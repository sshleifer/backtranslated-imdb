This is a good movie that is wrong in many ways with low production. Martha Coolidge herself said she only has $ 350,000 to do. This is a movie I loved growing up in the Midwest. I remember friends and a nostalgic trip to this movie 10 years ago. Great stuff about this movie .... Great cast with hungry actors and hungry director. Bad points in this movie .... To a small budget that calls for too much improvisation. If Martha Coolidge got more money and time for this movie, then the results would be even better. They should have had a story from a 20-year perspective and not a 15-17 year old high school. Most of the actors were in their early years until the mid-1920s trying to play for 15-17 years. The best scenes from this movie are set in the stupid Hollywood clubs of Nicolas Cage. I gave this movie a high rating of 9/10 for five reasons .. Nicholas Cage is improvisational at the point of playing; Camera work and angles are excellent for the budget they had and were able to have only one scene from each scene; Sytles, music and lingo are captured perfectly and forever; Again, the music is incredible and brings the story all over the scene; And finally ... Martha Coolidge could change the weak scenario, the unknown actors and the very low budget, and 20 days of filming the whole movie in such a good and memorable movie is overwhelming!
