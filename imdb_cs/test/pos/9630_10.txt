I really enjoyed the Patriot. This film had less violence and was based on a real life threat that could inevitably destroy our civilization. One line in a movie from Wesley McLaren (Seagal) stuck in my mind to be very true to our company, "Western medicine is in practice prolonging the disease and I'm in business to heal it." <br /> <br />
