I saw this movie today. When I came in, I thought it would be good because I love Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon is also a great actress, but it was a better way than I could imagine. You look great in the movie. The meeting was excellent, which has been difficult recently. Natalie Portman is for great stuff and I'm a NYU college student, I think it's great to go to school instead of being an actor. Anyway, back on the subject, the film keeps you interested all the way through and I think everyone should go see it. I would give more details, but I don't want to give up the movie.
