Maybe I read too much of it, but I wonder how much Hongsheng was in the movie. I mean, when a story is told that throws away the main character as myself, I think it would be a hard hand in writing, documenting, and so on. But. .. this family and friends may also have had a hand in getting real information about Hongsheng's life. I think the best look would be portrayed from the perspective of the Hongsheng family and friends. They saw his metamorphosis, and they weren't so bewildered by the medication they remembered everything. As for Hongsheng's fulfillment of himself, the consistency of the performance of Jesus Christ makes him a martyr who sacrificed his life (metaphorically, of course, he is obviously still alive when he is cast as himself) for the happiness of his family. Huh? The viewer sees him at his lowest points while maintaining a superiority complex. He is lying on the grass that descends from (during?) High with himself and with his father, thinking about life and having a vision of dragons at his window, celebrating his freedom on the bike while stretching out his hands, his head tilted to himself. It's wonderful to be from drugs now, but he's not a hero. He went from top in his career in acting to his most vulnerable point while on drugs coming back somewhere in the middle. This same device is used in Ted Demme's "Blow" where the audience empathizes with the main character who is shown as a flawed hero. However, "Quitting" ("Zuotian") is a movie that is recommended, mainly for its haunted soundtrack, superb acting and landscapes. But the best part is the feeling that one gets, when what we assume is Jia Hongsheng's house is actually a set design for the game. This makes the viewer feel like Hongsheng's life was just a game told in many difficult parts.
