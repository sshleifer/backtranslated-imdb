Undoubtedly, the Blue Planet series is one of the biggest documentaries ever made at sea. For five years, filmmakers have worked tirelessly on the series, getting shots that have never been seen by anyone (ie, In Title, Deep.) <br /> <br /> I highly recommend watching this series. To see anglers fish off the small pictures listed in textbooks is really a treat, but only a needle in a huge haystack at sea that covers Blue Planet. From the open ocean to the tidal pools, the coral sea to the deepest darkest part of the ocean, the BBC takes the viewer to an almost magical journey through the ocean. I must admit that one of my oldest dreams in life was to be a marine biologist and after seeing this series, the dream was revived. For years, I have studied the oceans of this world and have seen countless documentaries about coral reefs and dolphins, whales and crustaceans. But in everything, nobody has managed to capture life under the waves quite the same as this group of people. Watch the 'Blue Planet' series in its entirety, I promise you won't regret it.
