What a tribute to his father! He set out on a journey to learn more about the man he knew little about, and I believe by the end of the journey that Nathaniel Kahn was happy with what he had learned and felt personally. The film is five years in its creation and a quarter of a century after his death, the absolute commitment of Louis I. Kahn in his work - a consistent strong desire to build buildings that are meaningful to mankind and timeless for the world, looking into his life proudly depicted by his son Nathaniel in "My Architect: Son's Journey". The film is by no means an anthology of Louis's work. There are lots of books and archived materials that have records of Louis Kahn's projects and buildings. This documentary acts as a mystery, writer-director and co-producer Nathaniel Kahn sought a man he knew briefly as his father. The film is in chapters. In "Heading West" we are at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. It's a view worthwhile - Kahn's integral concept of building and the environment, optimizing light for scientists at work is amazing. From a former colleague who worked with "Lou" 35 years ago, we hear about his careful attention to detail, as well as how "rambunctious" he could be - he certainly didn't say the words in his criticism. The memorable scene is when the camera pulled back and we saw Nathaniel skating around the Salk Institute Square - a small figure, like a kid playing happily in his father's hand. The "Immigrant" segment brought us to a meeting with Anne Tyng, an architect who worked with 'Lou' and also gave him a daughter, Alex. Now in the 1980s, Tyng's return with Nathaniel's film crew to Bath House in Trenton, New Jersey became nostalgic. In "Go to the Sea," we'll see the Barge for the American Wind Symphony Orchestra - all of steel and a meeting with Robert Boudreau, whom Nathaniel surprised when he finally told him he was Lou's son. Boudreau touched, said he had seen Nathaniel when he was six, with his mom (Harriet Pattison) and he didn't tell anyone that Lou had a son. It was a "choking" emotional moment of reunion. Like his father "Nomad", Nathaniel traveled to Jerusalem and learned about the synagogue project that his father had begun but did not realize. He attended the Wailing Wall, and when he saw his fairy-tale cease, his head felt that he might not be "completely" Jewish to be his father's son. We continue to sit with his two half-sisters in the "Family Affairs" segment. We also heard him talk to his mom in Maine and from the conversation with his father's former staff we learned how his father worked there and practically lived, slept on the carpet on the office floor, on weekends and everyone. "The End of the Road" brought us to Ahmedabad, India, to the Indian Institute of Management. Talk to architect B.V. Doshe was a revelation. Finally, Nathaniel found his living Louis Kahn, his father, his spirits living in him. This document is very tearful for me. Most of the time I had tears - it was very touching and I am in awe of the man, the architect and his son and the women in his life beside his famous works and buildings. Louis I. Kahn wanted to give his love to "the whole world", juggling work and three families (you can say he has three women in his life to keep his inspiration going). As Shamsul Wares, an architect in the Bangladesh capital city (completed 9 years after Lou 's death), he honestly remarked: Louis Kahn has given a lot of people to Bangladesh, spending time in Bangladesh, understanding the culture of place and people - as well as giving them democracy through what they he has achieved, and for such a devout man, usually people who are close to him and often miss them. The price of the great seems to come with inevitable personal sacrifices. This film reminds me of the 1949 "The Fountainhead" of King Vidor (a good dramatic story in B / W with the music of Max Steiner), based on Ayn Rand's novel, with Gary Cooper as an uncompromising architect who stands in place by his own ideals, and Patricia Neal as a parallel support woman in his life. <br /> <br />
