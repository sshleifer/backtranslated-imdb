Nothing better than an android that boasts 80's technology and a story that is nearing the age to take its thoughts from the depths of your mind forward and to the center to be captured by a beautifully nice cast. Growing up in the 1980s, it gave me an invaluable opportunity to see many "not entirely human" on many special occasions. Since my parents were never present at the sightseeing, I thought I'd probably enjoy it as much as I did. So perhaps this is a movie that kicks your VHS collection and gives your children a hand, it can be found on the same tape as "The gang of apple gangs" and an episode of "touring the service", that is, if you recorded the LP mode of course.
