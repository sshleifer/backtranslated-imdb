I just watched the DVD version of BORN BAD and found it tense, bold and at the end too graphic for a faint heart. Justin Walker (Clueless) and Corey Feldman enjoy top performances. For a low budget movie, this picture brings. The depth of the character and the clever dialogue are two things that are usually not seen in Roger Corman's image. Check out the DVD!
