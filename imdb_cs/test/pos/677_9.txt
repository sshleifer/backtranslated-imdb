When I first saw this movie, it was around 1956, and although I saw it again recently, I didn't think so. I think it was Robert Ryan's best film because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life (my father), though he never killed anyone but was hit more during World War II, which made him worse. Having humor just got him and getting through the day was so apt. (My mother and brother had to do it) When I saw Robert Ryan showing this type of person, it was a very good imitation of this type of person and I impressed him.
