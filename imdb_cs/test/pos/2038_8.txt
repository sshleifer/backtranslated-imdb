I am a fan of action movie, but to date I have never seen a preview or advertisement for this movie in Italy so I went to see "The Long Kiss Goodnight" on pay-tv hoping for nothing special. But what a surprise! This movie is great! The only problem I found is the presence of some holes in the plot, but the rest is the funniest, fun and funny action movie ever created. Transforming Samantha / Charly from an ordinary teacher It seems a good idea is a cold-blooded agent who is recovering from amnesia. Action scenes and stunts are the best I've ever seen. Samuel L. Jackson adds some of the best lines I've ever heard, and his chemistry with Geena Davis is good. And what about Geena? She is amazing, she plays the best action hero she has ever seen, and makes strong, compelling stunts and stunts. So I think this film has had poor performances at the box office and bad critics because most reviewers and some kind of public have a hard time with strong female leadership roles. 9/10.
