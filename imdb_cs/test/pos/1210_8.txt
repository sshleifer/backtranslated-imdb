This event has defined the era of wrestling fun, which I believe is not balanced today. The colorful characters - in their stereotypical attire - have brought a certain show magic that has been raped and overexposed since then. The match was a bit innocent then. The child could watch it without watching Jerry Springer's episode. Looking back (at the time I had 5), even though I loved both Warrior and Hogan, I think I enjoyed Warrior more because of its mysticism. Hogan was a branded hero who cast an impressive public image. Ultimate Warrior, on the other hand, has been a masked man of several words - an out-of-the-limelight hero for another audience. This rivalry was as exciting as a child because it duality in me duking for every warrior. I had room for both. Because in that long, heavy battle there was also bloodshed, bets were high - at least for me as a child. On a similar note, because of Hogan's defeat, it made him more human - I remember how sorry he was. All these emotions in the play of the juvenile soap opera were made by Wrestlemania VI. great time for this game.
