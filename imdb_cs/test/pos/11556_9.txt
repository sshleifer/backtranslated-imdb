Nobody would ever ask that director Leos Carax is a genius, but what we are interested in is: is he a crazy genius? So many people hated this movie! I am usually the first to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and flashy films (such as the horrible recent film L'Enfant and the pointless and offensive "Feux Rouges"). But strangely enough, I thought 'Pola X' was an amazing movie, made with great skill and passion by its craft master and featuring remarkable performances. The film carries melodrama to more extreme lengths than I believed I had ever seen on the screen before. But Carax is extreme, we know. The film also includes what I consider to be the extraordinary imagination of Trotsky or anarchists and wet dreams, a mysterious group of young men who train for machine-gun shooters in the bourgeoisie between playing Scott Walker's fascinating music in the band, having a session in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires in old steel barrels. Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in the castle (whose stepmother is Catherine Deneuve, and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath, by the way). Suddenly, however, he "completely snaps" when he discovers that his late father, a famous diplomat, begot an illegitimate daughter whom Deneuve effectively destroyed as an inconvenience. This is because the nurse suddenly appears as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild tousled hair, a blank face and little ability to speak French cohesively. Depardieu then transforms himself into a "first-class hero" on his left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, living in a miserable environment and extreme poverty while trying to win a huge heritage. He then initiates an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, who is shown in an explicit sex scene that has insulted many people, although I have no objection to how I think people are too hysterical about sex, especially in America, \ t where it will never happen. The intensity of acting and filming makes this improbable scenario as the experience of a strong, depressing, hyper-melodrama. The differences between Carax, who makes an extreme movie like this, and numerous extreme French movies that I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) is serious about trying to explore meaningful if he is It is a sad, extreme emotional state where a human being falls apart and turns against his background. Many would say that the extreme elements in this film were unreasonable, but I do not agree. I believe Carax was real and did not create a picture of exploitation at all. It is very difficult to justify a person who goes so far and who, for all I know, can be a complete madman, but I believe he deserves a defense for this remarkable film success.
