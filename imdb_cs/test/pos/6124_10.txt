Do you know the proverb "Curiosity has killed a cat"? I've heard so much about this movie, a magazine that named this one of the most shocking movies of all time, my 1001 movies you have to see before you die, my sister who saw it at the film festival, and I love the 70s on VH1. I had to see this movie since it was named the coarsest movie of all time, and well, after the show of this movie last night, I have to say that it really lived up to its name. My God, this movie was so special! I thought I really saw it with some of the worst movies and TV shows I've seen, some things I think it will always be like a shock. Well, Babs Johnson, aka Divine, was named the liveliest man alive and a jealous couple named Marbles compete for this title. They want to take the divine out and be named the worst couple alive by kidnapping women, raping them, impregnating them and selling their children to lesbian couples. But it seems that the divine and her family well ... I don't know, she seems to be holding the title by having sex with chickens, synthesizing her butt lip, eating dog feces, stuffed meat into skirts, incest, and it just gets grosser and grosser. Pink Flamingos is terribly acting, terribly doing, and well, just terrible. The reason I give it is because this movie? I always evaluate, so I just found out what the hell? Through the coarseness of this film, do you have to give John Waters some appreciation that the hell ever thought of this movie 35 years later? You guys are just ugly to cast and work on this movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
