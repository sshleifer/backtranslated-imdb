Many reviewers seem to prefer the original version of The Man Who Knew Too Much, which I couldn't see. The '56 version itself is a very well made film. Running Mid-to-Late 1950s Hitchcock movies (including "Rear Window", "Dial M for Murder", "Vertigo", and "Catch the Thief", as well as this movie) is one of my favorite seasons in his career . In the movie "Who knew too much," Jimmy Stewart plunges into her role as always. Doris Day is very trustworthy in the role of atypical blonde Hitchcock. I thought there was nothing false about her performance. Her character doesn't have to be written as strongly as the original, but she is definitely not limited to the passive role, "Yes, dear" on Jimmy Stewart's arm. the smart lines written for Hank (the son of the couple who later kidnapped) in the opening scene of the bus - it's bad, Christopher Olsen read them so hard. It's rare to see good performance from a child actor in the 1950s. Most of the other actors in this film were very competent, especially the killer (played by Reggie Nalder). Some little things that make this film undeniably Hitchcock's - using a non-English dialogue, especially French (something that Hitch has done on a much larger scale in "Catching a Thief"); using the premonition of Arabic music in a hotel when a murderer appears; Stewart and Day spoke in church and sang their words for the hymn tune; the scene of Albert Hall, specifically showing the musicians and accomplices of the killer following the tensions, as well as the cymbalist; And finally the killer is a weapon as it seems from behind the curtain. It moves so slowly and precisely that it had to be done mechanically (the Hitch effect used at the end of "Spellbound", too). <br /> <br /> All in all, a man who knew too much is a fun movie to watch. It is not as deep or heavily burdened with symbolism as any of his films ("Vertigo", "Aliens on the Train"), but still one of my top five Hitchcock masterpieces.
