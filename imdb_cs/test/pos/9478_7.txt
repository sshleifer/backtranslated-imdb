Early in the film, Cagney's Johnny Cave Character tells his snoopers in the Office of Scales and Measures that in the previous year, unscrupulous business owners cheated the American consumer out of more money than the aggregate national war debt! Then he goes out and tickets a particularly greasy green merchant for a short-selling bag of sugar that is four ounces off (oh, horror!) And one skinny chicken that his butcher's scale has rather generously claimed to be six pounds. , after which the fur - or in this case feathers - flies. Um, fly. When the politician's robe tries to derail an investigation into the perpetrator's practices, our hero becomes a lonely wolf who wages a war with housewives all over America. After all, four cents here and a quarter add up and before we know we have anarchy! The word of his insistence will soon reach the mayor's office as well as the governor, and Cagney will become a strong man. If it sounds stupid, it's not - dishonest retail practices are just a conspiracy tool (or, as Hitchcock, McGuffin would say) and unknown, it works every bit as much as any Treasury Agent or G-man anthology in which the fight is led to the dark fraudsters who act outside the interests of the common good of the earth. The production standards are definitely Grade-B, but it's Cagney, who makes this movie a pleasure that it is: it was his first film away from Warner Brothers after looking for court release from his disproportionate contract, and he seems to be cool and unbelievably enjoyed - the performance is intelligent and crackling with its unique energy and charisma certainty. The presence of Mae Clarke lends Warner's definitive feel to total production. Supporting players turn around in solid appearances and the story moves elegantly to a rocky introduction that seems to start with three or four reels in the story - but sit back and enjoy it for Cagney's presentation and engaging time capsule of the Depression era. .
