This is my favorite horror movie, close to the 2nd poltergeist. I saw 'One Dark Night' when he first appeared in a theater in 1983 in a theater where I worked. I was born in 1963, so I have a certain love for the 80's horror movies, despite being a little dated and the dialogue not well written. What I thought was so original was that the phenomenon of "psychic vampirism" was not solved (at least according to my knowledge at the time) and it is a very real phenomenon. I didn't do it If Adam West is in it (nothing against him, but his supportive role was unforgettable), she thought Meg Tilly was a good casting. Unfortunately, the little-known Donald Hutton (from "Brainstore" and "Invaders From Mars") as an ambiguous scientist who oversaw Ramar's ability studies, has been overlooked. As a homosexual, I paid more attention to David Mason Daniels, the unfortunate friend of Meg Tilly. Now selling real estate in Texas. I felt the film "realistically" in two ways: Raymar, who had murdered 6 girls in his surrealist apartment, had a funeral that was rarely seen in attendance, reflecting the fact that not only was the mysterious, hermit but murderer. As you know, these types are buried without fanfare. Second, if the corpses were to be telekinetically mobile, their feet hovered and dragged. The filmmakers could go on a schlock walk, moan, hand-drawn zombies, but decided on what would be believable. Glory! The buzzing electric discharge from Ramar's eyes on his "throne coffin" (as he oversees his kingdom of the dead) cast a terrifying purple light into the mausoleum that will stay with you for years! If you ever went to the mausoleum, even on a sunny day, you will notice that they have their own rosette lights caused by stained glass. Don't get me to keep quiet. Even Ramar himself looked like someone who could walk like an eccentric, perverted old man. The score was one-of-a-kind and unforgettable, and I was digging myself for not getting it on the tape when it first came out. Shooting the tracks was done where it was supposed to be. I especially liked the carefully planned characteristics of each dead body: the bride, the poorly sprawled child who still held the teddy bear, the grandmother, the tall slender black and half of your World War II veteran, and the green-slender eyes. an older gentleman who first welcomed the initiators of the "sisters". I suppose even corpses can be good actors. The only thing I had to groan was the arm that came out of one of the vaults and choked Julie's friend, who couldn't be done if there was no corpse on him. It looked a little fresh, too. The movie begins with a scary, never seen Ramar face with us (until the last quarter of the movie, which is like unpacking a birthday gift) as he is picking up a teenage girl girl in a psychic flash of her daughter. Then we see the coroners taking his body in his one-bedroom apartment, where we see him experimenting with his telekinetic craft by gradually washing the dishes in the wall. The rest goes when the Heathers-like "Sisters" lead Julie to the last initiation by spending the night inside the mausoleum, but it is a well-placed building to a relaxing horror. The film is not bloody in any sense. The most extensive part is when Ramar's daughter uses a compact mirror that gives him back the energy and then melts. I always felt that the power Ramar could never die would be interesting to watch. I see it now: One Dark Night II: Turning in the Grave. Let's face it - The film stands alone. I heard that the film has different titles, but it will be original. Remake would be useless. However, if there were one, I would write a better dialogue and prolong some of the scenes, for example, a study of Ramar's capabilities in the lab instead of hearing them on a tape recorder. At this information age, something like this would be well documented on DVD. And more corpses! Why just lift those in the mausoleum when Ramar's power could spread to the cemetery? Let's say I hate being one of the people who had to clear the clutter at the end of the climax; something that can also be displayed. I think one of the initiating nurses will recognize one of the corpses as a relative who would add some good if it interfered. With CG effects, some amazing scenes with Ramar animation cremated remains would be off the wall! <br /> <br /> Tell me what to do, 'One Dark Night', but it has it all. At least once in your life ... or death!
