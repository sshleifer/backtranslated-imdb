This is a funny movie and I love it very much. Cary Elwes plays Robin Hood on the tee. This is, of course, the usual good against evil with Robin against the evil sheriff of Nottingham. Humor is in your face something for the most part, but it still works well. Night comedy, if you don't want to think too much, it's worth renting!
