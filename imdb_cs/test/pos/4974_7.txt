Violent men are good west. Perhaps this story is not the original owner of a large ranch trying to drive small competitors out of the valley it needs for its growing cattle, but the film has many components that increase its level and are worth seeing. The cast is the highlight. There is a reliable Glenn Ford (John Parrish) as a former army officer and now one of the small ranches who are trying to stay out of trouble until he's pushed hard. Edward Robinson (Lew Wilkinson) is as good as ever when a crippled big man and Barbara Stanwyck (Martha) play her treacherous wife in one of her usual roles for a woman to deal with easily (others in "Double Indemnity" and "Blowing") Wild "). Brian Keith (Cole) does it perfectly like Robinson's shooter's brother, an ambitious man trying to take his brother to a big ranch no matter what. Wade Mattlock, a 50-year-old villain, is there and ends as usual (no surprise). Dianne Foster (Judith Wilkinson) plays Robinin's daughter, who does not endorse the way they treat their neighbors with their father, mother and uncle. Rudolph Mate delivers a standard but acceptable direction that could be helped by beautiful and wide open scenery and great and appropriate music also helps. The inevitable final showdown between Ford and Keith is one of the best in Western movies. filming with his Traight Arms and heading to his goal in a military manner) to settle their differences then and once and for all. This is certainly one of Glenn Ford's best western performances, the second only to the classic "3: 10 on Yuma," he wrote two years later. It's probably a cast that puts the film as "A" speed, and, like me, enters the top ten genres.
