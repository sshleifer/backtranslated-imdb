My wife is a mental health therapist and we've been watching her from start to finish. I am a typical person and I cannot stand a young one, but this film is incredible. If you want to see what it's like for someone who is going through this type of fighting, it's a movie for you. When I watched him, I felt sorry for him and others like him. *** Spoiler *** Plus the fact that all the individuals in the movie, including people in the psychiatric hospital, were real people in real life, made it more real. Must see someone in the mental health profession!
