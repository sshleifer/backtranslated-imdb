Many people remember the Waco opinion that happened long ago. What most people have taken root in their minds is David Koresh's "cult leader" and images of this compound that burn on the ground after a long distance. Many people believe that Koresh was a madman who thought he was God. He was accused of being harassed by a child and credited for the disintegration and death of his followers. In addition, many people feel the cult mass suicide committed when the FBI attacked Mount Carmel Center and burned. Most people feel that the cult was to blame for not agreeing to the FBI on reasonable terms. Most people feel that the cult was brainwashed by Koresh's brain and followed everything he said. Nothing could be farther away from the truth, because the strong evidence after the nightmare ended, and this documentary proves that it is one of the best! <br /> <br /> This document is one of the most balanced tests in the situation. It is much more thorough and detailed than most people have received in mainstream media. To the shock of many people, this documentary reveals that it was ATF, the FBI and the higher levels of the United States government that were unfair, cruel and deceptive, not David Koresh and his followers. What Korsh and Davidians did was only to protect their constitutional rights, and higher powers completely violated and raped these rights. AFT had no reason for a compound storm; it was AFT who was firing first and firing helicopters from above on unarmed men, women and children! Even more shocking is the FBI's activity when they entered Mount Carmel. Watch it yourself and develop and look at the US government. There's infrared shots that clearly show that the FBI shoots with machine guns in men, women, and children in a burning mixture. This will make your blood cook. It will be really angry. This will interest you in what kind of people run this country. In the end, you will be interested in what you are told in the news every night is the truth and nothing but the truth. This video is scary and I highly recommend it if you find it. This document does not need to be purchased; can watch it for free on Google Video!
