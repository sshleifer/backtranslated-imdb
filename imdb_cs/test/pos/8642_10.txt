The history of the Mulholland Dr. case is known: What should be another excursion (after Twin Peaks) to the rival field of the TV series has ended abruptly after the pilot's completion. It was too risky and twisted to make investments for the manufacturers. Lynch used all the film and editing material and started new firing to complete a brand new feature film. Outcome: One of the most impressive cinematic experiences of this decade, one of David Lynch's best works. His earlier films "Eraserhead", "Blue Velvet" or "Wild at Heart" remained reserved in an irritable way that sent the viewer into the role of voyeur, but never interested him as part of the storyline like here. /> Mulholland Dr. there is a riddle missing pieces, others are obviously taken from "Eraserhead" and "Lost Highway", but it never seemed to be an unfinished work. I have come across a lot of instructions and essays on the internet that explain this film. I'm aware of losing magic when you try to decipher it completely. All these detailed explanations of the solution are not only waste, but also a controversial attempt to offer an answer where such a thing is not required. Imagine this scenario: A young child discusses his teddy bear to find out where the secret and its specifics lie. Is it because he wants to destroy his toy? Is mystery lying in a teddy bear or, in fact, in the heart of a child? Moving to "Mulholland Dr." means that innocence is one of the most important conditions to monitor and appreciate it. David Lynch succeeds not only in imagining the surface of human life, but also struggling with everything under him. Human desires, dreams, obsessions, and fears - all that remains unspoken; emotions that are often suppressed.

Actresses and actors who are ready to follow the director's vision of selfless.Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts, Justin Theroux solves her task in such an impressive way that you do not wish or imagine another cast. While they appear to be somewhat overlapped at the beginning, you'll soon find that this stereo writing is set with the intention of manipulating the viewer and confusing it when the red thread of the film is visible. <br /> <br /> When you declare the criterion of a well-made movie so you can get lost and immerse yourself in what you see on the screen before Lynch succeeded in creating a masterpiece. A modern masterpiece that shows David Lynch as one of the most important, creative and brave directors of the day. Like any filmmaker who crosses borders, he is confronted with criticism and ignorance. This will disappear once you find the individual key to Lynch's film. "Mulholland Dr." is more than just a sleeper? This is to be seen for anyone who loves an ambitious cinema. And besides, the film is a paycheck with Hollywood, in the form and content that in this difference was barely dared before.
