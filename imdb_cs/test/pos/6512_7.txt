I don't understand why this film has such a low rating. It deserves more! Sure, it's totally ridiculous, but it should have been. Do not expect film transcendence from a film about competing beauty contestants who are stranded on a Caribbean island! What you should expect is a huge spoof of almost all relevant science fiction, fantasy and block-buster movies in film history, and even links to other spoofers. Everything is totally exaggerated and sometimes completely unnecessary, but that's exactly what this movie stands out for. If you like the parody, and enjoy telling Leslie Nielsen or Mike Myers, you'll love this. Definitely yes!
