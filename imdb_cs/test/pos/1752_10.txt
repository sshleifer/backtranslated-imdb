"Mr. Bug Goes to Town" was the last major achievement created by Fleischer Studios. The quality of the Superman series produced at the same time is also evident in this extraordinary film. Music and lyrics by Frank Loesser and Hoagy Carmichael (with the help of veteran Flieshcer Sammy Timberg are pretty good, but not the same as scoring Leigh Harline, who also scored on Snow White for Disney, is "atmospheric music" A few years ago, it's time for Fleischer's artists to outperform themselves, the techincolored beauty of the film can't be denied, and while Hoppity is a star star, Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito steal the picture. Mercer (from Popeye fame) is invaluable, Kenny Gardner (brother-in-law) Guy Lombardo ... and his band's vocalist ... doing his usual nice job as Dick Dickinsen. Fleischer Studios was an expert in animation par excellence, which clearly shows the finished product, the film is melodic, a story great for all ages and final scenes of mistakes arguing about their lives on a growing skyscraper are some of the best productions and animations of past and present animated films. Don't miss this wonderful hand drawn movie. Also, be sure to appreciate the sequence of titles with the most sophisticated example of the remarkable 3-D sterioptical process of Max Fleischer, which took four months to construct and use 16,000 small glass panes in Manhattan's "electrified" buildings. Don't miss Mr. Bug goes to town ... aka Hoppity goes to town. I bet you'll be careful about the results!
