I found that episodes are fascinating and well written. As a TV show, it was fun to expect from fictional entertainment. I like the "relationship" between a professor and his female security guard ... though sometimes her Scottish accent makes it a little difficult to understand what she says. I was hoping there would be more than four episodes. I admit that one commentator / reviewer of this series had comments regarding his opinion as a doctor. I understand the gentleman's comment; however, this is a fictional television series that is meant to amuse ... not to present accurate facts as a documentary. Patrick Stewart performs well and his character is believable. If you want to watch a documentary, then it's not a series for you. But if you want to watch unique science-based theories in an entertainment-based environment, then you'll enjoy four episodes.
