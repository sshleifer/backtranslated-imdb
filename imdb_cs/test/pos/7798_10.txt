It is difficult for me to believe that this film has such a low rating. This is probably one of the best comedies ever made, and certainly the best Bollywood comedy 90s. The film did not do much at the box office and people saw diametrically opposite reactions. My guess is that most people didn't expect it to be a total comedy and they expected a regular movie. If you love comedy, you need to see it. Aamir Khan is excellent.
