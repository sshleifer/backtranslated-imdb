This is my favorite Columbo. Martin Landau (excellent!) He plays twins, one of whom can commit murder. This Columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you any clue to it! Peter Falk is in shape as usual in this episode written by Steven Bochco (who also wrote 'Murder by Book', my second favorite episode). Especially Julie Newmar (very undervalued) and Jeanette Nolan as the goalkeeper of the house, who are still upsetting Columbo, are particularly supportive. The surname of Martin Landau's characters in this is 'Paris'. This was the surname of Leonard Nimoy's character in Mission Impossible. Chance? Or joke Steven Bochco?
