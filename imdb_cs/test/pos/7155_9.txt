In this fairy tale of a tightly wounded Christian family who has three of its four "rebirths" after a cake accident, what really stands out is how most of them are based on where there are so many opportunities to go up , and how he really inspired most acting. Where most film moments, especially his sincere and "innocent" discussion of sexuality after three out of four family members, are removed from their guilt and shame, they are cheerful, it is also a provocative idea and the characters stay with you. How often, for example, does a comedy character turn from a nearby cartoon to a full-fledged emotional being during one scene? How often do we see a cast that can bounce off showboating in the middle of a sentence to show a little humanity under the skin of a character? Even many of the "bad guys" in this movie have moments of heartfelt sincerity, though much of what they do can be absolutely ridiculous and frightening. There is truth and history even the most controversial acts in this film, which is a difficult task in satire. How refreshing you can see a dark comedy that can dare to be humanistic. How nice it is to see an actor so fully devoted to the character that they can dare to be ridiculous and noble. And as a homosexual I don't think I've ever been so affected by a heterosexual. Sex scene as I was at the first sex meeting of this family's parents after their accident. <br /> <br /> Bravo. Bravo. One of my favorite outfests this year.
