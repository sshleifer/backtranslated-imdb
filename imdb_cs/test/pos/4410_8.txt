I was pleased to see this gem of the movie available on DVD. Despite being a "TV movie" and filming at 16 mm, he provided a wonderful view of the different types of people who wanted to become a "London taxi driver", along with their interests and family commitments. Even the unfortunate candidates, Titanic with his non-communicative wife, were able to see how Jack Rosenthal was able to create a fun and sometimes tragic excerpt from London's life in a fun 90 minutes. Originally premiered as a vehicle for Mick Ford, which means that the quality of the ensemble cast including Michael Elphic, Nigel Hawthorn, Jonathan Lynn, Lesley Joseph and Maureen Lipman (Mrs. Rosenthal) meant Mick could have top billing. but he had to work hard with such competing talents. Even 15 years after its release in 1991 it is as fresh as ever!
