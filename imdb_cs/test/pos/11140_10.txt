I'm impressed by actress Bobbie Phillips and her outstanding skill as an action star! This movie is powered by her wonderful acting and amazing bravery action. I am a science fiction fan, but I have to say that this movie outperforms most of the sci-fi films in its cinematography, and most importantly, it is the use of an actress whose presence replaces a plot that is fine but nothing new. Although this film seems to have been made for television, in my opinion it is better than most of the theatrical films of this kind.
