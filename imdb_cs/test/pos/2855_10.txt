Renee Zellweger is Betty, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse who is infatuated with a soap opera actor (Greg Kinnear), and who is married to Del, a cheating, stupid male chauvinist trying to sell some stolen drugs. Unfortunately for him, he gets brutally, blood-murdered instead, while Betty secretly watches. She leaves her and believes that Kinnear is really a character she plays, Dr. David Ravell, and that is his RN ex-fiancee. She leads to LA to find lost love, not knowing that stolen drugs are in her suitcase. Watching her are Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock respectively), hit men who inadvertently killed Del before they found out where drugs were hidden. They watch it all over the country, while Charlie gradually falls in love with his image. And in LA, things become completely bizarre, because nobody realizes that Betty is deceptive. Alternatively funny and touching, this movie is almost perfect. Stop reading comments and go look.
