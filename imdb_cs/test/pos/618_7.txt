The first half of the movie scared me and normally I'm not scared, but the other half of this thriller didn't work quite well, but still very scary! A good thriller than using simple ways to make good horror. Lowbudget, based in Russia, unknown cast, and made in Europe. but still a lot of fun, and yes, there's a few laughs that fit well for good things!
