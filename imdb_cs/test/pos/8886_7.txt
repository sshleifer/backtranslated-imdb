Inspired by Hitchcock's STRANGERS ON THE TRAIN concept of two men exchanging murder in exchange for getting rid of two people who take up their lives, MOMMA Z VLAKU is an original and very creative comedy. It was a credit for Danny DeVit, who wrote and played in this tiny comedy gem. ANNE RAMSEY is a mother who inspires the title of the film and is understandable why she gets her sharp tongue under DANNY DeVITO's skin and relentlessly put it on any minor offenses. BILLY CRYSTAL is a writer whose wife has stolen his book idea and is now lionized as a great new author, even appearing on the Oprah show to say she should be looking forward. So DeVito gets an idea of ​​the murder exchange to get rid of these unpleasant factors. Of course, everything and anything can happen when writer Carl Reiner lets his imagination roam with endless ideas as the plot unfolds. And it's fun all the way, providing plenty of laughter and laughter along the way as well as a lot of tension. <br /> <br /> For the devoted black comedy, this is sure to please.
