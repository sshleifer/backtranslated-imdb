I watched this brief moment on the Sundance Film Festival website and I must say that it is absolutely stunning. I expected it to be fun - just like all Sundance shorts - but I wasn't ready for such a deep sadness as well as a sense of passion and beauty. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen any of this year's festival entrances, I suggest you go to the site and watch these mini-masterpieces - I've seen them all and I can honestly say: Youth in us is the one that mine heart touched the most. I am not the weakest member of the audience when it comes to romance in movies, but my eyes have flooded so much that I am surprised to see the screen. <br /> <br /> I agree with 'addicted2you', it's really the masterpieces of the director and the cinematography just breathes. I can't think of a better way to spend 12 minutes.
