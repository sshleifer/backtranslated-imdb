"Everything Is Illuminated" is a simplified interpretation of something more than half of Jonathan Safran's Foer novel. This version is more about changes in Eastern Europe since World War II through the post-Cold War and how the younger generation relates to this history as family memory. The director / adapter debut Liev Schreiber preserves some of the novel's humor and linguistic clashes, mostly through the gorgeous Eugene Hutz as an American-chirped Ukrainian guide. He is so appealing that the film becomes his odyssey in his country and his family because he goes from his comfortable environment in sophisticated Odessa to the heart of a cynical, isolated country that has been devastated by conquerors through communists and now capitalists. , both with Jews and non-Jews as detritus. His funny opening scenes are when he bases his cheeky bravures, later we feel his water from the water in his own country as he tries to give instructions to local yokels. Shreiber uses Elijah Wood, as an American tourist, as a tense wheel in a visual review because his character is less verbal than one of the storytellers in the book. He and Hutz play well until the end, which in this simplified plot becomes sentimental. As soon as he takes the story of his grandfather in the last quarter of the film, stunningly and unpredictably ordered by Boris Leskin, the younger generation will probably not undergo any catharsis because it will only clean the cap. Schreiber does a great job of visualizing the human urge to document history. One of his credit consultants is Professor Yaffa Eliach, and her memories of life before the Holocaust through artifacts have clearly inspired appearance and are very powerful and effective. The Czech Republic is worth Ukraine and manufacturing workers have been able to find unforgettable symbols of change in cities, towns and rural areas, as it is now mainly a road movie, and long driving scenes are moving a little. Schreiber retains some of the symbolism of the book, especially the moon and the river, but when the cut-out parts of the book explain them, they just look nice or ominous for the atmosphere and no longer represent time and fate. <br /> <br /> Like W.C. The field would have predicted, the dog had stolen most of its scenes for laughter. In general, Schreiber is more honest than a book. It is irresistibly touching, especially for those who have not read the book, but less morally and emotionally chaotic. The film is immensely elevated with its amazing soundtrack, which ranges from songs and instrumentals from Hutz's Gypsy. band to traditional melodies to contemporary songs to Paul Cantelon klezmer fusion score. It is not a film about the Holocaust as a picture that is a mirror image of the "Train of Life" as a memory of time, which is now loaded with meaning but resonates more with those who have an emotional connection with this history.
