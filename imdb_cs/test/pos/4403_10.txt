The Coen brothers have really overcome this wonderful saga of the three convicts who have been deported. Although it is based on "Odyssey", the ancient work of Homer, you do not have to read "Odyssey" to be able to follow the story. Coen brothers fought celluloid and auditory tapestries! The soundtrack is inherent to the film, it's as if the soundtrack was a product and the film is wrapping paper. Each character is beautifully exploited and harkens back to the old days when the films were rich in actors whose appearance in the film adds wealth, structure and authenticity. George Clooney is spectacular as the fat hair of Everett Ulysses McGill, an honest con on escape, whose pompous linguistics and vocabulary are comic and cute. Brother, where Art Thou is so far the best Coen movie, as well as Clooney's best efforts. Clooney is good enough to guarantee the best actor nomination, just as Tim Blake Nelson is a friend of Delmar, while the film deserves the best film nod.
