This was essentially a remake of "Diagnosis of Murder" minus Victoria Rowell, Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter. Dick plays a college professor who teaches criminology 101 and can't even find his own class. Barry is now a private eye unrelated to Dick. This allows Barry to shoot at guys accelerating from him, which a cop can't do. Barry still gets the girl at the end. Tracey Needham displays a girl. He's the chief suspect, and Dick and Barry believe he's innocent and done it. That's all a spoiler. The end is unexpected enough that you no longer know him in the middle of the movie. <br /> <br /> Don't take it seriously. Don't criticize it. Just sit down and enjoy Dick and Barry Van Dyke.
