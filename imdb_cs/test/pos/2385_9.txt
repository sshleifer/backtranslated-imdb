I'm a talent manager. I'm 15 years old. I discovered amazing talent. They were in Movies, Commericals, Braodway and Television. In my opinion, Eddie Monroe was a beautiful cast. I like to see the ability of real people. It's not just a name. The actors in this film were very natural and believable. This movie really enjoyed me. I like a movie with a few twists. I also like when the puzzle is resolved at the end of the movie. I'd like to know what happened to the big money. (When you see the movie, you'll understand what I'm saying.) Mobsters look really ???? I'd like to see this movie on the Big Screen. The shots were shot really well. The New York scenery was New York I know. They have Happy 2006 and can make this movie to awards.
