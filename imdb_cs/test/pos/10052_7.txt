Dashing Errol Flynn brings his usual drama atmosphere in this historically faulty but entertaining movie of George Armstrong Custer's life. Amazing, jovial Flynn essays by Custer from his days at West Point as a reckless, stubborn cadet, through Civil War years in an extremely generous and welcoming interpretation of history, and finally as a nonpareil Indian fighter whose mistake on Little Big Horn is. excused as a victim by Custer of his command as a way to uncover corruption of government officials and postal traders, as well as a protest against the unfair treatment of Plains Indians. Olivia de Havilland, co-founder of Flynn in several other films, is a self-sacrificing, adoring Libby Bacon and Anthony Quinn looking like a wild boss of Sioux Crazy Horse. The movie battle scenes are excellent. Civil War battles are brief and are shown as a few vignettes in which Custer, seemingly supported by a handful of soldiers, beats the Confederate army into submission. Custer's latest fight against the Indians is a spectacular spectacle, a fierce clash between red men and white, without a quarter, given by the wild mix of military forces among the designated fighters. Big Direction, Cinematography, Casting and Max Steiner's wonderful music make this movie a Hollywood classic.
