This movie is an amazing remake of the original with the same name. The film was fine, despite the fact that I hate new! The whole cast was amazing. Has a great cast and amazing land !! The main plot is a man who is poisoned and has to solve his own murder neatly? Dennis Quaid is a man who is "DOA" (in other words Dead On Arrival). now he's a suspect! Dennis's character has a few hours to find out who poisoned him. The movie is quite fast and full of action. You can see two other big stars in Meg Ryan (Courage Under Fire) and Daniel Stern (Home Alone, Very Bad Things, Bushwhacked) in supporting roles in this cool, cool remake of classic movie !!
