The young couple - Father Ben (solid Charles Bateman), wife of Nicky (lovely Ahna Capri) and their daughter KT (cute Geri Reischl from the fame "I Dismember Mama") - are trapped in a small California desert town. hysterical lunatics. Worse still, there's a terrible Satanic cult that kidnaps young children for their devilish purposes. Director Bernard McEveety, who works from the unusual and inspired screenplay of William Welch and L.Q. Jones ("Devil Times Five" director Sean MacGregor came up with a bizarre story), relates a convincingly strange plot in a slow but steady pace and ably creates a spooky, nervous, mysterious atmosphere of ooga-booga. Strother Martin delivers a wonderfully vicious and robust performance like Doc Duncan, who is joyfully a sinister leader of the evil sect. The top cast of outstanding character actors qualifies as a substantial asset: Jones as a grumpy, not-absurd Sheriff Hillsboro, Alvy Moore as a friendly local Toby, and Charles Robinson as a clever, wildly devoted priest Jack. The clear, polished widescreen movie of John Arthur Morrill, Jamie Mendoza-Nava's haunted score, and the fierce, exciting climactic black mass ritual are equally up to speed. The idea of ​​having a murderous life toy is simply brilliant (the introductory scene with a toy tank coming real and crushing the family in the car is really shaken). Nice mysterious ambiguous end. Pleasantly eccentric and underrated winner.
