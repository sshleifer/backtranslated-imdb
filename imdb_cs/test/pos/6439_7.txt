The 1978 adaptation had all the components of a potentially beautiful movie. It is based on the absolutely enchanting book of Charles Kingsley. He has a really talented cast from people like James Mason, Bernard Cribbons and David Tomblinson, not to mention David Jason and Jon Pertwee's vocal talent. There is also Lionel Jeffries, a director of wonderful classics such as rail kids and amazing Mr. Blunden, and while the film is good from most parts, it was also a little disappointing. I had no problem with performances, especially with Mason and Tomblinson as Grimes and Sir John Harriet, and Tommy Pender and Samantha Gates are believable as Tom and Ellie. The voice cast is also commendable, especially Jon Pertwee, expressing charming characters in their own right. I also liked random music that is so scary and beautiful, and the script was pretty faithful and generally well written, especially at the beginning. Characters, especially water kids, are very charming, and the bad guys are both sinister and witty. funny. However, I will say that the film looks dated, especially animation sequences, the live action parts were not so bad if you forgive a somewhat dark camera. The character animation was rather flat and the background sometimes was a bit boring, though there were some nice moments like the scene with the Cracker and of course the first meeting with Water Kids. I also had mixed feelings about songs, Water Babies was beautiful, but I forgot the first song when Tom ended up underwater. Hi-Cockallorum is an example of a song that is like marmit, either you love it or you hate it. I personally don't know what to do with this song, it was fun to listen to initially, but as soon as it's in your head, it may be annoying. Like me and Lionel Jeffries and his films, his direction lacked the miracle and magic he usually does. All in all, it's definitely not a horrible movie, but it could have been more artistic.
