BROADCAST NEWS opens a series of short medallions that are a clever way to start a story about TV anchors who have no idea what they're talking about. Speaking to the group, most reporters, all of whom are bored with her presentation, would be leaving. When the last performer, the co-owner of the action will say HOLLY HUNTER quietly: "I don't think there will be any Q&A." A subtle line in a brilliantly written low key comedy, a farce about the aspect of show show TV anchor. WILLIAM HURT is a clumsy novelty that works with HOLLY HUNTER as a network anchor. Hurt badly needs help in corrective reports and Holly refuses to take the bait - initially. He knows he's only able to look good, but he's not a reporter. It turns out to be a quick study while his handset is working and he gets all the direct information from executive producer Hunter. Holly's other friend (ALBERT BROOKS) is helping to feed the information he transmits. hurt. Of course, he gets into conflict with his feelings for reporter ace Brooks and equally strong appeal to handsome boyfriend Hurt, who has his own conspiracy with a nice employee. <br /> <br /> You have to wait up to twenty minutes Before the movie ends, he finds out which man he'll end up with. Brooks tells her that Hurt is bad because he represents everything he is against. In this unpredictable comedy, he won't tell who Hunter (the neurotic heroine) will end up. HOLLY HUNTER, WILLIAM HURT and ALBERT BROOKS were nominated for Oscars (Brooks as a supporting role). as well as the film itself and the director / writer James L. Brooks. All in all, seven well-earned Oscar nominations. <br /> <br /> The script will not be chosen for a conventional happy ending - and in this case it's the only mistake for a great script. I felt cheated and somewhat in the end.
