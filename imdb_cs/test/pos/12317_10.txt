There are so many '10 Best 'lists that could easily fit the "The Dead" - Best Drunk On Screen, Best Literary Adaptation, Best Use of Music That Is Not Specially Written for Movie, Best Use of Poetry, Best Speech on Canvas, Best Ensemble Cast and finally, perhaps, the best movie ever made. This was John Huston's last and greatest film, adapted by his son Tony from James Joyce's short story and set on the evening of Epiphany in Dublin 1904. It is limited, largely, to one setting, home by Morkan Sisters, and not much to Becomes in conventional 'dramatic' terms. They enjoy their guests; There is singing, dancing, reciting and many small lectures, but you can't imagine watching this film anywhere else than you would rather than in this company. Finally, of course, it's 'much', much more. It's about love, loss and regret, the stable foundations of a great drama. In the final footage of the film, tenor Bartell D'Arcy (Frank Patterson) sings the song "Lass of Aughrim", which rises in Grett's mind (Anjelica Huston), wife of Gabriel, (Donal McCann), the spirit of her first and probably greatest love, a boy who he died in the certainty of a broken heart at the age of seventeen, and suddenly Gabriel realizes that he never knew his wife and that he was not the great love of his life, after all. Emotionally, these scenes are incredibly powerful, first, as Gretta tells the circumstances of her lover's death, and then, as the voice in Gabriel's head summarizes his own feelings. That's great cinema, monologues well delivered by Huston and McCann. But then all performances are extraordinary. This is a top-level file game, and although it would be unthinkable for one of the performers to appear over the other, the screen would give us a more sympathetic, brilliant or convincing drunk than Donal Donnelly, or would the poetry ever be delivered with such passion that Sean McClory, (male IRA in "The Quiet Man"), brought to read the reading of 'Donal Og' by Lady Gregory? Of course, the added poignity is to be aware that Huston himself was close to death when he made this film, which seems to me the culmination of his life. Death can be its central theme, but viewing this film is a life-giving experience.
