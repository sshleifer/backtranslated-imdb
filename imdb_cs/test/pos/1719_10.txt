I have some older videos and DVDs Who. I played them over and over again. I adore each of the "doctors" for various reasons. But because of the man in the BBC hierarchy, Who was canceled, though it was still one of the BBC's support lines-up. With the departure of Sylvilla McCoy, the doctor remained alive through the fans. The BBC kindly allowed fans to write books and cartoons. Dr. Whoa was still stable after 1989. Then she and Paul McGann decided. The film was defective, but gave the BBC an idea of ​​what we wanted. In 1999, the "man" was gone and newcomers at the BBC felt it was time to bring the doctor back. It was a total success. Here in America, the Sci-Fi channel took a chance and it became a total success as well, although the writers had to start again and explain Dr. Who mythology for new audiences. It's incredible that they did it. In Season 1, staring Christopher Ecclestone with Russell T. Davis as lead writer and Phil Collinson as producer, the doctor returned to us and in each episode learned more about who the doctor was. The Doctor Who Universe was always about "choice", "love" and "sacrifice". That's what they provided. It wants me more and I am sad that Mr. Eccleston decided to get out. My first doctor was a doctor no. 3, Dr. Jon Pertwee. Mr. Eccleston does not have to worry about his position in the universe. Who. It's as solid as the rest. He's the 9th doctor. I didn't know about Mr. Eccleston before his performance at Dr. Eccleston. Who, but now. I wish there was some way he could know that in the fan community We've already seen he's a great actor.
