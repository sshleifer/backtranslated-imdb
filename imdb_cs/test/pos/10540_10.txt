(This review contains a huge spoiler, but I don't know how to explain how cool it is without giving it away) I saw "Pinoccio's Revenge" a while ago. <br /> <br /> Now you can think of just bursting a children's game. There really are similarities. However, Chucky was an obsessive doll who works independently of a child. It is possible that Pinoccio is possessed by a demon or cursed or something. however, the puppet is actually completely inanimate. KID is crazy and KID is the one who kills people! Everyone, including viewers, survivors and the Boy himself, thinks he's a doll. But it's KID. Nudity is almost a shame, because otherwise I could tell everyone to see it because it's a really interesting horror movie.
