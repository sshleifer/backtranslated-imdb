LA ANTENA (Esteban Sapir - Argentina 2005). A unique look at the silent cinema in this fairy tale as the story of Esteban Sapir, beautifully shot in black and white and practically without dialogue, "La Antena" is a feast for the eye and a must for lovers of German expressionist film, mostly nod on the works of Fritz Lang and Friedrich Murnau. 'City without a voice', 'La Ciudad sin Voz' is ruled by Mr TV. He took the voices of the people and is in total control of all spoken words and images, forcing everyone to eat their own brand of TV food. Mr. TV is not just a monopoly, he is the embodiment of evil and totalitarianism, even the swastika appears several times as a symbol. He secretly works on a hypnotizing device that controls all citizens' brains through television. To this end, she is kidnapping the only one who stayed with The Voice, a beautiful singer, but the TV repairman witnesses the kidnapping and runs into the old TV antenna in the mountains to stop the evil manor plans. The production design is stunning with beautiful sets and paintings. Shot primarily by the basic language of silent cinema, Esteban Sapir also adds a number of his own techniques, such as a combination of typographic and animation techniques. Everyone talks to each other using text balloons (usually floating near the mouth), speaking louder, the larger the characters. The texts themselves may be extruded or crushed. In the opening sequence, we see a book called "La Antena" that opens and the paper city comes out of the pages. There are hardly any references to Argentina. It is a constant snowfall that gives the film a very un-Argeninian feel, while the surrealistic environment suggests some big city in the northern hemisphere, with just some of the songs revealing the Argentinian background movie. Tempo is fast and so much is happening on the screen, it's hard to follow the unreal story of the movie. Not only is it amazing to look at it, but we also have some reports on media monopolies, corruption and totalitarianism, but they are packed perfectly. One of the most original movies I've seen in years. Enjoyment. The film was screened as an introductory film at the IFF Rotterdam 2007. <br /> <br /> Obscura Camera 9/10
