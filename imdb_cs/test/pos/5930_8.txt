This year's Royal Rumble wasn't too bad, but last year was definitely better. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH- SHAWN MICHAELS VS. EDGE Although this match lasted a little longer, it was still fine. Edge wins after using a rope to pin Shawn Michaels. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SECOND MATCH- UNDERTAKER VS. HEIDENREICH IN CASKET MATCH Now I don't like the Casket matches, this match was boring and sloppy, but in the end it picked up the pace as the Undertaker nailed Tombstone, then rolled Heidenreich into a coffin for victory. 4/10 <br /> <br /> THIRD MATCH- JBL VS. KURT ANGLE VS. BIG EXHIBITION IN TRIPLE-THREAT MATCH FOR WOMEN'S CHAMPIONS WWE It's not a bad triple match. Too bad JBL will win his title again after nailing Clothesline From Hell on Angle for victory. 5/10 <br /> <br /> FOUR MATCH- RANDY ORTON VS. TRIPLE H FOR THE WORLD WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP A great match between the two men, the game was a bit sloppy, but it was still good and it got pretty good by the end. Although Orton lost the match, he was fast and great until the end. HHH Nails Orton's pedigree for victory to keep his World Title. 5/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH MATCH- ROYAL RUMBLE This was a super Royal Rumble {Every Royal Rumble is Good}. After entering all 30 men, the last four remaining superstars in Rumble were Price, Edge, Mysterio & Batista. Edge was able to spear Mysterio out, later Batista and Price clotheslined Edge together together. It was now up to Price and Batista. First after the reversal of the F-U, Batista went for a Batista bomb, but suddenly both men fell apart on the outside simultaneously. After a controversial decision and Mr. McMahon, who went into the ring to solve the matter. The match was restarted again as Batista and Price Fought It Out, but Batista got a better off Price, nailed spine-buster and threw Price Out to win the 2005 Royal Rumble and go to Wrestlemania 21 to face the Champion in the mainevent. 10/10 That was a very good Royal Rumble, but last year would always have heralded all the Royal Rumble in history. <br /> <br /> Overall: I'll give it 8/10 & B +
