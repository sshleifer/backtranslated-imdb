Another "oldie but goody" from about the same time as "Out of Towners" is "Cactus Flower", with a large cast: Goldie Hawn, in her first film appearance (pre-facelifts), Ingrid Bergmann in one of her later and still funny Walter Matthau. The story is about a dentist pretending to be married to have an apology for getting married to his girlfriend, leading to the need to come up with a fictitious wife for proof. She oversees her reception desk (Bergman) to take on the role, leading to numerous comic disasters and surprising romantic turns. It's in the same spirit as Doris Day / Rock Hunter. Fans of those - like me - will like this movie; if not, don't bother.
