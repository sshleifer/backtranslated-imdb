Later one night at Tom Snyder's "Tomorrow" show, I watched Tom ask his guest Henry Morgan what he thought was "perfect." Morgan replied, "Anything with Glenda Jackson." And although I would not consider this film perfect, it knows this concept very well. I wanted to use a clich√© about Hollywood to do it again, but then I saw "Up in the Air", another smart movie about 2 people over 35 who fall in love. But there are similarities. "House Calls" is just plain fun watching two professionals like Matthau and Jackson, and that's absolutely natural. I saw this movie in the theater in 1978 (at the age of 18) and it took me another 20 years to get all the jokes. Any movie that can break out of the sketchy tennis bill Bill Tilden of 1920 and British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain wouldn't play much in the megaplex these days. One other idea: the original theatrical release featured a 'walk on the beach / fall in love' montage set by the Beatles / George Harrison melody, "Something." It seemed a bit forced at that time, but the song has since been exchanged for the relatively generic music of Henry Mancini for more home video and cable releases. Too bad because the scene is lying right now, another sacrifice of music that grants hell.
