Anastasia: The Secret of Anna was a two-part star with the historical film T.V. based on Peter Kurth's book, Anastasia: Anna Anderson's Puzzle. It keeps historically to a great extent, the names are changing, etc. But it keeps the real story quite well. Omar Sharif and Claire Bloom behave very well as Russian royal families, Tsar Nicholas and Czarina Alexandra. Too short portraits of Rex Harrison and Olivia De Havilland appeared in my mind. All in all, it was a nice production with a fine acting performance. I was quite impressed with the production values ​​when it first aired on NBC at the end of 1986. Also played by great German actor Jan Niklas, who had previously played in another Russian NBC epic "Peter the Great". I felt that Part 2 skipped some important details of Anna Anderson's trip to America. It is also important to know that in 1986 less was known about Anna Anderson's story. It was not yet known whether her claim to be Grand Duchess Anastasia was genuine. More was known at the end of the 1990s and Anna Anderson is now considered a fraud. Too bad that networks do not make such films for television.
