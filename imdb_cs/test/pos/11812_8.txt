I really liked the movie, I thought it was very fun and dramatic. But I just had a question that music is a movie. I was unable to find any soundtrack (if there is one). More specifically, I was wondering if anyone can tell me the name of the song being played while the boys ride the river on their way to New Orleans? I thought it was something like "My Big Escape", but I was searching the Internet, books, almost everything I thought I'd try, and I just wouldn't find it anywhere. If someone helped, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
