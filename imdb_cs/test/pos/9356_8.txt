A man named Joseph Samuels is brutally murdered in the apartment. Samuels would seem to have been visited by a group of drunken soldiers the previous evening, and when one of them seemingly missing, the evidence would certainly cause the missing soldier. But as Detective Finlay plunges deeper into the case, he discovers that they might bark at the wrong tree and that this crime is dealing with something desperately sad and outrageous anti-Semitism. Crossfire was born by Richard Brooks, a novel by John Paxton and director of the cleverly excellent Edward Dmtryk; Thousands of filmmakers have been forced to ease the story from the original source, the novel is about homosexual hatred as opposed to anti-Semitism, which is mainly due to RKO's supremo Dore Schary and producer Adrian Scott, a kind of creepy unrest. Drops with Noirish Style. The cast features three Bob's, Young's, Mitch's's and Ryan's with Noir's Gloria Grahame, which adds an emotional female heart. Thousands of thirds of the invoiced, that is Robert Ryan's image, his portrayal of bullying, Montgomery's diving is a top-of-the-line move, and he shows off the talent he had in abundance. Ryan had a good reason to give Montgomery some of the best work for he served in the Marine with Richard Brooks himself, both men discussed the possibility that if the novel were to be made into film, then Ryan wanted and played Montgomery, the genesis of Ryan's career, how weasels were born. Gloria Grahame also puts in a wonderful and cordial turnaround that is all the more remarkable that she was troubled by her brute wife. Stanley Clements was known to be violent towards her and his constant presence around the ensemble irked others in the cast, but Grahame, probably directing real life emotions, became the character of Ginny and glowed very brightly. Bob Mitchum and Bob Young also come out with flying colors to make a real deal about what a cleverly functioning Crossfire picture really is. Tho Crossfire was released before the second anti-Semitic painting of 1947, the Gentleman's Agreement, and raking in over a million and a quarter dollar at the box office, some of his thunder was stolen by the Oscar winning picture from Fox Studio. Nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor {Ryan}, Best Supporting Actress {Grahame}, Best Director and Best Screenplay, won nothing but the critics of that time considered it a great change in American film and today stands at a high level. proud and dark as a brave and excellent piece of work. 8.5 / 10
