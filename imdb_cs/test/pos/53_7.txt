This movie was very good, not great but very good. It is based on the play of one man Ruben Santiago Hudson. It looks like a stunt casting on paper. Yes, let's round all the black people in Hollywood and put them in one movie. Halle Berry even made it. The only name I didn't see was Oprah, thank goodness because it would probably end up like Hallmark. Instead, this movie wasn't some sort of sentimental mess. It was moving, but not false, the characters came and went with the exception of her husband, Pauline and the relevant writer. The film revolved around the Nanny universe, Mrs. Bill Crosby, and how she raised the writer and took the people. Now that I was tired of the New Yorker when he said she married sick people and the old and then we see them go to a psychiatric hospital to pick up a man, I think she looks like a nurse with a cure. Getting Jobs and Checking Medicines / Caid Controls But not Lou Gosset explains that he only wants $ 25 a week and doesn't want the money ahead. I think that part was put into the movie just for us tired New Yorkers, so we know it's not poor for poor people. (G) It was written by the New Yorker, so he knows the deal (g). and looking through the eyes of a little boy I see why. She is married to ne'er doing well, which is 17 years younger and fools around her. Terrence Howard was born to play these types of parts. He was good, but I'd like to see him play something else. Markerson, who plays Nanny, is also very good. But for some reason, the person who stood up to me was a small role played by Jeffery Wright. Where is this man Oscar? He has already won Emmy and Tony. He was in the shaft and stole the movie. I didn't even know who was in this movie. He is a chameleon never the same. I've never seen him play a bad part. It was a 5 minute role and I laughed and cryed. I flipped the scene several times ... because I didn't know who it was. His wife Carman Ejogo was excellent. I saw her in roles before most miserable things. But here it is so good. I know people who act like her. Macy Gray, who had one of the larger parts, was also very good. I was very happy not to kill Nanny. I thought she was at the beginning of the goner movie. But she was able to go home and start her old care routine. There are such women in most of our lives. People with whom we could know or even live. Thank God I don't know how they do it all the time. I have a friend who has lost 2 kids and has gone through a lot of things, but whenever I feel selfish, I apologize for myself, I'll call her and always give me a good mood. This film is a tribute to all these people. I just wish they could tell us what happened to some of the characters like the one armed man, Paulines friend, played by one of my favorite actors on HBO The Wire, Omar, Rosie Perez and Richard Lesbian and Delroy Lindo. arm man, was fascinating in another small role.
