I agree with all the comments above. This exhibition was a pleasure to watch. Funny, funny, amazing acting and zany sets. It's always exciting to find a show that is cleverly written, assumes the audience has a brain and displays subtle humor. I would spend good, earned money to see it again on DVD. And if we ask a Smart Series that has never had a chance ... How about a DVD release of Maximum Bob (another well written, special duck show with a wonderful cast of characters.) And add to the list ... Ages or Frank's Place. There must be a way to release these programs from the vault and into the hands of dedicated fans and new audiences.
