Fulci ... Does this man bring one of the bloodiest and weirdest movies ever made? Answer: yes! The Cat in the Brain, also known as the Nightmare Concert, is Fulci's last masterpiece. Yes, no matter what some people say about it. There are few facts why this film is one of Fulci's best films. <br /> <br /> Fulci is making fun of this movie and movies. Lead in this film is nothing but Fulci himself, who plays ... a good horror dragon who thinks he's slowly spreading. It is filled with black humor, which, unlike most modern horror works, works here. Being a Fulci flick, you must know it's bloody. How much? Quite a lot. I've always loved gore in movies and I've never gotten it, but Cat in the Brain actually stopped my thirst for gore, and believe me it's hard to archive. Even Braindead didn't stop it. CITB is about gore. Almost every scene revolves around Fulci, who, after being hypnotized by the evil psychiatrists * khmmm *, sees all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to him or all he sees. Some of his scenes let him drop randomly, and instead see a spoiled corpse on the ground that spits out of it. Forget Beyond or Zombie 2, it's the bloodiest movie Fulci! Now I like how Fulci managed to apply all the comic parts in the gorefest movie. He's a great director. From time to time, there are some funny moments and lines, such as where Fulci says "making gore movies is something like a disease". The end is very good considering that Fulci (and most Italian horror masters) are known to end without meaning or many hole plots. If you're funny from Fulci, make sure you check it out. If you have a weak stomach, avoid it and repeat "It's just a movie" ps. some of the gore scenes in this movie: Chainsaw Cutting (Full), Torn Tongue, Torn Eyeballs, Worm Attacked Corps, Zombies, Decapitation, Boiling Water Face, Shower Sting (Head), Crevice, Many Body Parts and organs toasting aside, hammer broken faces ...
