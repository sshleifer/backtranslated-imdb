I learned something: you have to take this movie as a fun comedy if you don't want to be disappointed. The movie is nice because it's a great comedy. I think excessive humor hurt him: too many glorified Monica Bellucci appear in several scenes and not as good as they wanted to believe. It sounds unnatural, false: the best actress in this film is Sabrina Impacciatore, who speaks with a perfect Tuscan accent and shines with Massimo Ceccherini. Elio Germano is, in my opinion, very, very good: the most promising young Italian actor. Daniel Auteuil looks like Napoleon, but I have preferred other actors. So the rarest shows were the worst. Costumes and production design are all right: sure, American period videos are more accurate about these things because they have bigger budgets, but Italian ability rewards money shortages. Nice period comedy, in short, with first-class casting (except Bellucci and Auteuil).
