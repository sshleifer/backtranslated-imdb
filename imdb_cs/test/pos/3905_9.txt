I remember watching elizabeth montgomery when I was about 5 years old (if that's the case) and I still remember this movie (bits and pieces). It was a movie I remembered throughout my life because I was afraid of sooo. I think I remember his part and the house is still dark. the main part that was most interesting to me was Elizabeth, who went through the house dark, and then there was someone out there. At the time, I thought I was an old witch, but the memory of her is now so vague that I can't remember who it was, but it was someone who was definitely out of the box ... and that part is what frightened me the most. I really wish I saw this movie again. If someone knows how to get a copy, email me at valid908@yahoo.com
