[Minor spoilers follow] <br /> <br /> Steve Allen believed that the actual humor about serious events can be found by many people acceptable based on the formula: Tragedy + Time = Comedy. 1939 before the German attack on Poland was scarcely a fun season, and subsequent events, including Blitzkrieg (following the Sitzkrieg) which took Germany to the canal, resulted in a heroic evacuation at Dunkirk and gave the world an overwhelming spectacle of light French prostrating. his honor before the Nazi conqueror. Things About Romance, Comedy And The Great Fall Of Serious Drama? Yes. Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau, with an excellent cast and excellent cast, creates in the "Bon voyage" pastiche of events and scenes from history and fantasy that is extremely entertaining. Viviane Denvers is the best French actress because war clouds are coming down in Europe (which is an exaggerated clich√©, I apologize). Her veteran, who honors herself, with many matters on her merits, seems to have her inner motivation as "What's Good for Viviane's Good for ... Viviane" After the premiere of her latest movie, after which the Minister in incompetent administration Reynaud, Jean-Etienne Beaufort (Gerard Depardieu in an unusual role for him), signals his interest in her, goes home to a tedious meeting with a former lover who does not understand the word "no". another former beau, still shaken by Frederic (Gregory Derangere) to help deal with the mess in her apartment, Frederic is a novelist in anticipation. <br /> <br /> A comic accident that once again emphasizes almost as a public service message , the importance of windshield wiper work puts Frederic in jail on the most serious accusations. Fortunately, the Germans' escape from their static positions forces wholesale he removes the transfer of prisoners to the south of France, but our boy runs away, he does it privately and not as a state department. Panic and fear in France when the Germans headed for victory are well portrayed and a new twist enters the story. Who should meet Frederic, but a truly wonderful young scientific assistant, Camille (Virginia Ledoyen), who accompanies a compulsory scientist of a Jewish refugee, Professor Kopolski (Jean-Marc Stehle). Kopolski has several bottles of "heavy water" he needs to get to England. Of course, the Germans are not interested in this important component because you know what (this part is purely fiction - there was never any heavy water in France in 1940 - just Perrier). And Camille is so great, just as dedicated. <br /> <br /> What next? Peter Coyote as supposed French journalist Alex Winckler. Be inclined in terms of his name. He is indeed an officer in Abwehr (German Military Intelligence: spy). And he also slept Viviane (and wants to remember their affair). It seems that Kopolski is the only major male character who doesn't want to let go of the actress. Following is a series of adventures and disasters that are seamlessly integrated to create a very fast, dark and enjoyable movie. Partially a tribute and a little spoof to "Casablanca", it is a remarkably witty movie (except for heavy Nazi bits). Isabelle Adjani deserves credit for Best Picture I saw in years of adorable cute narcissist with a few if any redemption features. And Depardieu, disloyal to Reynauld and ready to jump on the ship and join the traitor to Petain, is convincing as a man whose enthusiasm for Viviane exceeds his dilute sense of duty to the Republic. As a human being in power at a critical moment in French history is Beaufort mundanely vile. Too many theaters don't show "Bon voyage", which should soon be available for purchase or rental. You see it! 9/10
