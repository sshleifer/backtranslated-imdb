I promised myself that if I ever sent a comment that was less than free, then it would feel different later, I would go back and report a change of heart. So far, it's the first time it has happened. <br /> <br /> I'm really starting to use Hack. Something has changed clearly. The stories seem to be much stronger. The plot may still be unreal, but the characters have developed much deeper that a surrealist plot can be forgiven. I attribute it to gentle action. <br /> <br /> Not every show can come from a default gateway winner. Some need time to speed up. I'm glad I followed this program and I really hope it lasts.
