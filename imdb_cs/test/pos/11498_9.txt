Joline (Heather Graham) sets off for her husband Carl (Luke Wilson), who has disappeared to clear his head about himself and his marriage. Joline, who is devoted to her marriage, begins her journey to find Carl, but on the way she finds out a lot about herself. On her way, she encounters a number of interesting characters who unknowingly help her find her way. <br /> <br /> In my eyes, this is a classic road movie that moves at the right pace (some viewers can also find it slow down). She keeps a funny note throughout the film, while Joline responds to the madness of the world around her with a warm, noticeable, sometimes sad smile. All actresses and actors give a wonderful performance and the music score is spotless. 9/10
