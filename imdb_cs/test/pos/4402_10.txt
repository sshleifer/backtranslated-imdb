He's not a fan of the Coen Brothers or George Clooney, everyone can see the skepticism of the theater. Once again, someone in Hollywood dares to create something else. This time they were these zealots (for the temporary lack of a better word) Coens, who did "their thing" to one of the great works of literary history. Who would have thought Homer meant that? I don't know where this movie will fit in historic books in Hollywood, but it will be in my and many other DVDs or VHS libraries. It's one of those movies you can watch over and over again. The story is brilliantly written. Clean and fun, with a few Gumpesque brushes with fame, great performances of Clooney, Turturro, Nelson, and a short but hilarious Holly Hunter. Since I was born in Mississippi and grew up in other parts of the South, I wish that we enjoyed it a little more. They even refer to the south soundtrack in the country. You are nothing better this weekend, check out this movie! <br /> <br />
