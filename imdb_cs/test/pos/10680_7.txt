When I saw that this movie was broadcast on late night television, I decided at first to do it. I'm glad I started watching. Yes, special effects are the same as Gerry Andersen's puppet show. Some actors / actresses are from his other productions, he apparently used the same composer later on, as the cheese soundtrack could only derive one of his productions, and the plot is as slow as a wet weekend. Get everything and you have a movie that shows interesting options. Is there a planet on the opposite side of the sun? Is it a duplicate country? Is everything about it, and if so, does it speak English the other way round? I love this old SF only when it's gerry's beautiful model cars, planes, buildings, and spacecraft. Some of them aren't as attracted as it seemed. Have you seen the European Space Center logo? Very reminiscent of today's euro logo. Pause your faith and spend a few hours watching this, you'll be glad you did it.
