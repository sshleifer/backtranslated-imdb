Sherlock Holmes and Basil Rathbone Watson (Nigel Bruce) has been hired by the British government to protect the Swiss scientist Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.). He has a bomb that the British want to win the war. Unfortunately evil Dr. Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) works with the Nazis and doesn't stop at anything to get to the doctor - and his invention. Moving Sherlock Holmes into the 1940s sounded like a stupid idea, but it works for one reason - Basil Rathbone. Probably the best Sherlock Holmes ever on screen. He plays the character so well (and accurately) that it doesn't matter what kind of crimes he deals with. As for Nigel Bruce as Watson ... everyone has problems with it. He plays Watson as a dull old fool ... that's not Watson's books. You are really wondering why Holmes is taking him. Still growing up on you (in a way). Then there's Atwill with the Moriarty whale of time - discussions and the battle between him and Holmes are just great! I never liked Dennis Hoey as Inspector Lestrade - he's such an idiot. He makes Watson a genius. A Post Jr. He's pretty good as Tobel (though his accent is still changing!). This film is complicated and runs just over an hour. Still, it has slow spots and I never understood the secret code section. Still, it's worth catching if it's just for Rathbone and Atwill.
