This movie is my favorite comedy of all time and I've seen a lot of comedies. The dialogue is almost completely written by the actors. Cast is one of the best comedy files you'll ever see. The story is about the Mayflower Dog in Philadelphia and some of the contestants in them. Laughter comes from the absolute pathetic character. ***** / *****
