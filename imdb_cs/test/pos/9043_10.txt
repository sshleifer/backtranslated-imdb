The unjustly neglected classic "Alien in the Dust" is one of the greatest films of the 1940s, which unfortunately slipped into the unknown. Based on the story of William Faulker and shot in his hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, "Intruder" tells the story of Lucas Beauchamp (played with great dignity by Juan Hernandez), a black man unjustly accused of murdering a local white man and a white boy (Claude Jarman, Jr.) who uses this situation as an opportunity to pay Beauchamp an earlier debt. Amazing acting, especially by two great actors, Porter Hall (father of the dead man) and Elizabeth Patterson (best known as Mrs. Trumbull on "I Love Lucy") as an old woman willing to stand against the city's inhabitants to see the right thing is done. This direct, tense and sincere study of racial bigotry deserves to be more visible.
