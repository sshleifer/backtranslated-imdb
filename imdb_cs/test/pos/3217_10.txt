The idea of ​​a young girl who becomes pregnant at age 16 is nothing new for the drama genre. But it's quite new when you look at the comedy genre. There is this basic plot of Lorelai and Rory, mother and daughter. Lorelai comes from a rich environment, got pregnant for 16 years and escaped from her parents' house at age 17. But this series doesn't start, when Rory is 16 years old, and it's all about the problems of a single mother who has terrible problems with her parents and all the problems you have when you're 16. <br /> <br /> Okay, now it sounds quite normal again, but this little thing called a joke. Gilmore Girls speak incredibly fast and do like 60 jokes a minute. Although you don't understand all the jokes because they contain hundreds of links to movies, music, gossip, history, literature and politics. Sometimes you even get confused, but that's really fun. And not only is it fast, it's clever and beautifully sarcastic. Besides, it's not just funny, it has great dramatic parts in it and you can take some lessons from it and at home. Which is not the thing that would not go for every TV series. Watch it! Lighten your mood and help you through tough decisions!
