Jenny Lewis plays an embarrassing girl named Jade. Smokes and drinks. She doesn't have a lot of friends and has a confusing mother (Beverly D'Angelo). Jade finds herself closer to her mother's friend Billy (Rob Estes), possibly attracting him. Of course, I don't have to tell you what happens next. <br /> <br /> This is probably my favorite TV movie. This film shows that sometimes everyone is to blame. This film also has the best I've seen in TV movies. Beverly D'Angelo does a really nice job as a sweet and loving but negligible and blind mother. She couldn't see what was happening under her own roof. Rob Estes is in the best position as sleazeball. Jenny Lewis is a standout. She seems to be exactly like her character. It seems that he loves this movie!
