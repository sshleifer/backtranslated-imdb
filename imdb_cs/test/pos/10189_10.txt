I recently visited Magic Kingdom as an adult with my mom, her best friend and my adult sister. Disney World is often mistakenly seen as a place for children, but when you see good shows like Mickey's Philharmagic, you realize that Disney's magic is for everyone! It was such a spectacular show that we left the theater and turned around again. And then a third time. It was absolutely breathtaking. I would like to encourage anyone who goes to Disney World to look at this show, which is not just a show, but a world wind, a fun ride with Donald when he leaves him cool again!
