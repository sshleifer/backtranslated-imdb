Rowan Atkinson delivers unforgettable performance as a helpless Mr. Bean who never gets far without his teddy bear. Mr Bean's appeal is largely his childish behavior and innocence. We don't know if he came from heaven or another planet. It's the kind of weird character you can't easily create. He is often alone and used to it. It is difficult to communicate through speech, which might be the reason why we sometimes hear his grunts. There are other characters who talk to him and he will answer. Mr. Bean's character is a mystery and still is. He lives alone and makes unthinkable when he can do a rational thing. Mr. Bean is rather a strange person who doesn't mind much. Better live a simple life with his yellow car and teddy bear and hopes to get to work on time.
