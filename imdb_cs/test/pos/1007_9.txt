I am a huge Harald Zwart fan and I knew I had to see this movie, although I can't say I'm a football fan. But the observation just filled my heart with joy, and I had a great time in the movies watching it. Bj√∏rn Fast Nagell does a tremendous job of managing this movie, and while you notice that the main characters are new to playing, they grow up with film and do what it is. Although it is supposed to be a football movie, there is surprisingly little football. The whole idea is to show the six guys who make the word N O R W A Y on their way to the World Cup this year in Germany. <br /> <br /> If you only want to see one Norwegian film this year, it's the only one.
