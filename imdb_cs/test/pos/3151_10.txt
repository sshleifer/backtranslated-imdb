The reader is a perfect example of what a short film should be. A charming story, a simple, well-written dialogue, beautifully painted paintings, a score that seamlessly weaves the way through the story, and characters portrayed by thought and grace. I saw this film at a festival where other interesting movies and ideas were screened. But none of the other shorts had all the elements of great filmmaking in one movie like The Reader. The reader paid attention to each festival visitor in the room and took us to the emotional life of the characters for 10 minutes. Duncan Rogers has created a beautiful film and I hope to see more of it as a director is more shorts or a feature film.
