all I can say is that every time I see CONRACK, dir. Martin Ritt, DP. John Alonzo, I feel the ultimate feeling for inspiration and enlightenment in what is the power of film in such a simple film possible. Conrack is set in 1969. It is based on a true story. It's a story about a white man (Jon Voight) who teaches a group of young black kids how incredible the world is outside their little island South Carolina. The story gives the teacher work as a noble thing to change children's lives. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend.
