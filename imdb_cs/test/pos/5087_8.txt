Although, the short lived "amazing spider-man" was one of the best made for the television versions of the famous comic hero. Only "Wonder Woman" (Lynda Carter) (Best of the Genre and "The Incredible Hulk" (Lou Ferrigno) were better. "The Amazing Spider-Man Overcame 1966- 1968" Batman "Because the high camp elements of the latter often destroy the adventure." "Spider-Man" overcomes all three television interpretations of "Superman" - "Lois and Clark", "Smallville", and of course George Reeves "Superman", which brings back. "The Amazing Spider-Man" was an action drama, in the late 1970s, a pre-CGI era where stunts had to be performed by stunt men. "Spider-Man" had its very talented stuntman who did The acrobatics of a daredevil dealing with death was named Fred Waugh, who put on a suit for action sequences.Peter Parker, similar to Christopher Reeve- Superman / Clark Kent, Adam West-Batman / Bruce Wayne and of course Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman / Diana Prince. It's unfortunate that the show just had thirteen episodes. Because when the first episode hit the waves in November 1977, the whole country watched her Wednesday night on CBS. In all fairness, CBS should release this pilot episode as well as "The Deadly Dust", "Captive Tower", etc. On DVD. "Spider-Man" was short lived but had a cult following, and in my opinion it was a hell of a lot better than interpreting the movie's famous hero hero Toby McGuire. CBS may be hesitant to release these episodes for two reasons. (A) For them there may not be a wide market based on the lack of longevity of the series and the generation of children and young people who were not born when the series was originally broadcast in the 1970s. (B) One of the first episodes of "Spider-Man" dealt with the terrorist's suggestions at the World Trade Center, which was attacked twice many years after the show came out of the air, in 1993, and of course a devastating attack against him. land on 9/11/01, in which towers and many innocent lives were destroyed. However, I don't think it would be in bad taste to release this episode of "Spider-Man" even if the show was an adventure derived from a comic book and a camp in nature. The live action "Amazing Spider-Man" has no big sequel, but has a cult following. If and when CBS issues it on a DVD this cult following could be explained along with an episode in which Spiderman rescued the towers in 1978, but as in September 2001 real life proved to be different from the films. I like watching news, but I also like Science Fiction / Fantasy. That's why I'm waiting impatiently for the release of "The Amazing Spider-Man on DVD".
