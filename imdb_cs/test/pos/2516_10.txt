Great action - yeah the assumption was made - but not this way - it's a trick. hey people - SHOCK - it's an X-file. For me - it's okay that Scully / Mulder have almost no scenes together - they have to adapt, relying on each other to think what's really going on - and each other adaptation skills. They read their movements and do their work .... (kind). Yeah Yeah - Really Good Acting - These People Will Be Paid To Do It? A slow day when they don't put them to work in the shop. (hey - Duchovny - where are the old donuts? Malcolm - to school ...)
