I'm a 55-year-old, quite tired gay white. As I watch TV, I watch at least 250 movies a year, most on DVD. I keep notes about all the movies I see and evaluate. Since December 2003, I have seen only five films that are as big as eighty. So I rated EIGHTEEN better than at least 700 other recent movies. Mr. Bell is too modest in his film commentary. Eighty is a big movie. The result is also two "first" for me. For the first time I watched the movie and during the last half hour I was riveted and cried, something that only happened to me three times earlier. (Five minutes into the movie I knew it would be very good.) When Jason started reciting Whitman, I lost it and then ... Kiss. Well, this is one of the biggest movie kisses and the scene between the film's most enjoyable and memorable. When Pip throws out the candle at the end and credits roll, I clapped. I cheered. I like happy endings. I cried. Then I watched the trailer and the TLA previews and wondered, "Okay, is that $ 800,000 or so is India really that big?" I immediately watched Eighteen, something that only happened three times before. And eighteen times he sacked my socks again, even more. Then I watched "The Making of EIGHTEEN" and was completely enchanted by cast and Mr. Bell. So I thought I was going to follow the CHILDREN'S director's comments again. I've never seen a movie three times in one night. After the third time, at 3:00 in the morning, I knew I had a big movie; Eighteen are now top ten on my Top Twenty Films of all time. And in a very small universe of a big gay or gay-subtext movie, there is Broken Mountain, eighteen, Mulholland Drive and Maurice. <br /> <br /> Thank you Mr. Bell! Eighteen is brilliant and fully realized, with a wonderful cast, beautifully moving, undervalued score, excellent cinematography, fun, moving, perfectly appropriate and humble song. I can go on, but I won't be much stronger. This film was to receive Oscar nominations, certainly one of the best photos. The performance, without exception, was amazing. Mrs. Gill's nice, sensual speech was a surprising revelation. And Sir Ian McKellen? Nuf said. Great. Eighty is the reason why I spent over 200 times average to terrible movies (some $ 150 million plus) in a year to find out that one treasure, the great one, the magical, the unique one unique. a charming, perfect "Faberg Egg" surrounding an unforgettable heart. Finally (I promise), my second "first" - I've never posted a comment on any movie I've seen. br /> <br /> Thank you again, Mr. Richard Bell! A breathtaking genius. Give this man $ 100 million for another movie! He made $ 700,000 US into one of the top 50 movies of all time. If I had cash, I'd give him $ 75,000 a year to live and answer all the money he got for his next film. Mr. Bell is already a great director at the age of 31. Can you imagine it at the age of 45? Wise and witty, tender and brutal, ready, irritated, undervalued, yet nervous, cool and exciting, fascinating, scary, unforgettable: Eighteen, MASTERPIECE.
