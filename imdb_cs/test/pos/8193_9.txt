Emperor and Assassin (w / English subtitles) for 161 minutes is long, but time is full of story that hardly fits into it. Golden hued palace scenes and dusty yellow panoramas of Chinese landscapes background true story of the unifying king of China, about 300 BCE. The intricate plot with countless twists and turns is played with excellent casting images. King Qin is a simple wish for a unified Empire for his ordinary people is fulfilled, but not without betrayal, land and counters and oh yes, bodies. Lots of bodies. This epic story of Chinese beginnings is a great way for Westerners to look into the little-known Asian history. Among the heritage of Emperor Qin are thousands of life-sized terracotta characters that have been dug up to this day. As a historical man, this film makes it clear that Emperor Qin should be considered together with George Washington, Napoleon Bonaparte, Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and Julius Caesar to name several of the world's greatest conquerors / statesmen. I highly recommend seeing the emperor and the killer, especially on the big screen.
