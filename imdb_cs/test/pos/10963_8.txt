In the "Shadows" final credits, after reading "director John Cassavets", we can see a few white letters on the screen: "The movie you just saw is improvised", they say. I always follow the fact that words are so important in movies, because the creators started using them because there is basically no screenplay movie and many other reasons. Cassavetes pursued the same goal and believed in the freedom of words; "Shadows" is a perfect example. It is a film without real main characters, with no real mainline plot; it is mostly people in different situations talking. Yes, some situations are connected, but Cassavetes, apparently always in a hurry to get to talk, uses the technique of fast forwarding when characters go away or escape from someone and don't talk. Appearances are everything in this movie. For example, there is a brilliant score, full of jazz influences and lots of fantastic solos, and there is one character who says he is a jazz musician and plays the trumpet (Ben, all the characters 'names are the same actors' names). But we never see him playing trumpet or jam with a band; he doesn't even talk about music and just wanders with his friends around town. They talk, a lot and everything in their minds; go from how intelligent each one is to a merry analysis of the statue. "Shadows" is humorous in its intellectual references in parts like the one above, because these friends are not cultivated. The only important female character in the film (Lelia) wants to be an intellectual. But again, she has one very interesting conversation with an older man at a party, about the book trying to write, and about how to face reality; but nothing to do with being intellectual. At the same party, the woman actually makes an intellectual statement, full of complexity, and asks the guy next to her: "Do you agree?". "Yes," he says, but you can say he doesn't know what he is talking about. Another character, singer (Hugh), talks about her glorious days on occasions and we see him perform only once; but no references to the music industry. Cassavetes focuses on the singer's relationship with his manager (Rupert), who mostly includes chats about trivial things and not real "musical" talks. An important trumpeter agreement in "Shadows" is the time he spends with his friends; The Wonderful Girl's Intellectual is her way of dealing with romantic relationships (one of the film's strengths) and the singer is a bond with his manager? Appearances. The reason why performance isn't important in this movie is simple. Cassavetes needed people who could handle improvisation, regardless of whether they were really good. I believe some of them are not, but they certainly know how to improvise in the scene, and you can see how well they do it. "Shadows" is not about performers; it's about making a movie based on a conversation spell; And there you could say that the performances mean something. Therefore, in every conversation, the camera is a stalker, always in the eyes of every character, constantly looking for expressions that come with natural language. There is a scene where the trumpeter and his friends try to pick up some girls. They are three, so each of them sits next to one girl (girls are three) at three different tables. Everyone talks at the same time and the camera shoots across the table, and sometimes friends look at each other while they say what they say is natural.
