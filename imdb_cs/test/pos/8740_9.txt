This film was not entirely fresh in the spirit of film enthusiasts and it is a cry of shame. His witty adaptation to the screenplay should be nominated for an Academy Award for outstanding screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond adaptation and flawless performance of Ingrid Bergman. Goldie Hawn must have been a young age to work with Bergman, looking over ten years younger than 54 - fifty-four! When it is on the screen, it positively twinkles. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that may appear initially at first, but in fact I wished I was during the swingin '' sixties. Hawn's fashion is just as cheap as Bergman's fashion. (This is one small mistake - is it not her character too soign√©e in a gallery that still lives with her sister? But then we would have another ingrid again?) And who wouldn't want to hang out a nightclub called Slipped Disc? The best compliments I can pay for this movie is that I am somehow nostalgic in a decade I've never seen, and that it left me more. Speaking of wanting more, I wonder what happened to sexy actor Rick Lenz? (In this film, he resembles Griffin Dunn.) That was his film debut and I see no other major roles in his filmography. As far as Goldie Hawn is concerned, it has been so many times since it's not easy, but I can't imagine any other actress playing the role. <br /> <br /> Since the movie is game based, line delivery may seem a bit of a stage-y, but it didn't hinder my enjoyment at all. In fact, I am impressed by how fun it is after more than thirty-five years. Since this film represents a past era, it has unfairly slipped away from the minds of film enthusiasts. This is more associated with the era of movies that came before him than those that followed. But don't let yourself stop to enjoy the pleasure it offers. Stamp A
