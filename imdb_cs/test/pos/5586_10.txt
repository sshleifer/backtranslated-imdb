This movie seems to have been overlooked. Someone should put it on VHS and DVD. It's an excellent movie and much better than the one with Brooke Shields that was terrible. Jean Simmons deserves more credit than he gets now. It would be nice if all her films were offered on VHS or DVD. Jean Simmons was and still is a very good actress. Surely it was beauty. In fact, it is still beauty. She also did very well on T.V. She is much better than many actors today.
