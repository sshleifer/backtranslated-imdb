I read all the manga that Junji Ito released. I was watching a Tomie movie and it was a big smoking pile. Uzumaki really does manga justice. I think those who read the manga will really appreciate this movie because many of the screenshots and camera angles are just like in the manga and it's interesting to see the characters in the movie playing the book. This film reminds me of a horrible Indian. The end is different from the manga I expected. Kirie looks like her manga counterpart and her friend suits the whole. I have to admit it is scary, this film seems to me to be a horrible nightmare. Isn't it at all scary at all, but strange if you get drifted? Another great horror from Japan, you get a copy.
