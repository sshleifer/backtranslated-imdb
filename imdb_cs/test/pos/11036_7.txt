Feeling the need for someone to play the role of arbitrator of public appetite and political correctness will always get under our skin. These self-determined, self-superior, pseudo-intellectual types appear everywhere; be it in the family, in the church or in the bowling league. These are those who should completely ignore society and ignore everything that has gone before us; unless, of course, no matter what it means, they do not fly in the face of today's "acceptable" language, morals, and general "norms" of "right" behavior. SO thats that this day, high-tech book burners have focused on a great deal of what was Hollywood's greatest success; in particular, their participation in our own allied propaganda through their selflessly produced news and thematic films. Brutal in its generation ONLY, Banned Code and List of Now Unacceptable extends to war cartoons that do not encounter new touch, rather socially constructed "official" attitudes; which these "Mind Police" undermined us. We were really surprised to see that these are bundles of such animated shorts. Most of which we are aware of are from Warner Brothers' LOONEY TUNES and MERRIE MELODIES; featuring Bugs, Daffy, Elmer and Porky, all in conflict with Hitler, Goerring, 'Il Duce', Tojo and the like. Surprisingly, however, we found enough supplies of caricatures from MGM, Walt Disney, Lantz, Paramount-Famous Studios, and Brothers Fleischer. <br /> <br /> ARE SAP MR. Famous Studios (Paramount Pictures, 1942) is a prime example of what we are talking about. Being practically indistinguishable from the cartoons that were the result of the studies of Max and Dave Fleischer's business coup in 1941, which moved them out, brought the new name of "Famous" Studies, are SAP MR. JAP did not carry any of those elements that would reduce the last day of Popeye Cartoons to the level of a short film. We all remember Popeye and Olive Oyl together. Enter Bluto, usually an exponent of a wolf whistle and an acceptable on-screen version of a male response to female pulchritude. Olive falls on Bluto less than honest attention; Until he gets too physically and always fades away, "Hey, Babe, how about" kiss? "At this point we hear" Help! Help, Popeye and the diminutive sailor show up to save the day; filled with a mandatory can of spinach! Exaggerate, Schultz? ONCE again this JAP SAP cartoon is nothing like this. "Sure, it follows the story now to have Popeye in the US Navy. they even put Popeye on board a mythical battleship USS Pensyltucky. <br /> <br /> OUR PLACE IS THIS: SPINACH FER Britain is not really a cartoon car for the Theaters comics program, but it's a sort of editorial group cartoons that are similar to those of all the "big metropolitan newspapers." one more panel of illustrations, they are charac that are highly symbolic and representative of peoples, thoughts and ideals such as fair and lasting peace. Bunny or anyone) alone with the enemy symbol Both are exaggerated visual metaphors for abstract concepts and though they are shrouded in humorous traps for a wider taste. <br /> <br /> Our antithesis of intelligence may not be seen in this way; but for this kind of behavior, they are no more than Neo Nazi book burners. PLEASE, allow future generations to see and appreciate past events that are both historical and humorous. > <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
