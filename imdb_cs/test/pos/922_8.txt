In my analysis "Trois couleurs: Blanc" I wrote that his tone is much lighter than the tone "Trois couleurs: Bleu". I think it's the same with this movie. This time it's not because of the tragic comedy-element, but much more because of Valentine's main character. Although her boyfriend lives abroad and is ridiculously jealous, directs her life with ease and optimism, it seems to me that she could be a picture of Kieslowski's carefree youth. The opposite appears to be a judge who is a very pessimistic, grumpy old man who experiences great loneliness. In my opinion, Valentine and the judge are very similar, the judge is much older and has experienced many other disappointments. They share a different kind of naivety and both find that they can learn a lot from each other. Finally, I would like to emphasize the performance of Irene Jacob, completing the amazing women's contribution to the "Three Colors" trilogy.
