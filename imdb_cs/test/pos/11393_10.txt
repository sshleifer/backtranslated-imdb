All you need to know about pornography in the late 70s and early 80s is all packed in Paul Thomas Anderson's BOOGIE NIGHTS. Although the film is completely fictional, it is actually probably based on the story of the porn Kingpin John Holmes. In Southern California in 1977, Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) works as a busboy in a nightclub. One regular customer is Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) and two of his stars, Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) and Rollergirl (Heather Graham). Jack and Eddie meet and Jack realizes Eddie is good ... a little ... gifted. So Eddie plays in Jack's films under the pseudonym "Dirk Diggler". He becomes a "big" porn star (he has no pun) and seems to be on top of everything. Then comes the 1980s, when the video replaces the film, and Jack's porn empire begins to collapse, along with Dirk Diggler and all the others who work in the field. <br /> <br /> BOOGIE NIGHTS is a really well done drama. There's some violence, but P.T. Anderson is more stylized. And it's kind of a scary approach to pornography degradation, especially when VHS has become the standard media for the production of pores. Many bizarre and unique characters are being introduced. William H. Macy has an interesting role as someone working on movies whose wife keeps sex with everyone. Especially I liked the role of Don Cheadle as a Buck stereo dealer. Best performance is BOOGIE NIGHTS definitely Burt Reynolds. 90's classic!
