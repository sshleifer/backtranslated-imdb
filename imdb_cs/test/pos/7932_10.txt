I learned a lot from previous reactions from the viewer. Is there one who doesn't mention "propaganda"? Too glib. "Perception is concept dependent". I love Fred Astaire's musicals, great, great songs and Fred's unique grace. But comrades, if you see idle, helpless, rich parasites dancing at the oppressed and the unemployed, that's a valid critique of "capitalist propaganda." Any movie is immersed in the values ​​of its time and place, not to mention those who finance it? pipers calling the melody. Great art transcends all, as well as "Nevsky" as well as "Silence on the Western Front". I confess. I saw it forty years ago. But the images are burned in my brain. It's the biggest battle scene that would probably be filmed. And that scares you to be excited. Did anyone say "plastic ice"? This is the real death you are watching. Real extras died doing this. 'Real looking' is now defined as special effects. Likewise "too long" - for the age of dilapidated attention? Did Mozart have too many notes? Propaganda, Catholic Church Decried? The Vatican was on the STILL when they urged ancient favors to reach the German Christian Democrat. to recognize Croatia in the 1990s? Remember the chaos and genocide? Forget the props, lighting Nevsky painted the medieval world? like Breughel. One Palace at Hampton Court Palace shows a massacre. Perhaps gross Dutch nationalist propaganda, but tears in the heart. Stylized acting? What is Henry V (Olivier's Film)? Naturalism? Does anyone know that an English medieval knight-killer spoke like that? As has been said, Prokofiev's music is amazing. Only Ken Russell & Eisenstein had the balls and genius to match the sound and image at this level of 100 octane. Okay, you want it a bit and a little. I always risk nervousness every time. Eisenstein did not copy the Wehrmacht's helmets, but his model seems to have been buckets worn by the Teutonic Knights in the tales of the 1930s. Eisenstein was a genius, but unlike Hollywood directors, he had almost unlimited time and funding. Modern Russian directors are without political ties, but they have no money. Even Kurasawa had to make a late (big) film in Communist Russia. He was worshiped, but in his own country (just like Russell). How much propaganda is in the viewer's eyes? Imagine reasonable people from another, peaceful world. How would they respond to Nevsky? Would the battle or mourning of the dead prevail over their knowledge? If we didn't know about the gas chambers and the SS, what is the "victory of the will"? Where can I Get Nevsky DVDs, Cheap?
