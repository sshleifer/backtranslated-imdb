Of course, for those of you not familiar with Alisdair Sims, it's definitely Scrooge's all their Christmas movies. I think I'm really bad. I think those who saw Christmas Carol and so accustomed to his character could find a surprise. You see, in this movie Sims has two roles. One, he's playing harder, and in the other, he's as a director for a private girl school! So once you get through a thick skull, this movie offers plenty of delicacies. The story deals with the way school tries to make desperately needed money through a race. It's actually a little more complicated for young children, but I think they would take care of their opposites and the horses to really notice them. Despite all the strong accents that are also thrown, adults could get through. But again, the story is lightly light, crazy and frenetic action to really notice. PS, kids look like they came from Eloise's school of cuteness.
