In this dramatic drama set in Chicago in the early 1960s, we are watching a group of high school friends going through the ups and downs of their lives. The two main characters are Leroy "Preach" Jackson (Turman) and his best friend Richard "Cochise" Morris (Hilton-Jacobs.) Both of these boys have a promising future. Preach is a great writer, but a lazy student, and Cochise has just won a college basketball scholarship. When there are no craps filming with their friends in the local inn, or hanging out in a friend's house or chasing girls, skipping school, going on trains over Chicago or going to quarters over the weekend. Things go wrong when Preach and Cochise make a mistake when they join two hoods and go to hide in a stolen car. The police are watching them and being arrested. But thanks to the efforts of the concerned teacher (SNR Garrett Morris) they are released. But both hoods are not and they promise to avenge Preach and Cochis because they think they blame the whole thing on them. This movie is very episodic, but it still works because that's what life is, a series of episodes. Some funny, some sad, some romantic, some bizarre. The film will never be bored because all characters are so well played and realistic, and the situations are all believable and relatable. Like Preach, he romantically pursues a beautiful girl, or a party that becomes violent when some asshole decides to start a fight, or to engage in younger brotherhood brothers. But while the situation is not personally portable, as boys who pretend to be secret cops to get out of some money to hook up all their friends into the movie, the sequence is still cheerful. 'Cooley High' was the foundation of the classic 70's 'What's Happenin!' which aired on ABC 1976-1979. Although the show is best known for the character Rerun, it is not in this movie, nor is there any sign distantly like him. The show's humor was very wide, but fun. Humor 'Cooley High' is truer to life and thus more fun. Plus, the soundtrack is great. Classical songs from this period by Diana Ross and The Supremes, The Temptations, Martha & The Vandellas and Smokey Robinson play throughout the film, complementing the fun, youthful, lush tone of the film.
