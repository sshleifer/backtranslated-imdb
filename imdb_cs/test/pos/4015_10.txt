*** Spoilers Forward *** My late childhood had two cinematic icons: Star Wars and this movie by Czech genius Karel Zeman. The Jules Verne Encyclopedia, in which the XIX century illustrations come to life in gorgeous black and white photography, combined with stop motion and conventional animation. Verne's spirit of adventure is fully present throughout the film as well as a very modern interrogation on moral limits of power and advanced technology. In fact, it brings atomic energy to Verne's universe in a very elliptical and elegant way. Also elliptical and elegant is the extinction of a villain, with a (probably nuclear) explosion that sends a hat over the sea. The resolution of the film is symbolic and very satisfying, today it is very rare when many films seem to not know how to end. local television at the end of the 1970s: I was enhanced by the joy of Verne's fiction and cinema. 10 of 10 for Karel Zeman, underestimated master of fantasy.
