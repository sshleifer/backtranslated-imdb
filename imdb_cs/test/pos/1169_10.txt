A movie I've seen and enjoyed more than any other movie. I first saw it as a child and loved drama and great battle. As I got older, I enjoyed it as much or more than before, but now thanks to all the components that work together to become a true classic. Acting is great (especially Keith as T. Roosevelt), cinematography is spectacular, the script is full of gems and the director cares it all. It is loosely based on a real event, and it shows the rush of Europe and the emerging America to carve the 'Sick Old Man' (Ottoman Empire) as it collapses in fashion as opposed to other 'historical' film I have seen. Humor, drama, action, love ... it's all and deserves much more greeting (similar to "The Great Waldo Pepper").
