Others have missed James Stewart while playing Lindburg (he was 47 Linburgs twenty-five). But Stewart doesn't look his age and film because his dream came true. Stewart, a true pilot and retired general aviation general at the end of his life, felt that his character and understanding of his passion that other actors could not bring to this role. Added to the cast was co-star Murray Hamilton, who was also to be featured in the "FBI story with Stewart) and such other well-known character actors as Richard Deacon, later" Dick Van Dike Shows "and Robert Cornthwaite" \ t Another World "1951 Sci-Fi Classics" Billy Wilder captures the taste of Lindburg's autobiography and narrative of what has become a major event in aviation history. The film is a testimony to the soul of determination and perseverance to realize the dream, when the box office was released at the time of its release, it became one of the greatest classics of American film and more in a long line of outstanding performances. An actor who is called American Everyman, no film history student should not miss to see this. There have been over 500,000 movies since the beginning of the movies, and it is among the top 500.
