I found it charming! No one but Kiarostami can do so little, yet so much. You may think I am weird, but I was so enchanted that I couldn't speak during the movie. While I comment a lot on other films. The short film he made for Lumiere et Companie, the one with eggs that is insurmountable in my heart, but that's also amazing. I liked it better than ten. In my opinion, Kiarostami is the best director because he sees things! He doesn't have to use a lot of things "brought from home" to illustrate his images, he simply catches the camera. She can't do much. Maybe I don't know much about movies, but I don't care about complicated things, all you have to do is touch my soul. Kiarostami.
