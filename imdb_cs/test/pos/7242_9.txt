'Nemesis' was the last book presented by Miss Marple, written by Agatha Christie (the official "Sleeping Murder" case was written in the 1940s) and I always had a very soft place for him. I loved the characters and are lovingly brought to life in this excellent BBC adaptation with Joan Hickson, amazing as always, like Miss Marple. Overall, this is a very faithful book. Several characters are omitted, the first (new) murder is somewhat different and several new characters are introduced. I personally felt that the added character of Lionel Peel was unnecessary and rather irritating. The Madge guide teased in another way, but often very fun. This is largely due to Lionel, who doesn't award 10 out of 10! Other characters are beautifully made especially by Helen Cherry as a worthy Miss Temple and all three strange sisters, but especially Margaret Tyzack, who is posing as a towering performance like Clothilde. He threatens to go over the top to the end, but he simply avoids it. Female bodyguards are also good and the episode contains one of my favorite Hickson lines ... "Archdeacon?!" This is another pretty early BBC Marple that looks beautiful and has a great nostalgic feel. Highly recommended.
