When that movie gets right, it really gets right. And when it goes wrong ... I'd say the whole 3/4 of the movie is great. I can even isolate the wrong piece. It's all related to romance. Everything you need to know about is said in the first five minutes, but it takes about 30 years. I recommend you skip this section if you can. He does nothing but explain his exile. It was supposed to be a small plot to quickly pull aside. Fortunately, the period from 0-30 to 1: 00-2: 19 (The End) is excellent. <br /> <br /> There are a number of great performances and the same number of horrific movies in this movie. . Like everything else in this movie, acting is either perfect or terrible. Peter Ustinov as a slimy one-eyed slave Kaptah is perfect. This is one of his best performances, there with his role in Spartacus. Victor Mature as an ambitious Horemheb is also perfect. Again, one of his best roles. Jean Simmons is wasted as merit, a perfect girl in love with our hero John Carradine gives a nice supporting role as a thief of a philosophical grave; and Michael Wilding is excellent as Akhnaton, an idealistic pharaoh who seeks to bring peace and monotheism to Egypt just to see that he has fallen apart for his unwillingness to fight. Now for the wrong. Unfortunately, Edmund Purdom as Sinuhe is wrong. This is twice as unfortunate as it is the main character. The whole movie revolves around him. In fact, he is rather good as a disillusioned exile and a wise old man. This is due to its very limited range. He doesn't seem to give any passion to his words. This is especially evident during love scenes that are awkward. He spends the last half of the film as an old man, a performance on which he is decent. He has a perfect voice for character. The less of Belle Darvi as Nefer, the treacherous Babylonian woman, the less. Costumes and sets are beautiful. This is the only film I know about trying to portray life in Egypt, which is not overshadowed by Jews or Romans. The film takes place in the 14th century by B.C. which is still Exodus. The only monotheists are Pharaoh Achnaton and his followers. There is the same strong element of religious zeal that can be found in most epics, but it is done differently and it only proves at the very end. Interesting remark: by following Akhenaten with Pharaoh Horemheb, the film will completely skip the most famous Pharaoh of all: Tutankhamun. It seems something strange to do if this name could raise film awareness. Be warned: this is an epic film from the 1950s. If you don't like this type of thing, then don't expect it to be different. It's different, but it's still an epic. I appreciate this film and appreciate what it did and what it was trying to do. This is a movie that should be better remembered than it is.
