There is not much to come close to the perfect pace of stories and thrilling action-packed levels like "GoldenEye". When it came out, it was the greatest game of all time, and even today it remains strong. <br /> <br /> I admit that this game was bored after a few months of playing and not. I play it again two years later, I was pushed back to its biggest, almost as if I played it for the first time again. <br /> <br /> There are 20 action-packed levels, which is probably the most of all James Bond games to date. Perhaps the most memorable is the Tank level, which was probably the most explosive video game sequence at the time. First-person fans, as well as the use of Q-gadgets, is what James Bond fans always die. Frankly speaking, as a James Bond fan, I am looking for aspects of the true James Bond experience that now appear in PS2 games. So this game, even though it has some great actions and usable aids, I expected a little bit more, even in 1997. I also didn't like the fact that this game didn't have Q or M or Moneypenny, nor anyone from MI6. While watching movies, Bond communicates with these characters at least several times in each movie, but they are nowhere to be seen in this game. And the voice dialogue would make the game more vivid than the text dialogue that ended up using it. They had technology. Probably the most annoying feature of this game is that in some ways the story of the movie follows exactly, and other ways that it is incoherent. For example, there are two levels where you have to protect or save Natalia, even if he can take care of himself in the film. There are also some unnecessary levels, such as the level of a ship where you have to disarm some bombs (which is not in the movie), which nothing happens to happening at all. There are even some levels where you save Natalya, but at the beginning of the next level, she is captured again. As? <br /> <br /> All right. Even the little ones can't build this game. And while I prefer newer games, this Bond experience is definitely one you won't forget. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
