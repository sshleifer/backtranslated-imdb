If you really want to scare people, choose the devil as your subject. After all, a lot of residents believe it is real. Therefore, you are joining the whole mass of rows of existing religious and mythological images. And in your young spectator, they must cause a few nightmares. This episode had all the forms of a Hollywood blockbuster. After completing the track, I switched to another channel that played on the recent Bond movie, and frankly, I couldn't split my hair between the differences in SFX. With a minimal cast, limited by his situation on the space station; with a stunning panoramic view of the imploding universe, it was as claustrophobic and intense as Alien or Event Horison.

And because the horror is intensified by the knowledge that Dr and Rose are stuck, the sinister Ood begins to direct the intangible voice, and then the characters start collecting one by one ... \ t Girl in fireplace and blank baby. Emotionally engaging, frightening and funny, without being cheese. This is much more frightening than any amount of Daleks flying. But you need to ask, is this really a good display for kids? This is not a family-friendly episode. Too bad a poor parent who has to put his children to bed after this. I'm not sure I want to see what's next!
