Patty Chayevsky has been in front of the most successful script and dramatic writers for tackling sticky objects for years. This 1971 film was followed by Sinclair Lewis and A. J. Cronin (or ARROWSMITH and CITADEL) at a critical view of the world of medicine, although his goal is to focus on a special stage: a modern Manhattan hospital. Khayevsky's view is quite straightforward: there are places in the hospital for people to go well, or there are organizations where people often die because of incompetence. As a person who has recently been in hospital too many times (and will soon return) I HAVE NOT HOSPITAL very early and rewarded. George C. Scott is Dr. Block, one of the leading surgical centers of Manhattan, a major teaching hospital. He had just begun his day when he was told that one of his second-year residents had died in an apparent mix during the night. It looks like he was asleep and dazed as he slept on his bed (he had a sister with him) and someone manipulated it i.v. which contained water with glucose (it was later shown to have received an insulin overdose in i.v.). Soon Scott discovers that whenever he turns around another employee, he dies of a heart attack or an operation. The key to all this seems to be one patient who came to the hospital ten days before the regular checkup and has since lost one kidney, has almost lost his second kidney and is now in a comatose state (Barnard Hughes). Hughes' daughter (Diana Rigg) wants to bring a comatose dad back to her home on Apache Indian Reservation in Mexico. Scott is not entirely against the idea - after all, hospital bugs have almost killed Hughes. Scott also suffers from a crisis in the middle of his life with the collapse of his marriage and family, and his growing doubts about what his chosen profession actually achieves. It's not just a look at the case like Hughes. The hospital is in a constant state of chaos where regular staff (Scott, Stephen Elliot, Nancy Marchand, Stockard Channing) is overworked and overrated and is at war with merchants (a typical Frances Steenhagen in a really cool show). The local community is hostile due to plans for hospital expansion - but when they meet to "discuss" issues with Elliot they prove it is as dividing among themselves (militant Black Panthers versus local clergy versus birth control seeking women and pro-miscarriage clinic ). Rigg (who falls in love with Scott over the course of the film) is becoming more and more convinced that leaving the city's madness makes sense, and Scott is also playing with this idea. Scott was in his role as an actor in this film, with ANATOMY MURDER, THE HUSTLER, DR. STRANGEL and PATTON under the belt before the hospital was made. His anxiety came to pass when they and Rigg recognized each other (preventing him from killing himself because of his despair). He can't tell if anything in the hospital pays off, and shouts out the words in the "Summary Line". Though later relaxed a bit about how good his teaching is for doctors studying with him, Scott is not quite sure about it - but he fully accepts his own sense of responsibility, which others just throw away. Also, Rigg was at the height of his international fame (if not her acting ability) - her stint as Mrs. Peel at AVENGERS was several years old, but at that time she was also recognized as a leading talent talent in Britain. as one of the trendiest women in this period. Supporters are also good. In addition to the cooling Steenhagen (demanding Medicare / Medicaid / insurance information from patients with comatose in E.R.), there is Hughes as a religious maniac who wins, and Elliot as a feed head of the hospital. There is also my favorite cartoon: Richard Dysart as Dr. Elwell. Elwell is a butcher who has found a real home for the Stock Exchange Council. Anyone who recalls his performances as ethical types, such as a law firm leader in L.A.LAW or as a friend and physician to Melvin Douglas at the BEING THER, when he saw his greedy Dr. Elwell, sees another aspect of this talent actor.
