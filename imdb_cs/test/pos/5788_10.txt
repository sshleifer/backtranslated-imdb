I have a good common sense of knowing that oil cannot last forever and I am very well aware of how much of my suburban life revolves around petrochemical products. I was a passionate consumer of new technologies and I still lack space on powerboards - so I know that the energy crisis associated with Peak Oil will change my life considerably. The end of Suburbia shows in a rational and fun way how much my whole lifestyle will have to change in my life. I am particularly concerned about future generations who will have to pick up a card for our excesses, but filmmakers offer a glimpse of hope that they recognize human ingenuity and determination - and a sense of community that tends to be called. about common suffering. There is no point trying to pretend that Peak Oil is unreasonable propaganda - or treats it as an approaching radioactive cloud in "On The Beach" (ie, suicide pill). ). Even with our best efforts, the times will get right and I hope there is enough compassion and humanity.
