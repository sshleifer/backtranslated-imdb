I just watched it with my three kids - 12yrs (boy), 10yrs (boy) and 8yrs (girl) and this movie was a good old-fashioned family action adventure. Although it has certainly focused on the children's market (I would say 5 to 13) it was certainly observable and as a parent it is a pleasure to find a film that appeals to a wide range of ages and is also suitable for the whole family to watch - especially younger children. The story revolves around Ricky, a bit of a fool with a vivid imagination (this can be seen in his dreaming of dreaming), who deal with the kidnapping and theft of large works of art on board a flight to Washington for a school trip. Ricky's dad is an airplane mechanic, so Ricky not only knows the structure of the plane inside, but is also a top-gun on his computer flight simulator. This is useful when the pilot and passenger are cool in a series of disasters and there is no one to fly by plane. I don't want to give out another plot.
