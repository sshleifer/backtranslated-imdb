I was very happy and quite surprised by other positive comments written by non-Koreans. This film is amazingly heartbreaking and shows a very 'sad but warm' view of life that is typical of Korean people. I thought other strangers wouldn't understand this delicate feeling and underestimated this silent movie as boring, but I was wrong. The attractiveness of this film can hardly be avoided by foreigners. (Even without subtitles ...) <br /> <br /> I would like to mention some of the points others have missed. Of course, this film captures the love between man and woman. But the theme itself is beyond that. Actually it is about time, value of memory and death. In this film, no attention is paid to the "love affair" between two people. As some have pointed out, they do not kiss, even when holding hands. Love itself is not finished in the film (either positively or negatively). Rather, what haunts Jungwon (the leading actor) is his impending death. He is running out of time, unable to keep him, leaving a few behind, including his father and of course Darima (metermaid). So the problem is how he can face death and leave something valuable in his short life, not how he can make love with Dari. <br /> <br /> This kind sounds very good to us. There are a lot of movies about patients with an incurable disease such as "Love Story". What makes this film special is the way Jungwon kills his death. It's defeated, but he was trying to do his best when he was alive, V SILENT WAY. He won't tell anyone about his death. He hides something in his mind, but without anger, hatred, revenge. He was just trying to do his best when he was alive. This limited communication and obedience to fate is a typical attitude of Koreans, and most Western people do not understand or at best understand. This topic is very effectively expressed by the director of this film (surprisingly his debut). Some say it is heavily influenced by Japanese director Ozu Yasujir, who directed Tokio Story. I remember reading in a magazine that the director himself admitted he was influenced by Oz. I'm not knowledgeable to analyze his style compared to Oz, but they have some in common and some don't. Low angle and static camera, especially remind us of Oz. Regarding the theme again, this Korean director seems to have a somewhat warmer and more promising vision. Very well done and really heartbreaking scene, I think. Actually, the director had the first idea of ​​this film when he attended the funeral of a very famous Korean folk singer who died of youth for a mysterious suicide. He says he saw a photo of a singer at a funeral and thought of a film about death and memory. (And maybe I hope the rest, I think ...) <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone who is deeply interested in film art and Korean culture. This film, in my opinion, can be rivaled with other films like Tokyo Story, and a kind of American beauty. It's great, no language barrier. The DVD version will be on the market this February, so it may be a little help for strangers with English subtitles.
