I read angels and demons about 3 years ago, and I can honestly say it's one of the few books I couldn't lose while reading. a lot of action, with a somewhat mysterious story. In my opinion, Tom Hanks plays a much better role as Professor Langdon than in the Da Vinci Code. You won't have to worry about this being as bad as the Da Vinci Code is all that wasn't. Much more interesting, more action, more tension and less unnecessary disputes. If you haven't read the book, you don't have to worry. And if you read the book, let's say you could be a little let go because I found many scenes I enjoyed. But maybe it's not too strange for Dan Brown fans.
