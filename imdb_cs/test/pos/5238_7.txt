Sweeping and Still Impressive Early Talkie Western Pioneering Days; other contemporary films in the same spirit include COVERED WAGON (1923), IRON HORSE (1924) and CIMARRON (1931)? I watched none of them, even though I had the other one on VHS. It was currently filmed in the "standard" fullscreen ratio and in an experimental widescreen process called "Grandeur", but only the former was released on Bare Bones by Fox DVD; one can only guess how it would look wider but careful framing? not to mention wonderful cinematography ?? it is also sufficiently clear in the "Standard" version. Young John Wayne is surprisingly commanding in leadership (a role that did not lead to the expected fame in 'B' Westerns for the best part of the next decade, before John Ford came to his rescue with STAGECOACH [1939]! ); like Marguerite Churchill (from DRACULA DAUGHTER [1936]) are they making a nice couple? despite its rather tiring character. Supporting characters include a variety of stock types: West Veteran, comic-sidekick relief (with a penchant for making noises with the mouth!), Stout and dishonest thief (played by Tyrone Power Sr.!), His two slimy cohorts (Mexican and Southerner, the latter also filling up as Wayne's rival for Churchill's hand), etc. Also among the members of the wagon's party is a shy Swede (full of optimism for the Promised Land, but who is continually laid by his irascible mother-in-law) and later Wayne Regular Ward Bond. The episodic story solves itself in a row alternating Cornball, lyrical and action-packed vignettes? how we see potential settlers fighting elements, Indians and alone; however, the film has an absolutely authentic impression that smooths its essentially dated and static quality. Also editing is somewhat choppy (especially during the second half)? No wonder because the DVD release of the movie is only 108 minutes against the complete 158-minute "Grandeur" version!
