I saw it at a screening at GenCon in Indy. I had time to kill and decided to check it out. It played about 1000 people in a packed hall-only-room-only ballroom. Wow, what a ride! The script was tight. The action tensed. Stimulation is perfect. Character exposition excellent. One thing I really appreciated was that you knew it wasn't a big movie budget. However, it soon became apparent that the creators shifted their files and effects as far as possible, despite their limitations. And it was more than enough. It is true that this film was aimed at a certain audience - players / table players - the creators do not try to hide it. Other filmmakers could learn a lot from them. For being a jugular in the scene after the scene and not worrying about the mom who is going to be going to "get it" again and again they get to the biggest laughs. But there is enough versatility that mum will also laugh, though not on every joke. I think too many times I see movies that are trying so hard to lower the bar to the lowest common denominator, so they will appeal to most people, but the film suffers for it. But not this movie. This film was so strong that the audience wrapped it around his finger from the opening credits. And while viewers around me * really wanted the movie, they weren't pushovers - players could be among the most critical places. I'm so glad I saw it in a big crowd. At least ten times the audience had such a good time that applause for a joke or scene broke out during the film. How often does this happen in projections? It should be no surprise that a huge ovation took place when closing credits. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to be released on my part. After finishing, one of the producers said they were shooting for the current TV / DVD release. The date cannot come soon.
