Mary Haines (Meg Ryan), a wealthy woman discovers that her husband is cheating on her with a younger woman (Eva Mendes). He doesn't know what to do and friends Sylvia Fowler (Annette Bening), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing) and Alex Fisher (Jad Pinkett Smith) are trying to help. OK - There was no reason to rebuild the 1939 movie. This is a real classic and doesn't need to be updated and reworked. Of course it was done. It has some of the worst reviews I've ever seen for a movie. I like the original and I saw it ALWAYS - I kept comparing it. Now it's not a classic, but it's not that bad. <br /> <br /> ** MINOR SPOILERS !!! ** Bad first - the story is old and has been (badly) updated. Indeed - a man who cheats on his wife is barely shocking today. Meg Ryan (beautiful actress) is pretty awful. Her face doesn't seem to change her expression! I couldn't believe how bad her scenes were. Eva Mendes is also bad - but it's not her fault. Her role is poorly written and she must compete with Joan Crawford from the original. Smith's character (hardcore lesbian) goes to pieces in the operating room. It's funny ... but it turns out that a strong woman will immediately hit pieces when faced with distress. Also, the script puts some clumsy passages where Ryan talks to his daughter about being alone. In those moments, it seems more like a lifelong film than anything else. Now it's good - this film retains the original decision that it will never see a person on the screen. This movie is about and for women - men are not needed (BTW - I'm a man). Bening is just great as Fowler - whenever he is on the screen, the movie makes a big leap. Also Smith is simply fabulous - not too (or underestimated) her lesbian character. The message is also good, but not much. Bette Midler is just hysterical in a small role, and Cloris Leachman will step back from anything she should do as a housekeeper. The direction is also good - especially during the fashion show. I heard director Diane English allegedly had a lot of trouble directing his first feature film, but it didn't show up in the final product. There are also some clever references to the original (mostly certain lines) that have been inserted without fuss. I saw it in an audience full of women (there were a few guys but not many) and they loved it. The film ends in the operating theater sequence that had all the howls. So - it was not needed, but it is not the disaster people say. Also - people say we don't need a movie with all the women. Well - why not? I see a lot of movies with all the guys in the cast and no one complains! Ignore complaints and bad reviews and check it out. With better performance of Ryan, I could give it 8 or 9, but as it is, I can only give it 7.
