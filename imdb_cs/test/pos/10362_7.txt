I liked this movie. Many people refer to it as "Sabrina Teenage Feminist". They do it with a lot of movies in which Melissa Joan Hart is. Yet she really surprised me in this movie because it was great in the part of Mary who fights for justice when her roommate is raped. You could say that Hart was very determined in this film and showed. I also liked Lisa Dean Ryan as Mary's roommate. She was very effective when she excused me for her character after she was raped. Josh Hopkins was good as a confident and egoist rapist. Lochlyn Munro played his character convincingly. Playing in this movie is better than most TV movies, in my opinion. But the movie was quite predictable. I also expected more from the end, it was too steep. Delivery could have been better. But performance and overall plot compensate these problems.
