A really great movie ... I stumbled into it and rented it because Aaron Eckhart was in it (in the company of men and your friends and neighbors), just like Paulina Porizcova ... but that's just one of the many reasons to rent it ... It's very exciting and the character development is fantastic ... Eckhart is one of the most underrated actors who works this movie and steals this movie ... It's very dark and violent, but I loved it.
