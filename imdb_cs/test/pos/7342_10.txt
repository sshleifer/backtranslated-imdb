Whatever you do, stop watching when you think the movie is over! Hang on your first batch of credits or you're missing something! We saw this film at the Savanaah Film Festival and thought it was the best of the game. Dreya Weber is really a miracle, not only because of her performance, but because she can pull her so far above the ground. She said on questions and answers that there were no wires or effects, so all you see is really her way. Addie couldn't get to the festival because she danced with Madonna. She was excellent and my gawd, so beautiful. I was amazed that the film went so well with the crowd of blue hair, but here it is, Savannnah is not water.
