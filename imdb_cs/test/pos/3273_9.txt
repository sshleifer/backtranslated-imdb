spoiler-- <br /> <br /> In 1993, African-American director / actor Mario Van Peebles followed up with the hugely popular New Jack City action movie with "Posse". The film was co-author and director of Van Peebles, who also plays the lead character, Jessie Lee. Plot: The film begins at the turn of the 20th and 20th centuries when the United States was involved in the Spanish-American War. Jessie Lee, apparently the time when the US court system could send sentenced prisoners into military service, found itself as a reluctant petty officer who served with the Black Cavalry in Cuba. Some of his compatriots include Little J (Stephen Baldwin), a fast-talking Weezie (Charles Lane) and a soaring-but-simple Obobo (Tiny Lister). On a reconnaissance run they find a hidden chest of gold and decide to keep it. However, ambitious, bigoted Colonel Graham (Zane) learns of gold and is apparently willing to kill Jessie Lee and society for it. The firefight between Graham's forces and Jessie Lee leaves the colonel of the blind in one eye, and his forces retreat. Team members Jessie Lee managed to smuggle (and gold) back to New Orleans, but it turned out Graham wasn't far away. Jessie Lee and his allies are forced to run, heading west, to a town called Freemanville. Freemanville seems to have been founded by blacks in the years following the Civil War. Father Jessie Lee, "King David", was a charismatic preacher who founded the city. However, as revealed in intermittent flashes, King David was soon brutally murdered by a white crowd, in parallel with the Ku Klux Klan terrorist campaigns that began at the same time. Eventually, Jessie Lee and the company find their way to Freemanville to find out that the townspeople aren't quite happy to see him - especially when Sheriff Bates (Richard Jordan) from a nearby white town makes it clear that Jessie Lee and his partners want dead or alive. Carver (Blair Underwood) is the sheriff and de facto Mayor of Freemanville and his own agenda does not have to be with Jessie Lee around. <br /> <br /> Analysis Action sequences are very trustworthy and Mario Van Peebles is changing in a good performance as a tense hero. In the aftermath of New Jack City's success, it was almost awaited by Van Peebles by following the sequel, or at least similar to an urban-following action. Instead, Van Peebles looked 100 years past, creating mostly-black Western (effectively 'updating' black-themed Westerns of the 1970s), and continuing the legacy of highly-forgotten black-themed cowboy movies from the early 20th century. . Unlike New Jack City, the film was independently funded and originally released through Gramercy / Polygram Entertainment. Attackers in large studios reportedly resisted when Van Peebles sent them "Posse". Some of the "more curious" casts at that time included Big Daddy Kane and Tone Loc as Father Time and Angel. In some interviews, Mario Van Peebles said he often likes to oppose the type; In the years since then, the trend of casting rap singers in non-musical films would have become almost commonplace. Keen viewers will notice several portraits of various entertainment personalities: black-action veterans like Isaac Hayes ("Truck Turner"), Pam Grier ("Foxy Brown") and Larry Cook ("Spook who sat at the door") as well as the stand -up legend Nipsey Russell, not to mention television producer Stephen J. Cannell (who hired junior Van Peebles to play in "Sonny Spoon" years earlier). The film is reserved with Woody Strode ("Spartacus") in a key role.
