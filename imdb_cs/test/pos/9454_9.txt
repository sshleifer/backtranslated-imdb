I thought this movie would be totally lame based on the ads I saw in the theaters. When my sister borrowed from a friend, I decided to watch it because it was summer and there was nothing else. . I didn't say ten minutes in the movie and I loved it. Amanda was a great actress in the movie, her comedy timing was perfect. The one who played Duke was hot, simple and simple. My favorite scene was certainly when Amanda was dating a gardener and a classmate who was suspicious of her, and she was talking to her mother about her clothes - how she pretends to be a guy! Again and again I watched this part ... to make a long story, the movie I thought would be lame - I own it now.
