Chaplin plays in a dual role as a Jewish barber, which, with amnesia, is mistaken for dictator Adenoid Hynkel, (ie Hitler) A film made in 1940 when the war was in his dark days and was by no means won by the Allies. It was forbidden in Germany by Hitler and it was a risk to Chaplin, because if the war was lost, he would definitely be sent away to be "re-educated" <br /> <br /> Funny satire with the classic Hitler scene throwing around a giant balloon of the world. Good fun, but with a message .. a little sermon at the end. That was the last movie with Chaplin's trademark. on a scale of one to ten
