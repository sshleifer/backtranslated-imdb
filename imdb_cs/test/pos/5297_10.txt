Miyazaki Ghibli Studio shows its amazing touch that brings life to life in every little action character in Ponyo. When Sosuke so carefully puts his little boat into the red fish, you know you will have a good time watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Characters are interesting and you really care about them. Remembering visually other stories, Riisa seems to have grown up with Nausicaa's son, an old lady in a wheelchair recalls a witch at Howl's Moving Castle. The presence of elements, wind, rain and sea with its large, powerful waves is so strong that I think that in no other film has it ever been so evoked. It's a simple story, loosely inspired by the "little mermaid" and extending into the heart of the audience, just like Totoro, Miyazaki's second true work. <br /> <br /> An instant classic with a great soundtrack and catchy song during the closing credits. Don't miss it.
