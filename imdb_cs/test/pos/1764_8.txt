Like all the oldest movies, this "movie" is very, very short - it takes about one minute! In short, it is not possible to compare it with more modern films. But it's actually a very remarkable film. Much of this is because the prints were hand painted - making Annabelle appear red and other colors as it does her amazing dance. Actually, I saw two different versions - one where it is red and the other where it changes color. I think the best one is red on the DVD "The Great Train Robbery and Other Primary Works". Dancing itself is very hypnotic and much like amazing performance. And unlike the other minute (or less) of today, this is the one I have seen repeatedly - it's just visually convincing and odd. <br /> <br /> If you want to see it online, here is the 36-second version on Google Video ("serpentine dance" type).
