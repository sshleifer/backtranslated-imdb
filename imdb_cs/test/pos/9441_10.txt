Oooooh man was glad I didn't miss it. I wanted to send this review because this episode especially does what a recent film study didn't do. It's a real tribute to DOOM. His plot is different yes and the characters are apparently set in a completely different universe (apparently the doctor who universe), however the feeling, pace, links and placement are perfect. And for all original Doom fans listening to the sound effect of opening and closing the door, this is the icing on the cake. his gem!
