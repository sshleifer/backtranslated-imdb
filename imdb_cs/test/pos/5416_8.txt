It's a shame to collect limited ratings, perhaps an audience that would find this movie most useful will probably not be seen. Imaginary Heroes follows the life of a teenager after the suicide of his brothers. Of course, this is not the most original story in the world, but it spends a lot of time humanizing its parents, "imaginary heroes" who have failed in their sons' eyes. For teenagers who tend to give responsibility for their failures to their parents but still refuse to accept any real responsibility on their own, the film sends a strong message, that in the end we all have our own concerns we need to deal with, and that we all create our own paths. But unlike other films that tend to force youth independence, this problem solves the problems between parents and the child and becomes a stronger unit for it. That the oldest child committed suicide is regrettable, but is not overlooked in the film later, and the responsibility of all parties for tragedy is thoroughly explained. t so covered - the film pulls very small wounds. Now, why did you earn a rating R is confusing - it is unlikely that you get through a teenager in this era without being realistic, yet that realism limits that very audience. He was my junior this high school showed that it was possible to prevent two suicides. In this case, the censors seem to have made extremely poor judgment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
