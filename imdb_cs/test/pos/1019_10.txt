Well, I love this movie !!!!! I saw it over and over again. It's hard to tell who the attacker is. You still think it's one person, then another, then back to the first person, then another person. It's so tense that you want to quickly move the TV forward to see who it is. SUMMARY: Gail Osborne is raped and left at her home. She is in the hospital and begins to tell the story of how she was raped. She goes from her meeting with her old friend, her teacher who likes her, her former friend, all the other stories, all the suspects. But who did it? <br /> <br /> I love acting, they have a lot of talent. The tension is amazing and the setting is excellent. If it comes to television, watch it. *** 1/2 stars 10/10
