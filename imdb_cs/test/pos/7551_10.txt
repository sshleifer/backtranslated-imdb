FOUR FRIENDS was first charged to HBO in 82 as a sleeper hit. We heard the term "sleeper" when 14, then - I tried to see one. (!) Boy - I was surprised! This film! I wasn't really in love with a film with no special effects beyond TREASURE THE SIERRA MADRE - much less than a "hippy movie" ... but when I grew up with a pair of hippies - I understood too much about Mr. Penn's film. Four friends are definitely of a kind. The script is so personal - and the cast !!! Craig Wasson defines Danilo Prozor so well! He simply embodies the "type of writer" on the tee - both clever and clumsy (window scene ...) and strong, yet very vulnerable. For me - he captures what it's like to be so impressed with agirl that it takes more than a decade ... and I've always found solace in character - and in the movie. During the 1980s, FOUR FRIENDS was a criminal partner - and I captured the film whenever I could on HBO - even though I had to stay until 5:00! And still, always at the end - there is a feeling of loss when all the beautiful characters come from the viewers on the beach. Jodi Thelen embodies the "girl" in the handle - it's so hard that she can't charm her. This film really stands the test of time. Once in a while I watch my video ... or show a friend ... and STILL gets a solid response. I know women who fall in love with Georgia! So many levels ..! Just an incredible piece of mankind for 60 years. Very strange, very magical. Recently I found the REVISION OF FOUR FRIENDS by Robert Grossbach - and that's even more detailed that movie! Actual event data, etc. Real Find! What's more - haha ​​- I found the novel while I was walking through a book shop ... in Omaha, NO from all the places !!! Guess you have an eye for her! When I was in L.A. in 92 worked as an extra - I went to the store with ruddy lil memorbilia - and there was a ton of photos !!! Unfortunately - I was broke and I couldn't indulge ... but a boy, those photos of Georgia and the guys just went over me! I met director Joe Sergant on SKYLARK in Emporia, KS in summer 92 ... and we talked about four friends - very cool! Also ... work in a video store in Omaha in 98 - waiting for a woman who was related to Jim Metzler ..! She told her to pass on the word that there was a child in Omaha that was just fanatical about the film - and got the most out of it. The film again captures everything that is in the heart of Danilo's character ... great, great work --- one of mssrs Tesich's best works and Penna. Steve Tesich is a lot left out. Incredible writer.
