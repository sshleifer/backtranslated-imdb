Good movie for horse lovers and most others. It's a movie of races and it's a "little man gets his chance" movie, and it's "how far would you go?" film. Walter Mattau once again proves his adaptability as an actor. Fits directly as Lloyd Bourdelle, a puppet in Louisiana Cajun. This film gives you a rare look of the Lousiana Cajun horse screen to drag races. He has a young quarter horse, which is a top prospect. "He had nothing but a gas station and a good horse." Bourdelles seized the opportunity to be great by taking the horse, Shadow, to Ruidoso, New Mexico, to prepare for a run at All-American Futurity. But how far will Lloyd go to win fame and fortune? Also unforgettable from this movie are the scenes of Lloyd spitting tobacco juice and waiting for his truck to begin.
