I really enjoyed this movie. It was nervous without being a sociopath. Vin Diesel brought Riddick to life and made you feel good and bad at different levels. I also saw Iron Giant and Vin is perfect. (Snowmobile movie - oh yeah, it's called "Triple-X," or "xXx" - was a weak example of his work.) In Pitch Black, he plays the anti-hero to the max. I don't think you can go wrong when Vin in the movie. Unfortunately, Hollowood could enter him as an adventurous action movie star - wrong! I think the script for "XXX" was weak for which Vin couldn't act. Anyway, Pitch Black is a great scifi - see! <br /> <br /> - Zafoid
