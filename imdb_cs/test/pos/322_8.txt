Last night I saw PECK ON CHEEK (KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles). Oddly enough, it was 137 minutes - somewhat longer than the time on the IMDb. I initially lost interest in this film because the rather confusing style of filming really lost me. The context of what's happening is missing and I'm glad I got stuck with it. At the beginning, the young couple is married and after the wedding a war breaks out in their native Sri Lanka and the lovers are separated. A few months later, the woman is very pregnant and heads for a refugee vessel to India. In the refugee center, you see that the lady is about to give birth - after which the titles for the film are finally revealed. is about to nine in Madras, India. You see her in your house and talk to her about her life and family. None of this is so interesting or important and you wonder what's missing - what about the lady who was about to give birth? My wife and I were debating this and finally thought that this little girl was actually the lady's boy in the first part of the movie. Some or other, she was adopted and talked about her life with mom and dad # 2 - though she didn't realize that these people were not her biological parents. Soon after, the parents revealed themselves to be total idiots (one of the complaints I had about the film) because they decided to tell this very young girl the truth about her parenthood and tell her to leave the girl emotionally confused and confused. Despite the stupid decision and the worst way to say it, the parents agreed to help her find her biological mother. When I saw the impact it has on the girl and the parents (especially the adoptive mother), he was impressive to watch and certainly triggered my interest. Unfortunately, Sri Lanka has engaged in a very, very long and brutal civil war with Tamil militants for three decades. The family's decision to look for a mother in Sri Lanka was truly noble, but also a little silly - when they risked so much and killed again and again, they just blindly jumped into the middle of the war! That was all exciting and captivating, but it also allowed me to think about the common sense of adoptive parents - first you tell her it's NOT your biological child and now you take her in the middle of the WAR ZONE !!! Sure, the boy really wanted to meet his biological mother, but it was stupid in a guarded look. If it was me, I might be tempted to pay the unemployed actress to play this part and fool the boy - so I avoided being in the middle of a war! Despite my complaints, the film was beautiful to watch and very beneficial. Far from perfection, it will certainly hit the emotional home run. Although I expected it because I saw several Indian movies, many Westerners will be a little surprised by the live songs that seem unexpected - this IS standard in most Indian movies - including those made in Bollywood. (Mumbai) and Tamilwood / Kollywood (Madras).
