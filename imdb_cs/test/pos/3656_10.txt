Among the vast, extraordinary scenes in a variety of Indian locations and a plot inspired by Bollywood, which has so far been inspired by reality, this highly moving film is a must-see for all who love romance / adventure. And I mean "good", not Hollywood or Bollywood easy and perfect happy ending. The East meets the West in another film about a friend. The performances are inspired and brilliant, epic cinematography and conspiracy fun, engaging and engaging without a trace of schmaltz or cheap heartbeat. HARI OM is a sweet film that won't stop your teeth. You see it!
