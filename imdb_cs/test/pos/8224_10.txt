Regard of Flight, written and executed by Bill Irwin, is a true classic theatrical project that has a very good impact on the small screen. Full of quick and vibrant dialogue and some of the best physical comedies of the decade, it's head and shoulders over 99% of "comedy" as it is presented today. I'm sure one day he will take his rightful place with such great performances as "The Fantastiks" and "Waiting for Godot". Why it is not yet available on DVD is a mystery and tragedy.
