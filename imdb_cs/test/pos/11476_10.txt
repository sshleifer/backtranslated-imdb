"Sorte Zero" is the # 1 Box Office Portuguese movie of the year 2004. This extreme low budget production (an estimated USD $ 150,000) opened during Christmas opposite American blockbusters like National Treasure, Polar Express, Incredibles and Alexander but quickly seized Portuguese adolescence. viewers. Despite the harsh competition, a small movie has surprisingly well done, topping all the other Portuguese films of the past two years in its first weeks. The film is a mystery / murder with a witty tone cleverly written and directed by Fernando Fragata, who has become a firm reference in the European independent film arena. Did I like the movie? Oh yes!
