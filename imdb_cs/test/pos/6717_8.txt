LIFEFORCE was one of the biggest flops of Cannon Films. It received mostly bad reviews and did nothing to help director Tobe Hooper's career as a result of the Spielberg / POLTERGEIST discussion. All this is unfortunate because LIFEFORCE is really a really great movie. It's extremely fun, moving at a fast pace and offering some of the most striking over-top-direction, production, performances and special effects ever exploding across the screen! It must have looked bizarre on paper: DELTA FORCE, ALIEN, Texas Choreographer Masse, BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S, STAR WARS ... <br /> <br /> What more do you want ??? We have an alien ship full of giant bats! We have a sexy, naked space vampire sucking human souls! We have exploding bodies! We have zombies! We have property! We have interrogation S&M! We got the whole city of London on fire! It's Dracula meets NIGHT OF LIVING DEAD meets QUARTERMASS and PIT meets EARTHQUAKE. It is quite possibly the only worst horror / sci-fi / comedy / action / disaster / erotic / apocalyptic epic that has ever unleashed, that is, if there are any other. <br /> <br /> Try to watch this movie changed chemically. Maybe then you'll understand. Truly a f *** ed up experience, and one of the directors of Tobe Hooper's most underrated movies. Maybe someday he'll find his audience.
