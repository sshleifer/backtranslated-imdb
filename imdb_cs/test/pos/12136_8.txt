Very good 70's movie about crowd operations in New Jersey. When a "maverick" gangster doesn't play according to neighborhood rules, sooner or later, it's time to remove. Joe Pesci was true to his character - smooth and witty. It only improves with age. His face and present fame should not be used on the DVD cover for the sale of this film "B" because he was only the third billed star. music makes for distraction. I'd like to see big cars from the 1970s. However, hearing is good. Anna Johns' nudity was not necessary to make this crowd story work. And the database doesn't appear like any other movie in a movie other than this one. Very bad; she did a good job! Story Morale: Don't "Don" upset with you. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something else when you wake up In the middle of the night, check out this DVD. It was part of a three-film-on-one DVD $ 5.88 special at the local discount store. <br /> <br />
