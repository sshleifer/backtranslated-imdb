OK, so I admit it often seems that most of Sylvester / Tweety Pairs have the same plot: Sylvester tries to get Tweety, but repeatedly fails and always gets into the process, often with the help of a bulldog. I think it's something like Wile E. Coyote chasing Road Runner (in other words, mammals should never go after birds). "All and Bir-r-r-rd" has the same graph and sets it on the train. In a way, the best part of these cartoons is to see what kinds of Sylvester schemes come to try to go after Tweets. We know he won't succeed, but it's also funny to watch Tweety turn into a bad ass (if you've seen his really early cartoons, you'll see he wasn't "cute" at all, but actually had a harsh strip). This works mainly as a way to pass time. By the way, I thought I saw - I guess I'm tense - a drifter - Sylvester hand over a piece of luggage called Friz Freleng to it.
