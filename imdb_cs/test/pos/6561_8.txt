Uzumaki is a visually stunning movie, and I don't think anyone can argue. Unfortunately, the story falls somewhat. <br /> <br /> But the movie is very fun. It uses wild style to tell a somewhat non-existent story. The film almost works, just based on its characters and style, but in my opinion it leaves something to be desired.
