Sometimes it is hard to be a pirate ..............., but according to Miss Jean Peters's golly she has a lot of fun - and that shows, especially during her first place of friendly swordplay with Blackbeard (Mr. Thomas Gomez - immensely hissing) when the joy of performing on her face is obvious. Fifty years back, Feminists seem to intend to grab this film as an anthem for women's empowerment, but I have serious doubts that either M.Tourneur or Miss Peters had such a concept in their heads on their heads. time. It was an exciting, fun family movie with absolutely no claims, hidden meanings or alternative agenda. M.Louis Jourdan is admirable and treacherous as her love interest. Mr. Herbert Chapman is wise and philosophical as a wise and philosophical physician. Mr. James Robertson Justice is just a little less incredible than a bosun. But it is Miss Peters, who will remain in memory. Indeed, adolescent, illiterate, hard, but vulnerable, beautifully agile and finally brave, it's the idea of ​​every pirate. It was a sort of opportunity for her in the role of wild costumes - that she hadn't decided to take hold is a question of regret.
