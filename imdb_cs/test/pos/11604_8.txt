I bought the DVD a long time ago and finally got to watch it. I really enjoyed watching this movie because you won't get a chance to see many more serious Bollywood movies like that. Very well done, but I'd say you have to pay attention to what's going on because it's easy to get lost. When you start watching a movie, don't do anything else! In fact, I would advise people to read all the reviews here, including those with spoilers, before watching the movie. Raima Sen showed her first big performance I saw. Aishwarya was the best on her. All the performances were strong, directed and cinematography ... go look!
