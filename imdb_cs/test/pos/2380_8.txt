Mexico Monster I agree to be the weakest of the modern Scooby Doo movies, mainly because of the poor plot and how predictable it all was. However, the Loch Ness Monster is a great improvement, with beautiful animation, and Scotland honestly looked beautiful. The music is good and the plot is well thought out. In addition, there is some great dialogue and voice play has been wonderful, with Casey Kasem, who was pleased with Shaggy, and the beautiful Scottish singer Sheenou Easten as a guest guest. My only complaints were actually some strange accents in one or two members of the voice cast, with the exception of Easten, whose accent sounded real, and somehow the Loch Ness Monster wasn't as well designed as it had the potential to be. Overall, Scooby Doo's solid and enjoyable movie. Bethany Cox
