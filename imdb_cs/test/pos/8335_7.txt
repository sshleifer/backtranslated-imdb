Following the coup d'état in 1941, Max and Dave, the Brothers Fleischer were removed from their own studio by Paramount Corporation. Former employees like Seymour Kneitel and Izzy Sparber have been commissioned for new operations, now renamed Paramous Famous Studios. Finally, the final product Famous was indistinguishable from that recent output of Fleischer. The current series (Popeye, Superman) continued as if nothing had happened. TODAY'S Subject, JAPOTEURS is one of the former SUPERMAN shorts of the well-known Studio Studio. As it was a custom, SUPERMAN cartoons were a great combination of fine, suitably shaped music in score. This applies to the theme (overture) as well as to the whole background music (random). It was when every short film had its own background music because everything was kept fresh by apparently recording again with each image. As for JAPOTEURS, we have to realize that it was filmed during the first year of United States engagement and the characterization of the enemy was very stereotyped, shortsighted and utterly evil. The dialogue and personality of the villainous Japanese saboteurs was strictly based on the songs of the old magazine's characters, each of which was said to be sarcastic, utterly obscene, because the characters boasted cold bloodshed because they were demonic demons. threats and inflammatory acts against the occult world. JAPOTEURS is a visually bright and uplifting, stunning layout, and uses some animation of multiple planes or desktops to provide real flying depth to its flying sequences. br /> <br /> Utilizing the good use of tie-ins among animated cartoons, then the radio show SUPERMAN Radio has heard through the broadcasting network; the cartoon carries a close resemblance to the comic book page and uses the very same talents of voice actors Bud Collyer and Joan Alexander from the radio show. <br /> <br /> We rate it with *** ½ stars. /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
