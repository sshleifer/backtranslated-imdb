After the funeral, the season's episode was absolutely excellent and by far the best. I was disappointed with the cards on the table, which started so well, but they have dropped significantly in the last half hour, and I didn't know what to think about how I married After the Flood, although I remember being confused at the end. After the funeral, as I said, it's one of my favorite poirot episodes, there with five little pigs, sad cypresses and ABC killers. I was afraid it would destroy the story, but instead it is a very faithful book. Now I will say that I do not mind the changes in books and try to compare films and TV adaptations with their sources, except when the book is a masterpiece and adaptation does not do justice. That's why I didn't like some of the Marples as Nemesis and Sleeping Murder, and so far from Poirots Roger Ackroyd's murder, taken on the flood and cards on the table, are the only ones that really disappointed. Everything else is moving from good to excellent, even the recent appointment with death, despite the many deviations from the book I admit it is not popular, was surprisingly good with amazing production values, star file performances and excellent music score. Back to Funeral, the production values ​​are fantastic. It has a really cinematic feel, and stunning photos and beautiful scenery and costumes made it a visual feast for the eyes. The music was very agile and even scary, and the whole cast gave a wonderful performance. David Suchet is perfect as always Poirot and Geraldine James and Anna Calder Marshall are just as amazing. But for me, Monica Dolan's stand as Mrs. Gilchrist was with me, with Donald Sumpter and Polly Walker as the best actor / actress in Poirot's episode. All in all, he must see one of the best episodes of Poirot by far, and one of the more loyal ones too. Bethany Cox
