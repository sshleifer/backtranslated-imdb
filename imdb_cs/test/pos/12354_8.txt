Sheba Baby is always underestimated because it has a pg rating instead of the usual r rating given to Grier. everything pg means that Pam doesn't take his top off, takes his top off in any other movie she was in. it's more exciting than Coffy, more action. it takes off slowly, but when it is on the screen, excitement began. as Dolemite d'urville martin is hard to try to get Shebin's father, but he doesn't. Wages one women's war against Martin and his gang of friends. the best scene is with a stupid pimp in a car that I am still laughing about. I thought it would be stupid for pg ratings, but I was wrong to replace sex violence and blaxplotation, which could be good!
