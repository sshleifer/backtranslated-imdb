This film begins as a schoolgirl, T'n'A, but turns quite ugly after the main character's sister, who is raped by a biker gang who drives the van. It has a pretty good pace, and James Van Patten is doing a pretty good job in this Cannon Tax Depreciation movie. That was the first movie I've ever seen on Parkway Drive-In, here in Toronto. The main feature was the "Alphabet City", and "Young Warriors were added to the function. Of the 2 movies, "Young Warriors" was far more fun and unforgettable. If you're a fan of 'em up, too violent movies, it would make a great addition to any collection.
