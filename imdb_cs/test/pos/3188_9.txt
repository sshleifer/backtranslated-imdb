This is a very sweet movie, very funny and Russell Crowe is amazing! Those who know him only from the Gladiator will be surprised to see the extent of their acting skills. Arthur Baskin (his character) is one of the best on-screen dolls I've ever seen1 Watch this movie - how can we reissue it in NTSC format? <br /> <br />
