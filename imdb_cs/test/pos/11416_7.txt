Im a big horror fan and I enjoyed this remake pretty much. With all the horror remakes I thought was one of the better attempts. I watched it with my two sisters and I think it was even better because they were pretty scared. Also shouting on the screen "Dont do that!", "Not like that!", Etc. I thought there were some good little nervous moments and put the tension well. Camilla Belle is absolutely stunning in the lead role and a very good actress - so she keeps your attention well. <br /> <br /> A decent movie overall.
