This movie is the smartest comedy I've ever seen, a lot of jokes are either a parody of another movie (from star wars to dragon ball to mighty rangers of kung fu etc.) Or somehow related to the history of anything, (Otis creates a lift) a lot of jokes also relate to the modern world and made fun of it that it was BC (Just like the wheels of a horse carriage) Other jokes are just totally absurd, but also merry (just like the famous scene, with a dog running on the Roman boys with little music). every kind of humor. I've been watching this movie six times, and every time I watched it, I found other fine jokes. (as the scene where the waldo is part of the Egyptian crowd). It's the funniest movie that seems to me, finally a ridiculous comedy that doesn't include a restroom or sexual humor. Numerobis is also what makes a movie, everything that comes out of the fact that boys mouth is cheerful. This film is almost perfect, with the exception of a few clich√©s, such as the fact that Asterix gets its power back because it is a silly kiss. But overall a great movie !! 9.5 out 10
