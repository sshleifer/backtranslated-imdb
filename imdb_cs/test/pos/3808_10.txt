This is a fun surreal road movie. It was written by Joseph Minion, who also wrote After Hours, an outstanding surrealistic film by Martin Scorsese. The film follows the adventures of a ten-year-old boy named Gus, who drives a red Ford Mustang across some fictitious states with names like Tristan (maybe homage to Luis Bu√±uel's movie, maybe?), Essex & South Lyndon. Eight Elusive Motorama Cards from Different Chimera Company Petrol Stations. The film feels incredible because many things are unusual, such as money that is like blank paper with numbers. Most characters are ugly on Gus. trip. They tattoo him, punch him, but that doesn't stop the child from his tireless search. Some theater actors, such as David Lynch, Jack Nance, Meat Loaf & Flea, also perform. Jack Nance plays a motel owner who, when he first meets Gus, says, "If you see any squirrels, give them to me." This is a movie where a man and his wife leave their little children because the man owes 100 USD; and the mother encourages her son to loudly raise as he spoke roughly. If you are a fan of Twin Peaks and surrealist movies, you'll love it. Strange little gemstone movie.
