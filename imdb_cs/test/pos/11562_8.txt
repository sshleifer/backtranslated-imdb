I haven't seen this movie since it was released in the mid-1970s, but I remind myself that it's a very realistic depiction of a music business (right there with Paul Simons "One Trick Pony.") Harvey Keitel is doing a great job as a producer he caught between the music he believes in and the commercial "tripe" that the record company "suits" wants him to work with. Since I spent my entire career in the music industry as a composer / arranger, I can really guarantee that I own this movie. <br /> <br /> If it ever came out on a DVD, I'd buy it!
