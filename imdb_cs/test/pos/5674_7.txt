"Black Water" is a film that surprised me in a way, and I surpassed my original expectations. "Black Water" is a really well structured, unpredictable, exciting, well-directed and well-haunted movie. The land is actually somewhat original and will certainly interest you. One thing I love about this movie is the direction because it is mainly about how it exceeded my original expectations. My original expectation of "Black Water" was that it was poorly made, acted, directed, walked, and boring. It really wasn't. But acting is nothing to praise because there were times when I felt they were not showing enough emotion, and there were some lines that felt so little. But I love the direction because all his shots seem predictable, but not. As with watching that camera gets a slow shot of water, and it goes pretty well, you're like a crocodile about to attack. However, the croc steps are very unpredictable (which was bad for me who does not deal with such films at all), and that makes you jump. Plus I'm just glad it's one of those horror movies that don't rely on a sudden big sound to jump you, but instead a real movie. I also like the way the story is about people who are trapped in these trees, it seemed very real, and definitely kept their eyes on the screen. I have to say that I didn't think of opening 20, so the minutes were done well, and I think they ship a little harder than it would be in real life. Plus, I didn't like the way they tried to make their characters look absolutely hopeless when it really wasn't. Again, I don't think that some characters were realistic. For example, I wouldn't go anywhere near the water because he knew it was a crocodile, let alone a killer. However, these problems aren't really that big, and I was still able to enjoy the movie. Overall, as far as films are concerned, I have seen better, but as far as the animal offensive horror movies (the genre I scarred easily) is one of the best you will see. And it's certainly not perfect, but that doesn't mean it's not a shot.
