awesome for a science fiction movie channel that far outperforms many of the poor previous efforts that I set out. Bruce Campbell is in great shape as a potential investor who finds himself in a bizarre experiment led by delinquent Professor Stacey Keach and his half-assistant, Ted Raimi. The movie is pure b movie gold and its great to see Keach and ram up on the screen with Bruce, and the fact that a lot of the movie works purely on Bruce's comic grotesque playing is what's merry and makes me wonder why this guy isn't getting More of your scenarios? Is it really a sick world. Definitely worth the watch.
