It's so refreshing to see a movie like this with a real mood and personality instead of just a lot of CGI cartoon tricks. This is a great horror-spoof that has true chills alongside some really cool sets and performances. His laughter is soft but rich. Because there is very little if any CGI, there is no need to forcibly shake the camera around to hide the lousy effects. As a result, the film is immensely observable compared to other films from this genre that have been created over the past decade. Today it's much more fun than the big-budget re-made garbage that Hollywood has released today. <br /> <br /> Check it out.
