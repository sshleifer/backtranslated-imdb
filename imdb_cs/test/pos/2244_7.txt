Age of Steel follows the previous episode of Rise of Cybermen, which in some ways was excellent, in others it was missing. RotC had several positive elements, the most important of which was Tennant's excellent view of the Doctor. Indeed, his kind of stupid dizziness carries, to this writer, the shadow of Dr. Tom Baker, with his kind of subconscious asides (as when ticking out of time periods when Mickey holds a button in the Tardis), nevertheless brings his own distant superiority to la McCoy's doctor when around events. Some reviewers and fans, whose pieces I have read, seem a little horrified that such a young actor portrays someone who must be over 1000, but disagree. Indeed, Tennant's Doctor "carries the weight of the world on his shoulders" as he points out in this episode, and one can see it in his almost smug character, as when he finally confronts Lumic / Cybercontroller at the top. His world-weary, apparently perverse kind of attitude is "refreshing," especially after the excellent class of Eccleston's pseudo-working class, the Bada ** character interpretation, rather the action man than the fresh pendant. The best moment Tennant might be after the end, when the Tardis restores his big goofy Baker-esquire smile when the Tardis reboots. Here we begin to feel that this new doctor, a character who is slightly more than the different personality aspects of the average person, is divided into 13 different people; some opposing, some more sympathetic than others, yet they all form part of the whole. These two sides were clear, but weak. The concept of reviving cybernetics is very welcome and looks fantastic, but a plot involving a parallel Earth where this action is taking place does not seem to work properly. True, the allegory here of people's reliance on technology and their need to serve her, as the doctor says, is excellent, but it could easily be placed on the present Earth or something. Some other weaknesses are, as others have pointed out, the ease with which the doctor and the society get out of the tight places, see. a deadly beam from the Tardis component, a seemingly endless series of uses of the Sonic Screwdriver (my wife laughed when they used it to cross a rope ladder through the end of a rope ladder; it was traditionally used as a character rendering device from situations where there is no other escape Some of the actors wanted, especially Mickey, who really needs his life, and one of the support casts, Lumic was scary as he needed, his voice even sounded Cyberman-esquire. that Rise of the Cyberman is more fun, even though the other half was passable, building up what we knew was inevitable, but the resolution was disappointing. Too many unlikely escapes, no supportive occupation, and, in my opinion, not enough Tennant. the show is excellent, and Davies t o takes a good course, but the dialogue (except the doctor) needs to be tightened as illustrated by Mickey's farewell, which was pure ham.
