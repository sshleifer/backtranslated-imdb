This film reminded me of watching old black and white movies with my father. More faithful to characters seeking love, love and loss. Old story fresh look. Larenz Tate was so Cary Grant in style as the character might find himself in a deep position, but the actor let him look silly and cut out like a cardboard. Nia Long has always been my favorite, she's sweet, though hard, almost like Kathrine Hepburn. This is one of his best works and shows that it is better than always to play an angry black man. This movie is a classic, great acting performance, a well-written, real love story in Chicago, what more can you ask for? SuperB Black Love Story
