Personally, I think the movie is pretty good. Nearly 8 degrees. I liked the ethnographic aspect and the beautiful photo. Colin Firth's character is not the most likeable, but with a role he does better than a decent job. Beautiful Nia Long, the heroine, is a well-known film heroine in trying to do what she thinks is best for her child - marrying a respected member of her compatriot community - while fighting her attraction for " bad "man" - one who is not a member of her community ("outsider"), most of the film is about this mother's fight: she should do what is expected of her, what she thinks is best for her son, or should she Let me say that this is a good movie with beautiful footage on the spot, excellent African dress (it is worth seeing the movie just for brilliantly colored African clothes and headbands) and sympathetic characters overall. who plays Nia Long's son is bright and adorable, the story is a bit formal, but I liked the movie. If you are a Colin Firth fan, you have to see this movie. I think I'll watch it tonight!
