Susie Q is original and not like the other bad Disney movie, *** spoiler *** boy named Zach is moving to a new city and has problems at school is a good basketball. a girl in the fifties died with her boyfriend as their car crashed out of the bridge. Susie (Amy Jo Johnson) of the Rangers - The Pink Ranger - Helps Zach as a ghost to take a necklace for the journey he must explain to his sister about her spirit, and finally gets to this necklace, Susie returns to the bridge that died. and then he gets into his friend's haunted car and floats up. later, when she is missing, she finds a girl who looks like her. (Do you believe in reincarnation?) Susie Q is a good movie to see and then, but barely give, because Disney needs to fill everything with silly movies and show that I'm giving it <br /> <br /> 7/10
