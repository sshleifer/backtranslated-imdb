That's halfway that it's the best movie. The opening section, which spoils Hollywood's "social news", is absolutely brilliant. It's a rebellion from start to finish. The second part, which introduces us to the main characters of the story, is also very good. We get a lot of great comics, top performances and dialogue is really dynamic. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler Alert!) <br /> <br /> The one who really dislikes me about the movie is the ending, which in my opinion is in contradiction with everything that was before. My explanation was that this film takes mickey from all the stupid prejudices and allusions of small urban gossip and nationwide tabloids. I loved that the film struggled for the sexuality of man NOT to be determined by their hobbies, idiosyncrasies, sense of fashion, or anything else. And then ends the end and re-enforces all gossip and stereotypes that the film successfully lampooned in the first place. It turns out that everyone was 100% administrative !!! It was very disappointing what was really a great story.
