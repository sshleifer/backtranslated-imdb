One of the most successful shows in television history is back. I admit that I never got to the original show .... Okay, so I never saw it at all. But the new show is impressive. Sci-Fi premiered this weekend in the first two episodes "Rose" and "The End of the World". We meet Rose, a 20-year-old clerk who is haunted by remote-controlled dummies. She is rescued by a mysterious stranger called a doctor. Using the Internet, he finds a conspiracy that warns her that death may be the case. When her geeky friend Mickey is replaced by a cheater, the doctor informs her of a plot to use Earth as a breeding ground for more of these plastic monsters that the doctor fought through space and time, traveling in the Tardis masked by the 1950s. -style police challenge box. It helps him save the world - otherwise it wouldn't be a show - and decides to join him. But when he's in danger, he's upset and asks if her company is worth the risk. Although special effects are a bit flabby and some scenes are a little jerky, "Doctor Who" (after two episodes in the US) is an intelligent, well-written work. The second season seems to have been broadcasting in the UK, so I predicted the same success here.
