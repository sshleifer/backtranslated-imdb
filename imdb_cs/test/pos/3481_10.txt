I was just witnessing a movie that, according to all rights, should be the feed for the second MOW for life ... but believe the Irish to do nothing but saccharin. Setting everything except SCREAMS "Here's a message about what's important in life," but the execution was in line with "Let's take a look at what we can do, here." Helps have two fantastic actors in the lead - James McAvoy (as Rory) and Stephen Robertson (as Michael). While Rory is offered as a close holy - no matter the language and attitude, it is a "life force" in this work and could easily be intolerable in his ultimately "caring" attitude - McAvoy keeps him sharp enough to keep him from being too sweet . But the apparition is Stephen Robertson as Michael. Not since Leonardo Di Caprio in "Gilbert Grape" has someone so perfectly captured a man with the sorrow that I started to believe he was really an actor with cerebral palsy. And his eyes ... my god, he can tear you with them. This film is to paraphrase Rory, f **** n 'amazing. Go see it. Take the Kleenex box and enjoy every well deserved tear ... and laugh.
