Seriously every movie with John Malkovich is usually very good. And that is Clint Eastwood, Rene Russo, John Mahoney (Frasier), Dylan McDermott (The Practice) and many other great actors. We are accustomed to Wolfgang's "water movies", such as Das Boot, Poseidon and Perfect Storm - that was really different, but also subconsciously driven. The killer's assumption is as serious as it goes, the film is well stimulated, some violence is a bit ... But overall recommended (but not for children).
