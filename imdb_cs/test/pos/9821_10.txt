Adult movie, educated audience ... <br /> <br /> I saw "Random Hearts" in advance of my North American release. This romantic drama was a pretty good experience. I'm sure this story won't be a cup of tea for everyone, especially with regard to the dark negative assumption of the film. But the pic has some very uplifting strong points in its favor. All-time Box Office Draw by Harrison Ford ("Star Wars", "Raiders of the Lost Ark," "Fugitive," "Air Force One," "Patriot Games") is at the top of his game as horrified and a desperate Home Affairs Officer, Dutch. Ford's very subdued performance shows a totally sufficient range that can reach class and determination to bring the audience into the world of loss and betrayal. This is the ultimate complex task and a very different type of film for Harrison Ford, who tune the screen with his blockbuster action. Next year, Harrison Ford will return to action, first for director Robert Zemeckis ("Forrest Gump", "Back To The Future") in this year's thriller "What Lies Beneath" and later in the film adaptation of Tom. Clancy's "The Sum of All Fears". "Fears" will be Harrison Ford's third trip as CIA Operator Jack Ryan. Director Sydney Pollack ("Out of Africa", "The Firm", "Tootsie") has a supporting role in this role. political advisor to Scott Thomas Congress. For Pollack, it's a very sharp and energetic image. Not only is Sydney Pollack a gifted director, he is also one of the most reliable, natural and charming actors in the area (see also "Eyes Wide Shut"). Kristin Scott-Thomas ("The English Patient," "Horse Whisperer" shows that you don't necessarily have to be eccentric or secular to be considered sexy. That's one of her better films, and she gives a tremendously crafted and soft performance that works well across Ford's quiet man's toughness. <br /> <br /> Subplots work exquisitely, especially a subplot involving the character of a police corruption investigation character.Look at the frosty and effective turnover of actor "Heat", Dennis Haysbert , who plays George Beaufort's detective, the obstacle to overcome the corruption investigation in the Netherlands. <br /> <br /> The rest of the support cast is a delightful delight. the best actors, and Bonnie Hunt, who is very solid in this production, steals most of her scenes with that wonderful, charming smile like Wendy Judd. <br /> <br /> The technical side of Pollack's thriller is top-of-the-line, by Dave Grusin (Pollack's "The Firm"), a perfectly surrealistic jazz score, to Philippe Rousselot ("River River Through It It"), sharp shots, sharp cuts that keep the film fresh despite the unfortunate film. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has a good yarn secret, well-paced fence, character-driven stories, and romance all rolled into one. This is an amazing story of betrayal and forgiveness. It also features one of the most surprising, yet poisonous, and sure to be controversial ends for the Harrison Ford film in recent times. "Random Hearts" is definitely one of the best films of the year. <br /> <br /> (*** 1/2 of ****) or (8.5 of 10.0)
