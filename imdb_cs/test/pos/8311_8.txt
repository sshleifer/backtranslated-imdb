His fantasy adventure, John Dark-Kevin Connor, was the basis of the Summer Vacation Days before Star Wars: it wasn't a masterpiece, they didn't enjoy the latest special effects, but they were exactly what the children's audience wanted from the film in the mid-1970s. On Earth, Core Catches is just the right tone for suitably named Burroughs' breathtaking adventures about Victorian inventor Peter Cushing and the inevitable Doug McClure ends up in the underground world of Pelucidar and in battle with his evil telepathic combat dinosaurs. This time the puppets are gone for the benefit of men in monster suits, which is much more fun if you are willing to suspend your distrust, and if you aren't there, Caroline Munro always appears. Besides, what can be Peter Cushing's worst performance, irritating, but dottier rehash his movie Dr Who ("You Can't Capture Me, I'm British!"), It's Just the Best of John Dark-Kevin Connor- Doug McClure's Fantasy Adventure Surprisingly well controlled and boasting atmospheric use of color. The photography by Alan Hume, which is not particularly good in the exterior, gains immense control from the studio studio (the film was filmed exclusively on sound booths) in order to draw a clear living world that deserves a new fictional cover. It's not a high art, but a great Saturday fun.
