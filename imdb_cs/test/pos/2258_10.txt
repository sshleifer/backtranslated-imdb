This movie was one, if not the best movie I saw in the past year, I highly recommend it to start as a very funny movie, but how the movie progresses into much more. do yourself a favor and see this movie. I've seen this movie's screener, but I'll buy it not only for myself, but for some real movie fans, I have the unfortunate feeling that this great movie will not be widely recognized, as is the case with many other non-commercial films. Comic, but the heart is a shabby movie It will make you laugh that you will cry that you will think and yes you will think about when its over and not what is a good movie is!
