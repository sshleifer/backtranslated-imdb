"Gay Desperado" is wonderful all over the world. The joke between Leo Carrillo and Harold Huber is just as funny as anything you hear today in the movie. Best line? "That would be my third choice!" "Diego" is apparently the archetype for "Silent Bob" Kevin Smith. Lucien N. Andoit's black and white cinematography (especially with the bandit shadow) was remarkable. All I can say about Ida Lupino is "Thank God for DVD!" You can go straight to the scene, trying on sombreros and serapes and watching them stand still in front of the mirror. Not to forget that Nino Martini's guy is also singing clean, too.
