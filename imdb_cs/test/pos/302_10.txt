I decided to extend my review of my favorite movie. Unlike other war films that focus on action, Apocalypse now takes the viewer into a psychological trip. Pure Surrealism makes the body uncomfortable, but you cannot take your eyes off it. Outside the Heart of Darkness of Joseph Conrad, the Apocalypse is now slowly descending its protagonist, Willard (Martin Sheen) into madness, most likely as much as Kurtz plunged into madness. The production of this film is notorious for its delays provided by the monsoon season and for Brando's impromptu performance (he read his lines from cue cards). There is a documentary called Apocalypse Now: The Filmmakers of the Apocalypse that shows hell all passed in doing this. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is one of the most famous and popular in any movie. As the chopper blade is heard in slow motion and napalm is dropped on the trees, the song "end" through the door can be heard. Another shot is Willard in the bed with the fan, so the noise of the helicopter coincides with the fan. We are informed that he is doing special missions for the army, mostly assassinations. When his next mission is given, he is confused. "Charging a man with a murder is like giving a ticket in the Indy 500." The man he was supposed to kill was a respected colonel who went crazy and isolated himself with the people's tribes. Kurtz orders the brutal acts that these people do, and he must stop me. But Willard is not alone. He is carried on a ship with several soldiers and has encountered several battles. Along the way, they meet Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore "Hoorah" about the war. Willard thinks that if Kilgore is so crazy he could be Kurtz. There are many scenes that display Willards plunging into insanity: Tiger attack, defeat of innocent Vietnamese, nonstop rain, pile of dead bodies scattered around, and death of its crew members. When he arrives at Kurtz's compound, he is greeted by village people and hippie photojournalist (Dennis Hopper). Instead of murdering Kurtz immediately, Willard starts talking to him and his conscience begins to doubt what he should do. Kurtz, on the other hand, wants to die. He is tired of war and wants to go down as a soldier. Willard kills him with a machete, while in unison, the buffalo is sacrificed with several machetes by humans. As soon as they realize that their leader was killed, instead of killing Willard, they will welcome him as their new king. Willard rejects the offer and leaves it. <br /> <br /> The camera is absolutely breathtaking. The colors are grain-free, which is rare for older films. I can watch it dim and admire the beauty of the scenery. The set is amazing, everyone is playing well. Many criticize Brando for some reason, but I think his nails his role as a depressed lunatic who is beaten to war. The soundtrack and score are scary, and provide a mood for the movie. I wonder what instrument they used in this guitar sound when the credits were rolling? There was a lot of parody of this movie, but my favorite quote comes from Marge Simpson, explaining Homer why a character with the same name on a police show acts like an idiot: "Your character provides a comical relief for shows like um, Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now "Those who saw the movie know why it's fun."
