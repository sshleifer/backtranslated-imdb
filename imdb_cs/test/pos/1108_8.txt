OK. Warning for anyone who is a parent or guardian. Beware who you see this movie with - ie - DO NOT USE CHILDREN THAT SHOW THIS FILM. I'll explain why. <br /> <br /> 1 - The title is misleading and the film has nothing to do with romance - I suppose it was totally intentional for the producers, but it's annoying 2 - The movie itself is really very disturbing. I have some problems - the first is that the film is neither violent nor sexual, and therefore is not a "horror film". However, it is a very disturbing film that includes a child and his parents and a small town. The film is not suitable for minors because it contains sequences and images that are disturbing and confusing for the child. He has a bizarre quality for it, just because he has a child in him that makes me feel unsuitable. As a parent, I feel strong enough to tell people because I only read the other day when they have a theater release. I hope I will not offend filmmakers by saying it, but I think it is my right because it is a release and only has a M. rating (because it is neither violent nor sexual). Just weird and disturbing, but pretty good on its own.
