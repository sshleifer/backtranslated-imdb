"The Last American Maid", along with the "Fast Times in Ridgemont High" is one of the last big teen movies ever made. It's a tender story about envy and unrequited love from the early 1980s. Many critics that it was a sophomoric, trivial attempt to restore the magic of "fast times at Ridgemont High", these same critics fail to recognize that two films were actually filmed in parallel during late 1981, and released at only slight intervals from one another. Either way, studies would never allow such a courageous and uncompromising portrayal of the problems that many male teenagers face when they reach their sexual maturity. Especially in view of the heartbreaking discovery of the protagonist, Gary is finally confronted. It's not American pie. The story revolves around three male teenagers and their mostly failed sex pursuits. Gary is the least successful of the band, so LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN is the slogan. Secretly, Gary longs for Karen, who is involved with Rick, his best friend. Rick and Karen start having sex, and Karen gets pregnant only to be thrown out by Rick, who is not interested in the obvious responsibility that lies ahead of him. Gary slips into Karen's help, which leads to the aforementioned unexpected conclusion. Overall, as a film, I consider it very successful as a comedy, as a commentary on the sexual dilemmas of young men, and the remarkable arrival of an age story dealing with issues such as envy, unrequited love, and abortion that are equally important. today more than twenty years ago. Also, it has one of the nicest soundtracks ever made !!!
