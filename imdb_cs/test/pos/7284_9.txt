Sometimes, when you're looking for a movie, nothing but a good thriller. Dead Line certainly fits into your account. A little warning though: if you watch this movie, you will not know too much specifics about the property. The story gets stronger as the film goes through. Really remarkably well built tensioning handles. It's deep and scary. It goes to the darkest places in the human mind. The story also has very surprising shifts. Just wait for the twilight, turn off the light and watch this movie.
