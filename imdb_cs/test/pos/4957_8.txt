I think this movie is actually fun, even though it lacks some of the elements that are essential to this kind of movies. First, when Doug and Chappy start their mission, they start with the F-16B and pilot the F-16A during combat scenes. The second thing I don't like is the ever-repeating F-16, which returns to the right to escape from missiles ... why haven't any chaff and flares been shown in any movie yet? Third, once you see the F-16 almost empty ammunition, it seems that there are enough missiles again ... the models used to simulate a destroyed plane are not good. However, I think that using IAI Kfir as a rival aircraft was really good, much better than the F-5 shown in the Top Gun (but this film is not as good as a masterpiece). Funny movie, I love airplanes and I've seen it more than three times.
