But not too hip. And not too wise. "Judas Kiss" nails new things noir just like that. Great stimulation and nuances of the score round the musty story filled with sex, betrayal and certain fire. Inspiring work all around. Kudos in partcular to HalHolbrook (his best work ever), Gil Bellows (Ally Mc-co?) And Carla Gugino (best famme fatale ever ... smart, funny and ultra HOT) ... 10) because 10 should be reserved for Humphrey Bogart and Coen Bros.
