The Italian job is a real explosion. It's a really fun movie, something you watch just for the pleasures of it. It's not hard with drama or emotional hand-wringing, it has no cosmic sayings about life, and it's not violent or profane. It's just a fun movie. Between watching small Mini Coopers fly around crowded LA streets and great stunts of stereotyped computer geek-turned-cheater (played joyfully by Seth Greene), I had a lot of fun watching this movie. Special Way to Background Music. They have really set a masterpiece for such a film, so gentle, but it keeps you on the edge if necessary. Apparently many artists have contributed to the music, I found it to be the most interesting part of the film. 8 out of 10. It's not an amazing but great movie that looks at the end of a miserable day at the office. <br /> <br /> Barky
