The best thing - and that's pretty good - about The Black Castle is that it is a black and white Gothic grabber from Forties' with a murderous crazy count that was somehow created in 1952. The star is said to be British actor Richard Greene, a capable man who reminds me of an earlier version of Roger Moore. The thief is a crazy number who played Stephen McNally, who does a credible job, except when he called to laugh. Skulking around in the shade is a long-time Boris Karloff in the definitely secondary role of an older doctor who may or may not be the salvation of our hero. It's half of the 18th century in Austria and Sir Ronald Burton (Greene) is determined to find out what happened to two close friends. They disappeared near the castle belonging to Count Charles von Bruno (McNally), deep in the Black Forest. Sir Ronald and his friends seem to have been instrumental in defeating von Bruno's brutal plan in Africa three years earlier, including slavery and ivory. The Count was left not only with a failure, but with a scar on his face and a black patch he now wears to cover the ruined eye. von Bruno promised revenge, and he seems to be partially successful. So, under a false name, Sir Ronald arranges a hunting invitation from the Earl, and we take the carriage through the dark storm path and howling wolves at the Earl's Castle. It is a massive mass of stone towers and corridors, shady staircases, huge fireplaces ... and haunted corridors that lead to a cell dungeon cell, a torture chamber, and a large pit filled with cracking twisting crocodiles. It is also filled with Earl Beautiful, Blonde, Sensitive Wife, Elga (Paula Corday, who is sometimes billed as Rita Corday), and Earl two close friends played two actors that we know from the fifties who specialized in slime in costume, John Hoyt and Michael Ansara. There's a dangerous leopard hunt, forbidden kisses, joints of servants, wooden signs creaking and swaying in the cold wind and poison in a cup. Last but not least, Dr. Meissen (Karloff) has a special bottle filled with a medicine that slows down bodily functions that seem to be dead. The risk is that ... well, when a person wakes up ten hours later, he should hope that he is no longer locked in a coffin. Surprisingly, for all clich√©s, the Black Castle is still moving happily. The film is taken seriously, but it is sufficiently developed to maintain our interest, even if we watched us smile. It is even a reassuring way to realize that there are strong echoes of the most dangerous game. When Burton realizes how crazy Bruno is, he becomes determined to bring Bruno to the account. And naturally he fell on Elgu. von Bruno, crazed with vengeance, but deceitful and capable, is a man who loves hunting and is implicated in killing. The second rule of Hollywood art has always been: "If you want to steal, steal the best." It's the first creative rule, of course, is "If you steal, steal the best and then make it liver." The Black Castle is a nice piece of the Austrian Braunschweiger.
