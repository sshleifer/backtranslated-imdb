The Bothersome Man is one of the best foreign movies I've ever seen. In my opinion, all technical aspects are perfect (lighting, playing, overhead, stimulation, etc.). The story is breathtaking. Behind death, our main character found himself in a world without beauty, passion or anything that would be remotely enjoyable for human senses. His work is cold and uninteresting; his relationships are insensitive and uninspiring, and when all this happens too much, he tries to put it off the train. But it won't end - he can't leave this strange world with suicide! Our main character returns to a man who felt that he felt the same isolation and loneliness, and joined him in digging a stone wall in the hope of revealing a source of strange and wonderful scent and music. Just as they break through - and I won't reveal that much, it all ends and the film ends so strangely as it started. Just say you either love this movie or hate it. I feel like it's like a magic poem - open to many different interpretations and all equally valid as others. If you like the new movie experience and want to be taken away from a Hollywood holiday, try this movie! 9/10 (and I don't have easy movement!) Despite its darkness, this film has left me with a sense of something bigger ... something mysterious and out of it. Great!
