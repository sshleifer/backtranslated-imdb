It's not a bad movie, but it could have been done without the full frontal nudity of a 10 year old boy in one of the opening scenes. This film has an excellent dialogue; which is certainly common in foreign films. Foreign actors still know how to act as opposed to American actors who let the CGI, stunts and special effects do all the work for them. This movie is just a good old fashion actor. Gerard DePardieux did a great job as always. Costumes and scenery are accurate with time. My only complaint is that instead of using subtitles, they should speak English over French; This could be just because I hate reading headlines.
