Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers is probably the best sequel to all Halloween movies. Jamie, serial killer Michael Myers' niece, carries a child who is then taken in by Man In Black since Halloween 5. Some sister helps Jamie escape, but Myers is watching her quickly and killing her. Jamie's kid finds and saves Tommy Doyle, one of Jamie Lee's babysat children in the original movie, and Myers arrives in Haddonfield and starts killing Strode clan living in his old house. The film ends with scenes revealing the traces of Michael's evil, the identity of Man In Black and the close story of Dr. Loomis / Michael Myers. I highly recommend this great horror masterpiece. Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers is rated R for strong graphic violence, extreme gore, concise sexuality, language, and brief nudity.
