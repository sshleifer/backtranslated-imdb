Somewhere on IMDb is a discussion about the greatest director of all time (there are named Spielberg, Copolla and others). The biggest argument was about Spielberg and whether or not he is a great director. The problem with Spielberg is that while he is a master of techniques, most of his films lack depth. Rescuing Ryan is technically truly excellent, but his message is boring, and although it is very fun, that doesn't mean you think of anything. AN is the best movie I've ever seen because it combines great filming with a profound philosophical view of so many things, from war in general, clash of civilizations, the status of a soldier in wartime (is a soldier a hero or a murderer? says he is both ...) and many more. The problem with some people is that they try to argue whether these points are true or false. But a great movie and a great work of art in general are supposed to arouse arguments, not solve them ... Maybe Coppola is right, or maybe not, nobody actually is right. You can watch this movie for its external beauty, amazing scenes, great acting and unforgettable quotes and you will be completely satisfied. But what really makes this film a masterpiece is its inner quality. You can't help but compare with the recent Fahrenheit. Both Copolla and Moore deal with similar issues, but while Copolla presents things from an external, objective point of view, Moore takes a very party stand that really compromises the whole point of the documentâ€¦ It's a shame that a film like Fahrenheit 9/11 won a prestigious Cannes award . But anyway, if you want to begin to understand a bit of the Vietnam War, the war in Iraq, World War II and any war in general, you should definitely see this movie and not the other one ...
