Once a wise man from India said, "They will laugh at us first. Then they will hate us. Then they will fear us." Know that yes, this film was a bit out, but even so, his story is increasingly interested in many years later, no matter how it looked. But soon, at the right time "Masten Thrust" will appear on the big screen once more. Then he gets more than a shock with the new reworked T-Rex. It will scare many for centuries to come! This movie is in the current pre-production and there will be nothing like what you have ever seen! <br /> <br /> This will be out of THX format ..... directly into 4-DX format. <br /> <br /> "Fear, be GREAT Fear!"
