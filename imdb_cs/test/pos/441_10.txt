"French Cancan" is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's an excellent movie. There's color, humor, music. It is a very good portrait of the so-called Belle Ã‰poque, although Jean Renoir's priorities have always shown fantasy. So the film is not a historical film. The last sequences in which girls dance cancan are unforgettable paintings. It's a movie you shouldn't miss.
