Come on. Anyone who doesn't understand this cartoon should be kicked out of the critics panel. They must not be allowed to be heard because they obviously have no sense of humor. Anyone who doesn't love Tex Avery's animated cartoon here should be chained to a chair and forced to watch "Huckleberry Hound" for 20 years straight! <br /> <br /> In this cartoon, these are the best and most interesting examples of this important comedy history that has ever been captured on film. Tex Avery should receive the posthumous Academy Award for this cartoon. It is the best.
