I've seen this movie many years ago, we've been trying to find it, but obviously we can't find it anywhere. It was so esoteric and yet one of several movies that will stay with you for a long time. I'm still not sure what the reality of the film is, and maybe, as well as the principle of uncertainty, is a certain thing. Acting is excellent, the atmosphere is always filled with a sense of premonition, pervasive overall melancholy, and yet it's hard to absorb the story. I rented it because it was science fiction (it was in a sci-fi section with some totally misleading blurb), but it is not. Or horror or even tension. In fact, one feels grateful the director has taken the courage to make a movie like this for which of course there is no fixed audience. I know that some people have complained about the short role of Klaus Kinsky, but I think it is very appropriate - his limited exposure is crucial to creating the secret of this film.
