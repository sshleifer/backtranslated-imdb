At the Phoenix Film Festival in 2005, it was no secret that the film was at the top of the list. Checking Out (2004) brought crowds of movie lovers to Scottsdale's Harkins Cine-capri. The participants of the festival, who were waiting for a few hours in a row, were turned away at the door, despite the capacity of two theater screenings. Checking Out (2004) is a beautifully created moving image; inspiring comedy for a wide range of viewers to enjoy. Director Jeff Hare combines traditional film technology with a new twist of creativity, capturing Peter Falk in his greatest and most sentimental moments (usually depicted in detailed details of the footage) on the silver screen. With its uplifting mix of humorous humor and narrative plot development, Checking Out (2004) is an independent independent film that deserves your attention.
