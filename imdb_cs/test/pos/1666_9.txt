I hear they're about to redo the French classics in 2007, and I see that he's in progress for 2011. It's going to be a pity because Hollywood kicked writer / director Jules Dassin over an infamous blacklist. They should not have the right remake of any of their movies. <br /> <br /> I like "caper" movies and "film noir", and it combines the best of both. Tony (Jean Servais) will perform after making a nickname, and after defeating his old friend (Marie Sabouret), he plans a big score with his friends Mario (Robert Manuel) and Joe (Carl MÃ¶hner) . Flick's attention to detail in robbery planning. You see it reflected in George Clooney Vegas's capitals. Nothing is left to chance. Dropper goes great, but Grutter (Marcel Lupovici) sends his sons, Robert Hossein and Pierre Grasset to Tony and the gang. After being fired with Mario, they kidnapped Joe's son. Lots of bullets are flying before they finish. Great movie of a great director. The standard according to which other carp foils are measured.
