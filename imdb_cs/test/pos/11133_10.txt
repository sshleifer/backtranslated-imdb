'Fame' (1980) is brilliant. He has all these qualities that made the movies so great in the late 1970s. He is proud of his straightness and is not ashamed to be on top. It really matters, it's the way, not the destination. Ignorant idiots with a soap opera mentality never realize that 'Glory' is about the struggles, anxieties and triumphs of these young people, not their careers. Ironically, none of the talented actors 'Fame' did it in Hollywood. 'Fame' meant the end of the era. The end of artistic freedom and experimentation and the beginning of commercialization and political correctness. It is the last statement of a generation with its own voice. <br /> <br /> 10/10
