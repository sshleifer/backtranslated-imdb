This is not what one would call a happy story. The lead character (Edmund Purdom as Egyptian) does not get gal - though (?) Obviously he gets the 'last' word, otherwise the main tragic character (Michael Wilding as a politically short-sighted pharaoh) ends in a tragic and bad guy? even if it's Victor Ripe, he'll win - all the balls. Peter Ustinov may have got the best part (Kafka) and probably probably stole some, if not most, of the movie, with the exception of Jean Simmons' favorite, as somewhat brighter than the average bartender (Merit), who may have more on the market. ball ?? intellectually and spiritually than all of them together. An interested and pessimistic Sinuhe physician ("that's Purdom") is portrayed as a dark, cynical, tortured soul who spends the whole plot? his lifelong search for the meaning of life. (Btw, and paraphrasing John Lennon, 'Life' is what happens when you do other plans.) Excuse me for the lack of philosophical depth in the previous commentary, but eventually the story unfolds to reveal it! And when we speak philosophically, as if things were not morose and negatively enough, John Carradine ("as an unidentified grave thief") appears in a role that appears at the center of the immense movement "Life" is basically insignificant and worth living only as a bad alternative to eventual disappointment. So here we have more than 200 words and I didn't really have a word, so why the hell did I rate it so high? There's a lot of Shakesphra tragedy and a bunch of moral values. There are ethical contrasts, true friendships, true and unrequited (almost) love, and, despite the limitations of the production possibilities of 50 years, it is very well (sound) staged, pleasant for both the eye and the ear, and very well / evenly paced. Is the negotiations largely very good? Given that it is a drama about the fifties, and the interactions are credible until the fatal shortcomings of the characters - which are abundant, and in doing justice to the best of the Greek tragedy. There is some redemption, Sinuhe discovering and embracing his son? He played Tommy Retigg, who, despite Ustin's efforts, really needed Lassie to pull him out. Some other "misleading" souls will only get their desserts? "Foreign" meat Nefer (Bella Darvi) ?? apparently, in Egypt, a carnival exploitation work visa that had previously cruelly even mercilessly rejected Sinuhe - and the princess Baketamon (Gene Tierney as the sister of Pharoah Wilding) who knew the deep dark secrets of Sinuhe's ancestry and then tried to use it to oppose him your friend, her brother Pharaoh? nice people, yeah. He shoots dirge well enough that somewhere before the end of the pix, you want to hit him over his pussy, grab him by the lapels, and say, "Look at the dummy to swallow, the glass is not half empty, half full!" "and then finding out that you are personally disappointed in Horemheb - the really best friend of Sinuhe, (Victor Mature as a Pharoah Top Soldier) for himself that has this mistake in his character that prevents him from doing something positive." I wonder if the secret of the whole film is that it achieves very quickly and then maintains the necessary "suspension of infidelity" and will soon get you understanding and worry about the characters caring so much that they really do sorry and their wasted chances of happiness; luck that otherwise was not so far away from their grasp. <br /> <br /> ????????????????? Already on DVD and I hope it gets repaired soon.
