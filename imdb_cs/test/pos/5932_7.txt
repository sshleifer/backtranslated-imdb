Basically, this Royal Rumble was basically a match report. Gimmick and image are more popular than wrestling skills. HBK vs Edge. Pretty good match. A lot of heat for Edge, which just started as a heel and what better way to go to match with HBK. At the end it was a little slower. Overall, this match gets 6/10. Undertaker vs Hedinreich. It's not a good match. Despite this struggle, the Undertaker had to carry Hedinreich, who seemed to be really lost and crushed his movements. It was interesting to see Raws Gene Snitsky and a little later Kane came to this match. Overall, the fans were more interested when this match was over. 2/10 Kurt Angle vs. JBL vs. Big Show. This match was slow at first, but at the end it got pretty good when Angle managed to speed up the match. Kurt Angle has made some really good matches and proves he's the best wrestler in the game. JBL and the big show have been slow. The end of the match was bad. Throughout this match was 5/10 mainlly due to Kurt Angle. Randy Orton vs HHH. Good wrestling, surprising warmth for Randy Orton, who was in this match face. Randy proved he could go with the limit with any star. This match also marked the first match that HHH struggled with, where someone did not pull down and saved him from losing. Throughout this match was about 6/10. The Royal Rumble match was OK. Some surprises. Some not so good surprises. I was kind of upset that Kurt Angle didn't have enough time in this match. But the whole match had a guy I never thought would be pushed so soon. I won't tell you who will win. I give this match 8/10
