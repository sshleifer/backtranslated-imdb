This game is not the best N64 game ever. Sure, it's good, but only when there are four players. Without 4 players, the only fun thing to do is to take the distant mines and see how many people you can kill. But half of this game are levels where you have to save Nataly so you have to limit your use of the remote down in these levels and it gets pretty boring. The graphics are not exactly Super Mario 64 or even Mario Kart 64. And if you're talking about great multiplayer in the first shooter, you'll have to go with Perfect Dark. At least you can play multiplayer yourself.
