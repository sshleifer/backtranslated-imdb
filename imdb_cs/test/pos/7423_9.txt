One of the most unjustly imitated programs of all time, 'Terry & June' was also one of the most popular sitcoms of the 1970s and 1980s. It started as "Happy Ever After", but when Eric Merriman decided he didn't want to write anymore, it changed to this, and thus "Aunt Lucy" and Fletcher became Medford. Yes, it was a cozy, homemade, something of the middle class; the land led a cliché cliché from the boss who was preparing for dinner, a vicar holding lots of sales and unwanted relatives coming for the weekend. It was definitely not a "horrible lazy comedy". It wasn't supposed to be "smart". It was funny and well done, and that was enough! I also fell in love with the 'alternative' boom of the 1980s ('Spitting Image', 'Black Adder', 'The Young Ones', etc.), but also enjoyed conventional things like this. If nothing else, it provides an alternative comedy with something that is an alternative. I found it sad when you, like Ben Elton, opposed this and Benny Hill. Well, the family-oriented comedy disappeared from our screens, but where did it leave us? Check out the latest T.V. false. All soaps and reality. A few comedies left are aimed at teenagers, meaning they are wrapped with oath, body functions jokes, and explicit sexual links. And they aren't even remotely entertaining. The 'alternative comedy' boom was good in many ways but had a dark side. It made conventional sitcoms look old-fashioned, expelled by talented writers and artists such as Spike Milligan, and eventually led to such unspeakable drivel as 'Little Britain' and 'Tittybangbang' (Heaven Helps Us). If it's not broken, don't fix it!
