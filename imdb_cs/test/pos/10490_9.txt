This is a breathtaking story that borrows from Kennedy's assassination and uses it successfully to create an excellent Western story. The film has a good musical score, even if it relies on the repetition of the title theme. too much. Giuliano Gemma and the rest of the cast are excellent. This is more cerebral than the usual western spaghetti, which rely more on the story than on the action, and it thrives because the story is excellent. That doesn't mean there's no action in the movie. There are plenty of them and it's very well done. This movie pulls you right away, and keeps you absorbed to the end. You will always be interested in what is in those documents after all. It also has some scathing commentary on American politics. This film shows why Valerie, in my opinion, is in three ways tie with Sollima and Corbucci in second place in the spaghetti ranking of Western directors.
