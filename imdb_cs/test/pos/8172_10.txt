When I grew up on Mormon and bound up with the Church's fanatics of the Blacks (they were not allowed to hold the Church's priesthood when I was a member) - I did not know about the politics of organizations that would exclude gays and women until I left. Church in 1966 - (I was 20 years old) I was amazed to learn that friends who were gay were excommunicated after a business trip. LATTER DAYS reveals Mormon gay persecution. The movie is delayed. It is a great job that shows how the two leading men are balancing each other while at the same time growing up and developing more as individuals. LATTER DAYS has a great heart, gorgeous original music and another touch of class from Jacqueline Bisset. The film brilliantly tells the story of an individual who leaves the boundaries of organized religion and cultivates his own soul.
