"Cover Girl" is the best musical Rita Hayworth ever made. Mrs. Hayworth will always be remembered "Guild," but another film should be "Cover Girl". The story is great. It's about a dancer who wants to be a girl and makes him big in the show business. He does it without the help of his talented dancer / director (Gene Kelly). Mr. Kelly has a chance to choreograph music numbers. Dances are spectacular. It's fun to see Phil Silvers, a comedian, making music numbers with Mrs. Hayworth and Mr. Kelly. <br /> <br /> The support cast is perfect. Lee Bowman gets a chance to be an interesting third round, second friend.
