I remember watching this show at 16:00. during my junior high days. It was not a pleasant experience because I remember watching it when I was doing my homework. But the show impressed me when Alex showed his special abilities and dealt with typical junior high problems. But the show was not just about adventures and special powers; It was a more educational effort for the younger audience to be more interested in school and biology overall. Leading actress (can't remember her name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste out the main details). She made the show observable. Just don't do shows like this.
