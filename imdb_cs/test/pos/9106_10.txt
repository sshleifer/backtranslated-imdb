This is the only thing I will be able to address since 2006, and now I will say that it has shaken. She shuddered hard, yet she shuddered tasty. Mr.MEATLOAF added a nice little touch to this film from the film before the initial credits rolled. Now, if he tells you something, it was filmed before it started! Now I don't want to go too far or be a "spoiler" but this movie ROCKED! If you've heard the new album and thought of yourself, "this seems to be somewhat nonstandard Tenacious material, is it like I'm just playing badminton with Satan, what is it?" Then this movie will increase your appreciation for the music and you will be amazed at this steamy satanic masterpiece. For those who want it better, I don't know what they want, because it wouldn't be better anymore. This film is D period.
