It was in 1983 and I was 13. One night I watched Valley Girl on HBO when my parents worked. After he finished, I wanted to talk to someone immediately. It turned out that even my best friend was watching and became our favorite movie. Every weekend we watched him until we could recite him. We woke her parents late at night, laughing hysterically. We started to worship the main character Julie, played by beautiful Deborah Foreman. I'm not saying it's a great classic. Although it is personal for me. And I understand that the whole discussion with the girl in the valley is becoming unpleasant, but that was the 1980s. But deep in the heart of the movie - it's a love story and a familiar but good one. The girl meets a boy and there are sparks on both sides, an instant connection. Julie's friends don't like him - she doesn't fit into school, doesn't go to school, has no money. She liked better with her former football player friend, even though she's a jerk. The Biggest Victim - Your Luck for Your Friends' Luck. And she has these really great supportive hippie parents. It is one of Nicholas Cage's first films and his first major role. One minute is absolutely cheerful and another incredibly moving and romantic. His friend Fred is also pretty funny. If you were in the 80s being a teenager, you'll love this movie or at least bring back memories. It's not my favorite movie anymore, but it's still one of my favorites, probably in my best 10. I eagerly await its release on DVD if they ever release it. You can go to the Deborah Foreman website to sign a petition to be released on DVD and there are 2 movie soundtracks that you must have if you like 80's music.
