This is a very well done film that shows the lives of foreign students during their "Erasmus of the Year" in Barcelona, ​​which by the way is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and is an ideal place. The idea with all the different languages ​​is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are clichés about countries, but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their different countries. After the "Erasmus" experience, during my semester of exchangeang in Italy, I can say that the film is incredibly authentic. I had many experiences that were similar to the characters (except that I didn't get so often). The movie is also quite funny, but not like all the silly American college movies. Finally, the film touches on some important issues, such as changing from student to working life. <br /> <br /> 9/10 (maybe not very objective)
