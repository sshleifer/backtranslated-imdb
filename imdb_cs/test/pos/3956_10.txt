I had the opportunity to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and enjoyed it tremendously. I thought it was one of the most interesting movies I've seen for a long time. One of the best points of the film was meeting new fresh faces and great actors behind the unexpected and brilliantly shot big sites. Three heroes share a screen chemistry that runs across the film, making it so exciting. They are built on an exceptional landscape that is noticed by such an original eye (the work of DOP is great) that makes you feel that you are discovering it for the first time. The mood of the desert floods everywhere and even the scenes shot in the streets of Los Angeles or San Francisco seem to be a natural extension. The story goes smoothly through all these beautiful places and leads you to the bitter sweet end that is the perfect culmination of this perfect journey. The film itself is a masterpiece of craftsmanship. Skilled use of innovative resources (such as photos that sew Danny's memories into the film) will be compared to those that are so rare and so enjoyable. Blind Spot captures the essence of the desert that will take you to a universal common ground where each of us can feel like a discoverer and a native.
