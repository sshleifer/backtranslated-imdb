"Checking Out" is an extraordinary film that rises above most film productions. His refreshing, humorous humor is never an excuse to remain superficial. On the other hand, the film explores the diverse aspects of the human spirit and interpersonal relationships. His warm attitude promotes tolerance and acceptance of diversity and the recognition of what connects all people. The characters are charming and entertaining, reflecting those idiosyncrasies that we can laugh at ourselves. A quick dialogue and a funny joke will keep you on your feet, and you may try to hold your own laughter. You may want to see it in the cinema and then again (more than a few times) on the video and every time you discover something new. After each review you will be sure that you will feel warm and uplifting.
