I rented this movie because I didn't know what to expect, but WHOA was on healing! For everyone who, like me, was waiting for a good movie that combined horror and sci fi, it's time to rejoice because the wait is over. Writing, playing, filming and directing - all top. I hate to admit it, but in fact I cried in one place (when Dracula talked to the maimed man). Really emotional track from start to finish. The ship's corridors provided the perfect haunted environment for this story, and the actors were truly able to make their fear come alive. And Coolio as a vampire .... very nice! And believe me .... as big as the movie was ... the end will be BLOW YWAY! I know this movie is getting a lot of flack on this page for some reason, but I know none of you saw the end. Brilliant!
