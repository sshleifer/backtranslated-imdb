I saw it once probably like most people of my age (55) in the 1960s. Dissatisfaction with the end product is understood by both families. But it's a great movie, it was a great opera; but as a movie it's amazing. This movie should be released at least on video, other generations can get recognition for great music and storytelling. The cast was made up of some of the greatest black actors ever, most of them now died; only Sidney P. is with us. Please do not wait for it to be gone, and the film as a whole old movie will become useless for a time lame. Again, this is a great movie that is very often invisible today, if at all.
