This film was amazing, intelligent, playful, mysterious, full of surprises, with humor in special places and great energy. The famous film director (the protagonist) and the events he attempts to manipulate through film are entangled in fascinating journeys because he is almost a maneuver prince who has never heard of him. There are exquisitely rich paintings throughout and the paths suggested, but not followed (exactly what is going on with the gloomy wife of a pedestrian walking wedding director?). The end is so much better that he's dishonest. Realism and logic are not what you should look for here. If we are going to turn our weddings and our imaginative lives into film directors, we should be ready for a wild ride.
