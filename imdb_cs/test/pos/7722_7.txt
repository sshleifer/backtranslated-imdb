Typically Spanish production - slowly moving, but with great sensuality and sexuality from the main actress Paz Vega. (Watch her in "Spanglish"). Great sets, lots of colors - you'll see Cordoba, Seville, Spanish mountains and countryside. The story goes back and forth, but if you follow closely (even if the movie is in Spanish), you get its essence. The point is how one very very sensual young gypsy woman, Carmen, uses her feminine smiles to deceive her men to offer her. Carmen is taken to jail after she has attacked a cigarette colleague in a cigar factory where she works. She convinces Joseph, a soldier to take her to jail to let her escape. Jose succumbs to her spell because he speaks Basque (he is Navarrese and speaks the same language). Jose is punished 1 month in prison and demoted to a soldier. Later, she meets Carmen at the party and eventually becomes lovers. However, Carmen refuses to commit to him and continues her lascivious and coquettish lifestyle. In jealous anger, Jos√© kills a soldier who was with Carmen. Then he must leave the city. Life on the run turns Joseph into a bandit. Meanwhile, Carmen remains the same, wildly promiscuous woman. Finally, Jose loses his mind and ends in the death of Carmen. The person telling the story is Prospero Merrime, a French writer and anthropologist whose fantastic watch (played by Beethoven's Fur Elise) has been stolen by either Carmen or Jose. It is worth watching the sets and for the delicate Paz Vega.
