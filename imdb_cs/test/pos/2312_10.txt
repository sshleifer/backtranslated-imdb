I've lost the number of times I've seen this movie, but I like it and every time I see it, it's very funny. Facial expressions, grotesque humor and timing jokes make him great. Characters, especially "Nitro", "Sonar" and "Stepanik" are cheerful. I thought Kelsey Grammar, Rip Torn and Bruce Dern did a great job. In fact, I think this movie was perfectly cast. I think it must be released on DVD before I wear VHS.
