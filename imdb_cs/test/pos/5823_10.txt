One of the other reviewers mentioned that you will be addicted after watching one Oz episode. They're right, because that's exactly what happened to me. The first thing that occurred to me was his brutality and unflinching scenes of violence that came from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for a weak heart or shy. This show pulls no punches with regard to drugs, sex or violence. It's hardcore, in the classic use of the word. This is called OZ because it is a nickname given to Oswald's maximum security to become a Penitentary. It focuses primarily on the experimental part of Emerald City prison, where all cells have glass fronts and face inward, so privacy is not on the agenda. Em City is home to many ... Aryans, Muslims, gangs, Latins, Christians, Italians, Irish and others .... so skuffles, death glances, dubious actions and shady agreements are never far away. I would say that the main challenge of the show is because it goes where other shows do not dare. Forget the nice paintings for the mainstream audience, forget the magic, forget the romance ... OZ is not organized. The first episode I've ever seen hit me so ugly that it was unreal, I couldn't say I'm ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz and got used to a high level of graphic violence. Not only violence, but also injustice (shouting guards who will be sold out for nickel, prisoners who kill on order and get away, well-behaved, middle prisoners who, due to lack of skills on the street, alternate with prisoners) or prison experience If Oz, you can feel comfortable with what is uncomfortable watching ... that is when you can get in touch with your darker side.
