In New York, a group of freshmen joins High School for Performing Arts after being successful in their audition. For four years, their dreams, deceit, success, love and personal dramas have been published despite the uncertain Doris Finsecker (Maureen Teefy), homosexual Montgomery (Payl McCrane), aggressive Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray), promising Coco (Irene Cara). ), ambitious Ralph Garcia (Barry Miller) and their friends until their graduation. Twenty-eight years ago, "Glory" was a great success, with the story of teenagers looking for a show business and I loved this movie and the CD soundtrack. I was just watching "Fame" on DVD, and at this time, I'd say it's a good movie with great potential, but with too many erroneous tasks. The story follows too many characters and leaves many situations without answers. I don't know if Alan Parker was having trouble publishing to shorten the running time of this movie, but what happened, for example, to a ballet dancer who goes to an abortion clinic? What happened to Leroy and his teacher, because of a grammar problem? What happened to Coco after undressing the blouse in the cheater's apartment? The musician, who plays the synthesizer and his proud father, remains in the subpot. Anyway, "Glory" is still a fun and cult film for me. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fama" ("Fame")
