This is one of the most interesting movies I've ever seen. Scripting language, costumes, scenery, conspiracy, characters, etc., All this is highest. You won't be bored. I watched intensively or even just listened to this movie while working so many times I lost counting. Scarlett tunes forever, eventually gaining wisdom. This film will take you from Tara to Ireland, where her family originally originated, and see the results of another civil war that took place here, this time between Irish and English. This film shows the double standards of men at the time - a man is still respected if he has a girlfriend and a whore but not a woman. If she is only seen privately with a male company, she accuses her of being unsuitable. And, of course, Scarlett always thought outside the box, breaking the rules when it was necessary to make the necessary change, help people and / or survive. Scarlet's beauty definitely belongs to the bones. Her strength, self-esteem and wisdom grow with age. I remember her lines when I confront too much on my plate, such as "tomorrow is the next day" and the way she carried herself, her determination and courage, and learned from her experience . It's a good movie that shows your daughters how they teach a woman how important it is to have respect for themselves, and that men, especially very nice, can have two sides and can treat a woman differently, depending on how they act and respect. An attractive woman needs to find out what this film teaches. This film is like therapy for me and is better than Gone with the Wind. The second part takes place in Ireland and everyone who is of Irish decency will appreciate the scenery, the people and the character of Scarlett.
