The magnificent performance of Vittoria Mezzogiorno and the masterpiece of Jean-Hugues Anglade will embellish this amazing story of lust, desire and alienation in France.

Unfortunately, the screenplay is intentionally turgid and sordid, leaving the overall effect one with a downward ghost. However, those who appreciate high-quality performances will be able to enjoy the courageous work of leading in this often difficult film journey of Gallic low life. <br /> <br />
