This show is great cheerful! I started watching in 2007 and never heard of it before. After one episode I was addicted. I'm never home to watch it, so my wife bought me a whole series on DVD. Non stop laughter, do I need to say more? I wish it was still on TV because it is definitely worthy and much better on TV today. I wish they had a movie, really, who wouldn't see it. Kevin James's name alone will bring a huge fanbase to any movie, this guy is (make your stomach hurt) funny. Just really good, down on the ground, believable show. If you can buy it on DVD, do it, it's worth it.
