This is the last episode of the Goldenboy OVA series. Kentaro finds himself in an animation studio, which is quite interesting if you don't know anything about how anime studios are run. In addition to episode 3, this was probably the least risqu√©, but it had a nice girl interest, as well as a reunion surprise from others in previous episodes. My only complaint about this episode is that it seemed too short, but it could only be because it was the only original scenario for a show that wasn't based on one of the manga chapters. but it ended well, leaving us with a beautiful feeling that Kentaro is still 25 and continuing to study. Definitely watch the rest of the series all the way, you can buy a whole series like $ 17, you can watch all the way in about 2/2 hours or watch your favorite episodes if you have 20 minutes of free time School lunch break.) Good series, check it out.
