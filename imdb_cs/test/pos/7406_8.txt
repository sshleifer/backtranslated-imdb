This film was my first introduction to Chris Cooper's talents. I was deeply amazed by the character he played. I knew that when I saw the movie that other great things should come out of this talented actor. He plays the Union Captain, which, along with a pair of enlisted men, are foraging in eastern Kentucky. They become the women of the "Sesech", whose husband decided to go to the Confederacy. The image of Eastern Kentucky and its severely divided feelings during the war is so accurate. If you're looking for a war movie with lots of blood and guts, it wouldn't be. If you are looking for a drama that explores the psychology of nations in war, in fact, philosophically, then it is the best study of how divided loyalty has influenced the interactions of nations in border states during the American Civil War.
