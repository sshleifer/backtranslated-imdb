I've never seen a file in a language I don't understand just because I wanted to see the movie and I couldn't find it with English submarines. I don't know how much I missed, but it wasn't much. Probably just the specific details that sound stupid until you see the emotional level of this movie and how the characters interact. I want to mention Diceman from Germany that there is no reason to believe it is "upset" when it comes to commenting on the emotional power of the film. As I said, I don't understand Japanese - or at least a very small amount that I broke away from reading a very lengthy novel - probably my favorite books of all times that I couldn't put aside and take another day off from work until the end of reading! I don't know if there's an English dubbed or subbed version, but if the movie, but if I want to see it. The movie was incredible in Japanese something better is icing the cake !! Slainte ', Maegi
