I have always believed that a film that is a conspiracy is centered around a virtual reality video game that never sounds as if it was something special, but eXistenZ turned out to be bad. This movie is incredible and at the same time very fun offering much more than that. From start to finish, this movie gives you a conceptualization to the point where you can have so many ideas, you can't make the final conclusion. David Cronenberg has a talent for it because he does a lot of things. eXistenZ is pure Cronenberg; The way it is written and the way it is managed is unique to its style and it can only be a good thing. Cronenberg set a clear goal with this film, and that was to keep the audience guessing with obvious ease. His affection for grotesque is not as dominant in this film as it is in The Fly or Naked Lunch, but there are still some elements such as playing pods and how they are made that can pull viewers. As for his earlier work, eXistenZ is more of a combination of Videodrome and less violent scanners, which is quite an amazing combination. Setting the film in the not-too-distant future was a really good decision because it allowed Cronenberg to be very imaginative with the film's surroundings, as well as allowing him to imagine more concepts, allowing less repressed writing. It was important that the film did not overcome and Cronenberg avoided it very well by keeping things relatively simple. Besides, if he wanted to make an unknowable movie, he would know how to do it much better than this. <br /> <br /> eXistenZ boasts an exceptionally talented cast of actors and all play very well. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives a standout performance as a game designer who spends more time out of reality than in it. Leigh is sexy and in charge of his role as Allegra, and he really gets into the role. The emotional range that shows in the film is particularly impressive, making it absolutely believable (if you can trust everything). Jude's law is also good and is very convincing in his character's fear of implantation. The chemistry between the two is very electrical and gives the film an extra taste. Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe are just two of the great support actors who add another depth to the film with very varied performances. The cast of the film is not huge, but eXistenZ definitely has "quality is better than quantum" ethics that works very well. <br /> <br /> In addition to fun and provocative thinking, eXistenZ also touches on social issues such as self-control and loss. This further demonstrates the film as an intellectual craft and could also explain why it wasn't a huge Hollywood hit. eXistenZ has so much to offer, and although it's not for everyone's tastes, those who like Cronenberg's work, or who like science fiction, will be almost sure of this movie. It's one of those movies that need to be watched with an open mind, but it's really something special.
