So it's not a prize winner, so what? Have you ever wanted to see a movie that was just stupid? "The Villain" and this one could be up on the list. My husband says that "Jekyll and Hyde Together Again" is one of those movies that "if you were there and made it" you will think of this spoof for the 80's culture's rebellion. I think the whole movie is just fun. Nothing is sacred; Hospital, Plastic Surgery, Howard Hughes .... There are ongoing gags that you have to watch to appreciate. Saying that the movie doesn't follow would be true, but then a lot of hearty movies enjoy the published words. I recommend this movie to all the old "stoners" between us. Can we be smarter now, but will we still recognize and laugh at the many people we knew (ourselves)?
