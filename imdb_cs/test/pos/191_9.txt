Film by director Michal Kalatozov Cranes Fly (Letyat zhuravli) is a famous cinema. From Viktor Rozov's screenplay based on his own play, Kalatozov shows us the vision of the heroism of war and the suffering of those who stayed home. Inundated with countless war films that show the frontline and massacre, the theme itself becomes tedious and avoidable. But this Russian gemstone shows how the story of suffering can be told in another way; They told us, right from the soldier's mouth, how the war is hated by all, that they hope that those who died have done so because of the cause that will allow peace and the end of the fighting, we see a new vision of World War II. We have young men who volunteer to lead a war for peace, to keep their families and loved ones safe at home, instead of fighting the battle they do not believe in. With such hatred of our present situation in the Middle East and the way people live dying for no reason against their will, it is nice to see a film that shows how selfless and heroic these soldiers are, as well as those waiting for their return. Communist Russia shows how they were all involved. in war. While Boris volunteered for the front lines, his father is the hospital's chief physician helping to repair wounded soldiers, and his sister helps him, just like his girl Veronika, doing everything in her power to get rid of her mind. the fact that no letter came from her love. The whole city is coming to send the boy to the party. Even the factory that Boris and his friend Stephen are working to send representatives with gratitude gifts. Whether it is a glorious view of Russia at the beginning of World War II or not, I do not know. There are no protests or badmouthing of these boys risking their lives for the country, this is all praise and thanks. Some of America could learn from this, because whether you agree with the war or not, you are protesting and doing in their name confusion just what these men and women sacrifice every day and every day. <br /> <br /> Acting comes first, but some deserve to be missed. I really enjoyed Antonin Bogdan in a small role as Boris's grandmother. She's one family member she can trust, and her grief at his departure is very evident on her face and her body language. Vasily Merkuryev, as Patriarch Fyodor Ivanovich, brings perhaps the best performance. As stated at the end, Merkuryev embodies these ideas about fathers who need to stifle hidden tears. She devotes herself to the hard exterior, especially cracking jokes and driving her son hard when she learns of his volunteering just hours before she has to leave. But when Boris leaves to go to the meeting, we see the man's true pain sitting at the table. He loves his son dearly, and although he cannot show him, his actions in the film express it to the audience. Aleksey Batalov is as effective as Boris, a happy young man and an idealist who does what he believes is okay, and Aleksandr Shvorin is good as a villain Mark who has stayed at home for his talented piano skills, or maybe just stole his cousin's love . The love played by Tatyana Samojlova really attracts the audience to her grief, depression, and lean flash of hope. The real star of the film, he has to go through many emotions on the way to where he loses his way, needs to go back to the playground and hope that soon she made Boris return. In addition to realism to the story, as well as the fear of using the tragedy to get the topic, I also loved the visual style of the film. Sergei Urusevsky's cinematography is amazing, especially when the film is filmed in full screen. One thing is to create stunning compositions in a wide-angle panorama; It is completely different to do in a square frame. Right from the start we get a beautiful static shot of the winding walk along the water, the bridge in the background above, because our two lovers jump their way up the screen and into the distance. There are several instances of the camera behind the obstacles, but still allow the action to be visible, which always creates a unique depth and interest. Sharp angles are used, as well as careful blocking that allows overhead shots and exaggerated stacking of characters within the frame. <br /> <br /> However, actual performance is such a long shot. Well used to follow Veronica through the mass of returning soldiers, it is amazing before he roams those who say goodbye to their loved ones while looking for Boris, his own farewell to be said. The planning of this shot had to be extensive because, while it weaves in and out of people, the camera focuses on paired kisses, people shout at each other and all, all deliberately shot at specific moments when the camera moves. Everyone needed to hit their mark precisely and lead to a brilliant cinema. It's just one part of the overall masterpiece of tone and style; Cranes are flying shows how successful the placement and the mission en sc√®ne can be in that it shows viewers what they need, as easy as possible. The composition and professionalism of actors and crew members can work miracles, add something that huge settlements and special effects can never do.
