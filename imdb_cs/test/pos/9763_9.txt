This review contains what could be a spoiler if you never read a book or saw a video box cover. So if you want to access a movie that knows nothing about it, except that I like it, stop here ... <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are not the first speed, but what is among the leaders, and they give romance between them more life than Shute does in his novel (though I generally prefer the novel). My very weak objection to the film as opposed to the book is that the film is stupid some relationships with secondary characters, and among the leading characters in the scene to the end of the film, to give some not at all realistic dramatic tension and as a general plot device. All this is done much better in the book, which means that at the end of the book I get a bit more touching than the end of the film.
