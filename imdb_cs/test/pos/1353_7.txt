The title role of this western hit is played by Robert Walker, Jr. It is a young weapon that separates with partner David Carradine after making a contract with a Mexican general. When they escaped their pursuers, Carradine and Walker separated. Walker arrives at Robert Mitchum's attorney camp, a favorite of Walker, making him a protected and reclaiming project. This is the first of two films that Robert Mitchum made with Burt Kennedy, a writer / director. The second was the funnier of The Good Guys and Bad Guys. Not that Young Billy Young had his moments of mirth. But it's a tripartite story involving reclaiming Walker, Mitchum's hunt for the evil who killed his son and the romantic triangle with Mitchum, Angie Dickinson, and city chief Jack Kelly. The film is full of nepotism. David Carradine is John's son. Dean Martin's daughter Dean is in it, Walker is the son of Robert Walker, and Jennifer Jones and Mitchum's son Chris play Mitchum's son in some quiet flashbacks. Robert Mitchum started in Westerns and always looks at home. Basically, Angie Dickinson repeats the role she had in Rio Bravo. Walker had a short career playing rebellious youth and doing a good job in it. I often wondered what happened to him. He looks terrible like his father. Maybe he didn't want to come up with such a tragic start as his father. And that's not enough, Mitchum fans hear the old rattling eyes that sing the title song at the beginning of the movie.
