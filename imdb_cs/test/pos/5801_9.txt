That was fine. It was one of those we have, but we don't have enough evidence, but it's happening. In a few handfulls of movies I saw her, I'm never really much Stephanie Zimbalist. The professional television actress is, but nothing really outstanding. Here in this she was certainly above average as a former fed (or was fed on credit?) Profiler. Her character got well with a diverse group of Special Investigation Units she was assigned to. It wasn't really a goofy character to look at and despise what was good. Also good is that it takes a while to know who the murderer is ... but when I found out I wasn't so surprised. Oh, good. One more thing that was good was the place in Los Angeles. If it were done today, they would have used Toronto or Vancouver, but here they were really shooting at L.A. I don't know if I would watch it again, but it wasn't bad. My grade: B-
