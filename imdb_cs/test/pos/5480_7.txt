The murderous thriller in the form of Day of the Jackal, In The Line Of Fire has an added twist that Eastwood's ancient bodyguard Frank Horrigan is concerned about past failure at work. The persecution becomes personal, as reptilian killer John Malkovich Leary scoffs at this neurosis - with the somewhat awkward exception of the good woman's love (Russo's Lilly Raines), which wouldn't set Frank's mind in peace before Leary personally stands down. Malkovich is an unstable presence - not just a flammable but often changeable actor on the screen. This is one of his good films, focused and playing director Petersen's play. Eastwood is too old, but a) the audience doesn't care because it's him and b) his age is written into the script, not just in the narrative, but also as a recurring joke. Quite as you would expect, but they did well. 7/10
