For weeks I lost my beloved companion and a fourteen-year-old friend, a golden retriever named Sasha. When I came home from the animal hospital myself, after one of the most painful decisions of my life, my teenage daughter sat by my side. . and we talked about this Twilight Zone episode. I could be wrong, but I remember the line that Arthur Hunnicutt said when Satan tried to get him to hell, but his dog couldn't go with him. . and his dog growled in the gate of the porter, who was trying to deceive the old hunter to "come in". . that it would be "one heavenly heaven if dogs were not allowed", and the spirit of an old mountain man and his dog decided to turn away from the gate (about what they thought was heaven to wander eternity alone). a tearful moment when they meet "good oil" on this eternal journey just to find out that he is an angel who is sent to find him, and "a certain neighbor, of course, dogs are allowed to heaven". I confess that I screamed when I talked to my daughter about it while we mourned our beloved gold. Rod Serling was indeed a genius, a voice who spoke against racism, hatred, "know-nothing" in the early 1960s, and was a deep inspiration for me to become a writer. This episode, over forty-five years, carried the message of comfort to all of us who lost a beloved friend. I urge you next time to get a copy of one of the Twilight Zone marathons or to buy one. There will be some tears, but also comfort. As always, thanks to Rod, for everything you've taught us. . .even now.
