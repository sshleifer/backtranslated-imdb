The Cure is one of the few movies I rated 10 out of 10. I saw it almost a year ago, and yet I remember many scenes, especially the final moving scene that comes with credits. Two boy actors clearly gave everything they could and that makes a great story that makes the film perfect. The message is clear - friendship and is displayed throughout the matter. I have nothing to say. Simplicity is one of the things I love so much about this movie. And of course it's fun and movement at the same time, suited to people of any age. <br /> <br /> 10/10, done!
