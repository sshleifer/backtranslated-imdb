This was one film to see about the Civi War. My aunt actually played Justin and Madeline in this movie as a complement to the wedding scene, and my uncle was on horseback. The script was accurate and accurate. The costumes were tastefully executed, the sequence was fine and even the accents were good. I love Patrick Swayze and James Ried. It was the best two options and even it had great support. Civil War is my favorite thing in American history and I love movies about it. I saw quite a few and this movie and its sequential North and South Book 2 took the cake. If you haven't seen it, rent it. As soon as possible. It's quite an education.
