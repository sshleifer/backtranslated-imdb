Above all, it is a pleasure when the legend shows up to such amazing and timeless music. This movie and soundtrack is tour de force. Ray Charles is unique and amazing. I really loved the movie because it was inspiring and fun. Jamie Foxx has become one of Hollywood's premier actors, as is clearly seen in Ray, and he should be given an Oscar for this role, unprecedented. In fact, anyone working on this film should receive awards. I really liked Kerry Washington, who played an exceptional woman ... Ray Charles obviously got married. Regina King is a great actress as well as the extraordinary Sharon Warren who plays the wrestling young mother. In honesty, I would say that this whole project was clearly arranged. The whole cast was perfect, a great script and amazing settings ... the main prop for director Taylor Hackford and the crew to do such a great job that Ray Charles's life on the screen was so flawless. This is my shot of the year, certainly one of the best biographical films ever made.
