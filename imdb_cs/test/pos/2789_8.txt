L'Auberge Espagnole is full of energy and is honest, realistic and refreshing. It is neither a comedy nor a drama, but a piece of live film about this group of very interesting, but still normal young people who have a one year in Barcelona apartment in Barcelona. Beautifully photographed with a nice soundtrack. If you are older, this film should bring back floods of good memories. If you are young, learn this example.
