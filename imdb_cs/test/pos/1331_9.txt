The film can certainly be a narrative medium, but it is by no means an ideal medium. Literature best conspires because the reader can deliver the imagination necessary to complete the structure. The film is best viewed by looking at what it is: a series of images grouped together. What Soderbergh does in Ocean's Twelve is to combine the perfect film technique with the free-flowing American 70's movie. From recent perspectives, most people have gone in anticipation of the standard edition of the film lie, la Entrapment; in fact, people seem to lack the tiring clich√©s of romance disguised as tensions between leaders and ridiculous conspiracy twists designed to keep the audience awake. Soderbergh's directing bravery is the reason alone to see this film, but the close-up of Pitt and Zeta-Jones forty meters high on the screen doesn't hurt. A real treat for those who love the flickering of lights on the silver screen, and disappointment for those who are trying to make a film that is not.
