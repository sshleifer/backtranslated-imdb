This film was an introduction for many of us to K Gordon Murray's works. That's because it was easy to find. It was on every public label in the VHS era and before that late night t.v. cult classic, double knee thigh slapper. In addition, how to defend the title? For late arrivals, a brief explanation of this is merit: The Florida Wheel Dealer K. Gordon Murray imported Mexican horror movies, dubbed them into English, then the Mint with the Mexican ORIGINAL were pretty weird to get started with; The American borders and accepted horror film conventions were ignored cheerfully. Great, great design and lighting have been placed alongside special or ridiculous special effects. Nothing in Hollywood was as close as it was to get out and out strange. Now, the mix in Catholic has influenced social conventions, Mexican folk traditions, and we are not in Kansas anymore. <br /> <br /> Add the English scripts to which they were dubbed. Most of them were written by Reuban Guberman, who wanted the words to match the movements of the game's lips on the screen, not the literal translation. As a result, the American soundtrack tended to run from crowded to right loop. There is even a Murray fan website that prints the best, most over the top lines for each movie. For the first time, movie viewers complain about stimulation, purple prose, production values, and they are told to support it so that people laugh with pleasure from things that are usually considered fatal movie mistakes. All this has to be very confusing if you don't feel like it. This one was created back in 1957 with two previous movies in the series; AZTEC MUMMY and CURSE OF AZTEC MUMMY. All three are now available on 3 AZTEC MUMMY COLLECTION (BCI) discs and it's time. It has the K Gordon Murray version on the one hand, the original Mexican production on the other side. The contrast between them is fascinating. Many times the original Spanish is not much kinder. ROBOT / MUMMY starts with a nice long flashback that will take you to speed on previous episodes. window in number two, and from there it is logical downhill. You won't get Angel or any mention of him in this last episode. Names, places, even pedigrees are among the films. After a while, you begin to look for continuity changes. So far, the series of villain Doc Krupp is absolutely pig biting crazy, almost drooling with dementia and STILL wants to steal the Aztec breast panel. Rosita Arenas is sent back to the past with another nice finish to the AZTEC MUMMY floor show and goes out into the darkness in her nightgown to help find the dog again. Mum is not happier with that last time. <br /> <br /> The robot actually has a production credit. It was made "Viana & Co S.A.". I mentioned it because it seems as if a slower afternoon appeared between them, when the real costume went to each other. No. That was PLANNED. <br /> <br /> Wait for the controller to run from. X box where you were when Krupp needs ?? The LOOKS robot crushed to death at the end, but actually returned to two other films made in Mexico. . Sit back and enjoy.
