The giant robot was the most popular Japanese TV series ever seen on Indian television. It was aimed at children and we saw a robot for the first time. Many Indian children had to see a machine outside the school book for the first time. The series also showed a child in an adult organization struggling with evil. Many of us who have seen a giant robot in our childhood undoubtedly longed for our own robots, and just as they stopped, they looked at our computers the same way. This show also portrayed the ideal adults (referring to Jerry, friend of friend Johnny and Unicorn chief Azum). We have grown to respect Japan's progress and are still looking at Japan as an ideal Asian nation. BTW, there were no satellite TV channels in India at the time, and state-owned TV stations did not show many Disney movies. I think it was how he appreciated children's series as a giant Robot. Nowadays is Pokemon etc. But they are not as fascinating or tempting as a giant robot.
