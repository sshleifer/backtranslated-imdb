I'm surprised by the amount of negative reviews on this movie. If you don't like this movie for what it is - stupid, over-the-top, mob story - then you're just reading too much into it. This film is a classic story of a crowd woman trying to escape "life" and the difficulties that follow. Michelle Pfeiffer is a great 80's who is an insecure, annoying wife, while Matthew Modine is an anal retention, like a crowd watching a policeman falling on her. The storyline is mostly predictable and cutesy and Mercedes Ruel steals the show as Queen of Mob's wife. If you're looking for something too dynamic and complicated, this movie is absolutely entertaining and a cult 80's classic. You won't be able to stop following if you start.
