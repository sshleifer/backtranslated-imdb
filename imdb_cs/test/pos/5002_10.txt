"Who's dreaming about it? Hoot Gibson ... Howdy Doody? I'm talking about theater *!" [Harry Crystal] <br /> <br /> Nothing beats a big scene ... nothing! And Harry Crystal lives that faith. A theatrical actor awaiting his big break will bring the magic of a live theater to a small town and Artie Shoemaker (TOM HULCE) ... a young man who has big dreams (but didn't know until Harry met). With scenes and songs from many American classic musicals ... Those lips, those eyes see both the ups and downs of people who take us on a fantasy land for 2 hours, but who can keep the magic alive in your heart all day! Like Artie ... once you saw those lips, those eyes ... "You're addicted, kid!" [Harry Crystal]
