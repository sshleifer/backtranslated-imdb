I recently saw the Blurred Test Screening and I am surprised that it was actually pretty good! It's a movie about different groups of kids, your villagers, rich snobs, a typical teenage couple, plus two geeky boys and one hippie babe post. Together, but as separate stories, each group travels to the Gold Coast for the school week. Australia has never had any problems writing comedy and Australia is never short or actors who can play comedy with subtlety and the right amount for unpredictability. The cast is full of Aussie star actors with huge talent and plenty of presence on the screen. Watch young graduate Craig Horner, whose optimism for a weekly party is lost in his friends shenanigans. Travis Cotten and Mark Priestly, who have successfully resolved some complicated physical comedy as two bum bogans and Jessica Gower as a cutie but a confused teenage commitment to love. Veronika Sywak makes her debut in a film debut as any teenage girl dreams and is among a number of more experienced artists. Look at Matthew Newton, cleverly occupied as a limousine driver.
