Well, maybe it was because I was in China when I saw this movie. Maybe it was because I finally had something on TV to understand or at least read the headlines, or it was just funny. Whatever this movie was, it was worth the time. I just came to foot and head massage when they gave me a remote control so I could watch TV. I would usually turn the damn thing off, but I came across this crazy movie and got it wrong. and the food in this movie is a real star. If you like Iron Chef and many of the other cooking shows currently TV mode, then you will love the scene with food in this movie. <br /> <br /> It goes fast and the headlines are so faster to be better loaded at this speed. However, the action is mostly a slapstick so you don't always have to read the whole subtitle to get an idea. The main actress is beautiful eye candy and the main actor is not bad to look at one. Both are worth watching. Finally, if you have some time to kill and you want a good laugh, it's not a bad choice for both. I'm not even speaking a Chinese word, but I've been able to understand the cultural humor of this movie. For those who speak Chinese maybe it's even better. Overall, I give this 8 out of 10 and now I even try to find a copy I have when I stay in China and stick back when I get home, it will be a nice reminder of my time in Yangchun silly afternoon at the massage parlor watching silly film.
