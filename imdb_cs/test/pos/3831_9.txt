I agree that this is ONE of the best episodes of the series - my only consolation would be the somewhat unpleasant look of Mark Lenard as Romulan commander. My reasoning is this - if you weren't at the top of this episode, then you know Mr. Lenard as Sark, Spock's father. And for the second generation Trekkie (or Trekker - your preference) you will be taken out of the scene first. Yet he is an excellent commander, as well as the opposite of our captain, and this episode is strongly written and well-performing. Both sides have excellent points about the cost of war and the price of peace, and are sure to recall one of the best films of World War II and the later era. This is not my favorite genre, but I would definitely recommend a fan of this view of this episode through this filter. You'll see he's holding. I will never understand why Sci-Fi gets so little respect - the best drama comes from the placement of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.
