1956 was the 20th Congress of the Communist Party and Soviet Prime Minister Krushchev spoke with a speech condemning Stalin and Stalinist purges and gulag work systems that revealed previously forbidden information that publicly revealed the terrible new truths that opened the door to the new Soviet. Cinema led by Mikhail Kalatozov, once Stalin's head of film production. This film represents a Red Army that is not victorious, in fact, surrounded by a retreat mode, where many people die, including a hero, in a film set after 06-02-41, a German invasion of Russia when Germany introduced Barbarossa's plan, a lightning bolt invasion that was to bring about the rapid victory and final enslavement of the Slavs, and almost succeeded, in fact, it was within 20 miles of Moscow in what destroyed the Red Army, the devastation of human losses, 15 to 20 million Russians, or 20% of the population . Historically, it was a moment of great trauma and suffering, a psychological shock to the Russian people, but the Red Army maintained and extended the war for another four years before it finally won. During the war, Stalin used a war genre in films for obvious moral empowerment, representing female heroines that were ultra-patriotic and strong and idealistic, suggesting that if women could be so successful and patriotic, then Russia could expect at least so much from its soldiers. Stalin removed the mass hero of the proletariat and replaced it with an individual, courageous leader who was successful in killing many enemies, an obvious reference to Stalin himself, who has always been portrayed in the film as a courageous, wise and victorious leader. However, Kalatozov changed this view because the CROSS FLYING after Stalin's death, which caused political melting and the creation of a global feeling, a victory at the Cannes Palm D'Or, as well as the best director and best actress (Tatyana Samoilova) since Eisenstein IVAN THE TERRIBLE in the 1940s, for the first time woke the West into a Soviet cinema. This film featured a brilliant, breathtaking and exceptionally mobile camera work from his extraordinary cameraman Sergei Uresevsky, using spectacular cranes and surveillance footage, images of war, battle, Moscow and crowded streets that are extremely vibrant and really. . Another brilliant scene is characterized by the heroine Veronica, who has not heard from her lover Boris in the four years of war, so she is believed to be dead, but still loves him, expressed in a scene where she runs towards a train bridge behind her, the moment when the viewer wondered if she could throw herself in front of the train, instead rescuing a three-year-old boy named Boris, who was about to hit the car. The next scene captures the death of Boris on the battlefield, which dies of meaningless death, and his thoughts revolve and swirl in the beautiful cut of trees, the sky, the leaves, everything in a kaleidoscope of his own thoughts and dreams, including an imaginary wedding with Veronica. This film features a famous line, "You can dream when the war is over." In the end of the war, the street soldiers were returning in the mass scene, Veronica learns that Boris died, everyone is happy and excited about the return of the soldier, but Veronica is in despair, giving flowers to soldiers and strangers on the street in an extreme gesture of generosity and selflessness revealing "white and gray cranes floating in the sky". The film was released in 1957 in Russia and, according to some reviews, "the silence in the theater was deep, the wall between art and living life fell ... and the door unlocked tears."
