I was a little scared when I went to the movies to see this movie. Indeed, it is always difficult to make a comic film and the first episode of the adventure of the two greatest French heroes was good, but not fantastic. Finally it is very fun from start to finish with unexpected gags, some cartoon scenes, no timeout, great FX, great cast, great landscape, great everything !!! However, I am interested in how they can translate all French names in English or German because it is certainly funny in French but how will it be in another language ???
