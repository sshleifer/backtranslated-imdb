At the end of my Cache review, I wrote that Haneke caught me as a filmmaker. That led me to get a DVD for La Pianiste, which I finished half an hour ago and watched it. All this was expressed here in IMDb and in many external reviews - a terribly twisted pathology that would "create" individuals such as Erik Hupper, who, after years and years, is still trying to please his mother, at the expense of everyone and everything else in her life, starting with the self. She suppressed everything that would free her from her self-confident slavery, including her sexuality that literally vanished, to the point of madness where she could no longer begin to understand what a true loving impulse would feel. It is a graphical portrait of a serious emotional cripple who has never found the strength to get out of childhood and become an adult adult. I think this topic concerns us all - we are all trying to be autonomous, but there are needs, so many conflicting needs, most of which are not even at conscious level. He also deals brilliantly with the contrast between what one fantasizes about, the sexually and reality of these fantasies, as well as the consequences of choosing to share his sexual fantasies with another human being. Huppert's character gets what he wants in the course of the film, and it's hardly the emancipating experience she imagined. <br /> <br /> As for the much-discussed bathroom scene: I really appreciated how this sequence had all the possible erotic charges (for the viewer, I think) to suck out of it because of the previous scene where she put a drink in the girl's pockets. At a time when the bathroom is behaving like a scenario that is fine, we see that it is dangerously disturbed, and so it's not the case, its little domination with our poor unsuspecting. I think the next incredible success of this movie is how I forgot about halfway through this period that it's not in English and that I read subtitles. This has never happened before, in any foreign film, and I have seen quite a few. <br /> <br /> In this movie, like Cache, the end is not all wrapped up in a nice little tidy bow, but unlike Cache, we get at least some sense of finality, despite the fact that we don't know for sure whether it is Huppert's character alive or dead. After having experienced Mr. La Pianiste as far as Michael Haneke is concerned, it is useless to say that it is more than just a trifle.
