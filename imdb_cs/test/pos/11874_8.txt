One night at McCool is a very fun movie that is smarter than what it should be. Its form is more sophisticated than what I expected, and its randomness was excellent. Thoughts behind the film (mysogens, sadism, stupid men) are infantile. This is what I have to say about this film, that not only do they hate women but also hate men. It really has no sympathy for any of the men. It seems that is because of the form, but the end says everything. Nobody cares. The form has the first 2/3 of the movie that appeared in three flashbacks: Dillon, a stupid bartender; Reiser, a mysogenistic stupid lawyer; and Goodman, the stupid cop. The story is therefore always reversed by its own images and change of reality. Reis's BBQ fantasy is a great touch. In the end we never knew the truth and nothing is what it seems. Dillon has never been so innocent, etc. <br /> <br /> In fact, the rest of the movie is funny too. From the randomness of the last 5 seconds of the film to the too obvious manipulation of Tyler, the film seems to have its own energy. Everything is blue and nothing makes sense. We don't really care if we do? No. It's also a very dark comedy, but it has a shallow presentation. You think it's sister Betty or Jawbreaker. Outside covered with candy, inside a dark chewy. If you like your movies random, dark, or just pure, check out this movie. He will satisfy your cravings for a strange night at McCool's. <br /> <br /> 8/10
