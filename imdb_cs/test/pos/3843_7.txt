After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in two packs with The Fox in the chase, I decided to buy it because both of these movies were popular kids. Aristocats is definitely a classic. It doesn't have to be a five-star classic, but it's a fun movie and makes good evening entertainment. It's a little light snack from the darker, more serious Disney classics. Aristocats are trying to be a jolly musical comedy, and I think it's just about success. The plot doesn't make much sense, and I don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it's definitely not weak. Animations and backgrounds are a little scratched in places that are typical of Disney's' 70s movies, but they have a rustic, old-fashioned charm. The strongest points of Aristocats are characters, music and music. humor. Music is very unforgettable - try to get "Everyone wants to be a cat" from the head in a hurry! The songs are written by Sherman Brothers, who also made music for The Jungle Book. It was one song called "She never felt alone", which will appear in the film, but unfortunately did not get to the finals. It's a shame, because I think it would fit very well. <br /> <br /> Characters are unforgettable. Thomas O'Malley is voiced by Phil Harris, and is basically Baloo in cat form. Eva Gabor gives the Duchess this warm and maternal feeling, and the voices of her kittens are actually like children, not an actor imitating the baby's voice. Secondary characters are a dozen, yet you still understand their personalities. Edgar, the "villain" servant plays a similar role as Cruella De Vil, but is more comical than scary, often ending in fun situations. Even if he's a bad guy, he's still as nice. Both British Geese - Abigail and Amelia really ran me along with their crazy (and drunk) uncle. I also like dogs who tend to argue who the "leader" is. I could go on, but I won't spoil it. But I can tell you that Aristocats is entertaining and entertaining, without having to resort to basic humor for toilets. Bottom Line - Aristocats may not be Disney's crown achievement or their strongest movie since the 1970s (the price is a tie between the rescuers and the many Whinnie Pooh adventures). But it is a nice amusement park and it is definitely fun. If you're looking for a dazzling work of art, you might be better off watching Bambi. But if you want a fun night, Aristocats is the way. It's a charming and cute movie and it's impossible to dislike it. Enjoy! (And besides, it's good to have a movie where cats aren't considered villains).
