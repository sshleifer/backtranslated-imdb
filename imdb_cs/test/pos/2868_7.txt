This is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Haunted abandoned house, interesting characters, gore and twisted plot. Who could ask for more in a horror movie? This is largely predictable, but then most of the horrors are found within the first 10 minutes, so I won't hold it against it. Music, camera angles and so on are excellent. The sets are well made and convincing. There were almost no subplots however, that being a horror too many alternate plots just takes away from what he wanted from horror anyway ... Being scared ... This keeps it pretty simple and does just that. If I compared it to any other film, I would say it reminded me of a remake of the Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Certainly a horror lover must be seen.
