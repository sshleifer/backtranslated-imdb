"How can your name, not even your real name, break your heart?" Here's how. There were a few film versions of the celebrated novel that made better justice to their source material than Anthony Minghella's film Cold Mountain by Charles Frazier. If you have read the book, you will feel that most of the main scenes were shaking again. I have personally read a novel several times and spent most of the evening watching the film through tears. Stunning range, beautiful words, great acting and great music. In an interview on the DVD accompanying Minghella, he talks about several layers of the story. They all work. One of the best movies I've seen and invited to one of the greatest novels of the past ten years.
