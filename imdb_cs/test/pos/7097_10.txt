This movie was a very good Universal Monster movie. Again, Lon Chaney appears as The Wolfman and Glenn Strange as Frankenstein's Monster. Yeah, that jerk John Carradine is like Dracula again. I love every actor in this movie. I especially liked Onslow Stevens as Dr. Edelmann. I thought it was a good idea to keep the good doctor he denounced as Talbot. One scene I think is very good is the scene where Dr. Edelmann wonders how he changes. Everything that troubles him flashes in front of his eyes. A good doctor says no, while his evil side says yes. That's the only reason I didn't want this film to completely disappear from the film. I thought Dracula had no business in the House of Frankenstein. If his character was eliminated, he wouldn't miss it. In this film, the blood of the doctor is contaminated by Dracula, which gives him a Jekyll and a Hyde curse. I hate John Carradin and I don't think he should ever play Dracula. I didn't mind the other actors playing Frankenstein Monster after the great Karloff because they all did a good job. But when they get another actor to play Dracula, he stops there. John Carradine thought he was so tall and powerful. They offered him the role of Frankenstein Monster once and he refused because he thought he was too trained. I could only imagine Carradine playing The Monster, who would argue with the director on stage: "I don't have to take it from you, I made Shakespeare." John Carradine wasn't Dracula and he would never be. I'm sorry, John, Bela Lugosi is the only Dracula. Thank God they got Bela to come back as Dracula for Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie. You will not disappoint you and enjoy it as you did it. This is a very good addition to monster movies. If you are a collector, remember to leave this option out. <br /> <br />
