Fire on the Plane (1959) **** <br /> <br /> You don't see such movies anymore. 'Fires on the Plane' is an incredible depiction of the lives of Japanese Army soldiers. Kon Ichikawa's masterpiece follows Tamura, a soldier with tuberculosis, while he wanders the Philippine landscape in the final year of the war. His commanding officer is sent away to the hospital just to be refused treatment, so he is sent back. His CO tells him to come back, and if he refuses, his last order is to kill with his grenade. He is refused again, but meets a squatter band outside the hospital. The next day they are protected by US troops, and Tamura is fleeing, deciding not to kill himself, and from there he goes from where he tries to get to Palompon. They find out that some men ate the human body to survive, while others do so much tobacco as much as they can get back. devastation, with a hint of madness. Everyone we see is skin and bones, covered with dirt wearing ragged and ragged rags. Ichikawa uses her camera to capture the beautiful shots of a ruined landscape and Japanese soldiers walking around her. Kon Ichikawa was famous in Japan for making many comedies and satir, and there are moments in fires on the plain that are scathingly merry. For example, take a look at what appears to be a dead man lying face down in a pool of water; the soldier walks, but asks himself if it all ends, to which one lifts his head out of the water and answers "what was that?" and then the face goes deeper into the puddle than before. Another cheerful sequence includes one man who finds a pair of shoes on the trail. He takes shoes and replaces them with his old ones. Another man walks and sees the pair of shoes and switches to his old shoes. The scene continues until Tamura finally finds a place of exchange and examines the shoes that are left with almost no soles. She looks closely at herself and at those on the ground, and decides that they are both hoods, that she takes off her own and goes barefoot. The film is full of incredible scenes, one by one. Like Mizoguchi and Kurosawa, Ichikawa knew how to use her camera to paint beautiful and stunning images. There are many overwhelming shots of men in barren empty plains surrounded by nothing but smoke in the air and dead or dying bodies on the broken ground. There is another incredible scene where dozens of Japanese soldiers try to cross the road guarded by Yanks in the middle of the night, all crawling on their hands and knees as the camera watches from above. The film gets its name from the columns of smoke rising from the plains fires that appear throughout the film. They represent a little more ordinary life for soldiers; the lives of Japanese farmers back home to the burning husks of corn. But their beacons of hope for normal life are in enemy hands. The film caused a commotion in its day with its graphic content. Great emphasis is put on the horror of war, not just the enemy, but in your ranks and yourself. Kon Ichikawa's Plains Fire is an incredibly authentic and moving, and somewhat disturbing, portrait of the horror suffered by the men forming the lower ranks of the Imperial Army. The letters to Clint Eastwood of Iwo Jima, although a very good movie, are nowhere near to realize the horror of war shown in the fires on the plain. (Eastwood was undoubtedly influenced by the film when he saw that he was such a classic Japanese film enthusiast.) Many war movies show that war is the eyes of the victors in hell. In the fires on the plain, we have shown that the war is even more hellish when you are at the end of the defeat <br /> <br /> 4/4
