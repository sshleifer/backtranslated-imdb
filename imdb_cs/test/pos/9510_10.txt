It's the best movie I've seen this year! Great detail and story (for remake). It presents you with a "what if" situation where the island of Japan could be completely destroyed from this country. The idea of ​​a provocative, life and deadly situation and not to mention life on Earth (in this particular Japan). It also represents a great and ingenious solution to this massive tragedy. Horror, action, tension, science fiction, documentary, love story and all the stories of human interest you can get here! But I also warn you that this is a real tearjerker! Casts, actors and everyone are excellent, better than any Hollywood movie! The thing is ... this could happen anywhere in the world! Let me ask you about this after you saw it ... "What would you do if you were in this life and death situation"?
