As one of the other reviewers (maybe @ Amazon), I was first introduced to the Tourist Trap by a beloved, crumbled old WOR-9 in New York, circa January 1983. Devil Dog: The Hound of Hell, which I was waiting to see because he made his debut on Halloween 1978, he just finished, and I thought I should fill my horror stuff (stop laughing - that three eyes of "Borgost" (sp?) monster Ike Eisenmann in his room) scary) all day long . For Richard Cren, wearing his horror hat for television, it was the first 10 minutes of the hiking trail that followed Devil Doga that day. tag - and months later, it ended up being the first movie I ever recorded from television. WOR played it quite often, often as a Saturday afternoon Million Dollar Movie, as others watched. It is one of those offers that provide a strong horror strike forward, a real left hook - and then virtually starts again with the rest of the cast, dance and strikes. a true peak (see Night of the Living Dead, Re Animator). Two paragraphs and I didn't mention one mannequin. Face to face - those damn things are pretty scary, without music and script. I also remember some scary clothes and stuff in the attics and cellars of different relatives and tell you what you like about how relatively straightforward Schmoeller and Carroll's approach - nobody, before or since, has played so well. In real life, a good mannequin will do double - and here, this is the last thing you'll probably see if you happen to be stuck at Slausen's defunct wax museum and road stand. Yes, there is a point ("I loved her too") where Chuck "Slausen" Connors tries to hand over Vincent Price. Yes, the plot could begin in the first phase; I don't see the script that's so powerful. No matter. From direction to competent acting (Meryl Streep does not participate strongly, and here, it helps instead of obstacles), to another useful and effective score by Pino Dinaggio (see Carrie and various other films de Palma), to various lighting, film warehouses, the use of different levels sound ... I could go on - every element of this low budgeting will come together and get a job much larger than the sum of its parts. Did I mention that it's a scary Hell? Stephen King spoke about this film in Danse Macabre a year or so after its release, and with good reason. Like most of his work, it may not be a great art, but it certainly tells a scary story and does it well. The rest of the cast may be relatively unknown (wasn't Jocelyn Jones in that Texas chase movie?), But Chuck Connors and Tanya Roberts were and are, so well, familiar with the audience to think - Stephen King's style - it could happen to you or to people you know. Comparison with psycho and chainsaw massacre in Texas (overall look and feel), though not the first associations in my mind. I just wish I could comment on a DVD that I look forward to buying, because the Tourist Trap has become notoriously difficult to access on video since the almost complete disappearance of independent video stores, where it was home away from WOR and cables. in the 1980s (although TMC / Showtime seems to have picked it up and play it regularly now). No, no spoilers, I'm afraid no conspiracy breakdown - go see it yourself (all right, there may be a small little underneath it, so move if you want - better than sorry). The mannequins are damn scary and I'd rather show up before I say ... :) <br /> <br /> For the record, the tourist paste is also full of full lines. How do I see what I am watching?! "" you are so nice "," you can't hurt me "," I shouldn't hide it - it's good! " "(Listen that Vincent Price distorts again), the inevitable" you are crazy! "(delivered at the right moment and in the right tone) ... and try - just try - keep your hair down when you hear the mannequin head shouting "Molly! - especially when you realize which head it was ... :) <br /> <br /> PS ... Charles Band was a producer, I think, and probably owned the rights to Dinaggio's music. What I understand was the Full Moon Entertainment entertainment that could explain the subsequent use of music in a puppet master, so well, the 40 commercial approach characterized Full Moon throughout, from the pleasing franchise puppets to the ... Trancers and Bad Channels (Sorry BOC).
