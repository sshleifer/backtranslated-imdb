I couldn't completely block this movie from memory, even though it's been two years since I saw it. Don't get me wrong - I forgot the storyline for a long time - The relationship between Kidman and the law that made no impression on me, but it was a scene of torture in a movie that really hit me. I cried for about two hours in the wards. Never before had it occurred to me how people at war could use something as pure as mother's love. Here are some examples - both in the scenes with Natalie Portman, and with her mother's fingers in the fence to keep her son at home. I was shocked in these scenes and I will probably never see it again as a result, because the scenes are now quite clear in my mind. However, I am glad to have watched the film simply because I realized the horrors of war and the terrible cruelty that humanity can cause on its own. The blond albino character was on the top of my worst bad guy list ever since I saw the movie. His horrible smirks and lack of human feeling for the people they tortured really hit me. At one point I wanted to get up in the cinema and kill him myself (see the movie moved me to the edge of my mind, until later I thought I was just hit a big screen - that shows the power of the movie and minimally). I recommend the movie for his complete experience not for the intertwined love story, but for the way he recounts war without the need for a battlefield.
