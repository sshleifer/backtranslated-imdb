This movie was better than I expected. However, I do not think that he deserves a rating of R. I have seen PG-13 movies with worse language and violence. I found this movie amusing and am having fun. If you're a person who discusses everything, you can find it a lot wrong, but if you take it at its face value, I think you'll find it fun.
