This is a great horror movie for people who don't want all the twists and stunts. This film has the same amount of horror, tension, humor and even a little light nudity, but nothing big. Linnea Quigley is not on top because she was in "The Return of the Living Dead" where she danced naked on the crypt, but she is still basically the same slutty character. Cathy Podewell is a virgin and chaste character before joining "Dallas", and we are also familiar with Amelia [early Mimi] Kinkade, the sexy and sinister-dark house matron. As she and Linnea are obsessed with taking over the house, they revitalize the bodies of their dead friends to scare the survivors' limits. I've heard a lot of people compare this movie to "The Evil Dead," but if anything, this movie is a rival to just like Freddie competing with Jason.
