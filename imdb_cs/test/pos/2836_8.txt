Published in 1951, this film has the usual features typical of western games released in the 1950s; the cavalry needed to protect the territory from the murderous group of Indians, an officer to see this task, and men with it with various sign defects, which they had to unite into a cohesive unit. This little band has to hold a fortress that is close to the Indian village when reinforcements arrive. Indians know that a small group is immature and could be destroyed before the aid comes. One major difference for this film, "Just Valiant", is that it attempts to play the usual story, but at the same time, deliver the message that duty is a major concern to be shared by all, even if they do it. t accept that charge. Gregory Peck embodies the tightly-lipped captain of the troops to prevent the Indians from falling apart. The soldiers to take with him to the small base are the ruins of the army in the fortress; they, in turn, have the grip or weakness that makes them wonder if the captain has taken them because of their general lack of loyalty. Finally, the captain and the small band face enemies while confronting their own mistakes. The cast includes Western stalwarts such as Ward Bond, Gig Young, Neville Brand, Lon Chaney, Jr., and Warner Anderson. Sleeping movie and good solid western for fans of this genre.
