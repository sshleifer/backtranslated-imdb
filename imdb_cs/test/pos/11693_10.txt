That was a great movie! I saw it at the Karlovy Vary IFF in the Czech Republic and won a prize there. This is the first movie I've ever seen from Jan (director), and I was impressed. It's a great story about love and family. The film has a great balance between comedy, romance, drama and tension in one. I'm not going to give out any conspiracy, but this is a well-made film, and if I had a chance! The film / cut is great, the movie just flows, and the characters are warm, and they are the kind that can relate. I hope you like this movie. If anyone knows where I can find it in the United States, or if they plan to release it on DVD at any time, please let me know!
