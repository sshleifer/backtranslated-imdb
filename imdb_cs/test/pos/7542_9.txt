A really fun British comedy from the mid-1950s about a school for girls. Girls are all involved in disaster and chaos, making a gin bath, smoking and gambling. Alastair Sim plays director Millicent in a famous drag role, as does Millicent's brother. A female policeman goes to a secret school to find out what's going on. This movie is funny, has a great gag look and Alastair Sim is great. Just classic British comedy, a lot of fun and not too much crime. Joan Sims and Sid James, stars of many Carry On movies, play small roles, but this movie is about girls. It spawned 3 sequels and recent re-do. Watch and enjoy where it all started.
