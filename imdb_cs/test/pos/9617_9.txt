I was first introduced in this movie while in San Antonio, Tx. This movie was second. in double function. Unfortunately, the theater where I saw it was destroyed. Anyway, Five Fingers of Death (aka: King Boxer) was released in 1972 and introduced in the US the following year. Like a lot of "other" Kung Fu movies released while riding the "tail-tails" Enter the Dragon, this particular movie was really good. It is the story of a country boy who is sent to a martial arts institute to improve himself and his combat skills. Meanwhile, "opponent" martial arts schools plans and scheme to thwart our hero, using dirty tactics to try to blow him off the track and try to prevent him from participating in the tournament. Surprisingly, I thought, because Warner Bros. distributed this movie in the US, Warner Bros. will release a DVD. It never happened. As far as I know, this movie was released in English and Cantonise, w / sub-titles ..... the other "cleaner and brighter" version. Although combat sequences are a little fun to watch (ie, flying in the air and hitting, jumping on buildings, fighter using the head ... literally .... hit your opponent, etc.), however, it's a classic action kung fu wonderfully planned and executed. If you like Enter the Dragon, five fingers of death would be an excellent addition to any movie collection ..... if you find it.
