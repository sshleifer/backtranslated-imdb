I was very disappointed when this show was canceled. Although I can't vote. I live on the island of Aruba. I sat down on Tuesday to see the show. And it was very surprising that it was not broadcast. The next day I read on the Internet that it was canceled. It is true that not everyone was as talented as the other. But there were very talented people who sang. <br /> <br /> I find it very sad. That they worked so hard and where dreams came together. It's a shame <br /> <br /> Ariette Croes
