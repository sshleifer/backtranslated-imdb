This film is a story of a Catholic nun as a counselor of a convicted murderer on the death row. The film describes what she does as a nun who has no productive role. Perhaps she had doubts about her real role. But in the end he does a role that only a nun who has nothing but faith in Christ could do. There are so many movies in America that describe convicted criminals or jails. These scenes, especially designs, are too different from Japan.
