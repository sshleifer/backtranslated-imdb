Frankly, this is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. I was fascinated by the story, petrified by Captain Howdy and at the edge of my seat for the whole ride. I don't really understand all the negative reviews. <br /> <br /> The settings have been discussed in depth; Captain Howdy is an online predator who meets teenagers, kidnapped them and introduced them to his favorite body modification and body piercing fun. Dee Snider is Captain Howdy and is one of the most horrible psychopaths they have ever created; perhaps the most frightening, because it is so human and you will get meaning (especially if you are in the body modification at all) that there are really such people in the world. The biggest reason I enjoyed the movie and why it's so horrible is that Captain Howdy becomes a hero. At the beginning of the film, roles are clear; the victims are innocent, the cop is a good man, and Howdy is pure evil. But the second act changed things a little. You want Howdy to be evil, but it turns out it's just a victim of circumstances and maybe not good or bad. It's scary to find a cheering for a "bad" guy. A few people mentioned that Strangeland should be split into two separate movies. Sure, there are definitely two separate "acts", but this movie works so well because two acts are back to back. The first act is a typical psycho-thriller, but the second act is most disturbing because viewers react to the situation. I don't think it would work exactly the same if the second act were extended and changed to continue. As a great horror fan, I recommend this movie. It's the first horror movie EVER that gives me nightmares.
