No matter how much it hurts, the film is not as good as it could be. Maybe I was bewildered by the myriad of exaggerated reviews on IMDb, but I was expecting a lot more ... \ t is "dirty" with a few mistakes that I find unforgivable. At first I am one of the few people who feel that Heavy Metal music playing in the most intense scenes just tears the atmosphere. With another kind of music (Goblin ????) during "needle" scenes, it would be SOOOO intense! ... Instead, the soundtrack destroys every chance of tension ... Second, the last scene of killing and the last few moments of the movie is just stupid and uninspired. I don't want to say "amateur" because I like Argento movies. The end left me feeling empty. This is hardly happening in most Daria movies! Although, true, Suspiria also suffers rushing the finals (though most of them are brilliant) .... <br /> <br /> In short, watch this movie, try to make the most of its good points, but be ready even the bad ones. This is not a perfect film by any means.
