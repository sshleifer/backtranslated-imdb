I had no idea what I would see when I decided to see this movie and my surprise only a very well-made horror movie that is easily one of the best in the 1970s. The film is of course a low budget and this is an excellent example of how the story and style of the film creates chills, not special effects! Strother Martin is one of the greatest actors of all time and has a rare lead role and the film also plays good friend Martins L.Q. Jones and "Green Acres" Alvy Moore. Jones and Moore also helped produce this film. TV veteran Charles Bateman's star and "Enter the Dragon" beauty Ahna Capri is his girlfriend. Capri is in a bikini at the beginning of the movie and she's just awesome to look at! The film has a great job to stay with the story and does not add a false feeling that it is a good ending, and I really liked how the movie ends. Great atmosphere, interesting story and well directed by Bernard McEveety. The performance of Martins is also top-notch because it does not hold at all and actually fits into the role of Doc. Good and underrated movie!
