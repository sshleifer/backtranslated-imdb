/ * may contain SPOILERS, but of course it doesn't matter :) * / <br /> <br /> The Potemkin battleship is one of the stunning spectacles of scary images. The visual direction is (well and has been) inspiring, the sheer extent of the film is impressive and the technique is certainly pioneering. What is really amazing is, in my opinion, the depth and effectiveness of the film, without proper literary script, sound (save soundtrack), decent image quality, false deep (self) referentialism today, exceptional acting, pretense, etc. What You get is a purely visual experience you will remember. BTW, the previous poster noted, "After the great suffering Eisenstien felt that he was giving heroes what they wanted, that you think Eisenstein puts in a big final fight and then you are tricked, it's a little cheap, I would rather warn you that the end is not cheap and Eisenstein was not generous to the heroes, but history was. Potemkin really went through the squadron as it was shown in the movie. Finally, I would strongly recommend seeing the Potemkin battleship to anyone who is more or less seriously interested in the cinema. generally accepted as "great" or "classic", for "slow" or "boring", this movie may not be for you yet. It's not very cheap fun here. <br /> <br /> But it's full 10 / 10.
