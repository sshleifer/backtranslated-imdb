I loved the document first. It presents a new history of school / theory where the subject can reflect a wide range of social and historical issues. <br /> <br /> First, I'll put the camera and dogs out of the way. I hate Blair Witch camera quality but also understand the advantage of this casual approach. In fact, I agree with the other reviewer that he gives us unprecedented access. Dogs: Warning, I have a doctoral degree in literature that DOES NOT use as a profession, so some of my training can get inside: dogs are a wonderful metaphor for the complex relationship of great human effort and our need to find work to achieve . Dogs may reflect their owners as suggested by one reviewer. But it also serves as a stand-in for the workers we see in the film. While this may suggest a Marxist problem raised by one reviewer, I think it also shows how difficult it is to globalize work issues. No Mondovi in ​​Italy may translate elsewhere. (Yikes! I'm a Marxist in my heart and I hate hearing how my cynical resignation keeps swinging!) It's a remarkable bait and switch. Dogs are family, workers are family. But in the end, the dogs are workers (the last scene with a poor farmer). Although you disagree with politics, the art of analogy, along with the more apparent policy of the film, is amazing. If Faulkner (I'm from Alabama) had too many movies off the market in Hollywood, what interesting stories would be said.
