I have to say that I am a passionate fan of horror film and I can't get enough horror at the moment. Since the American horror power depends on gore power. <br /> <br /> This movie is fantastic. This film reminded me of the Sixth SENSE of M. Night. The film was directed great. The director took the time to set everything up. It took about 40 minutes to get the movie into horror. I thought the movie was just drama. This movie is just building up and payday is not too much. I've never done it before, but this is the main reason I liked the movie. because one scene just scared me ... which is a little pathetic ... but the movie does it, it's great.
