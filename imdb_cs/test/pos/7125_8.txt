There are several movies that await me and are waiting to be released more than this. This is the latest film by Dead Gentlemen, responsible for the original Gamers and Demon Hunters movies. This group has not been very active in recent years, but this film is a reason to try to keep things going. This film follows a group of players trying to complete a GM-driven campaign frustrated by his group overlooking his story. With the help of some new blood he tries the campaign again with the hope of completing this time. This film is a breath of fresh air in the movie community and a great improvement over the original. The film shows respect for the game as well as the original film, but on top of that, this film shows dramatic improvements to the special effects of running over the simplicity of college films. Acting is quite decent and jokes are pretty funny. Unfortunately, many jokes are in jokes, so if you're not a player, you don't have to find a movie as fun as others. That's why I give film 8 instead of 9, which I originally thought. Every case, if you are a player or know about playing games, you will enjoy it.
