ROMEO AND JULIET has been interpreted in so many ways, but very few versions have captured the essence of the game. The ones I can think of is really a naked Romanesque spirit were WEST SIDE STORY and believed or not, Troma Film is TROMEO AND JULIET. At first glance it is just a mere spraying, and many would think it was a bastard Shakespeare classic. But the film has an honest feeling. Updated to address today's sick young people, but not merit. Yes, frequent bursts, piercings, car accidents, lesbian sex scenes, masturbation and incest are in bad taste, but what a shame if you have such a sweet love story as a basis? Just as bad as most of the games in this movie is (I think it's Troma, after all), two wires have some real chemistry, more than in the great monstrosities of TITANIC and STAR WARS EPISODE TWO. There is a lot of modernization, but most of the original text is in tact, especially when Tromeo and Juliet are together. There is a great scene where Juliet pronounces the famous, "Parting is such a sweet sorrow," and tromeo quickly follows, in the mid-nineties grunge fashion, "Yeah, that's absolutely sucks." I think it's really unfortunate that this film won't get the recognition or the broad edition it deserves. I hope the people who see it on the video store shelves will not be turned off in the film by brute brute because they lack quite subversive expertise.
