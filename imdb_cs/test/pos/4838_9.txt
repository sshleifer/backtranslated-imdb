This was a very strong view of prejudice and group mentality. The cast consists of excellent actors who do remarkable work. The sets are beautiful and a little stylized. The artistic direction is top, along with great cinematography. The story is tense and shows how prejudice and fanaticism can flourish. It is worrying for his realistic violence and the protection of a relatively typical community. I was very impressed.
