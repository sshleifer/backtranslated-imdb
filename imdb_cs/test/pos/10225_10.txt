This film is a perfect example of Barkers' film gifts for the horror / monster genre. I thought this movie did a great job of maintaining the feel and appearance of the short story and comics (or, in fact, the comic may be second, I forgot). This movie was made for Barker fans. It helps you read the book in advance, but it's not important if you can watch a movie. I saw anyone on the fence about this movie, read the book and then watch the movie again. You can find a new respect for the film. I came to this movie a great Barker fan anymore, and after reading the previous book, he loved the movie immediately. There are great portraits, makeup, writing, directing, etc. In this movie. This movie does something most monsters / horror movies fail, show monsters. They are in full color, they are not hidden in the shade and take up most of the screen time. Unlike other movies that use quick cuts or trick lighting to hide creatures, this film celebrates grotesque, and throws them to the fore as a good guy. Two inches up Clive. We are always waiting for thieves :)
