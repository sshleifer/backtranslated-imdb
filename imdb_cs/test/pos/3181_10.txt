That was an excellent show. It came to PBS at home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (From EnVogue) played to a teenage daughter at age. The show dealt with topics such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. It was about a middle class black family who had a teenage daughter and a son who moved to a middle class neighborhood from Oakland or somewhere (I can't remember). I remember a few episodes, but the one I remember most was when their cousin first got their time. I was about 7-8 when I first watched it and was able to keep up with the program. That was a great show. I can't remember the guy's name on the show, but I always confused him with Kevin Hooks.
