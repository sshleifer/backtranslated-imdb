Merry movie, I watched him great. Star (Cuneyt Arkin, sometimes credited as Steve Arkin) is a popular actor from Turkey. He has played in many hard roles, epic movies and novels. It was fun to see him with an international cast and a couple of real miserable looking gloves. As I recall, it was also dubbed in English, which made things even more fun. (a bit like seeing John Wayne speak Turkish).
