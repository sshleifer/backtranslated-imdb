This film is definitely a case of style over the fabric, but the style is good and certainly more than unique so that "The Cell" is an unforgettable and above average movie. <br /> <br /> "The Cell" is beautifully decorated with impressive sets, costumes and makeup. Yes, it's a real eye-catcher. The film has several perfectly "dreamy" sequences that are certainly strange but also very beautiful and imaginative to look at. This film is a perfect combination of an art-house movie and a typical Hollywood thriller that is available to both fans of the genre. they always make sense. Since the film is not always nice and nice to watch, but as I mentioned earlier, the style compensates. This style lets you watch to the end and provides the best moments of the movie. Vincent D'Onofrio is unforgettable as a serial killer with a twisted mind. In fact, Vincent D'Onofrio is an actor who is a penny and this film shows his talent once again. I'm not particularly happy when I throw Jennifer Lopez. I know he can act in some of his movies, but it wasn't really suitable to play the main character in this movie. Her character was not strong enough to be overshadowed by Vincent D'Onofri and Vince Vaughn. I still felt that Vince Vaughn was also wrong in this movie. He did not interfere with the role well enough and no, I'm not saying I only saw him in comedies. The rest of the accompanying cast is good and still gives the film a certain level of credibility. Howard Shore's musical score was also surprising and it was somehow "Se7en". It fits well with the film, and some of its scenes have added some special mood and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> It's far from perfect film and the concept is much more appealing and not always handled properly. Still "The Cell" is a perfectly traceable movie and maybe a little must see, given its style, originality and creativity. <br/> 7/10
