Cheers to all the amazing fans of this film who not only saw and appreciated it, but (based on many literary comments) actually GET IT! I always consider Paul Mazurski as "Tempest" for one who deals with Shakespeare's play of the same name, as mentioned in several other reviews. On the other hand, if you are looking for a more straightforward customization of the game, you should look elsewhere. But as an experiment, it only succeeds remarkably. Charming, moving, funny, sad, dramatic ... it's all and much more. Cast, location, script, music are just fantastic. Cassavetes and Rowland have never been better. Susan Sarandon turned more than indicated the great work she would come from in the future. Molly Ringwald is her movie debut unforgettable and you just have to love Raul Julia's performance ... steals the show in several scenes. What's more, always great Cassavetes was confident and pretty sure he left him! The study of what Shakespeare's classics could be a life of if they were updated to a "more modern age", the Masurian "Tempest" burns brilliantly!
