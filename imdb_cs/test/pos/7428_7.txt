It was the third time I tried to watch this movie. The previous two times, I found the beginning of so ill sweet and "schmaltzy" that I stopped watching. Now that I'm a little older and more compulsive, I was forced to watch the whole movie and I was very surprised to find out that I really liked it. So I watch the movie as much as I was looking at swimming in the ocean when the water temperature is 70 degrees (that's about 21-22 degrees Celsius for all those metrics lovers out there). Sure, the water is very cold and initially shocking, but if you force yourself to stay in the water, get used to it - so resist the desire to jump right away! The film begins with a long exchange between Flynn and his daughter, played by sloppy Patti Brady. Some may find interviews very cute and cute, although others may find it a little hard to take because these moments are so gosh-damn sweet! In a way, it was some amazing Flynn game because it is hard to imagine having children or acting in real life, especially to be loyal to one woman in this movie - now IS ALSO! NEVER ARE GOOD FOR divorced couple Flynn and Parker and their mutual desire to remarry. Since they both love each other, as well as their kind boy, it seems to be a foregone conclusion that they will re-tie the knot. But there are serious problems in their way: Lucille Watson (who plays her usual predominant and arbitrary character), Flynn's girlfriend (after all, Errol Flynn and he is divorced, so you have to be expected to have a girl SOMEWHERE) and a marine (played by Forrest Tucker). <br /> <br /> Not unexpectedly, everything will be resolved and everyone will live happily to the end. However, despite being formal and predictable, the film is a winner because it's so fun to watch. Flynn, despite his reputation as an action adventure hero, is very good with comedy-romance and it's just a lot of fun to watch him. The film also has Cuddles Sakall, which is always chewing - it's just so cute and sweet that it's perfect in this type of movie. And despite the sweetness, the film is pretty well written. The bottom line is movie is fun. So my recommendation is to watch this movie and force you not to touch the naughty sweet aspects of the movie. Once you've got through it, the rest of the movie is a picture that's well worth your time.
