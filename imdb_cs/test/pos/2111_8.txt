I was honored to be one of the "Grand Champion" photographers and enjoy every minute of the 42 days I was working on the movie. I have been in photography for 25 years and I've been working on 16 films and I can't think of the time when I enjoyed my craft more. The kids were great to work with and little Emma Roberts has so much energy to be a real trip. She even grabbed one of my cameras while rehearsing the scenes and started shooting. Some of her images have been used for PR. I could have made more money to produce with a bigger budget, but I doubt I would be entertained and around so many great actors and great people from West Texas as I was.
