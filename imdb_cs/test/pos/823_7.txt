I like the shepherd! Of course, playing was not good, but the fighting scenes were nice. Van damme throws a few nice kicks and so adkins. The story was average. Texas cop battle smugglers. This film has done everything he should do with the movie van damme, which is a martial arts and action. Van damme has never been a good actor. I think this movie is better than van dammmes last 2. If you're looking for an Oscar winning performance you won't get it here, but if you're looking for action and martial arts then this movie is for you. Scott Adkins is an amazing martial artist and unfortunately the public has tired of superstars martial arts, but his films in this movie are great. Van damme brings strong kicks and it's good to see him again when he plays in the last 4 or 5 movies. This movie is definitely worth watching if you are a van Damme fan.
