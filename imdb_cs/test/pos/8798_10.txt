The film itself is absolutely brilliant, its buzzing, the rush that makes you just want to go out, blow your wages and relax. What the weekend is all about is our sanitation, where we can meet as one and be alone in the world. The film is layered in depth and the dialogue in places is just in place, especially with Jip. The characters themselves are immediately sympathetic, one of them is obviously a coloring character and his views on what "Star Wars" really is about genii. <br /> <br /> If you had an hour to kill before you go out, stay on it, you will immediately feel that you will feel confident, I definitely recommend it.
