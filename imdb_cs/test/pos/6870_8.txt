It's a shame House Calls isn't better known. Is it perhaps because romantic leadership is middle-aged, businessman and gun-shy, rather than excessive teen stars? Could be. If you are over 35 years old, you'll probably have this comedy. If you're over 45, you'll really have this comedy. If you have 25, wait until you're older to see it. The unlikely pairing of Matthau and Jackson is precisely because it is so unlikely. There's a beautiful line of Matthau that summarizes what's going on between the two - "I like old because you don't have to explain who Ronald Coleman is." (If it's not the exact line, it's close ...) <br /> <br /> The assumption of a sub-steam hospital run by incompetent circles is true. The image of Carney's senile head surgeon is absolutely brilliant. It is impossible to laugh loudly when it is delivered. Subplots, if you can tell them, are also fun, like Matthau and Jackson's teenage son. Everything hits exactly the right tone. Okay, there is something Matthau must wear women's clothing that is a little over-the-top and easy to mark. But still - it's Walter Matthau in the move! It is funny!
