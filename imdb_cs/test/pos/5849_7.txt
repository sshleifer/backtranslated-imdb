This thriller has so many twists and turns that I'm me on the edge of my seat. I saw it on the video, some landscapes on the "bluff" could be a little more spectacular on the big screen. Cast has Sandra Bullock, Ben Chaplin ("Truth About Cats and Dogs"), Michael Pitt (Henry Parker at "Dawson's Creek") and Ryan Gosling (???).
