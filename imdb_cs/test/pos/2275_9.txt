I went to the cinema, without the expectation of the movie I witnessed, "Everything is lit". I went with joy that I barely noticed with American movies. Actor Leiva Schreiber's directorial debut, the film follows a man on his way past, accompanied by an eccentric group, including the early dancing English-speaking punk of Eukrain, his grandfather who believes he is blind, and their crazy dog. The first half of the film is witty and clever with an extremely European taste in the use of small but beautiful characters, while the other half descends into the dark story of discovery and the Holocaust. This little film brings so many emotions and so many colors, with such a wonderful conclusion and is more than just a story about lighting, but also about relationships and connections. Acting is incredibly powerful, a story mysterious and interesting, and the artistic attraction of cinema, to die. With some brilliant and totally touching scenes "Everything is lit", I managed to capture my heart.
