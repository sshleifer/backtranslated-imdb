The film addresses here and now the horror of "rendition" with the multi-cast trans-global account of all involved. No one works lightly because we see the blindness of the players who make their own piece of the global game that accumulates hatred and misery on their "enemies" and on the same scale. between the sympathetic Senator Aide (starring Peter Sarsgaard's scintillation style) and Washington's powerful mongers he is electrifying. Meanwhile, in the field, the new CIA man (Jake Gyllenhaal) is undergoing a sea change in his attitude towards a new US homage to torture. Suddenly, though his rejection of what he initially condemned in silence is, he must ask why anyone on the earth who calls him a civilized state and how someone is so humiliated and abused? The film has few heroes - perhaps Gyllenhaal's defective and obvious CIA man is an exception and a necessary pleasure for the film to offer a source of hope. The sad fact is that this film is not a fiction at all, but an awakening for those who have left a fool of decency in them. The terrible truth is that we in the UK and the US have lost our moral plot and this film shows how low we are ready to go. All this in the name of freedom! In the scenario, there is an amazing line that says torture is a way to expand our enemies. This is already happening in real life and we should listen to the message that this film brings and start using our powers and money much more intelligently! It seems that every one of us who claims that extradition, torture and abuse of fundamental human rights are necessary to protect our way of life is as bad and stupid as jihadists and suicide bombers. All praise for the feelings of a talented South African director with eyes on the gross injustice, how much it is being performed, and the casting of major mainstream actors from the US and beyond. And by the way, the film has a sting in its tail with an ending clever and thought-provoking surprise (which I won't give away). The movie I saw in an early London preview, so it hasn't been widely written yet, but I'm glad the influx of less than the glowing review seems to be turning. The BBC review was very strongly in support and they (and I) suspect that most of the negative comments come from those who see the world through simple Hollywood specifications - where good guys and bad guys are cardboard cutouts. Hence the reason why many really big movies of the year are increasingly indie and / or non-US pix.
