I will not comment on the story itself. I agree that most people comment that this is a good action movie with a great storyline and good behavior. This film deserves 100% for cinematography for its opening sequence. The opening shot is stunning and I haven't figured out how they did it. The film is worth watching that shot alone! It is a pity that the DVD, which is currently out, is just a movie and information about its production is not listed. Hopefully someone comes with a special edition. And even better, the opening sequence is also ending, so you are completely guessed! Great stuff. Must have classic film moments for collectors.
