This is another coming back movie by John Travolta, and if he goes on with characters and movies like this, he will come back to him. This is so sweet ... naughty if you aren't on the romance comedy scene. If so, it is one innovative RomCom. Every show (including Skippy the Dog) was beautiful without much more than a hate track of "Dogma". (Though, as the movies go, I loved Dogma!) Travolta is not nearly as free in his performance as the previews would trust you to do so. He is an angel, and if you consider yourself well read, then you understand that angels are far from perfect. So you won't be offended by this movie. Even those who are too sensitive to such things should not be insulted by this work because Nora has gone very long to make it the least abrasive with regard to the subject. <br /> <br /> I love it and love it more when I look at it. It's beautiful and sweet, engaging and cute. <br /> <br /> Price for 7.3 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
