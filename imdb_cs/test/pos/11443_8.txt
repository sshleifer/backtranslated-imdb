Demon Night is definitely one of the ultimate demons of the fearsome 1980s, moving in the same spirit as the brilliant Evil Dead and Demons. This film combines hairy sexually active teens and demons into the hell of a fun movie. Some welcome extra after the 80's was slasher flicks crossed, it was nice to see something a little different. The storyline follows a group of teenagers who all gather for a Halloween party on the hull of a house that was held by Angela. About 40 minutes of walking and sexing eventually leads to a demon or demons who get out of the oven and have all those teens. Add a few fancy makeup effects, lots of gore, and cool-looking demons and you get a sweet 80-cheese-fest that would be ranked as one of the best demons related movies in many horror fan lists. br /> <br /> At first I loved the setting for this movie, "Hull House" is a really creepy and frightening and perfect horror movie environment, and when demons appear, it's when the action really breaks down and it becomes a night horror and fear. This film gave birth to 2 sequels, the first in 1994 that was fine, but none of it broke and the third, Demon House, was terrible. This is one of those horrors that have stood the test of time and remain my true gem for many years. All in all, it's a fun cheesy flick with demons that are definitely worth checking.
