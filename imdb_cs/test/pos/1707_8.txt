Tia Carrere was the reason I decided to watch this movie because neither title nor cover would be enough to spend time and money on this movie? who goes to the show, me and everyone that the DVD should not be judged by its packaging. *** SPOILERS *** The film felt like it was happening, but it wasn't going anywhere. moment ?? Paul Faber's inconvenience (Zak Orth) around the girls is almost too embarrassing than when he looks, and the edge on the otherwise appealing Kirsten Beck (as Alexondra Lee) is a school girl. Where are those that are fashionable in 1995? The relationship between Vicky Mueller (Tia Carrere) and Todd Boomer (Jason London) was exciting from the start! The first meeting across the lake? magical. What a beautiful coincidence should be reunited, just as he behaved like a complete moron ("Boomer, with two O, as in Moron?") Before Alexondra. Too bad we, as an audience, knew who Vicky Mueller really was. (Well, that title gave away, don't you think?) <br /> <br /> What really surprised me was playing. Especially in the scene where Vicky gives Todd a metal version of his alter ego in a small white jewelry box. Did the actors manage to re-create the first kiss feeling of armor? point for Todd and Vicky's return. Too bad, the movie ends with a focus on (after getting Todd's Harvard fathers) his reunion with his friends. Could I imagine a whole new movie? next Vicky to New York ?? there must be a good art university that Todd could attend !? However, the movie that does just what we want Hollywood to do: entertained us throughout the film. Someone else has noticed that there are none of those miles in this movie. Todd's mother is somewhat crazy (on 24/7 phone), his father won't find her attractive (more?) Todd's teacher is obviously disillusioned with his wife and vice versa? Todd himself enters a wonderfully erotic and courageous relationship that, however nice it may be, would be very difficult to maintain (age difference, adult difference, etc.) and Alexondra & Zak do not rely because Alexondra is not mature enough to she managed the relationship (-> her condom reaction, cheating, backups of Zak, etc.) are very immature and often include escape) and Zak, poor guy? is too much of a best friend / brother-guy to drag Alexondra. But be careful, good movie! I gave it 8/10. Brilliant performance of actors - who bring the script to life.
