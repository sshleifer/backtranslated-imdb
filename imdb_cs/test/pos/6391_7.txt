On a routine mission in Iraq, a group of Delta soldiers restore a computer hard drive from Alqueda Training Camp detailing the location of Dr. Dr. Walsh. Walsh found an alternative source of funding and witnessed a new research facility deep in the notorious Belzan forest in Chechnya, where he develops weapons and sells them to Chechen insurgents. sent to the black ops mission to get a doctor and his technology before the Russians find him and his lab.What Delta team soon discovers that the doctors latest weapons is a flock of large carnivorous bats that have been genetically altered to develop a taste for the human body. I found that this film is much better than what I expected. There are plenty of actions and lots of blood. It is more or less what you would expect from the function of creation. Acting is not great, but its patency. I certainly saw worse. Overall his nice movie for what it is. Good popcorn movie.
