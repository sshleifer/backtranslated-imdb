This is another Western about the greedy cattle baron trying to squeeze out small farmers and farmers. It's definitely all before and since then. But violent men are something special. The peculiarity is that Barbara Stanwyck plays the role of vixen, as she often did in her later films. She is married to maimed Edward G. Robinson, who is here a baron cattle, but Robinson is crippled and there is some indication that his wound may have left him impotent. Regardless of Barbara, whose needs are met by her brother-in-law, Brian Keith. It doesn't fit well with Dianne Foster, who is the daughter of Robinson and Stanwyck, or with Lita Milan, who is a girlfriend of Keith's Mexican girl. Unfaithfulness underscores almost the film, but Glenn Ford as a stout little rancher who is a Civil War veteran coming to the West for his health is able to keep his own. It's every inch of a silent Western hero that people make a mistake to push too often. I almost expect the famous words from Wild Bill Elliott to come out of Ford's mouth, "I'm a gentle man." They would be very useful in The Vioilent Men. The 1950s was the age of an adult West, the topics came into horse operas that had not been explored before. The following year Glenn Ford would make another western, Jubal, one of his best, who also examines infidelity as part of the plot. There is a lot of traditional Western things in Violent Men, and a lot for those who also depend on soap operas.
