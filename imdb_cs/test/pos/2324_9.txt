I just discovered this movie and loved it. It's the right mix of a fast moving story, fun characters, cheerful moments (but not overloaded with silly jokes) and entertaining performances by Kelsey Grammar, Harry Dean Stanton, Ron Schneider, Rip Torn and others. Buckman is especially good, and I really liked watching a guy who played Stapanick. Interestingly, they used a real submarine, Pampanito, to run on top of the scenes and imitate them almost exactly for their files. Set decoration is really impressive if you do a digital tour of Pampanito online and then compare it with the scenes in the movie. They did a great job on this movie. <br /> <br /> What's a fun and really enjoyable movie!
