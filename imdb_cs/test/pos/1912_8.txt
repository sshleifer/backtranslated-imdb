When I was a little garbage expert, I found this little treasure. Action, romance, crooked cops, violence. All this here and not one has been downloaded right. I was in love immediately. Then something happened for the second time. I became addicted. I thought it was going to be one rent and a laughing video. Rudy Ray Moore knew what he wanted to see in the movie. He didn't have the money to make it look good, but he did it anyway. This is very commendable. It also shows that he made the film for his own. I don't know how many of you heard Rudy Ray's music, but if you don't, there are a number of albums that went back to the 1950s.
