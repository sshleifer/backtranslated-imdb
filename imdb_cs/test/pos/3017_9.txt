CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> The cell, like Antz, must be tracked twice to appreciate you. When I first saw this movie, I thought it was average, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after the show, I decided to have to rent it again. I did it and I found the movie more sympathetically. The cell is not for everyone, but divides its stories with quality and it's a visually intelligent film that dreams into images and ideas that could not be closed. The movie's screenplay can sometimes be clumsy as well as acting, but the visuals are brilliant and bring an engaging story to an exotic and interesting life. Oscar-nominated makeup is also bold and careful, while beautiful costumes and a totally brilliant set of decorations have remained unnoticed. Tarsem Singh, who also has directed music videos, has gone completely crazy with his direction and is doing well. He has great talent and this film has great potential if you give him a chance. Overall, the cell is powerful, distracting and avoids too much stickyness, making it a great, enjoyable watch.
