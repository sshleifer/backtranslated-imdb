*** SPOILERS *** Anything else can (or can't) say about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted. Cinematography is simply overwhelming (at least) and fx is nothing if not the most modern. Conceptually, the show offers a bit of everything - and for almost everyone (parents, kids, fantasy and / or fx fans). CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THIRD TYPES WITH A BLACK LAGOON CREATURO with a little JAWS and GODZILLA fit in a good scale, say. And neither of them was the only sour note; Here is a surprisingly solid casting. This SURFACEd series, seemingly out of the blue, and thanks to the clear hint of his straightforward narrative carried the viewer throughout the season. All things were taken into account, work very good. I hope it will be next season ...
