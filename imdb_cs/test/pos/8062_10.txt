Like Schindler's list, this film was much stronger as it is a documentary film based on real life. It describes in detail the story of Frank and especially Anne. Although it is a bit slow moving first (describing their family life before the war); it becomes very powerful. Due to some of the records and photos of the camps, I would not recommend it to children, but to adults, this illustrates the horror of the Holocaust through one young girl. Highly recommended.
