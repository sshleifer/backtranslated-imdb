"Confirmed Dead" is an important episode in the series because it introduces four new characters: a rescue team Naomi turned to before she got a knife in her back. However, as quoted in my overview of one line, their real purpose of being on the island may be something completely different. All new characters look interesting (especially Miles, some psychic / exorcist), but at this point, it's too early to make solid judgments. I felt that this episode was a slight step down from "Beginning of the End" (this time without a flash; instead of short flashes) but still has its amazing moments and raises the pair at the end. *** of 4.
