Hello everyone! I went to this movie without any expectations, even though I knew that Maniratnam would give an excellent movie! I was impressed! The background is the struggle between tamils ​​established in Sri Lanka and the government. The story is about how young Amudha, who lives with her foster parents in Chennai, India, goes to Sri Lanka to find her real mother. The highlight of the film are the performances of every actor and actress and, of course, cinematography, editing and all other technical details. Full stamps for cast and crew. I have to mention cinematography because it brings war so that you feel there. Good job! Although the war sequences reminded me of Saving Private Ryan, such a work never tried on the Indian screen. Overall, the movie is great! And Mr. Maniratnam's hats. Mani Ratnam proved once again that he is a director who can take the Indian cinema to high heights! I'd like to watch this movie over and over again. Excellent movie and must see.
