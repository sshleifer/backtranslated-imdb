Imagine you were 18 years old on a plane. You were on a business trip to South Africa. You are a highly paid professional. You've been living in the US for 20 years. You are in the 1930s, you have a woman, a little boy and another child on the way. One thing, even if you have a green card, you're still Egyptian. In transit, you will be asked to come with 2 guards, another thing you know is overwhelmed, hooded and chained, and after a brief (but still reasonably civilian) interrogation you should be dealt with! This is what happens to Anwar el Ibrahimi at the beginning of the film. His story is pain and (literally) torture. It's one of several story lines. One follows his marital attempts to gain more information. One follows the (cold) bureaucrats behind the release. Another story deals with the family of the man who leads the interrogation of Anwar el Ibrahimi. There are other stories, and all of them are neatly meeting. Though more famous actors like Reese Witherspoon (as an upset pregnant wife) Jake Gyllenhaal (as a CIA rookie forced to watch interrogation in North Africa) and Meryl Streep (as CIA hotshot Corine Whitman) he's really more unknown actors who carry the story and give it a heart . For me, the actor playing the unfortunate Mr. El Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) was the heart and soul of this film. His depiction of a man in need was shocking. It's almost like being tortured for real! Also, Israeli actor Yigal Naor was very impressive because he cared for the family and the man who was an extremely cruel chief of torture. Hard to watch and not quite fun, but still worth it.
