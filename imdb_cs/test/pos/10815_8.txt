An amazing, fast-paced comic series / drama / farce set against the French battle of 1939. He played with a wide-eyed, straight face intense talent talented cast and chockablock with action, satire, social commentary, and authentic period details, from neat Brilian hairstyles and marceled hairstyles up to Citroen's "Tractions" fleet. a credible impersonation of Charles de Gaulle and Marshal Petaine. <br /> <br /> It's just one of the best entertainment programs that have recently been shown on screen. If the movies were trains (and there is a creative recreation on a steam train trip that works despite the fact that there is no steam locomotive - an expensive drill, it would undoubtedly be a TGV).
