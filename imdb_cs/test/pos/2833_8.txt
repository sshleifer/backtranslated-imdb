... I saw this film when I first came out in France, in my hometown, 54 years ago, I was nine, and today I still remember every black and white image, especially black, because it was so tense, scary, those who sneaking through the dark mountain pass, two soldiers, prisoners who were forced to fight with their prisoners, the last battle to uncover the Gatling car in his fire, the last fight between Peck and the boss, and the happy ending that allowed me to return my breath . I haven't seen it since, and I don't know if it would be a good idea to see it today, it was such a wonderful moment for the guy I was.
