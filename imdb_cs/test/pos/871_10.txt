The film is a joy to watch, not just for a conspiracy that is breathtaking, but also for the outstanding performances of actors, Deneuve and Belmond. Although considered a "flop" on its first release, it has become a critical success and it is clear why. Deneuv's acting style suited the film brilliantly. it constantly gives the impression of holding something or hiding it, and its character in this film is. I won't spoil it by saying what is, even if it is revealed quite early. Belmondo is nice as quite naive, but in the love of tobacco. I would recommend this movie to all Truffaut or Deneuve fans. It is a brilliant Hitchcock-style thriller with exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that evolve as a film. The movie is about 2 hours, so you feel you have not been sold shortly. Deneuve steals the show in this movie, and it is clear that by the time Truffaut was very smit with her. Certain must see for all cineaste or moviefan. 10/10
