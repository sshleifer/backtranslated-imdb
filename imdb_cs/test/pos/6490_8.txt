I'm a huge fan of the $ 5.50 DVD bin on my local WalMart. Hopefully you have one at your local branch. You will find plenty of campsites, a pile of rubbish and occasional surprises. This movie is one of the surprises. My friend recently bought this one, and when I thought it would be another cheesy laugh, I was really surprised at how good it was. I watch a lot of movies and as a result I can almost always call the movie out; and if it is a conspiracy, what it will be. Not this movie! The director is brilliant, the plot is amazing and the fight is incredibly resourceful. If you see this sitting somewhere at a low price, you get it! If you see it at full price, I would recommend it.
