It's a wonderful movie that doesn't-do-em-like-this-anymore. Well done by all and addressed by interesting actors. The smart, witty script worked with the right mix of broad comedy and underestimated humor. Holds for repeated (annual?) Tours. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING ** Re-make this movie with the same name, directed by Arnold Whatwashethinking, is an excruciating mess - painful watch - without scintillating the magic and the original joke.
