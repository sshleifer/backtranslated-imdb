The second time I watched this movie, I opened the eyes that were left closed for the first time and really looked, not the type of taboo I had heard about my life, but simply on two human beings. in love. I loved it, loved the story, loved a slightly broken, yet strong individual in the film, loved sharing feelings and loved strong ties created. It is a truly charming, beautifully made film that has sometimes made me cry and hope that people who read and watch the film will eventually remember that everyone deserves love, no matter what form or form it represents. ...
