I'm glad I'm not the only one to find this series very well. This is the best series for young ladies! I have such a special taste for comedy and I'm so hard to please my intelligence, and I'm so happy that their humor is exactly what I need. Love the gang of actors! If anyone knows a series or just a movie similar to this, I say quite please write back because I miss the series. And kindly ask writers and producers to continue, though the actors are all adults now, I think! <br /> <br /> Nice morning / day / evening / night! (because I don't know the exact time you read this post)
