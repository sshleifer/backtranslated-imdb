"Sister Betty" is a kind of film that you can't describe on a poster or on a trailer or commercial. It's the kind of movie you go to expect a more mature "stupid and stupid" to go on a cross-country adventure with a temporarily mad waitress without trying to kill the crooks. The fact is that this film is a wonderful, pleasing story about two people chasing their dreams. The best part about "Sister Betty" is unpredictability. Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to separate dreams from reality, and together with a moving drama and cheerful comedy you can never tell what will happen next.
