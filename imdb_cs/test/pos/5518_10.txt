This movie was different. It took a kind of typical thriller story and reached a more interesting, in-depth look at the struggle against the individual's faith. Of course, it helped that the main performance, Andrew McCarthy, was quite excellent. Other performances were also interesting, though not so consistent. The end was a little released, but there were plenty of good moments. The filmmakers tried to do something else - not just for obvious chills and terror. This is a dark movie (not for everyone), but if you want to be fun and not talk, try this one.
