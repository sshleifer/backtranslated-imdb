It's not a stunning but good movie to see once or twice. Bill Macy shows he can do more than act; his writing was pretty damn good. Great side cast, especially Jamie Cromwell as a racketeering private eye. The biggest strength of the film is the work of Macy, who reminds us of his role as Jerry Lundergaard of Fargo. He has many scenes where he is extremely funny as slimy, manipulative and deceptive. It's nice to watch this weasel, and for a moment I was happy that he was doing well. *** of four.
