I wanted to see it because the French teacher recommended it more than forty years ago. Maybe it was a long wait, because restoring the DVD Criterion Collection is impressive. In his sketch, this film follows a worn-out scenario: the men's quartet diligently portrays a difficult bank vault robbery, a robbery takes place, a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the ultimate demise of all. Although the shots of the robbery are transfixing, it occurs rather early and is ultimately not the core of the film. This film separates from the typical film of robbery by giving us a look at the characters' personalities and their motivation - its games as well as the drama as it does the thriller. Relationships play a big role and the kidnapping is directed, which gives us two movies for the price of one. John Servais plays the idea of ​​a man Tony le Stéphanois (always referred to as "le Stéphanois") with such mundane fatigue that he could just step out of the Camus novel. Just recently, Tony got out of jail and gave up the re-entry into crime until he had a very unpleasant interaction with his former lover (who took over another man) where he was physically whipped by the belt as a punishment. . Fortunately, the scene will be off camera, but you probably won't forget it. After this sober event, because there is little hope of reviving this relationship, Tony meets two of his old partners in crimes, Jo and Mario, and decides to join them in the last great robbery. They choose the services of Cesar, an Italian secure cracker who will be played by director Dassin himself - and we're gone into a robbery. But Cesar's woman bent is a personality trait that turns out to be fatal to everyone involved. However, we can understand his attraction to the nightclub singer for whom he has failed because there is a brilliant set where a sexy and film-inspired nightclub performs - it must be one of the most memorable noir scenes. Br /> <br /> It soon became apparent that Tony had a close relationship with Jo and his family; In fact, Jo's son refers to him as an uncle. I think it's partly to help Jo's family, which Tony agrees to robbery. The end scenes where Tony saves Joe's kidnapped son's life, partly redeems his more brutal and amoral actions. But only partially.
