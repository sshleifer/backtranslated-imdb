The show was amazing and very professional. Madonna is non-stop, dances and sings for 2 hours. The opening was pretty good when it came out of the disco ball and the jump was a really good performance. The whole show was full of energy, so it's hard to tell what it was because every song had something special and unique. I saw a couple of her previous Drowned world and reinvention tour that were good, but you can't compare with that. The dancers were fantastic, the lights and the shows were perfect. Madonna still looks very good. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend that you see it. You will enjoy the show from start to finish. Madonna is still a dance queen.
