This is not much reality, but this is exceptional because the viewer eventually gets something useful out of the fun. I don't have kids, but SuperNanny lessons will be a big help if I ever do! My only complaint is that the show was weakened because it was in the US. I prefer the British version with a stricter approach to the nanny. It's just me or someone else finds that the American version is a bit soft ... now it's a "kinder, gentler" nanny? I think Yank needs a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go after all?! Is there still nothing wrong with the happy happy ending?
