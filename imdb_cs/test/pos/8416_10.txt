It was very refreshing to watch this beautiful movie. The director focused on the main theme without embarking on the sub-plots (medical family or stories of other hospital patients) that are so typical of Bollywood's productions. He kept the narrative simple to understand and made sure that all the actors were true to the characters they were to display. Rustic ways of the grandfather in the clinic, the cold and unintended behavior of the surgeon, the zeal of the social worker gave the film a sense of authenticity. I am also glad that the director did not fall into the temptation to add songs or special effects and cut her to Ananda or Safara. A few scenes at the end of the movie, such as a boy who visits other blind children and a blind worker, and the last scene where a boy claps at the sound of splashing and chirping birds is sure your eyes will be hazy. Many Bollywood players don't realize that Oscar committee members appreciate the simplicity of the subject and the authenticity and brevity of the film more than glitz and glamor. Shwaas is certainly a better nominee than Lagaan, who has dealt with a topic that has already been defeated to death. No MPAA member will be willing to suffer over 4 hours of jingo drama and lots of songs and dances. I look forward to seeing more films by Sandeep Sawant in the future.
