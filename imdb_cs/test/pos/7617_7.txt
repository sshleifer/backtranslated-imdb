Very sadly, I can relate to this movie as I 17, and still be kissing, so I really feel for Josie. It's been a while since I've seen this movie, but I have been following this review again, and I remembered everything I loved about it. Drew Barrymore is a great actress, and this role very well suited her when. The chemistry between Sam and Josie was really good, and Michael Vartan was in this great actor. I also loved the story - as I said there, I could relate to, and it's rare that you find a movie that you can fully relate to. Everywhere - I loved it. 7/10
