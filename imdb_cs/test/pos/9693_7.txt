This is not a kind of film that deserves critical attention. It won't win any Oscars - it's really not a very good movie at all. Hell, it's not really a movie - just a chain of short, disgusting, rough parodies that are all about fun. And like any critical bone in my body screaming to make this film a failed score, gosh it hell, I'll give it a much better score. Those people who will enjoy this film are not the people who really care about what critics say, so I will not give some snobbery criticism of Jackass's quality of surrealist existentialism that penetrates and comments on how our society .... oh forget for it. <br /> <br /> What to say? There is no plot development, no character development - no real beginning - there is a semi-enjoyable end that is not nearly as humorous as the parody that precedes it, and everything between smelling wrong, humor bathrooms that junior high kids laugh. It's actually pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Leave all your good film ideas at the door. Jackass: The number two is just rough bullshit. That's really all. But I do it to filmmakers: they come up with some creative ideas. You will probably crouch a few times, want to throw away, shake and crawl a few times because people on the screen make death and vomit-biting. Vomiting, crap, urine, semen ... in every body you can see Jackass: Number two. There is nudity, sexual humor, and so on, and so on. <br /> <br /> It's fun. If you're the kind of person who finds it fun, then you'll probably really like Jackass: Number Two. I laughed several times. As I said, it's pretty imaginative. I never wanted to vomit - even though I have a strong stomach. Just accept the assumption of the film: a bunch of idiotic boys make weird crap for fun. As soon as you get around, you accept him and go with him. The only mistake in the film is the sheer excess of all the weird and disgusting things. There are a few very imaginative, very intrusive parodies, but they are drawn in many places because they are less interesting. Towards the end of the matter they rise, but the overall quality of the film pulls in the center of the film. It's not a problem in a half-hour TV show, but with the film's length of film it is inevitable that boring will happen at some point. After a while, bullshit crap becomes numb. But overall, the number two is a fun, imaginative, and above all, disgusting comedy that will leave you feeling pain, nausea, and cheerfulness. Look, if you have to, but hey, if you know you don't like such things, don't bother. You'll be disappointed.
