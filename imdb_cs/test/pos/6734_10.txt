The film begins with all the moody promises of the great contemporary noira Western - after a badly conceived initial sequence of flashbacks. The scenery is beautifully deserted, the characters are painfully isolated. While some of the acting is less than believable, the plot eventually brings enough tensions and twists to make this movie pay off.
