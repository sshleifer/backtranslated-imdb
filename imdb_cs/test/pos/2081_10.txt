He made this film on TCM at the beginning of A.M. It was amazing. <br /> <br /> Slow but ominous .... Scott is a shady figure who feeds on women. In this case, two women who become due to heritage in southern California. Beaches and neighborhoods of the 1940s are original and interesting. The title can be more creative, but the theme and shameful shadows of human nature are interestingly exposed, almost in the Hitchcock version. Scott reminded me of Uncle Charley's character in "Shadow of Doubt", one of Hitch's favorite movies. Viewers are learning, we really don't know what lurks in the dark side of the human mind. This film is a relocated gem and well worth buying. 10/10.
