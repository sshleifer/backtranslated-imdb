What a crazy movie it takes 12 (!) Hours and don't understand who these people are and what they do The main plot is about a lot of clueless actors trying to bring "Prometheus" to the scene, but there are plenty of parcels like the disappearance of Thomas and the crazy guy looking for Monsieur Warok .... what is the meaning of it all ???
