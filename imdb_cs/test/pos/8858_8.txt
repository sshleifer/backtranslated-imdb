Things must be one of all the great movies. Of course, at the time of the release, which impressed me so much, in 1982, when I was upset, I never saw anything like that! However, although the effects themselves made the film more horrifying, it was the story itself, the musical score, the claustrophobic atmosphere of Anarktia, as well as the interaction and tension between the members of the doomed research station that made it classic. Movies are no better than this! In the opening scene with a helicopter chasing this hoarse one, you assume it was some bored scientists from some station who left some pair. But when you see them continuing their pursuit at the American base, you think the Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme cabin load. However, this is offset by the terrifying opening music score that sets the pace! You just know something's wrong! At this point, it is a mystery until the "thing" is revealed. However, the mystery is coming back because it becomes a sort of Agatha Christie "who dunnit" (ie ten small Indians movie) sci-fi style because members do not know which of their team is really an alien. Suspicion is still returning, and among them all forward, one at a time collides or reveals itself as a stranger. Distrust between station staff absorbs how the film progresses until the last showdown. <br /> <br /> After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film production, they have special effects in The Thing. Same weight as in 1982, but other than that, it holds very well all round with some great cast performances.
