I usually don't like movies with / about aliens, but K-PAX is different. Actors are great in the movie - especially Kevin Spacey has played his character breathtaking! The film never falls to a lower level - tension is always in the movie and you want to know how it ends up, what's about Prot ... You have to think a lot about the movie through the movie because there are some open questions ... is Prot using only Robert Porter's body as a means of transport. As can see uv-light and how it can know about astrology. But everyone can make their own goal and decide what they want to believe. Very good movie with excellent Kevin Spacey!
