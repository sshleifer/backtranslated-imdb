Charlie Wilson's War demonstrates with skillful truths how futile wars can be, especially those who spend countless hours and finances to fund them. Virtuoso performances and remarkably unforgettable characters have teamed up with the horribly sarcastic screenplay that catapulted a movie that is associated with the continually unpredictable Mike Nichols, until the best of the year. Politics has never been so fun. Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a Texas congressman who received the Cold War award with almost one hand. Building on many drugs, women and cattle, he also has an unexpected interest in the events in Afghanistan and the horrors of the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Getting help by Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), renegade of the CIA secret mission expert and Joanne (Julia Roberts), a wealthy socialist, he raises money to provide rocket launchers and anti-tank weapons that need to cause serious damage to the Russian army. In the end, the Cold War will end in the late 1980s and the funds will be cut up immediately, eliminating all the help for the nascent country to recover and restore. The meeting is excellent, though it is to be expected from more than perfect casting. Much of it, however, should be attributed to a script that allows each character to be undeniably well developed and memorable. And the hearth of this loan goes to the novel of the same name, which is cheerfully honest. Tom Hanks adds more incomparable performance to Charlie Wilson, a man who has done so many people and still remains relatively unknown. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Gust, a character who is live boffo in both his corporeality and in his cruel cynicism; inimitable Hoffman once again shows the outstanding range of characters he portrays. Julia Roberts is perhaps the only weak link in the film, with a general snobbish character and a mild accent. And then there's Wilson's "jailbait" group of young secretaries trying to keep him happy. Under the guidance of always beautiful Amy Adams, every supporting role has its merry moments. The defeat of the Soviet Union was not an easy task, especially in view of the many conflicting goals between different political leaders. "Why does Congress say one thing and do nothing?" asks dissatisfied politicians. "Tradition mostly", Wilson returns. Everyone seems to want to end the Cold War, but the blind eye is turning to the atrocities taking place in Afghanistan. It takes a trip to war-torn refugee camps in Pakistan to motivate Wilson as well as with his main financial source Doc Long (Ned Beatty). Wilson takes advantage of strategic ties with the arms financing committees in Afghanistan from $ 5 million to $ 10 million with a simple command, but the President of Pakistan scoffs at the idea of ​​winning the war for such a trivial amount. By the end of Wilson's campaign, $ 1 billion is being sent to Mujahedin to shoot down Russian helicopters - the first step to victory, as Wilson predicted. Beyond the film, the unresolved unrest in Afghanistan has led to other, less ignored problems that Wilson probably anticipated. During Charlie Wilson's war, the main characters travel from the United States to the United States. Pakistan to Afghanistan to Jerusalem to Egypt, but wherever they go, there is always sarcasm. There is a surprising amount of comedy in the film, as political undertones are generally serious. Hoffman provides jokes with almost every dialogue exchange, just like Hanks, with his naturally witty women chasing ideals. The scene soon featuring Gust is continually heralded out of Wilson's office as he tries to straighten the legal issue with his pose of gorgeous girls ("You can teach 'em to write, but you can't teach' em to breast growth") reminds me of the grotesque routine from Marx's brothers. <br /> <br /> With a press focus on drug accusations against Wilson instead of important issues of the Cold War and conflicting wills of officials to budget their help, it's clear that by the end of the film, politicians are still ignoring what's really And since the scenario is so fast and delicate, some viewers may not be able to keep up with all dialogue intensive events, but, as politicians have shown, who are ignorant of the difference between Pakistan and Afghanistan, this is essentially another argument. to support Charlie Wilson's opinion. - Mike Massie
