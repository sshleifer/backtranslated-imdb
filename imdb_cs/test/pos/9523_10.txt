For all our American deneuve fans, this little gem is a bit hard to get ahold of. Fortunately, I found myself so packed in short bits that I saw a preview of youtube.com that I was willing to go to any length. I found it on ebay.com, I ordered it directly from France and changed my laptop so it could play Region 2 DVD. I'll tell you it was worth it. Be alerted - there are no headlines (fortunately Pathe shouldn't release it on DVD, Koch Lorber should - they're good about headlines). I Do not speak french. I can say here and there a syllable, order a drink and what not. That being said, this film was just like treatment. I could not fully appreciate the supposed "bawdy" humor or funny dialogue. Watching Deneuve and her cohorts was enough for me. I understood what was happening without the need for dialogue. It's really something he says about the movie when those who don't speak the language enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The camera is amazing. London is as adorable as cloaked son-in-law. She loved a lesbian mom. And of course, what can I say about our dear Mademoiselle Deneuve. She's one of a kind. The eyes, the smile. All day I could watch her movies. It really goes beyond beauty. People always say it's beautiful. Yes Yes. But she is also very talented. I trusted her every second of the way. Her talk about chocolate and vanilla with London is too sweet. Her character even gets arrested for smoking drugs with about 15 years old on the street. NENECH√ÅVAT! Fly to France and buy it if you have to. Great. 10
