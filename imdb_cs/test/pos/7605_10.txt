'Never been kissed' is a real good movie. If you haven't seen it yet, rent it. I'll buy it when I release it because I loved it. Drew Barrymore is excellent again, playing well. I felt that I could relate to this film because of the school days I had, just as bad. I thought the storyline was well written, it was comedy and romance, the kind of movies I love. I loved the end, because even if you know what's going to happen, he'll still let you sit on the edge of the waiting seat - expect !!
