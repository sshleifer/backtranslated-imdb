This movie has a great soundtrack and excellent play from several unknown faces. I especially like the Welsh docklands bad characters of the boy who are rushing around like American rappers who are working hard. Jipping between Jip and Koop is brilliant when they meet as best friends as if it were in real life. I've experienced some things in this movie and let me tell you at first hand that these people are not acting (especially with Jip and Koop and sniffing coke). Danny Dyer is invaluable as Moff's "party prescription" dealer and has the funniest lines in the movie ... <br /> <br /> "I'm the happiest when I'm off my pickle feeling of music, you get me I knew you wouldn't leave me, me it knew !!!
