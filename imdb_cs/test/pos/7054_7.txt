For the most part, I liked this movie, but I have to say that in addition to Bill Murray, there was someone else who wasn't that good. It brings energy into a role that shifts the film than it would otherwise be. I mainly like jokes pulled on one advisor and there are other funny things in this movie too such as a hot dog eating contest. This film would also set up a stage for summer camp films to compete at the end. Almost every camp movie has either this or a devious or problematic conspiracy of children, or a combination of both. This series would also have a somewhat strange shift in tone because these one and two are both family friendly movies while the third and four are adult oriented, rather like the old teen sexual comedy of that time. It's something that was the opposite of Police Academy films that went from R to PG-13 to PG movies. This series goes from the opposite of R. Still this first and only good one is worth laughing for the most part due to Bill Murray.
