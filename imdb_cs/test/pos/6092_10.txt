I've seen several movies in my time, but this is exceptional. You'll have to look at it more than once to really appreciate it, it's very emotionally complicated, it explores love and passion at the most extreme, and it's cinematography that's just breathtaking. The character of the Earl is intensely passionate and tragic, without having to raise his voice or actually leave his bed, the film is perfectly cast and behaved perfectly. The film has some mathematical precision and perfection that is rare these days. It combines action, love, tragedy, drama and politics in one. This film is unacceptable, all the hype about it and all the awards cannot start doing justice. Hats off Michael Ondaatje for writing the incredible book he is based on.
