Wow! What a beautiful, warm, country movie! The story focuses on Mi Taylor (Mickey Rooney), a young male rogue whose journey takes him to a quiet rural coastal town. There he stays with Brown's family. Velvet (Liz Taylor), their youngest daughter who gently befriends Me, has a passion for horses and wins the auction. This horse is a beautiful, chestnut stallion; his previous owner called a "murderous pirate," but Velvet named him Pie. Not long later, Velvet suggests to join him in the Grand National Race, Mi and her family are against the idea, but soon agree and Velvet and Mi began coaching him for Britain's most famous horse race? This film is a beautiful example of what British movies are. I remember seeing it for the first time when I was eight and on summer holidays. My parents recorded it from the TV and warmed it up immediately? I've been watching it for most of the days instead of the big Disney movie I've owned. <br /> <br /> I believe it was one of Liz Taylor's first movies and a good movie! Her character is naive but sweet? Her performances are extremely convincing, especially when she recounts her love for horses. It's also a good chance to see Angela Lansbury in one of her early roles; who is the star of the older sister Velvet who spends most of her time in the movie when she is struck by a city boy! I must say she was a beautiful lady when she was younger. Beautiful blond hair and pink face. Although they don't have a significant role in the film, they give a lot of scenes - so its fans won't disappoint! Parents reading this, I have to emphasize ??? if you can get a copy of this, please! If you love kids? I strongly recommend that you show them! They can find a few scenes boring, but you can see Velvet riding on many occasions throughout the movie and will be the most defiantly entertaining kids! Beautiful and nostalgic film. I could go away now and give it!
