I don't really know why this movie got so hostile when it was first released. Sure, it's lengthy and somewhat gratuitous in his portrayals of sexuality and violence, but so are a lot of well-regarded movies. I really don't think people who hated the "Heavenly Gate" really understood it. The "Gate of Heaven" in its uncut form, like the "Deer Hunter", shows the gross differences in the lives of insecure and dangerous life (such as immigrants and Averil in Wyoming) and living in comfort and privileges (as Americans settled) "in Wyoming and Averil in prologue and epilogue ". Living a hard life is painful, but it can also be encouraging as opposed to the dull life that Averil leads in the epilogue. Also, as Michael Cimino made great pains to make the image historically accurate, it is fascinating as a documentary (and perhaps allegations) of American life in Old West Wyoming. Dialogue is often truly smart and emotional. Combined with great music and cinema, the film works as a truly poetic work. It is true that the "Gate of Heaven", with the refusal to sponsor the viewer, is not for all tastes. However, Hollywood will show so much commercial dreck each year that is so much easier to condemn as mindless eye candy (although the example becomes a blockbuster) that "gate" and Cimino really deserve more respect. All people should review the full version at least once and then create their own opinion. <br /> <br />
