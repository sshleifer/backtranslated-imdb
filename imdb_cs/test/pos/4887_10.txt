Okay, I'm not sure it counts as a spoiler, so I checked the box anyway to save the trouble. I've noticed that the views on this movie seem to be a fair split. I loved him personally, although I must say that I think some of the portrait were there to have a portrait. (Peter Kay?) Personally, I am only grateful that it was not Edward, Tubbs and Papa Lazarou's show, and that they chose the 3 best characters in the series to make the film's title, especially Sir Goef Tipps, the funniest. bunch. Actually, this is less a summary of a more rather blunt blog-like thing, but what the hell, the movie was amazing, and I think that's all that counts.
