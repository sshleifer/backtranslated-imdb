Paha maa is another Finnish film. But things that make it different are copied abroad. Some narrative techniques are from Amores Perros, Jackie Brown and Elephant. The scenes are shot from different angles again. Paha maa is a good movie, but it's not so good that the hype says, "Realistic movie, no happy ending and no commercial confession." Some actors did a great job. Sulevi Peltola was as good as a vacuum cleaner. Jasper Pääkknen also shows his skills. But Mikko Leppilampi was so lame. He's such an overrated actor, he's a handsome and nice guy, but not the best actor in Finland. But if you like Finnish movies, it's worth seeing Paha maa.
