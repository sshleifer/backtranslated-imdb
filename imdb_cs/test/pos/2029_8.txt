What to say about a movie like Rock Star? Very much! This is a type of film that is almost critical to slam critics. It's also a film I, as a MAJOR Hard Rock fan who has enjoyed-no-loved in fact-while all very consciously aware of his many shortcomings and that film, while a decent effort in some ways missed the chance of having to escape to size and to become a classic of rock film. Oh well .... <br /> <br /> I loved this movie - and I would see it again and again - but I know it's purely based on my own personal tastes - Rock Star is a movie that will appeal to everyone who has experienced elements of rock or hard rock lifestyle and wants to go on the road to nostalgia. It was a great time for metal heads. And it's nice to have a movie that effectively captures that (long forgotten by many non-rock fans.) Time effectively as I think Rock Star did. This is one of the strengths of the movie, concert shots. Will you feel like them and how could a hard rock fan not love it? When it comes to setting the Rock Star atmosphere gets 10 out of 10. It also gets 10 out of 10 for pure fun. If you want the movie to just let go and free flow into some great memories of the good times of the past, then it's a movie for you. That's why I loved this movie. But it's not a great movie. I understand that and it was my real job to professionally review movies, I would have to be a little hard on it. The problem with a rock star is the development of characters. What is wrong with character development is that there is no one. None. The film has a few scenes-little and far away, but they ARE there that DO touch on size: WARNING Brief SCENE SPOILERS: 3 Examples-1) when Izzy debuts on stage (including the fall he takes) <br /> <Br / > 2) First "after the show" party with Emily (Anniston and Izzy.) <br /> <br /> 3) Backtracking a bit-At the beginning, when the original lead singer is accidentally released (burned) -the whole tone of "trade like usually “is the basis of what will come. It is played very efficiently. But the problem is that nothing comes. There is no one in this film who has no character, the personality of the people only touches but is never fully explored. I don't think it's an actor / actress's fault, especially Anniston, who's trying hard, they just don't have much work to do. It's just that the script was weak and lacked the ability to go beyond the "formula" to feel the actual depth of the movie. The rock star was sometimes covered with sugar (including the end), it was almost ridiculous. And although the scenes I mentioned WERE were excellent and very believable, unfortunately, there was not much more in the film. Another reviewer mentioned a lack of buildup and I agree, but in fact it was a lack of buildup on NICH. Why does Izzy leave? Because he's missing his girlfriend and the band won't let him write songs? Tests trust limits. And frankly, the end was just scaly. It made no sense and had no reality at all. When you watch it, it's almost like watching a movie in which the creators said: OK, this is happening here and then it happens and then it etc. And so on. It is no longer a film about a boy who has fulfilled a dream, it's just another heavily formulated love story. And you wonder why so much detail is left out .... <br /> <br /> I hope I'm not going to be tough on Rock Star because I really loved it - but not for the right reasons. I would love to love it as a great movie about the highs and lows of rock fame. Instead, I loved him for the 80s, feeling, clothes, hair, lights, life .... Although many others loved it, I think most people who lived the life of a rock fan like me or some who play. I liked it when I saw that the film was overcome and that it was necessary to be respected for being a good film instead of a cliché. I think one of the problems was length. I hate long movies myself, but this was really what should have been longer, if the movie was really right, the length wasn't felt - it's just a lot to the story to be as short as it was. This is one of the reasons why the development of a story or human beings does not appear to be in the film. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you can get to spin down. - but not a great movie. Look at the fun. Look at the fun. Let's look at going back to that big, big space at a time when metal wasn't just a part of life, it was life - and for those non-rock fans - to see a little bit of life that meant and still means so many of us.
