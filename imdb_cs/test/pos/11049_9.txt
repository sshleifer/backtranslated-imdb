And with those words, one of the big movie advertising campaigns came to a conclusion. "Garbo Talks" and those words spoke in her first sound film, an adaptation of Eugen O'Neil's play Anna Christie. Unlike some other players and other studios, MGM has tried hard to find a suitable vehicle for Greta Garbo. Many of the players who were in the universal medium of silent film would lose their career because of interviews. Their heavy native accents get in the way, some didn't know any English. It was no coincidence that Anna Garie was selected for Garbo. First, that he is the author of one of the leading American playwrights, it was her literary possession that would appeal to her. Second, because the title role was someone who was Swedish, this accent could be explained. Eventually, a lot of knots from early interviews worked out, though Anna Christie was still using cover cards. Like most O'Neil's works, it's a short but long and deep action. characterization. The story takes place on New York's embankment, where Garbo, as Anna came to live with her father George Marion. Marion ran away a few years ago when Anna was a child and Marion left her wife. Anna had to do what she could to survive in the adult world, including prostitution. Marion is, of course, happy to see her, even digging Marie Dressler, the old quay she lives. with years to create space for their body and blood. Obviously, Marion and Garbo have their own problems, and they are not easy when they give shelter to a sailor played by Charles Bickford who chooses Garbo. Marion repeats his role from the original Broadway production. Anna's role on stage was performed by Pauline Lord. Anna Christie ran for 177 performances in the 1921-22 season on Broadway. It is one of O'Neil's most famous works and the one that often revives. Of course, Garbo's performance with perfect diction and Swedish accent was appreciated, and her future in sound films was assured. Greta Garbo won an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and the film also received nominations for Clarence Brown as Best Director and William Daniels for Cinematography. Above all, Daniels should get a lot of things to photograph the scenes of the scene. And Brown created the mood around the waterfront where the movie is set. The work of Eugen O'Neil is timeless, so Anna Christie does not, with the many pitfalls of early sound films, list the path of many films. of this era. Garbo also shows that she has mastered the subtlety needed to work in an audio medium. Anna Christie is a classic, all the way.
