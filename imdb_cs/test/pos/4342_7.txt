DEATH WISH 3's Paul Kersey is very far from Paul Kersey's original film. If you remember the 1974 movie, then you remember that Kersey was "Conchie" during the Korean War and that he was physically ill after committing his first execution. Ten years later, Kersey seems to have learned an unarmed struggle and how to deal with anti-tank weapons in his spare time. But I overlook the gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequel, lowlife scum bags are shot, burned alive, teeth broken and thrown to the middle of the housewife, armed with sweeping brushes. Yeah, I know gang members are multinational, and they deserve some recognition for that, but even if they're not racists, they're still killing the scum that deserves everything they get from Kersey and innocent citizens. Who needs Rudy Mayor when you have Paul Kersey, an anti-tank missile and a lot of old-age retirees who could return the streets from the creeps. Paul Kersey Hello, sir
