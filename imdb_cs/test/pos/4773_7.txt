... But it's also Minnie and Pete! Yes, a grumpy captain doesn't have to look like Pete, but it is! Mickey and Minnie are the best characters, both are very nice and likeable. Interestingly, Minnie is more of a lady than what she is today, and Mickey is less than considerate in this regard. Pete is still old, but she looks a little different. In this famous episode, aboard a small steamboat, Mickey, Minnie and some side figures have a lot of fun and a lot of inconvenience. Even in their first performances, the three main characters are highly developed. <br /> <br /> I like this episode, although overall I prefer Mickey Mouse in the future. I like animation, steamer and musical theme, smart gags - and of course Mickey and Minnie! Like many earlier cartoons, it's very random, Walt came up with a very basic plot and just added gags to "gear" it together. There is also a parrot side character that is very unpleasant and rather unnecessary. These are the things I don't like about it. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about this episode is that the color version wasn't created for her (or I never heard of it)! Everyone who likes Mickey Mouse and Disney will enjoy it.
