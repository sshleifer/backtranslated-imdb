Okay, so I loved Rachael Ray, but now, INTRODUCING her! How innovative. I love having a cooking section - I admit that sometimes I skip the part just because I'm doing WAAAY too hungry! But also glad you can get to the next day on the next website. I like to have regular helpers and that her audience has become her staff. I love how personal it is and how creative it is. I also like how she makes her Mysterious Guests. It seems to be much more true than many other talk show hosts. He still gets a little bit of starter and I like it. I love that she talks about her personal life there and reminds people how happy she is. She mentioned the tabloids yet and it is so fun! It also has the funniest stories! By the way, I'm a fan for life. Even my 2 years knows who Rachael Ray is and also loves her!
