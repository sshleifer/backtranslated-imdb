I have just seen this broadcast on Channel 4. When I saw some earlier comments, I think I would like to begin by saying that I am not for the death penalty. With this I was expecting a great thing about this movie from what I did, but it just couldn't. Dead Man Walking is very cleanly executed, with good performance all the time and a good script. In fact, it's hard to miss it artificially. However, I felt that although he had tried to confront questions about the death penalty, he seemed to be set aside from a religious / moral stance (barely surprising given that the main character is a nun). Although I am not a heartless individual, I did not actually feel any character in the story. If you don't take religion seriously, you probably won't see much in this movie. I think Peter Medak Let It Have It was a much stronger and more moving movie and I would strongly recommend anyone who would watch it to see it.
