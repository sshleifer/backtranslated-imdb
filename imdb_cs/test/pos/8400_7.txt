This miniseries is a reasonable continuation of the original Gone With The Wind. When we look at our own merits (and not immediately after the original), it comes out quite well. I'm sure most viewers will question Scarlet and Rhett's performance, but it is unlikely anyone else can do better. Many of the characters here are new in this story, so a comparison in these cases (Rhett's mother, Uncle Henry Hamilton, Will Benteen) is not a problem. No one will be Vivien Leigh or Clark Gable. The best part of the whole production is the beautiful scenery of spring Charleston and Ireland. Watch it yourself. Of course it was a high budget miniseries. For a while it follows a book, then has a whole new story when Scarlett goes to Ireland. Acting is trusted if nothing special - the way I feel about Roger Moore after Sean Connery James Bond.
