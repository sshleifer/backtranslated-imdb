May contain spoilers. This is just a good movie. Lots of good stupid things to laugh at. However, do not look at the TV version, they cut on a lot out. Deluise's house is more amazing than the Don Mafioso hired to kill Robin. All I can say about his ten minutes: it's a long trip from Jersey. Also, you need to love them by checking the script to make sure Robin gets another shot. Also: 12th Century Fox. <br /> <br /> Any Bad Things? Rapists at the beginning and at the end seem to be dated. The songs were rather lame. Once while watching this movie, I was able to think a few times when they could throw into another joke or 2. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, the movie experience is pleasant. Must watch comedy fans.
