Zeke Rippy (Mic) is great, you absolutely believe his character. And it's scary like hell, I spent half the film covering my eyes, the other half on the edge of my seat. It's great to see something so exciting and scary that it's not all blood and gut - but it gave me bad dreams. Basically it's a great movie - you'll see the first chance you'll get.
