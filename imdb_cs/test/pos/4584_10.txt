I've never heard of this movie when a good friend recommended it. I believe this friend has a taste, so I bought a DVD. My wife and I sat down to look at it without knowing what it was about. I thought it was the funniest movie I had seen for a long time, mainly because I saw the truth in satire. I highly recommend this movie to all my friends. It's not a movie for everyone. Some people see crass humor and aura of stupidity, and find the Idiocracy to be one of the dumbest films they have seen. What these people seem to have misunderstood is that there is humorous humor, not an entertaining audience, but a show of what appeals to morons in the future. Luke Wilson is well cast "average Joe." He is mainly there to be hostile to the scathing commentary on the company that is widespread in this film. Many of the funnier bits are in the background, so it's easy to see them several times. What makes the film even more fun and frightening is that I see its elements in everyday life, in the people I meet, or in the media. Then I come back and follow Idiocracia and realize how good it is. Several people who have seen and enjoyed the film can be part of an elite club. I'll see an advertisement for a product with some breakthrough new ingredient and turn to my wife and say, "He has electrolytes!" He knows exactly what I'm saying.
