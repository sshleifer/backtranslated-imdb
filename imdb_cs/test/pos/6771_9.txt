Not quite sure how I came across this movie, but I'm so glad I did it. At first we were postponed because it was a subtitle, but even my dyslexic brother who hates reading (especially at the weekend) enjoyed this movie. I found that the script was fantastic and the way it was released in such a way that it was added to the puddle on my couch. It is not entirely certain that it is so funny for native Danish, as the comedy seems to be amplified by the subtlety of subtitles and ambiguity in translation. I haven't followed many Danish movies (or something like that), but judging by this film, I guessed they were not limited by the same political correctness as elsewhere (gawd blesses me) to make the character of Eigel breath fresh air because let's admit that special needs are funny. There are so many great movie players in this movie that shame the US sitcom.
