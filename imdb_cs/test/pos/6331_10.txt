Although it is not exactly a comedy in the usual sense of the word, it is much more beneficial than any movie full of laughter but without substance. I don't think Bergman's movies can easily be put into narrow genres, even the lightest ones are quite complex. Despite its light touch, this film presents a number of problems related to marriage and its shortcomings, and what happens when flames begin to die, etc. In fact, I do not communicate personally with these problems because I am sure others do. But the atmosphere of the film is extraordinary, you almost want it to not end. I must admit that I was frustrated by the Bergman of the 1950s when I met most of his later pioneering efforts. Before Nykvist, von Sydow, Ulman, etc. He created a master of some of the richest, warmest and moving films I've ever seen. Although it is a long shot, I have seen this kind of love for the human species, in its complexity, only in Fellini's films of the same period. Lessons in love alongside Smiles of the Summer Night are worth seeing Bergman fans, having a full picture of the man's abilities and those who love cinema with heart. Let him rest in peace!
