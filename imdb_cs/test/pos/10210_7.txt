While escaping from the bank robbery, outlaw Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) helps Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), the chief engineer of Western Union, who deals with the wild west and has a horse accident. In 1861, Vance regenerates and is hired to work for Western Union with a team that installs bars and cable from Omaha to Salt Lake City. Vance and Harvard engineer Richard Blake (Robert Young) flirt with Edward's beautiful sister Sue Creighton (Virginia Gilmore) and picks Vance. However, his past haunts him when outlaw Jack Slade (Barton MacLane) steals Western Union cattle masked by Indians. "Western Union" is a good but predictable western directed by Fritz Lang. The story shows the difficulties of brave and idealistic men responsible for installing a telegraph across the West, facing thieves and Indians. The fun story has action, dramatic, romantic and funny situations, but with the exception of Jack Slade's identity, there's no surprise in the story. Randolph Scott gives another spectacular performance with great cast. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Conquistadores" ("Conquerors")
