This show is best that is full of laughter and Kevin James is the best, so if you want a good show I recommend the King of Queens and his postponement that they canceled it, so at the end of this show you will forget your worries and cause problems if you have cast with Kevin James and Jerry Stiller can't go wrong. so i don't know why canceled show if someone knows please tell me.now days you can't find a lot of shows that meet your needs as an audience. After Seinfeld and the Queen of Queens the only show worth watching a prison break and if it stops, I don't know what to do. In the end, if I had to recommend the show it will be King of Queens.
