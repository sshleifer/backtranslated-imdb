Rather than going to a place and making a realistic movie about drug addiction in Windy City, Opposing Director Otto Preminger decided to go in the opposite direction and his film seems as artificial as possible, so flying in the face of fashion that men like . Kazan, Huston and Zinnemann, who made their photos around the world. Nelson Algren, whose novel the film is based on, continued to record as contemptuous. What, one miracle, was Preminger until, and why did he make the film that way? <br /> <br /> The sets in the movie are so minimal as to design Mr. Magoo's cartoon. Louie, a drug pusher, is familiar with being a gangster used by artists in Mad Magazine. Arnold Stang, a wonderful comedian who has been, appears to be in such a serious image and his appearance, which is an exaggerated exaggerated baseball cap, provokes laughter. Robert Strauss, another best-known actor for humorous roles, is also out of place because his big, heavily gripped face and Runyonesque lines delivery looks more appropriate to Jerry Lewis's film. Against that, the stars Frank Sinatra, Kim Novak and Eleanor Parker have to work overtime to keep the viewer shaking. Sinatra is nervous and manic throughout the world, suggesting that a person is cool with himself, and is therefore perfectly suited to the role of an addict. Miss Novak, plant and sublimally dead, is sympathetic and seems to be the product of the artfully filthy slums they love in the film. Parker is pure Hollywood and very hard working as a crippled and wily Zosch. He is never convincing, but then not a film. I would not recommend this film to anyone interested in a realistic picture of the life of drug addicts in America. Caligari sets do it by themselves. Preminger might have been trying for a dream effect, because the cardboard background gives the churches an incredible sense of opera nightmare, which may be returning to Preminger's first days in Vienna.
