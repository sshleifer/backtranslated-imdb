Okay, I marked this spoiler, so don't be upset when I wrap it up. Now I went to the movie and expected to see a very predictable movie. And I was right, because almost every horror movie I've ever seen was predictable, but not as bad as most of the others. The story helped us, I didn't expect Kane to be mad. But she was there, and somewhat hazy, you still have an idea and you understand the madness. Of course, if you like something that will scare you for the night to come it is not the movie you are looking for. But if your Saw fan or some other movies claiming that their fame due to sadistic content is a movie to watch. Now where I really throw a spoiler on the second warning. I give this movie 9 perhaps because I'm a WWE fan and a Kane fan, but who doesn't like the movie a little better when playing someone we love. However, this movie could have a score of 10 for me IF. . . (spoiler) ----> at the end of the movie as he showed Kane dead on the sidewalk. While the dog angry at his eye was "CUTE", he could be classic with a quick seven Kane / Undertaker and a head turn. A perfect 10 would be awarded if it happened. It was a great opportunity, but neither did WWE think about it, nor the next sequel that begins with what I mentioned. That is all. (9)
