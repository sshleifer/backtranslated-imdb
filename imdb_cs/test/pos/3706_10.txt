Mommy should have a really different title to distinguish her from all the other films that are called mum or mum in the title. <br /> <br /> This is an incredibly better zombie movie for so much garbage it gets out of time from time to time and everyone ends up just like any other zombie movie. It is so different and refreshing that it almost defies categorization. a kind old lady who marries a haunted guest who just happens to be a meat eater who then infects an old lady who also turns into a zombie or ghoul-eating body, which exactly not defined. There is pathos in the story as her son realizes what has happened, and at the same time horrified, tries to help her by supplying 'food'. (I'm not going to say more about it, for fear of inserting a spoiler!) It's one of those "silent" films as opposed to gun blasting, raging explosions, chasing cars, etc. Boring, etc., but still with cruel moments to satisfy horror fans and at the same time putting sadness in the story, along with a nice hint of humor as opposed to the sheer stupidity of some so-called "horror" movies. There is a particularly nice atmospheric shot at the beginning of the movie where the old lady sits alone in her room with her Christmas tree for the company and looks so "innocent" but what happens !! Oh my! The jewel of the film, even if not your thing, should at least be viewed if only once every horror fan.
