John Ford paid his cars to his special film "Wagon Master", which was created after two major episodes of Indian cavalry ... It's a beautiful poetic film full of romanticized reincarnation of a pioneering spirit ... It didn't have the big peak that preceded it ... < br /> <br /> It is very easy to photographically ... The camera moves only once or twice throughout the film and never when the director makes a move to underline the shot ... Ford even resists the temptation to watch his camera in the breathtaking twilight the shots of women wearily marching in the dust for cars ... They come and go while the camera remains motionless and viewers remain viewers of history, not a participant ... Of course, when Ford wants to engage its audience emotionally or dramatically, as in 'Stagecoach,' how to do it ... But "Wagon Master" is a gentle, nostalgic look backwards ... <br /> <br /> Filled with traditional West The other songs created by The Sons of Pioneers tell the West trek to Utah (in 1879) of the Mormon wagon train led by Ward Bond as Elder Wiggs and two young horse traders (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr). And in a series of beautiful pictures of how the wagon train fights outlaws, Indians, and nature to fight for the "Promised Land", the modest "Wagon Master" manages to capture the history and legend of the West ... <br /> <br /> Ford he himself said that the 'Wagon Master' (about which he wrote the original story) was one of his three films, "closest to what I wanted to achieve". Ford's career as a Western director was overwhelming ... More than anyone else, he was able to use the genre to protect his feelings about family, society and the American way of life ... Ford saw the border as a country to be muted a special class of settlers and lawyers whose great sacrifices make the country safe from those who come ... These morning residents were giants who deserved the legendary status they had acquired, and the civilized townspeople who followed them must always keep them in Fear and reverence ... Ford Westerns often use flashbacks to emphasize the historical and authenticity of its approach ... For example, in "Wagon Master", folk songs on the soundtrack tell us about the pioneers' problems a hundred years ago and Ford shows them in an almost documentary fashion ... In one sequence, the train is encircled in a circle and the settlers r to hold a square dance ... To create a dance floor, they have to lay boards over the desert sand and with this ritual celebration Ford shows the defeat of the wilderness through the landing metaphor ... <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful movie, full of amazing optimism and it's easy to understand why Ford found it so satisfactorily? Does it never violate the faith with the mood and style set in the first few sequences? But will he wonder if the ultra-romantic best suits the chosen theme? The experience of a wagon train must have been one of the most physically demanding and nerve-intensive practices that a man (with his womankind) ever built himself? Had it to be riddled with doubts? Was I wrong to sell everything and come? How can we hope to survive? How will we fight the other end of almost every next painful step of the journey? However, none of these feelings actually go through. The way this is general storm? Doesn't it make one so dangerous? Could it be, of course, that the Mormons were so "high" in the religious spirit that it tended to act as an anesthetic? In other words, their reactions were not those that had normal human weakness ... If yes, Ford was right and the doubters were wrong? What is unquestionable is the right and proper upset, especially at the first meeting of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr.. This is the essence of a light adventurous youth, especially one who feels Western youth of those extraordinary times? Is it a remarkable relationship and remains in mind?
