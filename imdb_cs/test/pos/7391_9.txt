When I first saw this movie, I wanted to like it for many reasons, but not. It seemed a little boring. But there was a little question I had about something I saw at the beginning of the movie, so I saw it again? and finally it clicked on me. At first I watched a movie that knew it was a "surprising end", and although I definitely wouldn't recommend having a break spoiled for you, I still really enjoyed the film and discovered many seemingly insignificant events that all reveal, a very ominous scheme. I don't think everyone will love this movie or even love it. If you like an actor, you will enjoy this movie because acting is quite strong and everyone gets a lot of time on the screen. If you like the mystery (namely Hitchcock), you will enjoy this movie. If you like independent or psychological movies, you will enjoy this movie. It really worked at all these levels. If you don't like actors, mysterious conspiracies or psychological elements, you may not like this movie. But that's your loss. The only thing that bothered me a little was the accents. Good try, Alan Rickman, in the American dialect, but it wasn't much improvement from the scene in Die Hard. (A beautiful voice is for a strange accent.) The movie's ball of accents was a bit strange, but it wasn't so distracting that it would be difficult or particularly irritating. Also, changing the camera from the scene to the scene was evident and could bother some people, but I think it was added to the scenes (or the scene? I just remember one scene where the change was very different but worked). <br /> <br /> When you see this movie, you'll see it at least twice. The second time you see it, I hope you realize how complicated the story is. Every time I watch this movie (it's less than an hour and a half, so many views aren't difficult), it seems to me that I've noticed something else and I wonder, "Why did it happen?" or "Was it intentional?" I like movies that think me. He does this. So you see it. Twice.
