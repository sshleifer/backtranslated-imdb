Excellent entry into the RKO Saint series with a well written original script, good camera and transitions, good direction to handle some twist twists, good editing to maintain constant flow and good behavior. George Sanders is great and funny. Jonathan Hale is simply Inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a gangster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he can't accept the pressure. It will be returned in a later serial listing. The story begins on an ocean-going liner heading to the US where the saint meets but cannot contact Wendie Barrie. Eventually he succumbs to his spell, but eventually breaks his heart. Saint assists Inspector Fernack to delete the name from the frame. Several bodies fall on the road. Good fun and above average for this type of movie. Bach.
