This movie was made shortly after Karen went through that maybe Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen felt a little guilty about how they could contribute to her health problems. As years have passed (almost 25 to be exact), it has been easier to deny any complicity. Richard spent years after Karen's death by endless remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin, Mary, and from what I read he seems to be planning another generation of carpenters with his children. It seems he regretted this movie, and that may be why it is not available in any form. It seemed to me that it was a fairly honest assessment of the tragically short life and incredible talent Karen Carpenter was.
