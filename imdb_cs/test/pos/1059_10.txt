Barbara Stanwyck is absolutely delighted in this war comedy, about a sailor who is invited to Christmas with a family of a popular magazine, on a Connecticut farm. The problem is that she doesn't have a husband, a child or a farm, as she writes about it in a column, and can't even cook; her wonderful recipes provided by her good friend "Uncle" Felix, the owner of a Hungarian restaurant in New York. Things get even more complicated when her strict publisher boss invites you to Christmas. The scheme is hastily planned, with her fake spouse providing a genuine Connecticut farm, borrowed neighbors, and a scheduled wedding when the publisher doesn't look. But when a handsome young sailor arrives on Christmas Eve, romantic complications arise because the supposedly married author falls like a ton of bricks for a nice Navy man and vice versa. This is a charming, warm movie that deftly balances humor with sentiment, and it's an amazing show for Barbara Stanwyck to show off her considerable comedy talent with the help of such amazing actors as Greenstreet Sydney, Una O Connor, SZSakall and many others. The Christmas night dance at City Hall is a toe tapping pleasure to see, and the unexpectedly sweet and feminine side of Stanwyck is an amazing surprise for viewers who have seen it mainly as a heavy, biting woman in femme fatale roles. Really beautiful movie that passed the time test.
