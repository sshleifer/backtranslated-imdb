I'm glad I have HBO now. I didn't plan to watch the movie today, but when I got home and saw that the next HBO movie was this one, I decided (based on the description) to at least do it. I'm so glad I decided to watch this movie! Maybe this movie just caught me in a vulnerable moment (I'm a bit stressed out, I got a huge test I was supposed to study), but it certainly gave me a pretty sure look at friendship, not to mention teaching me a valuable lesson on empathy. Currently, I am one year away from graduating from a pharmacy and the whole scene with a doctor and a nurse was definitely a learning place for me! Anyway, I wanted the world to know it's an amazing movie and don't miss it. There is definitely something for everyone in this movie!
