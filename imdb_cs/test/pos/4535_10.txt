Saint Schnikey! This movie rocks! Chris Farley and David Spade are great together. My favorite parts are "Fat Guy in a Little Coat, Oh My God, Room Service and Other Scenes That Will Be Remembered for the Years. This movie has a huge cult follower, I wonder why it proves that even eleven years after Chris Farley tragic death and still popular, playing Tommy, who will laugh at you every time you watch him, he's a great comedian and misses spade reminds me of Dan Akyroid, while Chris Farley reminds me of John Belushi. the film needs to be bought and should be in every collection of Snl fans.
