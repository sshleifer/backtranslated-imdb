Films belonging to the genre of "film noir" usually contain similar elements: "deus ex machina" conspiracy that drives the main character into bed, nice but psychotic girls, nice but psychotic thief, lots of money, a lot of brutality, and usually denouement in the desert . You mean "High Sierra" or "White Heat". There is plenty of hard night movie. But when the film noir is good, you can't take your eyes off the train wreck of human lives. <br /> <br /> This second tradition is "Blind Spot". The film follows Danny Alton, a troubled teenager (he played great with the depth, grace, emotional integrity and stinginess of James Franco, who plunges into the role), who fell in love with the rough street house of Darcy. /> <br /> You know from the beginning that it will be bad. Darcy invites Danny to his house. But the house is empty and for sale and bloody control of thousands of dollars is on the floor. Danny is robbed of his clothes and possessions, but he uses a check to track down a suicide April - another Darcy lover. When they arrive at Darcy's real home, they find Wayne - Darcy's robbers for the money they stole from him. Together, three succeed in finding Darcy in a dusty motel in the desert. But this is just the beginning of the story, such as plastic explosives, drugs, weapons, scary funerals, bisexual assassins and a lonely semi-finished house in the desert bringing events to an explosive head in the aisle at the tattoo parlor. Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> This movie features some of the best noir movies I've seen in years. In one scene, Danny walks across the desert to a half-finished house in the desert, believing that gangsters had taken Darcy that evening. A very long shot with sharp light effects shows Danny - arms and legs, trembling, tangible fear engraved on his face (visible at this distance), a cloud of dust that drags behind him as the wind whips in his direction - running through the desert apartments towards the house. Loneliness, despair, despair that Danny feels is shocked. In this film there are many such scenes, beautifully created by experienced Maxim Munzi. This is Oscar-winning material. Adjustments are also stunning. The film contains small moments when the characters gain insight into themselves or into their situation. Time bits, when memories and memories come back. At this time, a quick image montage will appear on the screen. This is an excellent editing by director-writer-editor Stephan Woloszczuk. In one early cut, Danny describes the amazing feelings she has now that Darcy has entered his life. Quick slides of Danny's diary flash across the screen: the words "4 life," "lucky" and "safe" stop for a while while the page on the page of words, the content of the human heart, the race across the screen - out of focus, too read quickly. It's like a flood of emotions Danny feels alone. The flood of images reveals something else about this film: How Beautiful is the Design of Nathaniel Waters. Darcy's quonset-hut home is a perfect match for high-tech and freedom (a tribute to Centric decorator Kimberly Foster). The stunning scene of the desert house is just scary. The ruin of the motel where Darcy hides is located in an abandoned town in America. A gruesome (and overwhelmingly illuminated) funeral home, where the plot takes a terrible turn, combines the sharpness with a variety of deaths hanging over the film. (It's too bad that a film director doesn't count.) This film has an excellent production design that enhances each individual actor's performance and performance. This is the fourth element of this film that makes it catch and hold on to you: acting. James Franco is an excellent actor. Even in "Spider-Man" - where he practically did nothing - he showed that he understood human emotions as no other actor of his generation. He's not a handsome boy who looks like Brad Pitt on his good looks. Franco portrays deep emotions with full force. His performances include a pure human heart. Consider a scene in a phone booth outside a funeral home where Danny collapses when she tells April and Wayne that Darcy is dead. Smaller actors could not eliminate the complete emotional collapse of a human being. Franco does it. Shawn Montgomery, in his first film, will simply blow you off as a suicide April. Deeply in love with Darcy, suffering from massive depression after having to bury his own unborn child (after the fetus spontaneously interrupts) in a perfume box in the woods, her life of luxury and perfection is now ruined: April is one of the best. drawn characters on a movie I have ever seen. While Danny's relationship with Darcy is slowly teased during the film, the April nerve breakdown is only revealed to viewers. Neither Danny nor Wayne is interested in her as a human being. April's desperation, realizing that Danny was also Darcy's darling, is irritated and powerful, even though it is shortened by the total inability of the character to feel any emotion for a long time. Montgomery brings the pathos to April that gives you a heart through the wringer. Mark Patrick Gleason gets the hardest job in the movie: He has to do something human and real from a thief, Wayne. Initially, Wayne is simply one of the many violent, outrageous, obsessed drug shooters / shooters who appear in any number of films (from "Copa Mindergarten" to "Beverly Hills Cop 2"). Gleason is doing very well with what he is given, but he doesn't get too much in Wayne. It's hard to say whether it's Gleason's problem or material. There is One Moment - Where Wayne (who is Darcy's brother, though neither Danny nor April know it) reads Danny's diary and realizes the sexual and emotional connection between two men - where you just know that Wayne will go homophobic on Danny's ass . But the explosion never comes. (Thank God! Trite lands are the death of film noir.) As soon as the sibling revelation appears at the end of the movie, viewers are quite impressed when they realize the depth of love and compassion that Wayne really felt for Darcy - so deep that Wayne accepted Danny's homosexual love for his bisexual brother. But all of this is happening off the screen. Gleason never has a chance to act on Wayne's feelings. It must be very frustrating for the performer. The story is somewhat inventive, though the smuggling facility seen at the end of the movie is likely to remind viewers of "Diamonds Are Forever" (yes, James Bond). The traditional voice narration (which proves that Franco is such a great voice talent as a physical actor) provides an amazing atmosphere, although it tends to flow into the schmaltz several times towards the end of the film (which provides unintentional laughter). Amazing locations play key visual roles in the movie. Kudos to place scout to find such amazing buildings! The end of the film hit me a little; not pat, but a bit too much for my noir movie tastes. Now I saw the audience either hate or love the "Blind Spot". The modern film audience, exposed to the most severe brutality and violence, often has little appreciation for the subtlety of film noir. My suggestion is to take a small group of friends who don't see despair, emotional collapse, despair or depression. Take them to a small theater where they can see a film vision, but watching them will not be destroyed by a crowd of people who do not recognize a good film noir. Give them some popcorn (trust me they'll be so submerged they won't finish), give them soda and let them be amazed. Go somewhere bright and cheerful to wash the dirt and the horror of the soul. Because this film is so good that you feel, you'll need this fill.
