I watched this movie for the first time after finishing the book last week. What's the problem? People admit that the shows are great - I think Lange is stellar - and the movie is nice but less than 6 '! I do not get it. Come on! Writing is not so bad! After reading many Pulitzer's winning novels and after seeing a lot of movies based on them, I think better than decent work was done in the script. I thought the disassembly of the whole dialogue in the novel was done almost perfectly. This story had a pretty strong dialogue in it, and the story appeared on the screen, even though only part of it was used. <br /> <br /> ** BOOK SPOILER PART ** I was nevertheless, a little disappointed with Ginny-try-to-kill-Rose subplot is omitted. I thought it was one of the more emotionally unpleasant parts of the book, but it was probably a good bet. Avid film visitors, I think more than avid readers tend to be less forgiving protagonists who are pulling antagonistic things. Johnny Lunchpail and Joe Sixpack are confused. <br /> <br /> If you love the book, you'll love the movie. If you hate the book, you'll probably hate the movie. <br /> <br /> ******** Rog
