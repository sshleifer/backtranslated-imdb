Ok I'm a huge Traci fan, so her just in the movie automatically makes it a rank of 8.5+ ratings. But beyond her being, I thought it was a good movie, especially since it's a HBO movie. But I'm afraid if you take Traci from the movie, it'll just be ok. But you can't do that and he's a beautiful actress. It is just getting better and better.
