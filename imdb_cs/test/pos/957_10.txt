I have to admit, I loved this film absolutely. Of course I'm sure you know that "Malcolm is in the middle" of Frankie Muniz, and still so sweet Amanda Bynes "Amanda Show" has played in this children's comedy as two friends that I am sure we can all return. on. The film is about a boy named Jason Shepard (Frankie) and his friend Kaylee (Amanda), who go on an adventure in Hollywood. SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> As it starts, Jason is a typical 14-year-old boy who is lying around his everyday life problems. One day Jason is hit by Mr. Wolf (a great bad director). Jason's English paper stole Wolf and started an adventure with kaylee to win his father's trust. They fly to Hollywood in search of Wolf to get him back. Frankie and Amanda do all sorts of crazy bits to get Wolf back, and all he has to do is call Father Jason and tell him he stole his idea. But the end is not a real surprise, it is good proveles and victory. The story is cute and the fifth year of humor, but what do you expect to be rated PG. I really believe it's one of the best family comedies. Not only do kids behave well, they are exceptionally cast, well-written, but it's good pure fun. That made me laugh, as well as falling in love with his innocent report. I highly recommend it and would like to disagree with who gave him ten out of ten. Unemployed critics are not unemployed for anything. I give it (well I voted ten out of ten) perfect.
