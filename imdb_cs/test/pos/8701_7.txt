King Vladislav (Angus Scrimm) of Romania is a vampire, but a vampire of light who wants nothing more than to live in peace and harmony with humanity. But his son, Radu (Anders Hove), is a cruel creature in his heart (which is clear when you see him). Three students came to study local folklore, but they found themselves in vampire legends at the wrong time: Vladislav was killed. Who Can Tell Something Wrong About A Movie Featuring A Portrait From Angus Scrimm? I can not. I wanted to say that I had a few low expectations after seeing more full moon images (especially "puppet master" and "demonic toys"). But despite the really bad animated effects of the demons, this movie was actually really well done and very fun to watch. Lots of blood, good plot and backstage (the story of Bloodstone was surprisingly refreshing) and even some new angles to the vampire mythos you think would be dead now. (Maybe I'm wrong, but this is probably the first movie on which rosaries appear to have been thrown out of the gun.) In addition to vampires and blood, you get a share of nudity (unreasonably, but welcome) and I have noticed an excellent score from composers (not sure who deserves credit, but those included Stuart Brotman, Richard Kosinski, William Levine, Michael Portis and John Zeretzka). This is Horror 101. Damn, you even get two sequels, which is a true horror movie. (Of course, some of the bad movies will go on to the next sequel - I mentioned "Puppet Master"?) The Romanian theme was well done and the film seems to have been created by the Romanians if I guess their origins correctly. And the score - music - really was like a nice change in tempo, mood setting for me. I like the Richard Band, but I'm glad another songwriter got a chance because he pushed the atmosphere on his head. If you like vampire movies and want a slight variation (one of Eastern European varieties), it's worth seeing.
