Wow, Stella shorts are great! Lots of patrons from State and Stella, TV show. I never knew Stella could get to a better level than on Stella or even on Comedy Central Presents: Stella. I never knew that short comedies could be good. My favorite was Pizza, Racking Leaves, The Woods, and David took care of meeting his long-lost cousin Greg. I think David was the funniest. It's funny when it doesn't make sense. I like music in shorts. That's something I pay attention to. They always had good taste in music. I wish to have even shorts, either do it or bring a sitcom there. I hope they will continue with a good and funny comedy.
