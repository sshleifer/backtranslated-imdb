Again, I read all the comments posted here and agreed with many intelligent, but totally disagree with those who think it was / is a hokum. Personally, I think nuclear power is the only energy we will have if our governments (the federals and states) do not increase the subsidies that homeowners will use photocells on their roofs. Many attractive and expensive houses in southern Calfiforn are designed and built to take advantage of the purest energy around the sun. I live in the attic, which is exposed to the whole sun on the roof all day. I hardly use AC - I'm sure it would consume too much electricity to convert the intense heat in the attic to about five degrees of cooler. We are blessed with "dry" heat in this part of the country. I'm from the Gulf of America, so I know about moisture ....... <br /> <br /> As I said, I found that "Chinese Syndrome" is a convincing film about what might go wrong. if the industry is not busy regulating and inspecting nuclear power plants. I think there are enough comments to shed light on those who are still afraid of them as plague: they are safe. TMI is still on-line .... <br /> <br /> Director James Bridges carefully follows this plot (Mike Gray-T Cook) to build a tense and thoughtful film. All roles were well-played: Jane Fonda ("Kimberly Wells"), Jack Lemmon (Jack Godell ") and producer Michael Douglas (" Richard Adams ") are all excellent in their roles, plus all the rest of the cast. I am glad that there is no score, it was so interesting that I saw backstage behind the scenes of the television industry, which should not be surprising. CBS, and I hope they win. Can you believe Donald Trump says, "Is it defeated"? Trump - Who cares? "Tiberius1234" here posted a very good comment - I agree, it's my opinion that getting "evaporation" by nuclear leak is much better than life in a world that has been wasted, and becomes "Blade Runner" and / or "Solyent Green". Leave your video games for a few hours and watch this "dated" movie (really not and get some nuclear power education, I recommend it to the whole family.
