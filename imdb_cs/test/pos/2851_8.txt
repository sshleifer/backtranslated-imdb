If only I saw a poster for Sister Betty, I would probably not touch him with a ten-foot mark. But after I heard some positive buzz and knew it was making some noise in Cannes, I decided to try it. What I have is a really nice movie, based on a very fun plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as Betty's sister, a woman who is sent into a vicious psychotic episode after a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by comedian Chris Rock. The film smoothly changes between comedy, drama, romance and thriller. However, despite this apparent identity crisis, it is doing quite well. I found my eyes sticking to the screen from start to finish and always waiting for the next turn in the story. The entire cast is strong, if not spectacular. My only real complaint is that director Neil Labute (who created a splash with a very impressive and dark film In the Society of Men a few years ago) relied too much on the many clich√©s of the Hollywood Conventions. The mood-producing musical effects that pulled back into every throat in every sentimental scene were unbearable! And he did the standard old "let's take some of the tiny characters and pair them in the end in illogical and useless romance" trick just to be absolutely sure everyone goes home with a smile on his face. Why do directors and writers have to treat their viewers like idiots? But the film is still too pleasing to make these unpleasant irritations go very far. In a very below average year for movies, 'Sister Betty' is one of the more pleasant surprises of 2000. 8 out of 10.
