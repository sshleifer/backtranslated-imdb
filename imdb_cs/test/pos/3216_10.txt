Honestly, this show warms my heart, I watch it every day on the fox family and now that the new season has become even more addicted than before. The characters are so well developed and their relationships are so real .. I would recommend this show for every woman or mother and daughter .. Lorelei are super fast talking funny girls who will, really inspire you and the show is occasionally hysterical and never too serious, but serious enough to be totally addictive. It's an hour that's the main PLUS because you can't get enough Gilmore! Even in one hour .. Emily and Richard Gilmore are KICKS (parents of Lord, Rory's grandparents) that you are an average wealthy parent .. Emily President of DAR and Richard of well-known Yale Lawyer and Graduate. in the footsteps of her grandparents, and that couldn't have made them happier, of course Rory's mother was so proud of her, but all her life he'd been working on defying his parents and not helping Rale on this journey, but trust me, everybody the coming episode;)
