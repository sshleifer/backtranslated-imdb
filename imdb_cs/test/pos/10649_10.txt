Eisenstien's "Potempkin", (Bronenosets Potyomkin), is among the best films ever made and perhaps the best of the silent era. Eisenstien was a pioneer in filmmaking, and his use of editing has influenced the movies to this day. The footage of the Odessa Steps massacre is as strong as it was when it was first seen over 70 years ago. WE HAVE NO CHANCE TO SEE THIS FILM!
