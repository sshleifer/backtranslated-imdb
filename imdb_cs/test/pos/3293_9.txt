This story has a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed the stories of mountain men and wilderness. Books such as "The Wild Calling", "White Fang", "Border" and "My Mountain Side" influenced me tremendously. I wanted to live so much like a mountain man, but nothing more inspired me than when I saw this movie on television in 1975. I wanted to be like "Trapper". However, as I got older, I found myself too fit to live like that. However, I am still romanticizing that I live that kind of life. I agree with some of the other reviews of this film that the story has a simplicity that is widespread in Disneyisque movies, but if you can look beyond the mechanics in which it was created and see the story's core, the real themes, then I think you feel pleasantly touched. I'll do this place to watch this film once a year. After twenty-one years, I still have a chill when I see a stream of snow rolling on the hillside and hear the echo of Trapper's scary laughter. <br /> <br /> Good luck, ancient and free - <br /> <br /> PS To read more about the real story, I found this link to Mad Trapper of Rat River: <br /> <br /> http: //www.mysteriesofcanada.com / NWT / madtrapper.htm
