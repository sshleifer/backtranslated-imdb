These movies just don't get the credit they deserve. This is my second favorite movie (Stand By Me is 1.) The reason I watched this movie was because Wil Wheaton was in it and he's my favorite person all over the world and I think he did an amazing job in this movie and the same so Sean Astin. Actually, I watched it last night and just stunned me. Everything in the film is very special. Screenplay, acting, script. I was at the edge of my seat 80% of the time, and if my mom wasn't in the room, I'd be totally packed whenever Joey Trott (Wil Wheaton) died. I didn't see it coming !! At all!! I was really surprised to hear that it wasn't popular in the 1990s. I was born a few years after he came out, so of course I didn't see it in the theaters, but I'm sure I'll have it if I were alive. If any of my friends were watching, they would be like "uhh okay?" But that's just the cause of their not cool enough to appreciate work like this. If you haven't seen this movie or want to watch something that's a bomb, it's a movie you can watch.
