It's a romantic comedy, so it's really fairy tale, but unusual. Cinderella, rather than living in the ashes, lives in an exaggerated castle in the suburbs with a good-looking husband who is not a prince. He finds his prince, but he's not so handsome. Instead of a castle, at least initially, it gets a little walk in Manhattan. Pfeifer, Stockwell and Ruehl lead the cast of fully-fledged characters if it's a little over-the-top. Demme achieves the highest level of filmmaking in my mind. It creates a world in which I want to move - Manhattan district and street life with life and community. <br /> <br /> I want IMDb to follow up on other reviewers' comments. I'd like to know what other movies people who sent this one hate. I've always been looking for a lot of laughter and nice places to "live" for at least an hour.
