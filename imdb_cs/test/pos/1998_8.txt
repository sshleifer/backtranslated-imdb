Okul is the first of its kind in Turkish cinema and it is much better than I expected. Those people who say it is neither scary nor funny are not right. But it is important to bear in mind that everyone involved in the film is rather amateurish, so it is basically the first cruise. And to compare this film with other Sinan Ã‡etina films, such as the 1st class "Propaganda" garbage, this movie is pretty damn good. One thing to be told: It deals with the life of high school students at school. Turkey very realistic! That's right! The scenes to scare are somewhat cheap and Hollywood. Most of them, though not all. But the religious lesson scene made me laugh in tears and Emre Kynay performs the best of this film as a religion teacher. It's not a waste of time, go and watch it! You will find it quite amusing, especially if you know Turkey enough to relate to the lives of Turkish youth schools.
