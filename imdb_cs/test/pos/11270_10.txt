Thank God for Internet Movie Database !!! When I first got this movie, I watched it every night just before bedtime and I always did something about it. But no matter how I cut it, it seemed disturbing. Black and white, and all the twitches really upset me. You are staring at the screen and don't know what you're looking at, and when you think you have it, it's clear and it's completely different. The images are very disturbing, twitching and straight razors do not fit with me in any movie. Every time I watched it, I interpreted it somewhat differently (there's no dialogue, you know), so I decided to check the IMdB for a plot summary. The boy who throws me in the loop, I had no idea it was God. Now I'll watch it with regard to it and see what happens.
