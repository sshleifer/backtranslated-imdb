This series has a lot of beautiful shots from the most impressive underwater environments on the planet. It's an incredible five years in the process, one would be hard to expect less. I got the impression that some of the first episode scenes that repeat in the other, which is naturally a tiny gripe. David Attenborough is great because the narrator and commentary are informative and leave enough room for one's imagination and well-spaced so that viewers have enough time to think about breathtaking images. If this opportunity is tried to look at the translated version of this series, you must definitely see for everyone who is interested in the complexity of our blue continents and easy about the best documentary on the subject. ever seen.
