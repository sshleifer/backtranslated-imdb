I just want to say that I was thrilled to find these comments about the show. I tried online searching for information about the show in the past without luck. LOVED I'm the show. I have a hard time getting motivation to exercise but this show's fun. As another commentary said, it was not as complicated as it is today. It was the perfect training that got a job! I'd like to give anything to buy a copy of one workout. I remember many moves, but not nearly everything. Someone, please try to get it back into the air and also make it available on DVD. It's great to know I wasn't the only one who loved the show! Thanks for my day!
