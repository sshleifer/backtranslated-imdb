A truly creepy haunted story full of cold and sensuality, this movie just doesn't reach what it promises. This is apparently based on the old spirit story, and perhaps relies on too much for a simple assumption. For most of the journey, his imaginative and actually clenched, but at the end of his almost as Oshima lost interest in him, and brought it to a quick end. The story is simple - a woman and her younger lover kill her husband so they can be together. However, their nerve failure and its returning spirit condemn them to madness. His beautifully crafted, imaginative scenes and lovers' lovers are beautifully drawn. But too often the film cannot really fulfill its promise, almost as if Oshima lost his nerve in the same way as lovers. His Valuable Movie, which looks only at how Oshima combines his great skill as a filmmaker with some movie exploitation tricks to attract viewers, but unfortunately it's not a real movie movie like Onibaba or Dune Woman.
