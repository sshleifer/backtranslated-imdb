I cannot imagine any film that better reflects the notion of grace in theological sense. The well-meaning religiosity of a small church that has melted away after the death of their leader robs them of what they preach: grace. The daring gift of a humble Parisian culinary genius is returning them to their vocation to love each other and distorting an aging general who is afraid of wasting his life. Elections are a central theme as well as grace. At the same time, artistic talent is acknowledged to have a powerful, transcendent role in everyday life and a life to come. Can't improve or ignore. This is a life changing movie for those who hear his message.
