After reading some of these reviews, it is clear that some missed this point. What is great about this movie (it's a point here), what's incredible about this movie, it's amazing that there is no proselytizing. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. Life goes on. It is a masterpiece that allows the audience to think of their collective self. These are just children who do what kids do - without consciousness. We all went to school with such children. We are impressed by the fiction / film / tv- / reality / novelty based on news. Feck's (Dennis Hopper great) girlfriend herself and his relationship is worth it to rent a movie. <br /> <br /> There were several films up to the intelligence of this film before or after this measurement. AMEN. <br /> <br />
