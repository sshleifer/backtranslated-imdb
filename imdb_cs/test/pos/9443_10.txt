Even an old cynical DOCTOR WHO fan like me can be breathless by watching my favorite show episode. It happened earlier during the Eccleston Final and it was the track of this episode. However, this does not happen often, but The Impossible Planet is an example of show and television in the same very good form. This is a staggering television <br /> <br /> The doctor and his companion land in a mysterious place where they see strange writing on the wall and the audience (many of them moving behind the couch) are instantly transfixed. The door opens and terrible monsters start chasing the passengers in time. This could take up to 25 minutes of an episode in the original show, but it all takes place in its for order titles. You may miss a longer drawn format of the original show, but at least this new series is drawn and if we're going to the unsatisfactory story, it's usually only one week. nothing that would disappoint the viewer. It is the WHO DOCTOR in its most traditional tradition. Writer Matt Jones and director James Strong have gone out of the way to create a story to be considered for years to come. They do this by building a narrative story. The Doctor and Rose are losing the Tardis and are trapped by the protagonists in the distant future. It is interesting to see how many stories never suggest this type of conspiracy where the doctor and his companions no longer have access to the Tardis, which is more interesting for the story. The highlight is undoubtedly the scene in which Scooti looks for Toby to find him on the surface of the planet, where he turns and invites her out. Everything from playing, makeup, and music by Murray Golde is a scene that really shakes his audience. I can imagine that immediately after this BBC episode, the PBXs received a tsunami of complaints about desperate parents who said how traumatizing their children. they were. That it took them several hours to get past the family couch and that they now refused to sleep with the lights off. To complain, it would be denying the WOC's DOCTOR spell. Yes, it can scare and yes such images will burn in the child's mind, something they will never forget, even if they live a hundred. But I bet that these same "traumatized" children would spend a week begging that no matter what they will be allowed to watch the next episode
