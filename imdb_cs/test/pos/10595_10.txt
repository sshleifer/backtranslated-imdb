absolutely brilliant movie from CKY ...... (not jackass boys ..... johnny knoxville, chris pontius, steve-o etc are not in this <br /> <br /> movie). OK so maybe they aren't the best actors, but that's not what you call a serious movie ...... but hey there is fun and its absolutely funny to watch. who does not want to see a don vito dressed as a Roman emperor! <br /> <br /> total if you like viva la bam or CKY ............ Almighty HIM, CKY and more ...... See more features on DVD, especially Freestyle Goals <br /> <br /> Chinese rap number two ...... seriously cheerful ..... ...... check this movie out ........ you won't regret it ......... 10/10
