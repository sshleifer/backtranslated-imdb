Hand of Death aka Countdown in Kung Fu (1976) is an extremely underestimated early work by director John Woo. The film is played by Dorian Tan (Tan Tao-liang) and features Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung and James Tien in important supporting roles. Many people believe or have been led to believe in deceptive advertising that this is a Jackie Chan movie. It's not Jackie Chan's movie, Dorian Tan is a star, but Jackie gives one of his best (most serious) early performances. The hand of death is about a Shaolin pupil named Yunfei (Tan) who is sent on a mission to assassinate Shaolin traitor Shih Xiaofeng (Tien) and protect a revolutionary named Zhang Yi (Woo). Along his way, Yunfei meets a young woodcutter named Tan (Chan) and a shameful sword fighter (Chang Chung), known as a "pilgrim". Both men suffered in Shih's hands and want revenge. Three teams defeat Shih and his eight bodyguards and escort the revolutionary to safety. <br /> <br /> The martial arts event is above average under the guidance of Sammo Hung. Dorian Tan uses his high mark kicks very effectively as "Northern Eighteen Styles Kicks" along with some "Southern Five Styles Boxes." Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan also provide excellent martial arts. James Tien is not the biggest martial artist on Jade's screen, but he does an acceptable job. Some of the first battles are a bit slow and seem to be above the choreography, but the last shows with Chan, Tan and Hung are very good. <br /> <br /> Director John Woo offers a refreshingly interesting character development in the film. Cinematography Leung Wing Kat is very stylish, unique and beautiful for the kung fu film of this era. Josef Ko's music: a combination of soft flutes and "Shaft" orchestral compositions in the best possible cinema. Hand of Death is not Jackie and Sammo's usual kung fu comedy. Hand of Death is a serious, straightforward story of revenge. The Hand of Death aka Countdown in Kung Fu is an underrated classic in the old kung fu genre. The film is one of the best artistically of its time and a preview of the great things that come from Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung. Hung's great choreography is exhibited here before his directorial debut and Chan's early charism and talent are clearly visible. The hand of death is a solid, stylish old school of kung fu and great early work. legendary John Woo. Kung Fu Genre Rating 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> A pilgrim to Tan (referring to his new weapon): "The Little Eagle Wing God Lance." Tan: "Just knickknack."
