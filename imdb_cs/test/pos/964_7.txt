I didn't expect much from this story about a boy whose semester paper was stolen and turned into a film script. Who then travels to Hollywood to get .. .. .. hey .. it's still a fun movie. Frankie Muniz "Malcom on Wednesday" fame stars as a child and is pretty good and Amanda Bynes as his friend is also very good. Yes, the movie works as an advert for Universal Studios and it's a really stupid movie for kids. GRADE: B-
