Pepe Le Pew can either really crawl you out or get rid of your feet. Either way, you can't help feeling a little horrible when you look at this classic WB character. This commentator personally believes that Pepe was the inspiration behind the others would be an animated kasanovas today from Cartoon Network's "Johnny Bravo" to Disney's Lumiere of "Beauty and the Beast". His unique love making brand is supposed to think in today's world about where his opposites would normally be slapped by sexual harassment and at least 50 meters from all his victims. In this particular cartoon, a world-tired cat decides to do the ultimate man and get some respect for a change for pretending to be a skunk. Everything is fine until Pepe arrives and immediately pursues an unhappy cat with his tremendously enthusiastic love. <br /> <br /> The basis for many of Pepe's trademarks is this drawing. From his adorable "frenchified" love he calls it an aggravating calm hop-chase of his. This caricature goes just to show that in terms of the world of cartoon fantasies, the hottest wooer can go remotely ... and let his beloved "pig" leave the traces of dust behind them.
