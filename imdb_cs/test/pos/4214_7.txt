Jimmy Wang Yu, an authentic Asian superstar, directed and wrote this film, which I only saw in the version of the dubbed videotape. Shaw Scope! The shape was lost and the original actor's voice was missing, but it's still good to watch. The story is the usual martial arts school fighting against villains from Japan conspiracy with our young hero won at the end by defeating a lot of all sorts of criminals. The fight gets better as the movie falls apart. Soon in the movie it looks tough and boring, but later there is a great scene where Wang Yu fights hordes in the gambling then comes in a snowy scene and takes some other villains with knives, sword and fists. This part is very exciting. <br /> <br /> Fairly good, but it would be interesting to see if a widescreen version is available.
