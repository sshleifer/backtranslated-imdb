It's a good movie for Chucky hard fans. Okay: I'm sure it's not as good as what the Baby Play movie was, but it can be really funny and fun, Chucky's laughter is fun. Now not one doll, but two, which means doubling the impact, Jennifer Tilly played the role really well and definitely withdrew the best killing of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you've seen children's play movies to be a good movie on your Chucky collection, but if you've never seen children's movies before, it will be a new beginning. Of course, you have no idea how Chucky got into his current state (because I won't tell you), but you'll find out why Chucky is very popular. <br /> <br /> Very nice movie in general.
