I love movies that take you to them. A film that actually leaves a feeling of weakness when its end and this kind of film is rare. Damian is so talented and versatile in many ways of writing and displaying different characters on the screen. This movie has top. The mainstream cast for such a low budget. Why is it that a person with this talent and charism (not to mention a sexual appeal in a way that crosses most other actors) can do it with so little money to work with ??? These actors really believe in his script and Raw Talent as a director, writer and actor. I am so glad that such a modern day genius is out there, letting him passion for the art of driving him and taking us as an audience with him. Damian I have heard so many different circles about you and I will not let the Jealous People of this world come to you. Martin gets it, Fellini got it and you always get it. Fire and passion in you is what we like to watch on the screen. Thank you for being different and have the courage to write just like you. You're one of the kind directors, don't listen to empty vessels.
