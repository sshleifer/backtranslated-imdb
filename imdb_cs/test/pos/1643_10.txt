Wow! It's hard to put my feelings into this episode. Ice is one of the best episodes of season one for sure. It's my favorite season. Six people and a dog in a claustrophobic structure isolated in the middle of an Arctic region with an unknown organism that causes murder aggression, the drama cannot get any good. Paranoia rules supremely, just as Mulder and Scully have doubts about reciprocity. I hear people complain about the similarities of the episode with The Thing. I didn't see it, so I wouldn't know. Ice is more than worth seeing just to see Mulder and Scully actually test their mutual trust. This episode is intense and tense to the end. You won't be disappointed!
