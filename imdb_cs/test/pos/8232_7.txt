After cleaning up Dodge City (with a little help from Wyatt Earp) Bat Masterson goes to Liberal, Kansas, where they have a nice little-scale war. Plus, an interesting sharing scheme. Randolph Scott is Bat Masterson and is after the villains Billy House and Steve Brodie, who run on farms. The homesteaders who leave are in a sharing scheme funded by Robert Ryan. It looks like he is comparing himself with different farmers on the land to get a percentage of their crops. Ryan is about to lose his shirt as a result of all shenanigans. As portrayed by Scott, Bat Masterson is a stand-up western hero who has a passion to go east and become a reporter that we all knew he did later in life. Anne Jeffreys and Madge Meredith are involved in a romantic subpot that includes Brodie and Ryan, which is a bit silly and lightens the action. Anne Jeffreys sings nicely. Of course Gabby Hayes as always provides great comic relief. A good addition to Randolph Scott's Westerns collection. It is also interesting that his later western movies do not have him as if he had a white hat like this one. This review is dedicated to Kasey Hayes of the professional Bull Riders, who is a proud Liberal resident. , Kansas, a city with a great tradition, whether Bat Masterson was there or not.
