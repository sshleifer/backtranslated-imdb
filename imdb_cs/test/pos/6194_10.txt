I found this show by chance and I was surprised to find out that nobody heard about it. This was by far the best show I've seen in months, if not years, and I can't wait to see more episodes. The Sleeper Cell portrays the psychological struggle of a secret agent inside a terrorist cell that must constantly make difficult decisions to keep its cover while remaining true to its real thing. This is a very well done show. Keeping you captivated from the first episode to the end, and although progressing slowly, is fast enough to feel on the edge. Quite realistic and humane, it touches on important topics, and each episode is an interesting question to consider. This show is not 24 or none of the TV shows, nor is it trying to be anything else. It's original and unique. It's a show about human being, his difficult decisions and life in a fight where a simple mistake can cost him everything. I gave this show 10 for a great story, good progress, great cinema, excellent music and realistic characters, each with a story that tells you.
