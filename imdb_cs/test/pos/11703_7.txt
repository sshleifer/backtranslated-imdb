I was restrained to see this movie before reading external reviews and user comments posted here. Why? Firstly, because Mick Malloy's humor (in my humble opinion) can be quite cool and on top, as evidenced by his poorly fatal shemozzle of the television show a few years back. And secondly, because good Aussie comedy movies are unfortunately as rare as Tassie Tiger. Sensitively, Mick has limited his natural comic enthusiasm in this surprisingly watchable movie. Who would have thought that the bowls club will provide a setting for one of Australia's most entertaining movies in the years. The cast is great, because all known local timekeepers give believable performances. It's interesting to see John Clark in this piece. It is a one-way part, but JC still adds a touch of class, as always. It's good to see Judith Lucy also get Guernsey or I should see a big bowl on the big screen. It's a real talent, a pity that many of her retorts are redundant. Her own material is much more fun. Interesting character. Bowl of reporter on local rag. How low is one on the food chain! Crackerjack may not be the funniest movie I've seen this year, but it's definitely a nice distraction, well worth a look. Many other people seem to agree with me because it is supposed to be the biggest grossing Australian film this year. It's good to see someone who finally makes an unpredictable, subtle comedy without trying to laugh ridiculously, like so many Australian "comedies". Finally a little bit. If you are wondering which Aussie rules Mick supports, check out the flag on your workstation. Also watch out for your old partner in crimes, Tony Martin makes a announcement in the final mission scene. <br /> <br /> <br />
