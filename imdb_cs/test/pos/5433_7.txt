I went to look at this thought that it would be a great comedy and comeback for Robin Williams, but when I saw it, I realized I was lying to advertisers because it was more drama than comedy. it. It was like watching two movies. One of them was funny chatting with Robin Williams, which should still be the whole film basin, but on Wednesday you will also get a movie thriller with political anxiety. I don't really know how to classify this movie. But I can tell you that it was good and I laughed, not as much as I hoped, but at least Williams is back in the right direction. Look, but before you go, it's not all comedy and it's a little intense.
