I'll be happy to make this movie for women in treatment. I feel like it's a great movie for them. I can't fine it wasn't I was on eBay and all the other websites make this movie. Now I ask you for help to get out where I can oder this movie on or what to do to get one. i will be glad to make this movie. So, I was like this movie and many people here in the treatment to find out how people can change their lives around and move on. I think Markie Post played that they move very well that she's a great actor I love her movies. And if you have any other film about addiction I'll be happy to bring them out of the treatment center of women and men so that they can look at other people to go through what they go in life.
