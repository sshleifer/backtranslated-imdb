He watched this film at the local Silver Sprocket International Film Festival Florida. What a beautiful movie. A simple, uncomplicated story about the morale of a young young man who must be responsible for his actions. It is neither the pretentious nor the flashy of my two teenage daughters that she liked, and I did not care about the change of film content or language. A real family movie and the best British comedy movie I've seen from Billy Elliot. The film also won the best festival awards in Best Film and Best Director. Ten out of ten.
