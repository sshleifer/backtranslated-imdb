I just watched Doctor Who's second season finale and, apart from a few boring episodes, this show is fantastic. It's a sad loss to say goodbye to the lead character in high season. the final, but the show moves on. The BBC needs to increase its exhibition budget, there are so many things that can happen in London and the surrounding area. Also, some of the special effects, even if the main very good, for a special occasion, must be a little more polished. For the BBC it was a huge gamble to come back to a show that had lost its way is long overdue and must be congratulated on it. Enter the Christmas 2006 Special, Christmas Special 2005 was by far the best on TV.
