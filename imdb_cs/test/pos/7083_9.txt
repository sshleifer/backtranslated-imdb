I loved One True Thing since I watched it in the theater, and I cried my eyes. I bought it as soon as it was available and lost track of how many times I watched it. <br /> <br /> For Me One True Thing is the ultimate film of a family relationship. I love watching relationships in the family and turning into what ends. I can cover many details in the film. My mother died of bone cancer, so it really hit me home. Maybe that's why I love him so much. I like the relationships between children and their parents and the relationship between brother and sister, but above all the love relationship between husband and wife. For me it's really beautiful. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this move to anyone who likes this kind of film.
