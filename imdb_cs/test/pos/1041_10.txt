That's the best job I've ever seen on television. The story is convincing - all the more so because it's true. Writers did their homework - the accuracy of events is well documented. Acting is great. That must be the best role Sam Waterston ever had. Black and white cinematography was exceptional. I'm just sorry it's not possible to buy it. A few years ago, I contacted someone who was involved in production (either with PBS or England) and was told that he had no intention of publishing it to VHS (at that time). It was BBC production and ran in the US on American Playhouse. Such an interest is visible - it is hard to believe that no one can access it.
