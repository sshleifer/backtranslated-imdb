I consider this loving and sensitively written story one of the real masterpieces on the screen. Many years have passed since he saw this film, originally on a silver screen with his mother, in Los Angeles, California, before I had the opportunity to experience it again. Beauty, calm, simple elegance and tranquility for me, put it away from many, many others of its kind. Yes, when I see me, there are still tears coming in and I can hear him singing once in a lifetime. maybe still, today my number one ever favorite movie. I hope this classic love story will enjoy and appreciate our future generations.
