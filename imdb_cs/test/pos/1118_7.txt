Walter Matthau can always improve the average film and this film proves it. She turns in a very realistic way as a little horse coach and single father, without the sugar coating of both roles. He can be, turned, soft and stabbing, then iron-hand for his boys, and we can see the same dichotomy in his approach to horse training (we see that he doesn't want his young lookout horse to be overworked and wounded in small time races, but he seems to be willing to risk his horse's life when he gets into big time). <br /> <br /> This is just one of the great Matthau shows and the one I highly recommend.
