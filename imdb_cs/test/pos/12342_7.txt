This is fine at the beginning of the '80s horror, in which a young girl (Meg Tilly) wants to get rid of the image of "good two shoes" and becomes part of the girl gang The Sisters. Their dedication to her is that we spend the night in the mausoleum. Too bad that the mausoleum is a "final" place of rest for some psychological Russian psyche and is not yet completely dead. This guy seems to have been found in his apartment with lots of stuff stuck in the walls of his telekinetic target practice, and there is a bunch of young dead girls in the closet. All the evidence that tracking can be dangerous, so listen to the girls. This man's daughter (Reymar) is a little upset by her father's death and is confronted with a man who said he knew Reymar and that he would give him a tape. Her husband (Adam West, Batman of Fame) is laughing and laughing, and not anything else. But perhaps Reymar's daughter may have some abilities she doesn't realize. After all, after putting an unfortunate vow on the mausoleum, the rest of the Sisters take off to take things (like masks, bed sheets, etc.) to get out of it and scare the bullshit, but few suspect what's going on and get more they scare them out of them. Even in death, Reymar is a bit of a busy guy that is fun for fun. And it also seems to have a bait thing. Overall, it is acceptable horror, nothing very intense, but not terrible either. The DVD of Media Blasters also includes another version of the film, which is a rough cut, I think I just watched it a bit, so I don't know how different it is from the theatrical release, but from what I saw. "warts and all" presentations. 7 out of 10.
