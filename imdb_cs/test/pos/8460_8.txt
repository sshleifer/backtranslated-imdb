Although the film's premise includes a major "coincidence", actors do a credible job and look great and bring the story to life. I found myself in the roots of the characters who played Mary Tyler Moore and Christine Lahti, empathizing with both and wanting them to come to terms. Sam Waterston and Ted Danson are also fine in their roles, doing decent work with a stereotypical friend. While the story tends to jump over time, occasionally leaving the audience perhaps a little hungry for the missing details, it keeps flowing and avoids real confusion. This interesting story has all the elements for a good "chick."
