Chop Shop. He wrote and directed Ramin Bahrani (Man Push Cart). Bahrani specializes in character-based studies in science-style movies about what little people go through every day without actually noticing in New York that they are there. These are the people who were pushed to the very edge of society. They exist in a kind of gray world, many of them migrants whose legal status in America is somewhat dubious. Where do they come from? How did they get there? How to deal? Where will it end? They are not good stories as such, but survival stories at its most basic, everyday level. But he is such a street child. He has no education and difficulty, just as he does to save money, but he is not beyond turning to petty theft. Mostly he tries to meet his older sister. We see him in the early scenes that ring into a safe house and search for it, but they have no real success. A young friend, Carlos, gets a job in a chops shop in the shadow of Shea baseball stadium. Eventually his older sister comes to live on the spot with him, but he is jealous of the motives of her friends and suspicious of how she makes extra money. She dreams of buying a food supply and building a shop with her older sister. Bahrani shoots all his movies on the spot. There is nothing shiny or overlooked. This is the life these people must live in, raw. It's not nice, even though it's never sinister, and the slightly desperate air that hangs over much of the movie is the one that hangs over the daily lives of these people. <br /> <br /> The script is also very natural and the characters get enough space and space to work. Polanco has an outstanding position in the lead role and Gonzalez gives strong support as an older sister.
