One of France's greatest achievements in 2002, "l'auberge espagnole" was also very well welcomed abroad, which is quite exceptional for the French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons for this success. The film, made by one of the most interesting French filmmakers of recent years, Cédric Klapisch, presents students from all over Europe and gathered them together under one roof in Barcelona. These students are described as the ones you imagine, or you see in everyday life: either untreated, serious or with a sense of humor. I think that if the film worked so well, it is because many students have to recognize themselves in portraits of the main characters and especially in Xavier. We watch the movie and thus its experiences abroad Erasmus student over the eyes. Xavier is a real student with his qualities, his mistakes. Intelligent creation with quite a lot of sophisticated ideas perfectly expresses his lost mind and anxiety about the world and is an Erasmus student. Here are the best examples in two sequences. The first is when Xavier asks a woman at the university for papers to send to the DEA. When the same woman informs you of the various necessary procedures, all the documents appear on the screen when they name them! In another order, Xavier's vocal voice entrusts the viewer with his vision of the modern world. Where to find the second example? Well, the scene where Xavier has a thorough medical examination, during which Klaispch's films his vision is enough to talk about himself. Moreover, the director was not too interested in studying his main character. He left this point low. He'd put a lot of effort into Xavier's private life, of course, in his love affair with Anne Sophie, but above all in his relationship with his tenants. It is a true story of friendship that Klapis shows us with his moments of happiness, but also his arguments and tensions. Through Xavier's adventure and at the end of his stay, he will be dedicated to life that will make him mature. The report that the author wanted to convey is not difficult to estimate. You naively believe that you live in a disorderly and complicated world. You must not give up, but intensively seek to get what you want, even if it is difficult. In addition, we might be worried that the Cédric Klapisch theme will be trapped: clichés. Let's be honest: they're included in the script, but the director is trying not to spread them too much in his film. The script then contains comfortable and predictable moments: at the airport and before boarding, we see Xavier leaving his family. But the deficiencies on the scene are luckily stopped here. Quite witty dialogues and cool young actors make up perfectly in their roles. Despite its weaknesses, "l'uberge espagnole" is to be considered a success in the film Young People. In addition, the whole atmosphere it brings us allows us to think that this film is primarily aimed at young audiences. In the end, the end of the film and its great success allowed us to suggest that Klapisch succumbed to fashion that suits American cinema: processing the sequel. Indeed, the filmmaker is currently working on a sequel called "les poupées russes". Hopefully it will be as good as l'auberge espagnole.
