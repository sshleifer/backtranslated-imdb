It is a very strange little short film that did not seem to me at first. From a purely aesthetic point of view, animation is certainly not nice here - although after a while you will notice that simple and silly drawings have some special charm. Probably because with a scenario like this, animation works. The movie shows an older couple sitting at a table playing Scrabble. At the same time they are fixed on this game or other bizarre activities (such as the urge of a husband to see things - even chairs and a table)! And all this happens when a television station warns against pending atomic destruction - Armageddon is definitely here! Of course, the neighbors are screaming and running amok - during this time a couple carelessly continues this idiotic game. Damn, even their cat knows that comes the end, as the couple starts bickering about who can or may not cheat - which leads to a very surreal ending really! The film deserves recognition because both are unique and very funny. While not winning, Oscar was nominated for Best Animated Short Film, which he deserved.
