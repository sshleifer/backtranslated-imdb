I really wanted to be able to give this movie 10. I long thought it was my favorite of the four modern live Batman action movies (and maybe it will still be - I haven't had to watch Schumacher movies again). I'm also starting to worry about being subconsciously contradictory. You see, I always liked the Schumacher movies. As I recall, I was either 9 or 10 years old. But conventional wisdom is that two Tim Burton directed films are much better. I had serious problems with the first Burton Batman this time around - I ended up giving it 7 - and sorry how I could, I just couldn't help feeling that Batman was coming back just having too many small direction, plot and script issues Diffused around the world But the Burton _almost_ trouble with the utmost power of style, and while there are a lot of small flaws, Batman Returns is still a great movie, especially if you're a Re Burton fan, as Batman returns has as much in common with Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Edward Scissorhands (1990) as it does with anything else in the Batman universe. The movie begins strongly with Cobblepots having a baby. We see their dismay - people come out of the birth room with horror on their faces, ready to vomit. They later have a baby in a small cage. Finally, they take her for an evening stroll and unload her in the Gotham City River. The child ends up as a Batman villain Penguin (Danny DeVito). Meanwhile, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is a movie "evil capitalist", comparable to Griss (Jack Palance) in Batman. He plans to imitate Gotham City in various ways and we perceive him as an emotionally abusive secretary, shy Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). When Kyle discovers one of the shameful conspiracies, Grissom tries to get rid of her, but she is rescued by the cats, becoming Catwoman. While all this is happening, Penguin, who has long been merely said to exist and who is considered dangerous, begins a plan to be presented to the public as a good man, although less than benevolent, side motifs. Before watching Burton's Batman movies again, this time I didn't remember how few of the films are about Batman (Michael Keaton). It's almost as if Burton didn't feel that the character was interesting enough to concentrate. The focus here is much more on villains, especially The Penguin. Batman does not appear very often, especially at the beginning of the movie, and we are surprisingly watching him watching the Penguin. Although some viewers necessarily count on the aforementioned mistakes, I can say I'm doing it, even though I want to know more about Batman and follow his story more. The villains' stories are also interesting and, as a "story of origin" for the two main Batman's bad guys, Batman Returns is more than complex in terms of conspiracy. But there are some problems with the characters, I count it as a mistake. The penguin has a cadre of circus artists who make his offer, but although they are often on the screen, we'll never know anything about them. Burton has a core of characters as interesting as those in Tod Browning's Freaks (1932) available, with actors as interesting as Vincent Schiavelli, but he just doesn't have the space to use them. <br /> <br /> For that matter, barely has Catwoman to explore. The film plays as if Catwoman may have been as developed and featured in as many scenes as the penguin, but that movie cut would have been 4 hours long. Most Catwoman scenes had to be cut out. Of course, this hardly leaves room for Batman. Burton has Batman very dark in the public eye in this movie, and unusually, he never bothered to solve it. As we know, at the end, the Gothamites still think that Batman is a murderous lunatic. This is an interesting development, but unfortunately it ended between this film and the next. Regarding the scenario, although there are minor issues, including some non-securitic and bizarre decisions (in terms of logic) created by characters, it is clear that Burton and writers Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters are not trying to accurately tell traditional story. A lot of the dialogue is punch oriented, but often it is quite subtle and / or complex (sometimes very sharp or transparent, of course). It helps to look at Batman Returns as a "more poetic" movie, as I believe it was the intention. This also translates into a more general plot and director decision - many strange character actions, including tiny characters, are done in the service of general mood or style, and this style works very well. "Dark" is the easiest way to summarize Batman's returns in a word and whether it is positive or negative depends on your choice. Anyone who knows me knows I like darkness. So for me, Burton's style goes far beyond shortcomings in history and scenario. In many ways, Batman returns them as a crazy, campy horror movie, with a beautifully frightening production design. Like Batman, Burton still makes many references to other movies, but instead of Vertigo (1958) and Star Wars (1977) (well, there's still a slight reference to Star Wars), he refers to films like Nosferatu (1922) (including that) Max Schreck "was the name of an actor who played Dracula-like character there), Motel Hell (1980), mentioned by Freaks, Willy Wonka and Chocolate Factory (1971) (which has a surreal, dark border to it) and zombie movies - the most explicit in the final Penguin scene. <br /> <br /> As for the visual and overall atmosphere - including the general "feeling" of the story, the characters and so on can not be stronger 10.
