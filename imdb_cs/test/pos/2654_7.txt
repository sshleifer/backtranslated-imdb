"2001: Odyssey of Space" is set in 2001 and the main character is HAL. Computer. That's right, the computer that talks and thinks all by itself. This was done in 1968 and thinking by 2001 it would be conceivable that computers would talk them a joke. If it were in 3064, a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered as moral as this one. There is nothing in this movie to provoke any emotion. It produces two reactions and one is called sleep. It starts with nothing, but with a black shooting shooting track in two minutes. Then the first shot we see has some kind of lighting is the "Dawn of Man" sequence. If it is in chronological order, the darkness before it is the birth of the world? During the "Dawn of Man" sequence, a huge monolith comes from nothing. from the ground, from heaven, we will never know where it comes from, but for one reason or another it is there. Monkeys go Apesh! T once they find this monolith that only a man could have done, but it is catching ?? the man hasn't developed yet. Who did it and where did it come from? What is its purpose? Monkeys will find a tool. Monkeys use bones to fight against an enemy group of monkeys. Gun monkeys are now the dominant group because they have used their minds to gain advantage. The most advanced monkeys and the much smarter and more innovative monkeys are the dominant group they have taken over by the watering hole. We jump quickly into space, millions of years later, where we see a bunch of spaceships floating around classical music. We see the earth, the moon, the sun, the universe, and for the film made in 1968, the visual effects are stunning but outdated. The score is legendary. Cinematography is magnificent. Editing is terrible. There are countless shots of spaceships that look in space, which seems to be an endless amount of time. There is nothing to talk about when we board the ship. For another hour, Kubrick shows various shots of life in space. Kubrick shows us the life of an astronaut who is very boring, and we got the message. Spacecraft interiors and exteriors are bulky and outdated. Remember what the first cell phone looked like? Neither me nor me, but that is what the future looks like in 2001. All characters have clothes and hairstyles that resemble 1968. The chairs are decorated in bright red colors and strangely shaped because everyone in the future knows it will be. sitting in a strange looking chair. The screens on the computer are outrageous and that is clearly before HDTV, because clarity is cruel. All TVs look like they were in 1968, so it's not all that futuristic. Like all films over 20 years old, they look awful and unconvincing. Just because it's Kubrick, we shouldn't say, "Well, that's how you think it looks." No no. Just as I wouldn't think he could talk to me about a computer in 2047. That won't happen, and if someone made the film right now, he arranged 30 years in time and should talk, think of his own computer laughing at that stupidity. Like me with "2001". HAL is the liveliest person to shoot? I just called him a person. HAL is a computer, but it has more life than any of the subdued characters in the movie and he thinks he's alive. HAL is the only thing that is alive and sees people taking care of him when he does all the work. HAL "reads" lips, one of the few interviews between Dave and Frank, and "sees" that they want to shut it down. Here comes the only dramatic part of the film - the ensuing battle between the red light and the man in the spacecraft trying to get into the larger spaceship. Oh, drama. As soon as the HAL thinks he has the upper hand, Dave goes back to the spacecraft, which shows wit. Dave quits the HAL. HAL, begging for his life when he slowly disappears, which, like everything else, seems to last forever. The final act is as lengthy as the first two. Once again, the monolith that Apes found appears at the end. He comes out of nowhere again. Then the baby is born in a placenta-like shield overlooking the earth from space. What does Kubrick say? Is it about transformation? Dave to the baby? Man is evolving again? Kubrick says it's the end of the man and the beginning? What is a foreign seeker? I may be crazy, trying to find out what the crazy director is trying to say, but the more I think the more beginning and end it makes sense. There are many questions that unanswered, especially for monolith purposes. If you manage to go through the film, it should cause some thought. Finally, the film tries to get where it wants to go. The first act and the third acts are strong, but the second act flicks around, hovering in one place for what appears to be eternity. There are some interesting things in the movie that provoke some thought if you give it a chance. When the beginning of the film makes sense, the end works much better, though you still don't know what Kubrick is trying to say, which I don't.
