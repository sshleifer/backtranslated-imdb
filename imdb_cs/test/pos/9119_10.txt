I saw this movie on fluke.I stood on 42nd street waiting for the bus to go home and the nurse started issuing free tickets to preview this movie. I gave a chance not expecting much. \ T justice at all. The film is about a young rocker who goes on a journey to learn the craft and art of heavy metal. film is a heavy comedy and a lot of fun. If your old enough to remember when Heavy Metal dominated the music scene in the eighties you will love this movie. is also a talented musician. Tenacious D is definitely worth a look!
