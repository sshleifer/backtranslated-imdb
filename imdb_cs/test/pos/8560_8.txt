Of course, we would expect it to be a typical, stupid T&A movie, and that's it. But it really has some pretty well thought-out moments. Given the era in which it was created and the obvious aspect of exploitation, it is still one of the better B comedies of that time. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, you will obviously find inspiration for many people. scenes in "vengeance revenge", and numerous other films of the same genre. Most games are awful and WAY over the top, but that's exactly what I expect in a movie like this. What she lacks in her way of playing skills is more than just a substitute for her value in the camp and a total disregard for all the merits. The amazing thing about this movie is that there was apparently some money that went into it. These films don't have the same style today. If you can turn your brain off and turn your sense of humor an hour and a half, you'll enjoy this movie. I dare not find at least something in this movie that thinks it's funny, if not merry.
