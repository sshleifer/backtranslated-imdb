ATTENTION: Potential spoilers ahead! "Steven Spielberg presents a little Toon adventure" has always been one of my favorite growing up cartoons (damn, it still is). And this film perfectly captures everything I love at the exhibition and puts it into a full-fledged form. Beautifully animated by Tokyo Movie Shinsa (WB outsourced every "Tiny Toons" project) the best studio to handle the show), the film begins at the end of the school year at Acme Looniversity, a renowned cartoon college where Buster and Babs Bunny ( no relationship) and their teen toon peers learn from the masters of animated madness, Looney Tunes. After the last bell, the film is divided into five different graphs. Buster engages Babs in a water gun fight, culminating in a dam burst and tidal wave, sending Buster, Babs and Elmyra a dog to Byron on an inverted picnic table for a deep south adventure. Regimental Duck talks about Hamton Pig and his family to let him go with them to HappyWorldLand, "The Happiest Place in the Western Hemisphere," but has to cope with the unbearable car ride and the threat of a hitchhiker who controls a chainsaw. Elmyra Cat Furball is finally running away, but she's not scary ... not when there's a lot of "aminals" playing with Acme Safari Park. Fifi la Fume is dedicated to her summer hunting her heart, movie star Johnny Pew, in the hope of getting an autograph. Of course, the hotel he is staying on is almost impenetrable. And Shirley McLoon prepares a prophecy stand at the Acme Acres Boardwalk ... and lets her go back in her spare time when Fowlmouth takes her to see the "Skunkophobia" horror. <br /> <br /> All these line stories are hilariously cheerful and some eventually overlap. The only complaint I have with this movie is that it doesn't use Tiny Toons's list - Dizzy Devil and Mary Melody have only one scene, Gogo Dodo only appears at the beginning and end of the movie, and Montana Max, Sweet, Kalamita Coyote and Little Buzzer are not nowhere to be found. They are still excusable shortcomings in an otherwise perfect film. This movie is pretty rare today because it's over 12 years old and I've never been posted on DVD to my knowledge, but I highly recommend that you watch it - anyone who is a fan of Warner Bros, either classic or present, needs to see this movie.
