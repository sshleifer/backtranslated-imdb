E! The Hollywood Special on Dirty Dancing, which is still being considered by many women, including my dear friend at the age of fifty, to be one of her favorite films of all time. Maybe music, dance, or melodrama around Baby Frances's plot becomes a dancing feeling with Johnny Castle. Of course, this film was founded by Jennifer Gray, whose biggest role was her dissatisfied sister at Off Ferris Beuller. Patrick Swayze is perfectly cast as a heart led by a leading man who literally sweeps a child. Dirty Dancing has everything to become a Broadway or West End hit. He has a love story, music and most of all dances. Jennifer and Patrick could easily revive their roles. It's nice to see that Jerry Orbach plays a doctor instead of a cop and Kelly Bishop as a mother. Everything happened at Catskills in the 1960s, when many Jewish families stayed in the area during the summer holidays. At the end of the movie, it is sad to see that the hotel owner, Kellerman, should be confused by the next generation. It happened anyway! Most people prefer cruises and travel in Europe than spending the summer in the Catskills. These old big hotels become Indian gaming casinos. Let Broadway bring Dirty Dancing alive and well. After all, they could do it for Footloose Fever and Saturday Night Fever, it shouldn't be thought out! I know this movie is one of the favorites that won't get tired of watching you 800 times. There are people who have probably seen this movie-1000 times now. Somehow I watched the work and the story behind Dirty Dancing, which forced me to have 13-year-olds. Dirty Dancing may not be the greatest movie ever made, but its universal appeal still attracts crowds and repetitive observers like 800 clubs whose members have watched it so many times. I watch it kindly now with all the inconvenience of Baby's first days and her first true love with Patrick Swayze as the heart of the tomb, Johnny Castle. No one could imagine this little movie as a big hit, then the music of the sixties, two soundtracks and even tours in the late 1980s. I hope they bring it to Broadway in the musical. This would work for viewers to be part of the movie. No wonder she still attracts children and even adults, especially women of all ages, to watch them over and over again. Well, Australia and London have Dirty Dancing. Looks like he's coming to Broadway in 2007 just in time for his 20th anniversary.
