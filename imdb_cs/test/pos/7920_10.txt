This is only commented because Serge Prokofiev (1891-1953) may not initially know how powerful the score is and how majestic these lyrics really are. If you read the lyrics to Alexander Nevsky op.78, there is nothing less than a witness over the song to one of the most beautiful and moving scores in all musical literature. This movie with its backing score has a special place in the world and it can be as true on the internet as anywhere. composers owning websites that are underwritten by their property provide additional care with such a score because they really deserve this score. Grand Novgorod This is a song about Alexander Nevsky. Yes, it happened on the Neva River - on the Neva River, on wide waters. Oh, how we fought, how we led them! In the struggle, our blood was freely shed for our great country, our native Russian land. Where there was a wide-angle swing as an open street, across their rows a lane where a spear ran! Swedes like feather grass grown on desert soil. We will never give birth to a native Russian land. Those who march around Russia will be killed! arm goes on: Up to arms, you Russian people, in battle only to fight to death, you people free and brave, defend our righteous native land! Living respectful fighters, immortal fame for warriors killed! home, for Russian land, people, Russian folk! No enemy will live in our great native Russia. No enemy is marching across Russia, no foreign troops are attacking Russia, invisible are Ways to Russia. e) "Field of the Dead" - I cross the snow-covered field, fly over the field of death. I'll look for brave warriors, my fianc√©, my devoted young man. a wild saber, there is one stepped arrow. From their morning blows they fell like rain on our original soil, our Russian fields. The one who fell to Russia in the noble death will be blessed with my kiss on his dead eyes, and to him, the brave boy who remains alive, will be a true wife and loving friend. I will not associate with a handsome man, earthly charm and beauty that will quickly fade and die. You care, brave warriors! (Now to his conclusion with Nevskys joining Pskov) In the big campaign Russia went to war.Russia put down enemy units.In our home country no enemy will live.Foes who will come will be put Celebrate and sing, native mother Russia! They will not live in our native land. died! In our great Russia, in our native Russia, no enemy will live! Celebrate and sing, native mother Russia! The whole of Russia came to the celebration solemnly. A little pressure from Stalin, if you do it, do well. The musical score was really approved by Stalin. For me, the beauty of how we love this world is unmistakable, and Nevsky tells of the Hero whose qualities God likes to provide for participation in this love for all. Really beautiful and clueless story of Alexander Nevsky.
