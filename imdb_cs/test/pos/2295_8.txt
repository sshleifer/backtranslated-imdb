MR. BASEBALL is a film of paradoxes. Written and filmed as "light sports comedies" have a truly pleasing core as human and universal, as is the case with Capra. At the conspiracy level, you have a baseball paradox, a great old American game played in Japan - turned around, with US values ​​discarded and put Japanese values ​​into play. (Some superficial "sports comedy" results from Jack's incomprehensible mistrust to how "bass-boron" is played in Japan.) You also have a lead character who is presented as an over-the-hill, aging baseball star, but who is \ t actually quite immature - a professional ball allowed him to postpone growth. And you have a leading character who is roughly resistant to the changes in his life that are forced upon him, refuses to accept the curve that life has given him, in the midst of a new country, a new manager, a new team, and a new girlfriend who has welcomed him and tried to to accept him. Sounds like heavy stuff? Not really. It is a charming comedy "clash of cultures" that takes place on a national, sporting, romantic and professional level. But if you watch it closely, you will also find a great story about a person who has to give up his immaturity and grow up too late in life (causing a certain amount of personal pain) and find success in places where he never expected it. I love the story, but I also have great respect for the Selleck performance; tearing his tush (literally) to portray the ugly American, insulting people and throwing anger in public, then letting him inside this character understand his dismay. It also doesn't hurt if you're a big Takakura Ken fan like me. MR. BASEBALL is a surprising "loss of innocence".
