First, and much better, two gay roles of Kevin Kline. (The second is the inconclusive "De-Lovely" in which Cole Porter played.) Inspired by Tom Hanks' emotional speech for "Philadelphia" in which drama appeared in high school, the nominated film in this version was probably more "Forrest Gump" than "Philadelphia" ". Hanks' character is played by Matt Dillon. The reaction scenes in most of the movie are very funny and, as often pointed out, are particularly effective, as Kevin, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck himself does (a brave step because he was the target of such rumors) which he denied!), Bob Newhart and Joan Cusack as finally joking bride-to-be. Tom Hanks' real teacher criticized the promotional scene, saying that people don't live like that in real life. But this is a farce and not a real life. As already mentioned, it's not as effective as it could be, and the wrong direction of the final "wedding scene" that makes Tom and Kevin look like they're getting in the ass. Of course, the highlight of the movie is Kevin's "how-to-be" soundtrack, and it's cheerful, but certainly not realistic, when the tape responds to Kevin's music. action. <br /> <br /> On the whole, hoofs!
