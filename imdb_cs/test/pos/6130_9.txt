"Pink Flamingos" is a cult classic. The plot of this film revolves around throwing a challenge to Divine superiority as the most vulnerable person alive. "Pink Flamingos" contains some remarkably repulsive scenes such as a sex scene with chicken and a scene where Divine eats fresh dog feces.Yes, the movie is shocking and funny at the same time, but the greatest laughter comes from the actors' lines. Divine: "Kill All Now! Condone First Degree Murder! Defend Cannibalism! Eat With *** It's My Policy, Dirt Is My Life!" Overall, I enjoy this movie really. Movies today can find this gem hard to stomach.Highly recommended .
