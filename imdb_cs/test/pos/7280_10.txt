The first thing I noticed about this movie was how well everything was set up. Quality movie all the time. <br /> <br /> I suppose you could only love this movie for his action, but I liked it more than that. This is a pure thriller / horror movie. It offers a fuller scenario than most horror movies. I thought at least the American version was brilliant and great. The story felt honest and brutal. The film has an excellent, tight scenario that keeps the action moving, with credible characters in very trustworthy situations.
