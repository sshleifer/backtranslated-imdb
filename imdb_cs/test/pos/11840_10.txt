I think this show is amazing !!! I love it and I love Fabian (not in a romantic way), but if I was there I would absolutely support Fabian as Haley and the other girls, yeah! I mean, when they roam, why don't you fight them! Fabian is the only one who has the courage to confront people and say what they think, not just stay and suck !!! FABIAN 100% !!!!! I also love Haley because she's like a normal girl who doesn't want to be with cows and bugs and grass everywhere, and sleep in a warm bed with servants, I mean, if you have a chance and money, why would you do it !!! and Fabian also brought Fabian a pizza, and like 2 or 3 people said thanks, I think he spends money !!
