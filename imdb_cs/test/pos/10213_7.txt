I've seen it years ago and it's fun, but not deep. The basic story is a young man who dreams of Midian, although he is not sure where he is, or even if he really exists. Spoilers Watch: He finally visits him, gets into Nightbreed. be bitten by another. Then they must help other Nightbreed members because they are attacked by Canadians. (Save for accents, all behave like Good Ol 'Boys. Not much in tune with the Canadian psyche, eh?) Someone watched "monsters" or "Nightbreed" replacing "Jews" and for Canadians / People, Replace "Nazis" , and you should get an insight into the fight of monsters against people. Well, maybe. One of the main objections I had was that when the underground city was interesting, it was somewhat feeble and frankly dirty. This must be a convention for films with an underground site. One would think that if monsters were good guys, some would have a little sense of decor. The storyline is thin, but it's supposed to introduce the characters. But it's fun enough for repetition.
