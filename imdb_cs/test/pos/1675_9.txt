Or vice versa. It is a French film noir directed by American filmmaker (Jules Dassin), who had to leave the country for being a Hollywood Hollywood holt based on HUAC. The idea of ​​the story is rather familiar - the last gem for Tony le Stephanois and his buds - and so is the end to everyone who gets ... Well, no spoiler here, definitely, because that's the kind of movie in which the tension towards end. Dassin shot realistic lighting in black and white in the streets of Paris with actors and actresses who are not charming. Engaging - sometimes penetrating - score Georges Auric nicely enhances the film and reminds the audience of many similar scores from American 1940s and early 1950s noir films. Jean Servais plays hardcore, consumerist leadership in a fedora much like Humphrey Bogart could have played him. Tony is out of jail lately, behind his prime, but he is still tough and decisive when he has to be, his mind is still sharp as he focuses, a kind of anti-hero whose eyes water, though tears never fall. Dassin plays Italian safecracker and would-be ladies man who knows the rules but gets careless. <br /> <br /> In film noir, we are forced by logic and focus to identify with bad guys. Often there are levels of bad guys, "good" bad guys we identify with, and "bad" bad guys who are in our good bad guys, and then maybe she's really bad, bad bad or two. (Here we have Remi Grutter, played by Robert Hossein, a slightly sadistic druggie.) Then there are the cops who are irrelevant or almost such. In the more modern film noir, the powders are not even "good" bad guys, and they get it, or something similar. In the old film noir, which evolved from gangster films of the 1930s, the usual motto, the old Hollywood "code", was "no crime", when every criminal had to pay for his crime before the end of the film. Probably the most impressive feature of Rififi is how well the movie moves. The story unfolds quickly and smoothly, as great film directors, directors like Stanley Kubrick, Louis Malle and the best of Hitchcock did. Some actually compared it with Kubrick's The Killing (1956) and suggest that Kubrick stole a little. Well, the directors always steal when needed, and there are some possible similarities, such as being the "last robbery" for the protagonist, and the little girl coughing up the works. The similarities can go deeper, because as this film came to an end, I suddenly thought, oh, no! the trunk in the back seat will fly from a convertible, hit the ground, tear and all the money will fly into the air! Those of you who have seen The Killing can remember what happened to the money at the end of the movie! Which reminds me of another movie with something wrong with the money: Oliver Stone's U Turn (1997) with Sean Penn. There, the money in his backpack is thrown into the smithy by a shotgun blast. Ha ha ha! Getting a dubbed version of this movie would be an act of sacrilege from dialogue (when there is something: robbery itself happens completely without dialogue, about 30 minutes), it is concise and easy to follow and only requires an occasional look at headlines By the way, they are quite utilitarian and guiding , unlike every word being clarified. One more thing: all the brutality is done like sex made in a movie that's turned off Camera. The guy gets his throat slit. We don't see it. Something like this approach. We don't have to see gore. You could almost let your kids see Rififi - almost. Catch this now and beware of the Hollywood reprise to play Al Pacino and directed by Harold Becker will come out next year in which you can be Make sure the violent scenes will be played in full.
