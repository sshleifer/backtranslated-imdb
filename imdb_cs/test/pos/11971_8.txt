Bears of so much resemblance to Dean Koontz's novel as Jessica Simpson makes it to rocket scientist. If you've read the book, I suggest you skip it as much as possible before watching the movie. The Rangers Are Your Typical "A boy meets a dog, a dog turns out to be a super-intelligent government lab experiment, a dog and a boy are watched by a super-intelligent and emotionally disturbed monster created by the same lab, and oh yeah, I mentioned the shadowy government agents who watched the monster hunting dog? movie. Corey Haim is a boy, Barbara Williams is his mother, Michael Ironside is one of the bad government guys, and Sandy is a dog, well, a dog (named Furface here; a book). Monster effects are ridiculously cheesy, most of the dialogue is ridiculous, the script rarely makes sense or is believable - a good example is the unquestionable acceptance of Haim's dog character as if every street Fido can write messages on a computer or bark keyboard once for yes and twice for no! Hmm, it must be a puppy, right? Haim's performance is enthusiastic but uncertain because he performs a stupid dialogue with the least skill. Ironside was the pinnacle of many bad movies, and that's no exception. He easily puts the best performance of the movie, though I am forced to add that dog (who is a damn good actor himself!) Comes in near second. <br /> <br /> All in all, cruelly stupid movie, and yet. . . And yet I watched it three times a week. And yet I can't help it. Hey, what can I say, I want a junk - and Michael Ironside (not that I actually tasted Michael Ironside - I'm sure the laws are against it). But every movie that can make me laugh (yes, even unintentionally) can't be bad. Chalk's up to blame pleasure, "yes, I know it's insulting stupid, but I like it anyway" movie. It's hard for me to rate it. On a normal scale, I am forced to give him D-, but on my personal scale, cheese gets to A-. Yeah, I know. I'm so special.
