Movies are something you see Saturday night and forget about Sunday morning. Movies are works of art that stay with you forever. Mishima falls into the second category. This is the kind of thing that should win the Academy Awards, a brilliant, visual look at a film that is both depressing and uplifting. Instead of looking directly at Yukia Mishima's life, director Paul Schrader intertwined three adaptations of the author's stories to look at his past and the last day on Earth. Caesar. If he doesn't, he commits a ritual suicide at the end that hits you like a ton of bricks. Three short stories allow insight into what has led him to do so, and are presented in an experimental way that makes them a movie scenic game. Ken Ogata is as magnificent as Mishima. Despite his eccentricities, he comes as a very sympathetic, man who is quite willing to die for his beliefs and does. This makes the end which is more destructive and the sense of loss more meaningful. Of the three story adaptations, the Golden Pavilion Temple, Kyoko House and Runaway Horses, it's the last one that is the strongest and most emotional. It is also a story that most corresponds to Mishima's mood in his last years and illustrates what truly led him to the events of November 1970. This review cannot be complete without mentioning Philip's overwhelming musical score. Not since 2001, the film score has such a perfect compliment that it's visual. Paul Schrader has created one of the most beautiful films of the 1980s or any other decade. They have hankies on alert because the end will leave you in tears. Mishima: Life in four chapters reminds you that film can still be an art form and is great as art.
