This is a pleasure. That's really a parody. Only French people can do such things without being rude. As a result, you spend a really good time watching Jean Dujardin play the dumb. Most of the film stands on his shoulders, and he is wide enough to make this film good. For example, he has a perfect way to play James Bond, which he doesn't imitate for Mike Meyers at Austin Powers. Dialogs are also good enough to keep the viewer's attention, with many stupid jokes, that's really perfect. Both women, who have the main parts of the film, have a comparison with the main character and that was a challenge. There is no really conspiracy in this movie, but this is not what is expected in this kind of movie. You just want to laugh for 40 minutes and that's exactly what the movie will do. He deserves the success he has in France
