As on Earth this film is not more widely regarded as me. I picked him up for Â£ 1, and I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the best pound I've ever spent a movie on. The thing that usually makes movies about the club scene is either music or real scenes shot at the club. <br /> <br /> Here are music and club scenes. absolutely trustworthy, using some great melodies of that time, and filmed in real clubs, with people who actually seem to want to be there. The performances of the actors are high all the time, even though Jason Donovan is particularly exciting for me (he played Frank N Furter at The Rocky Horror Show in London about the time it had to be filmed so His drag phase was in full swing!), And of course Tim Curry, who is eloquent The head of the drug country is convincing. Simply put, if you're a fan of British film, you have to see it. as well as the story. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
