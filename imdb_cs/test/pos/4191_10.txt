All this but ignored masterpiece is that the Monkees realize that they are fictional characters in the movie (Head), and that everything they do or say was written in a (invisible) scenario that seems to be followed. The head was written by Jack Nicholson, Rafelson, and Peter Tork during a three-day LSD trip in the apartments at an expensive Hollywood hotel. The other three Monkees acted in it. <br /> <br /> They fight it everywhere they can do things that aren't in the script. They deliberately fade their lines, leave the sets, tear the scenery, strike other actors unreasonably; and finally commit suicide by jumping off the bridge. For example, in quick flashes of a psychedelic party scene, if you watch a frame by frame, you can see Rafelson sitting next to the camera and cameraman, very deliberately shooting in the mirror. He reveals that the party is actually fake and is shot in the studio with actors who suddenly fall out of the character and leave in the middle of a conversation when the Director screams "cut!" they are also who they really are. It ends up as the core of Revelation that comes soon. At every turn, they realize that their increasingly bizarre actions were exactly what they were supposed to do in a scenario they can't escape. Are you saying that they went crazy and went through the sky (which turned out to be painted on paper and hung from the ceiling as the background of the set)? No problem! Hey, hey, it's Monkees, and those stupid guys are still leaning! Finally, their death did not free them. That was how the film was supposed to end, and their motionless, wet bodies were fished out of the river, placed in another box, and stacked in the film studio until the characters were needed for further studio production. It is all the more so because the Monkees really are fictional characters that have been forced into the real world. They made it through the power of their music. Ironically, near the end, Peter Tork has what he rightly sees as an extremely deep revelation that will solve their problem, but unfortunately, no one listens. Peter realizes that: "MATTER if we're in a box (movie)". It means that it doesn't matter whether it is free or illusory, and that "the only important thing is that you leave the present moment to come and come ... You must leave it now" as it happens. without analyzing or evaluating or judging whether the experience is "valid" by some abstract definitions. <br /> <br /> If you can't even tell the difference, it will be no matter whether it's free or not. you will find out if you are "real", it's just a waste of time. I saw this film in a very important time in my life. I tried to figure out how to escape, being a "geeky, creepy nerd" by thinking intensely instead of having fun (ie, Sex) like everyone else. But the revelation in my head broke my own recursive traps and helped me more than Rafelson or Nicholson or Tork, who sometimes know it. For decades, I've been watching "Head" and wishing I could thank Pete. Was it a good movie? Uhh, what about ... <br /> <br /> == <ANO> ==
