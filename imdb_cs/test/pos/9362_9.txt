This was a very daring film about anti-Semitism. Unlike the GENTLEMENS AGREEMENT (which also deals with anti-Semitism), the film has aged well and does not seem cumbersome. In other words, it deals with the subject without seeming to preach or humble according to today's standards. Robert Ryan plays one of the most outrageous characters when he beats a guy to death just because he is Jewish. Robert Mitchum plays an investigator trying to get to the bottom of this crime. I give the film kudos for his courageous and unwavering look at hatred. It is in many ways an example of Noir's film - though this is not about the usual gangsters or robberies.
