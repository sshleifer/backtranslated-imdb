The people at Aardman have made a cool, cute and wild adaptation of their short films, Wallace and Gromit, to mark themselves in length, just like a man and his dog, inventors who seem to have more (or practicality) for intelligence. In this case, they invented a machine that can capture all the bunnies who eat crops throughout a quiet English village. Especially for Mrs. Tottington (or 'Totty' for those who are 'intimate'), much to the confusion of Victor Quartermaine who simply wants to kill all rabbits with his trust rifle. Wallace and Gromit seem to have success with their machine, but Wallace has a mix-up: the machine he made to curl suddenly with a rabbit - the curse is on! Much of this is about as light a cheerful entertainment as a children's movie could ask for, but it also fits the oldest tradition of the classic grotesque series: Looney Tunes, which in turn owes a lot of quiet comedy and vaudeville. It is true that Aardman guys (Nick Park and Steve Box) have a lot of other tricks and tricks and ingenuity with their material. It is never less than amazing to see how one can stop movement, although a joke or gag may be a bit of a funny "ho-ho" not a funny "ha-ha" side (tired criticism, but I) I'll say it. The curse of Were-Rabbit works so well on all fronts for the audience, in its crooked story and sudden drops into the exposition (the Golden Bullet's Doozy story), Park and Box, and society never loses sight of the joy of material. br /> <br /> It's blurry and cordial and totally off the wall for kids (even the youngest will love adventures and weird aids such as Wallace and Gromit) and for adults there are little funky spikes, absurd tones in the middle of the classic English farce. Only (and here I am probably a minority opinion) compared to Chicken Run is almost a bit of a mild work - there's less plot than a series of running gags, and of course plenty of puns including bunnies and monsters and carnivals and cheese (and terrible egos men) in their weapons as Fiennes expressed Quartermaine). But when it hits the best, it's one of the most entertaining movies of 2005. It gives me a big goofy smile whenever it's on TV.
