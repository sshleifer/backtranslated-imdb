In the versatile series of modern Sherlock Holmes stories with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, SHERLOCK HOLMES AND SECRET WEOPON is not one of the best movies - even though it's fun. I think the problem with this is that much of the film "dueling" between Holmes and his nemesis Moriarty (played by Lionel Atwill) seems to be delaying the professor's actual job. Moriarty appears three of Holmes' films with Rathbone. In the SHERLOCK HOLMES ADVENTURE, George Zucco starred in the role of villagers. For my money, Zucco's performance as a best of three professor (in his performance is a short comedy moment when he is disguised as "police sergeant" at the end - as he prepares to sing Gilbert & Sullivan's "Police Lot"). Mr. Atwill's performance - more of it later: Finally, Henry Moriarty's intellectual at SHERLOCK HOLMES AND LADY IN GREEN is typically Daniel Daniel's cool, elegant performance, but his confrontation with Holmes seems boring to him. In the stories the professor appears, he really feels that Holmes is a nemesis that will remain a danger while he is still alive, yet, because the intellectual tennis match between him and Rathbone, Rathbone (in his autobiography) actually felt Daniell was the best Moriartys movie If Zucco caught the love of evil in the professor, and Daniell seemed to demonstrate a tired Oxford Don (vp.) Professor is a well-regarded mathematician whose book on binomial theorem had a "European fashion" and who wrote an interesting book DYNAMICS ASTEROID), Atwill demonstrates Professor as a pragmatic businessman. First he sold his services (apparently) to Nazi Germany. This has never been done, but it is assumed (as it happened before the Nazis really collapsed) that they will win the war. Second, he's not crazy. When Dr. Tobel (William Post Jr.) showed himself to be close to physical collapse as a result of Moriarty gang torture, the professor decides to kidnap one of the other scientists who help Tobel because he is as good a scientist as Tobel and would be able to build a bomb. Somehow I do not see Zucco making such a sensible decision on the spot, and if Daniell had to do so, he would seem to be angry that his plans had yet another delay. By the way, one trick used in all the Holmes series about the professor is how to get rid of his movie. If you read Holm's stories, Moriarty appears as a villain three times: in the last story of MEMOIRS SHERLOCK HOLMES, in the first story of RETURNING SHERLOCK HOLMES and the last of four novels (Fear Level) ). It is amazing how many miles a professor has stepped out of so few appearances (he is mentioned in two or three other stories as well - during). But given his fate at the Reichenbach Falls in "FINAL PROBLEM" and "THE EMPTY HOUSE", we always see him fall to his death. Zucco falls from the White Tower on Tower Hill. Daniell (with more imagination) tries to flee Gregson and the police, but he is shot when he jumps, and he can't keep the wounded on the wall of the adjacent building. Atwill (here it is not seen but heard) seems to fall into a trap door being planted in an escape tunnel). It's really boring after a while to see a professor always fall into these movies. One turns to the comedy Gene Wilder, but it is fun that Leo McKern is beautifully crazy and the villain Moriarty (complete, finally with an Irish accent) who is not killed at the end, but just left. Waving - in the boat - over how his careful schemes didn't work. I liked it better. Using the code "Dancing Men" as well as using "Devil's Foot Root" in DRESSED TO KILL captures some of the mystery from the story. "ADVENTURE OF DANCING MEN" appeared in the Mountain HOLM COURSE, and deals with the Holmes client, whose wife in this code became strange news that swarmed with blood. Charles Higham, in his biography of ADVENTURY CONAN DOYLE, suggests that Sir Arthur could pick up the code from a magazine game in the 1870s, but we really don't know. The code is basically one of the letter substitutes for the dancing men. The story in the story is dramatic, but it deals with the triangle. The only innovation in the film is that Tobel makes a slight change that confuses both Holmes and Moriarty. The movie will be fun, but I still think the HOUSE of Fear, SCARLET CLAW and SHERLOCK HOLMES FACES DEATH are better movies.
