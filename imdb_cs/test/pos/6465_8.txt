Though this little film type is lost in the wake of The Waterfront, Edge Of The City can definitely keep its own with this star studded classic. It's another story about the docks and the code of silence that rules it. In addition to the corrupt union that Lee J. Cobb ran on the waterfront, Jack Warden is a really small time of corruption. But he's real enough as a gang boss on one of the docks that intimidates other workers by fitting them with their fists and hook, and the rest gets back to give them back some of their hard earned money. And it's all hard-earned money in this job. One guy Warden can't scare them off Sidney Poitier another gang boss and when he tries to intimidate novice John Cassavetes, Poitier takes him under his wing. The two develop quite a friendship and Poitier and his wife Ruby Dee even fix Cassavetes up with Kathleen Maguire. The Ranger is indeed one nasty creature, and it is sad that almost everyone else is the absolute power of personality and the physical prowess of the cow. In this sense, he is tougher than Lee J. Cobb, who had to rely on a collection of goon prints to push his will on the quay on the waterfront. Edge Of The City was Martin's great directorial debut. Ritt, who did a great job with a good New York cast and a spot camera. The low budget of the movie is showing, but you're so impressed by the cast that you don't really care about. Cassavetes as a loner with past and hip and hard Poitier are both fine, but my personal favorite in this movie is Ruby Dee. She should get some appreciation for her performance, her latest scene with Cassavetes is excellent. <br /> <br /> If possible, grab this. I wish it was on DVD or VHS.
