*** May contain Spoilers *** OK, it wasn't as good as expected in fact it was a lot different than I thought it would be, but it still turned out to be a pretty good movie. I usually don't care much about this type of music, but it worked perfectly in this movie (I think a rainbow is a rock star), but in this I loved Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah, though the movie was amazing. And while Tom Cruise played Lestat in an interview with a vampire, I have to admit that I'm glad he rejected the role, even though I hate it normally when used by different people playing the same characters as sequels and similar things. Overall, the movie was great and I liked to watch it, though there were parts that could be better. Big vampire movie.
