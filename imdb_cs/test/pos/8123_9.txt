According to acting in this film, it is sometimes hard not to imagine that the cast is who they display themselves to be. Unleashed passion and acting sometimes make this film very enjoyable and engaging. It wouldn't be even about HBO late at night. And the biggest reason I like movies in the UK much better than American movies is that actors are not afraid to act on what is needed.
