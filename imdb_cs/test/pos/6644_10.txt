Scary watches, but one of Bergman's best films. It is interesting to compare it to The Wolf Hour because they both have the same lead actor as the artist (or artist and his wife) who took refuge on the island. In an earlier movie, it's pretty much inner demons that lead to the disintegrating personality of von Sydows (at least that's how I read it), while here it is a lot of circumstances beyond his control. the characters, particularly von Sydow's. For me, at the beginning of the film, there are flashes of a good (albeit wrong) man, but one who is wrong with the bad. Defects become all that is left, because his humanity is gradually eroded by one horror after another. Soon after that I watched Umumann (Ullmann and von Sydow on their island) and was amazed to recognize many of the same places. And then there's a dream sequence ...
