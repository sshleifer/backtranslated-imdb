I love this movie. Yes, the main character lies, but that's why it's called a "big fat liar". Even if this child runs to Hollywood, he doesn't give the kids the idea that they can. Besides not only doing it for fun or getting away from something, he does it to regain confidence. <br /> <br /> I don't think it was just one big advertisement for Universal Studios because I liked how it made an inner look at what it's like for kids who don't know how cool it is. <br /> <br /> He has good music and fun characters. This family / comedy is absolutely fun for kids and parents. He has humor, excitement and real life problems like lying. Finally, "Big Fat Liar" airs moral: don't expect lies to be easy.
