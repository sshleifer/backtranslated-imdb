this movie was great! I absolutely loved it! Wesley snipes was great for this role - and I'm sure the blade 2 would be just as good. <br /> <br /> The blade is by far one of my favorite outdoor events / horror movies! And if you have seen it and as vampires and blood (all of it), you should really rent it because I assure you you will love it!
