Send them to the freezer. This is the solution that two butchers will find after finding the popularity of human meat sales. An incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it much more than a horror movie. Comprehensive characters defy the superficial classification and make the story interesting and useful - if you can. Definitely a dark movie, but also a little redeemable.
