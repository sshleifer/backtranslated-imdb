This brings so many childhood memories. (I'm not old, I'm 19) It's brilliant. Trains, old house, fallen runner, really haunted landslide (that's when you are 6), drama if kids can stop the train or will it crash? It is a children's film without any doubts, but it offers great harmless blood / guts / weapons to children. And he has Bernard Cribbins in it, who is fine. 8/10
