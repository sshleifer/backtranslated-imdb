Death in Venice is a movie I have to see every ten years. It's always different because I'm always at a different stage of life. The film is about art, beauty, desire, death. Some scenes are painfully slow, others just unpleasant to watch, especially if you seemed earlier. Still, I wouldn't want to miss one picture. The music is repeated, the main theme of adagietta from Mahler's fifth is used again and again. Still, I wouldn't want to miss one comment. When the last picture disappears, the last note dies, I am cowardly and exhausted. This film is a monument to filmmaking. As with most really good movies, the crowd should stay on Saturday night. And that's just the best movie ever.
