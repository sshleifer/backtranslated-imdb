Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. This is Werner Herzog's most unconventional film. He has no story or story. Instead of the story, we get a collection of paintings, words and music that work so beautifully together. It's not even a documentary. Some people in this movie are directed and can read lines. It has some of the most beautiful and scary images. Herzog shoots real miracles and we see cars and people floating in the middle of the desert who are not there, but hundreds of miles away are reflected in the mirror. The use of music in this film is so brilliant - from Leonard Cohen, Mozart and the third band. Imagine Stanley Kubrick in 2001: Space Odyssey in the Desert; this is the movie. This film is so hypnotic that it has the ability to feel like your spirit has left your body. You must see. This will change the way you view movies. Rating: 10 out of 10.
