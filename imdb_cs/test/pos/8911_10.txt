First, the alien rescues a little black boy as well as Mexican, despite what the IMDb plot summary suggests. This film is the fulfillment of the purest male fantha, an interracial rape. The main character of this film is George Michaelesque a drug who does not understand the initial human urges, such as drug abuse and murder. Every time he uses violence to solve the problem, he has an internal conflict that physically prevents him. That's the square. In any case, my favorite scene is writing a letter to a gang that says they want $ 500 to get from the Reading Center to meet him. He is surrounded by countless Chicago gangsters at the meeting, but keeps his head cool. In slow motion, it strikes the stem with a wooden column that breaks when in contact. Then, still in slow motion, points to the gang leader and says, "Noooooooooooooooooooo, mooooooooooooore!" Gang members follow. Cool, right? The beauty of this film is manifested in these simple solutions to social problems such as prostitution and gang violence.
