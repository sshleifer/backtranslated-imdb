Despite the title and unlike some other stories about love and war, this film is not too sticky and pink because love is like a rose: With thorns, that is. Four leading actors have built their characters realistically and with a good sense and balance between tragic and earthly. The music and lyrics of the songs cabaret / chanson-esquire (sung by Keira Knightley herself) drag the viewer deeper and deeper into the film, from one place to another, between and between the brutal war. peaceful love. Some people may consider it too organic, but it is mostly a romantic story, although it follows the life of Dylan Thomas and a triangular relationship that is full of joy and jealousy. London will once come out from a different angle, Dylan's bohemian life during the German bombings set in the floating atmosphere of small bedrooms, pubs and bars. Independent women, a soldier and a charismatic poet are constantly swept away by feelings of love and anger. Maybe the end is too twisted and hangs loosely to the rest of the movie, but it's all a great romantic story.
