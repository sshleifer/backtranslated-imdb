Traveling to the past is unclear at best. In this episode, a man thinking about the possibility finds himself on the day and place of assassination of Abraham Lincoln. In the short time at his disposal, he tries to predict everything he can think of. Of course he's pretty crazy. He is arrested and finally returned to the man he is trying to stop. Serling was so clear that he could return to the present, but is it the same? This is something like the predecessor of "The Time Tunnel", where passengers on a weekly basis get the same job and overcome what has already happened. Unfortunately, the consequences of time and future distortion always negate the result. Unless you have something like Ray Bradbury's "The Sound of Thunder".
