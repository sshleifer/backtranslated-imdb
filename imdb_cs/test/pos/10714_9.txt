What can I say about Kramer vs. Kramer? On the surface it is quite simple, but under it it deals with emotions greater than life itself. This brings many fantastic moments, makes you laugh, makes you cry. You compassion and care for the characters. Many movies fail in this, Kramer vs.. Kramer is a success. I think everyone would agree that acting is excellent. Once you watch Kramer vs. Kramer, for some time in most of the other films he starts to feel plastic and fresh. The actors seem to be well based on their roles and the characters actually live on the screen. Among them is beautiful chemistry. I think the best performance in the film comes from the young Justin Henry. It's different from any other child actor I've ever seen. He's amazingly natural. Also in Meryl Streep there is some neurotic beauty. And Dustin Hoffman delivers one of the best performances of his career! The story is very well written. It's simple, yet complicated. The concept is a simple part, the feelings associated with it are a complicated part. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie yet, you're definitely missing! Look now!
