Better than my right to be, this movie died of a quick and painful death in the US box office. Occasionally sophomoric, at others, scathingly satirical and humorous, Jekyll and Hyde are mostly just a close perfect reflection of times, loaded with drug and sexual humor, commemorating one at once or another of everything from Woody Allen "everything you always wanted to know about sex" to Mel Brooks "Producers", Saturday Night Live Monty Python, Carlin Cheech and Chong Watch this, listen carefully because some jokes are really fast, and remember the time when comedy was allowed to be extremely cheerful.
