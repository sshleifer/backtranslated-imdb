There are only a few films that have been made on such a large scale and made such a difference in the art of making a film. "Bronenosets Potyomkin" is one of these movies, and it should be on the list of people who want to learn more about film history. Grigori Aleksandrov and Sergei M. Eisenstein conducted this groundbreaking film that documents the horrors of the Russian battleship. When the sailors finally retaliate against their superiors, the locals accept them and support them. Things are ugly when a group of soldiers is sent to a small town to take care of business. What follows is one of the most imitated scenes in the history of cinema. Anyone who has seen "Untouchables" and "Bronenosets Potyomkin" knows exactly what I mean. Overall, I think this film raised the bar for filmmaking as well as "Intolerance" a few years ago. If you don't mind quiet movies, do yourself a favor and check out "Bronenosets Potyomkin". <br /> <br /> If you don't like silent movies ..... just watch "Bronenosets Potyomkin". <br /> <br />
