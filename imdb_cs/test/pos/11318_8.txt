This movie was really interesting ... it is also quite shocking because a similar film event took place only 10 months after the film's premiere. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see the problems you might encounter and pretty realistic to show that no matter how ready you think you are - you're not. if it were made for an American audience - it would be different because it would be used as a full-blown propaganda film and not as the wake that the BBC did! it is still propaganda, to some extent - no film can be with these themes today - but it has successfully handled the problem. A movie that should be shown in all terrorism / counter terrorism courses, but it won't be because it shows errors that are not allowed! The big movie, in which the BBC took several risks and unfortunately, London no longer needs a fictional story, given the reality of July 7, 2005.
