"Any Gun Can Play" (1967), directed by Enzo G. Castellari, is a very good pastiche of Western Spaghetti, especially Leone. The first half is great, which, besides opening, is a direct nod to "For more dollars more", with Monco, Colonel Douglas Mortimer and El Indie lookalikes who go to the ghost town and then immediately kill them by Bounty Hunter called "The Stranger" , is absolutely serious, with big gunfights (especially the scene for stealing trains), fast and furious action and nice performances by Gilbert Roland, George Hilton and (who is doing well because he thinks he is wrong) Edd Byrnes. But when the film reaches half the direction, there is a funny fight between Hilton and Byrnes. It's not very funny and it's the weakest part of the movie, but it notices everything you've seen in a new light. You realize that in fact the whole thing is a spoof of the Spaghetti Western conventions and, in retrospect, the first half is so well done that this false undercurrent is completely missing. What follows is a brighter parody, even some acrobatic jumping from Brynes, which precedes all those 70s Circus Westerns. The end, the complete sending of "Good, Bad and Ugly" climax is very well done, because in other hands it could have been very stupid. So, quite a funny Spaghetti Western that doesn't take it too seriously. I would recommend it to anyone who likes spaghetti Westerns.
