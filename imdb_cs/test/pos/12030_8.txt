A guest of the future tells a fascinating story of time travel, friendship, the struggle for good and evil - all with a small budget, children's actors and some special effects. Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. The sixth grader Kolja "Nick" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a ruined building and travels 100 years into the future. He finds an almost perfect utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people have everything that technology offers them. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows people and animals to read thoughts. The device can be used for both good and bad use, depending on which hand falls. When two evil Saturn space pirates who want to rule the universe try to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of schoolboy Nick of the 20th century. With the pirates hot on his travels, he travels back to his time, followed by pirates and Alice. Followed by chaos, confusion and witty situations, when the happy pirates try to blend into earthly people. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in the PE class. Capture them, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like while pirates do. Also, pirates are able to change their appearance and turn to literally anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if James Cameron got the idea for Terminator ...) Who gets to Nick - and Mielophone? Excellent land, non-stop adventure and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood movies were like this ...
