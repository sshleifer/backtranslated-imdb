Big Fat Liar is a great watch for kids of all ages, even adults. I had a great time watching this movie and I recommend it to kids 10 years and under. Laughter never ends and an adventurous plot is also pretty good! Frankie Muniz is funny and Marty Wolfe is cheerful! Overall, a nicely made movie for kids to enjoy and just have a great time.
