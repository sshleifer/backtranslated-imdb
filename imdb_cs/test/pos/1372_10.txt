I must admit that I know some of those I have attended, I was in the planet's predecessor, Evil Unleased, but it was more than 10 years ago and since then I have lost contact with them. I was probably watching BBC Scotland News and a piece about the Scottish Cinema, the aforementioned clips from The Planet and comments from director Mark Stirton, which made me order a copy of the film on DVD. Now to the movie, the level of acting, writing, directing and sfx is there with some of the best around, OK, it's not Star Wars, but I've seen many Hollywood products that are much worse. It's very strange to watch a movie spoken in my local accent in northeastern Scotland, but it soon passed. <br /> <br /> ^ Mild Spoilers ^ <br /> <br /> Planet draws on several sci-fi classics; Star Wars, Alien, Pitch Black, The Forbidden Planet and Predator, a handful of deep-sea crews survive their vessel, which is attacked and destroyed by unknown ships, fleeing the deserted desert planet, one by one killed by invisible attackers, ships only by passengers The mysterious prisoner also gets to the planet, followed by a battle because the crew is fighting for survival. Planet is a great piece of sci-fi movie that does it Certainly hides a limited budget, well done by Mark, Mike and all involved, I look forward to your next job.
