Kennedy-Miller could hardly do a better job of tackling a very challenging task: to make dry political events as a human drama and to provide an even representation of explosively controversial topics. The key to his success on first counting is brilliant acting, though I was less impressed by Max Phipps' performance as Gough Whitlam than some other commentators here. The clear prospect of my money was John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and Bill Hunter as Rex Connor. He must be one of the easiest casting options in history - Hunter couldn't have been better at this role. On the second counting, the series avoids the "objectivity myth" trap through the narrator who articulates the director's sympathy (Phillip Noyce, who more recently demonstrated his left-wing commission in the Rabbit Proof Fence), while being carefully-hand-hand. and sympathetic in its dramatic depiction of all sides. Adhering to the theme of Lady Kerr / Lady Macbeth popular among Labor Guerrillas was perhaps a bit partial, though not disturbing. Especially the merit is the sympathy for Kerr and the extremely difficult position in which he has been placed, whatever he thinks of his act. However, there is one acidic note that the producers have been. perhaps not entirely to blame - showing Jim Cairns / Juni Morosi's affair. Those who get into the show without any stimulus to these events will have the impression that Cairns and Morosi were innocent victims of the smudge campaign created by the island gutter. Producers may be hampered by Australia's viciously abusive laws in this regard, and the recently proven willingness of Cairns and Morosi to use them against those who suggested their relationship was sexual (which Cairns would eventually confess to one year before his death). However, more could be made of bizarre fashion, in which Morosi ran Cairns's office as a cashier. Speaking of defamation, there are several disorienting opportunities whereby dialogue is obscured by court orders that have been removed by insulted insults. principles - with one beep and with a very loud phone ringing on another. Another Curiosity: The DVD release excites the line from the comic book scene where the customs officer (played by Paul Chubb late) serves Tirath Khemlani on his arrival at Sydney Airport. Next in line is a disheveled looking hippie who now only receives a disapproving look from Chubb as he presents his papers. In the original version, Chubb said something in the spirit: "drug busts in Bali, eh?". Of course, this line has not expired in the case of the Schapelle Corby case, which has dramatically illustrated that those who were stuffed with drugs in Bali can expect much worse results than deportation.
