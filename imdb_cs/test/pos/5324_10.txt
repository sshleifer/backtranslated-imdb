Every role, except the smallest, was cast and acted with the brave. Extraordinary Jena Malone will never make the wrong move. Her two star stars are the same in this movie. Ryan Gosling can be the best actor of his generation. Chris Klein has been giving his best performance so far. This is a thought and conversation provoking movie that should be seen by teens and young adults. You'll think about this movie and talk for days. Highly recommended.
