Boogie Nights was undoubtedly the best film of 1997. I could watch this film over and over again and still love. I'm not in any hurry to watch that burned novel / epic Titanic disaster again. The fact that Boogie Nights did not even receive the Best Picture nomination just shows how the Academy is predictable and anxious. Only Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereless and Robert Zemeckis's contact came close to being as great as Boogie Nights. In recent years, no other film director has even taken a distance to film as good as Tarantino Pulp Fiction. Paul Thomas Anderson got to the challenge and succeeded. Like Tarantino, John Travolta gave a career kick, P.T. Anderson gave Burt Reynolds a kick that needs his career. Boogie Nights will also undoubtedly make Don Cheadle, Heather Graham and John Reilly stars. Overall, a wonderful movie. Best from Pulp Fiction. Maybe even better.
