Absolutely the most elaborate, spiritually deep, intense Hamlet he has ever done - no other version is coming. Jacobi has the best understanding of the role of all the actors who played her. Patrick Stewart's Claudius is furious and still sympathetic - especially I like two Doofus playing Rosencranze and Guildenstern. Very flawless yet sinister. Some might worry about the need for a strong Ophelia - he's not a strong person, that's the right point, and Lalla Ward hits the right nuances. Amazing. Just amazing - I have watched it more than two dozen times.
