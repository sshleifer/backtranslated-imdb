Bergman is a noble director of comedy and writer. This fact is reflected in the "En lektion I kärlek", where comic elements range from pure grotesques to deep, yet very emotional scenes. This film paves the way for Bergman's later comedy "Sommarnattens leende" and "Kvinnodröm", all with Gunnar Björnstrand and Eva Dahlbeck. It is an excellent film with which you can start your Bergman experiences, acutely portraying the emotional difficulties of young and old. Martin Bodin's cinematography is overwhelming, for example on the picnic scene. In short, the film is a perfect example of a successful comedy, with clarity of depth even surpassing some of Bergman's own comedies.
