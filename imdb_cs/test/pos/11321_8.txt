Daniel Percival's "Dirty War", a BBC production made for television was shown recently on cable. The film has a documentary style as it goes for people who have caused a close Holocaust in one of the world's great metropolises, London. In fact, this film, produced in 2004, is an almost warning story of the following year's events in which terrorists set up explosive devices in public transport that killed innocent people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. /> <br /> The film captivates at the pace that the director and production team have given the project. There are no moments in the film as we look at the preparation of terrorists and people watching their dirty work. Though this inevitably happens, it is wonderful to imagine what the consequences would be if a real "dirty bomb" were set in a densely populated area. <br /> <br /> The latest movie frames have a freezing effect. Crowd scenes and the way the entire area is contaminated send trembling of fear and wonder how it could happen anywhere.
