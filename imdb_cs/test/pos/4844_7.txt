A very good film about anti-Semitism at the end of World War II. A scene that speaks aloud about the ignorance of these people is a meeting in a church when a priest gives a speech against "international grubs of money and communists". It sounds incredible as the speeches that Adolph Hitler used to thrust his people's throats, but none of the meeting attendees seems to see this comparison.
