If I look hard enough, in this film you can find flaws, especially the script. I found out that the character of Wolf is not entirely convincing. But these were my only "complaints". Because when this movie started on Cable, I wanted to record it and watch it later. However, from the beginning, with scary music and Cameron Diaz doing her spaced 60th dance, I was riveted. I never got up until the movie was over. I never seemed to flash. The work of Cameron Diaz and Jordan Brewster was excellent. The scenes were beautiful, the girls were beautiful and the music was scary and very touching. The story was quite unique and sometimes of incredible quality. The viewer would tend to behave more in the image if he understood the minds of young people in the 1960s and 1970s, especially in America. In fact, many of the scenes have managed to show something from the era that is difficult to set. It was a little more complicated than a simplified statement that they wanted to change the world and ended up disillusioned, although it may be the most obvious aspect. Phoebe gets to know more about how the film progresses. One aspect that seems to be covered by other reviewers who might mention it is the way the two daughters seem to go through life. after the death of his father. Both adored him, and his presence was a stabilizing factor in their lives, and he clearly loved them dearly. We've read so much today about boys who too soon lose their father just to lose their way alone. This film covers the rippling effect of losing her father to the daughters who stayed, first on older sister Faith, then on her younger sister. Their mother feels inadequate to try to be both parents. This type of dynamics is not covered by almost any other films, especially in so many different layers of plotter and subplot. Phoebe's inner struggles of reality versus perception are gradually peeling off as layers of onion. Speaking of conspiracy, this film should be slightly higher than here. I was still waiting for some conspiracy about the death of faith. As it solved, I was surprised, though others might have guessed much earlier. Maybe not for everyone, but I could watch this movie many times.
