I was impressed by the quality of this movie, especially after I saw photos of a barely adult director - all 140 (?) Lbs! Indeed, a boy who directs a film about a boy. I look forward to the next films by Luke Eberl. <br /> <br /> I thought this was too long. There was too much time spent showing Connor to be unsuccessful (and reluctant) to make a move on Owen. Caleb wasn't trying hard enough. Owen was so young that he could easily get to Caleb and later decided it wasn't his preference. And Owen would still learn a "valuable lesson" about corruption and politics. Instead, he didn't give him a fair chance to learn about his sexuality. What about poor Caleb? Owen could have been a good influence. Although the film wants to show Owen as a hero who overcomes perverted corruption, I felt sad for Owen. He was offered to amuse the boy with Caleb, who was extremely beautiful. Owen didn't have to go along with the political perversity it was offered. But he could try to have fun with Caleb, and he left when he left. It was clear that Owen was in charge - no one made him do anything he didn't want to do. However, he could have more fun and do it with a very hot friend on it. I hope Luke does more movies where attractive young characters have more fun.
