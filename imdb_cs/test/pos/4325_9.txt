Lost was one of the most fascinating and exciting experiences I've ever seen. Not only is it the mother of chance, but also every time you think you can set up a whole puzzle in your head, the story is completely new. Take this sacrifice, for example, in the US, who gives Sayid a way to become a torturer, is Clancy Brown, a character in the name of Joe Inman. In the last episode, he plays Kelvin Inman, Desmond's partner in Hatch. Destiny, uh? Yeah, yeah! I think we'll all have to wait to find out what's going on in the wonders of humans in this strange island, in the middle of nowhere. Knowing that several of my favorite characters, Desmond, Sayid, and Mr. Eco, have a vague fate <br /> <br /> I believe along with 24 and The Shield it's one of the best TV shows ever, of course, to keep Twin Peak on special place.
