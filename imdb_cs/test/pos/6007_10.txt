Excellent storytelling and cinematography. Poignant, biting social commentary. <br /> <br /> Excellent effects. Well shot and done. However, the parallel between the presence and adventure of travel (though very well done) sometimes pulls a little more (about 3 hours) and breaks the break of the Story Story. First I read the book as a child and enjoyed a section about villages and small people - but the book lost me when it got to the floating island and the land of "yahoos"! Although an adventurous plot may sound like a children's story, it is actually a very adult story full of symbolism about moral decline in England at the time of Jonathan Swift, the author of the novel on which the film is based.
