This is another fun and fun Hitchcock movie. James Stewart and Doris Day are incredible in this movie. Bernard Herrmann appears alone near the top: <br /> <br /> The scenery and locations are great, except for one scene that was clearly a fake background, which makes no sense because the scenes before and after were in the same environment real shots. I heard Hitchcock did it deliberately. <br /> <br /> It seems that the reviews of this movie are mixed. I think it's better than the average Hitchcock movie. Very fun and has a great light comic scene at the end. <br /> <br /> I rated 8 out of 10 <br /> <br />
