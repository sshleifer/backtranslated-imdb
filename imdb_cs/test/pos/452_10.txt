"Journey" is a very good movie. Produced in the spring of 1958, in Vienna, and released in 1959, this film was quite popular in its early years. Despite the political problems that influenced the film's success (because the story happens during the Hungarian Revolution, the Cold War), "The Way" is a very good film, but not known. I think it should be released immediately on DVD, because most people who have seen it so far want it at home. One of the most important features of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner, their intense relationship. All their scenes are very important, but they also reveal strong feelings, great passion and love among the characters (Major Surov and Diana Ashmore). Another quality is a script that is very well written. It was even released as a novel, screen player George Tabori. The film maintains tension from start to finish. At first we did not know if Diana and other passengers could leave Hungary because the Communist Major discovered that Dianain's friend, Paul Kedes, was Hungarian and that he was not allowed to leave the country. Major falls in love with Diana, and that is the real reason he doesn't want to let her go. After she hugs her and gives her one of the most memorable kisses she has ever seen on the screen, and she also kisses him, she lets her go. And the end of the film is one of the most dramatic endings ever made - Major and Diana say "Goodbye!" Yul Brynner is very, very handsome and Deborah Kerr is very beautiful, charming, refined, just like an English lady. Yul and Debora are perfect together. They are one of the biggest Golden Hollywood pairs. This movie should be watched by a real viewer. "The Journey" has everything you should have a good movie - great, captivating story, interesting characters, amazing direction (in my opinion, Anatole Litvak is at best). Finally, I want to give a message to Warner Bros. Studios or those who renew and release classic movies: Please release "The Journey" on DVD as soon as possible.
