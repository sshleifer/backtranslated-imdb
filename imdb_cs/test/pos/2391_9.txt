I found the movie very interesting. I really liked the movie, the actors were great. It was fun. Benny's uncle was wonderful. The end turned beautifully. I would recommend you see it. Eddie Mores, a girlfriend, reminded me of a little dog who was sharp as a nail. I also love the girls who played in the movie, it was very convincing. Benny reminded me of a friend who lives in Brooklyn. I loved the scene where he tasted the sauce in the pot because that's how most people cook lol. I actually watched the movie 2 times and learned the second time.
