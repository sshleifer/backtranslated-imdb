"The Long Kiss Goodnight" is a nice and very cool action thriller and a breakthrough career for Geena Davis. The storyline is very well known as The Bourne Identity, but so what. Combat scenes are a real eye-catcher and the plotline is strong enough to keep you running for 2 hours. Focused on a neat style and avoiding most action clich√©s. Geena Davis is great as an action cat and passes her usual role as a "good wife". Samuel L. Jackson is a good player, as usual. The movie is bad is too handy and you can tell what happens to it. It breaks away from ordinary action members like Commando and On Deadly Ground, and is clearly one of the best action players in the years. Good fun and good popcorn fun. 7.4 / 10.
