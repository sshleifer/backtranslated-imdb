A charming movie enriched with musical and vocal background, especially during the competition. My understanding is that there has never been a soundtrack, but you could advise me through my sources where I could get information about the singer and the likelihood of getting a copy of the song he sang. Your help would be appreciated. The song really touched me and my wife and we would like to make a copy wherever possible so we can play as background music when we have our family and friends for our "Italian nights". If we can get this information, we would be eternally grateful. Even if you can contact the studio to go directly. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, <br /> <br /> John Payling
