I don't think this cartoon was as bad as some think. Of course, I was only five at the time it came out. But at the time I thought it was very funny and I would give it to him today if he got the opportunity. Batman and Robin were expressed by Adam West and Burt Ward was a pleasant touch and gave me a sense of intimacy as I also watched the re-run of live action performance "Batman" at this age. This cartoon also introduced some new twists that I forgot, such as "Bat-Mite". When I looked at it, I'm sure it's as uncomfortable as many think, but it didn't bother me much at the time. The best I can remember his voice was a cross between Dumb Donald and Orc. Gee, I wonder why? :) Anyway, see if you can and think of your own mind. You may be surprised.
