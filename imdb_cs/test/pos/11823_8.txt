This is one of the most moving movies I've ever watched. No movie did me like that. It's a great movie and you have to convince yourself. I'm normally impregnable with these sob story movies, but this one for me. At the end I had tears. You will long for a friendship that is portrayed in this film. If I could give this movie a billion stars, I could.
