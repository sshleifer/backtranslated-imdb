Ernst Lubitsch gave us wonderful movies like Design for Living, Ninotchka, The Shop by the Corner, Be or Not to Be and other wonderful movies. But people usually gave Bluebeard's eighth wife as one of Lubitsch's weakest films. However, I consider this film to be an important film. This film began with the collaboration of Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder. Charles Brackett, Billy Wilder and Walter Reisch wrote the script for Ninotchko Ernst Lubitsch. Of course, Lubitsch worked with writers in the scripting process. Then, Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder worked together. Together they wrote a script for famous films like The Lost Weekend and Sunset Blvd. There are plenty of funny moments in the movie. I thought "The Taming of the Shrew" was very funny. There is a famous term called "Movies Are Sliced ​​Of Life." And here's a great example of Bluebeard's eighth wife (1938). At the first session of the scripting process, Lubitsch asked this question: how does a boy and a girl meet? Billy Wilder immediately suggested that the opening scene should be a department store. "The boy is trying to buy pajamas," he said extensively. "But he's just sleeping on tops. He's gentle, so he insists he only buy tops. The clerk says he has to buy his pants too. It looks like a disaster. only in pants. "Ernst Lubitsch and Charles Brackett were enchanted. Only a few months later they found out that Billy Wilder was sleeping alone and that he had been treating for months this month and waited for him to use it. <br /> <br /> I received this information from the book. I think this film can be considered the return of Ernst Lubitsch. Immediately after this film, he made amazing movies like Ninotchka, The Shop on the Corner, and Be or Not To Be. I thought Gary Cooper's performance was good. I think Lubitsch cast Gary Cooper probably because Gary Cooper played Long Fellow Deeds, who inherited the luck in Mr. Deeds Frank Capry in the city. But that's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the film very much. This movie rated 9 out of 10. Lubitsch movies are different because his films are slices of life.
