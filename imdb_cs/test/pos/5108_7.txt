Thirty years after the classic movie in 1939, Robert Donat and Oscar won and made Greer Garson a star, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" overcame a number of issues before stumbling across the screen in this musical version. The original stars Rex Harrison and Samantha Eggar were replaced by Richard Burton and Lee Remick, who again won the winner - fortunately - Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. Andre Previn's score was rejected and he eventually was folded - unfortunately - Leslie Bricuss. The first director Herbert Ross was given the monumental task of transforming a simple love story - a man for his wife and students - into large-budget extravagance. Being successful, as well as doing it over many obstacles in his path, is a testament to his two stars. Arthur Chipping is a Latin teacher in Brookfield, a boy school in the suburbs of England where he was educated himself. Introverted and socially inept, she is dedicated to her students, but she cannot inspire them. Before the summer holidays, a former student would take him to the London Music Hall to see the fun with Katharine Bridges. The meeting after the show is uncomfortable for all and the chips - as is well known - will set off to explore some of Italy's ancient ruins. She runs unexpectedly to Katharine, who has booked a Mediterranean cruise to grieve for her unsuccessful love affair and think about her career direction. When he spends together, he discovers a gentle and gentle person under the confused exterior, and after returning to London he is seriously watching him. When the autumn term begins, Chips returns to Brookfield with his young bride, and the two settle into the life of a peaceful home. Complications arise when aspects of Katharine's past surface are, and again, when World War II breaks into their lives, but Chips is backed by the support of his wife, and his new confidence makes him favorite among students. In addition to several musical splits - the beautiful production number of "London is London" and Katharine's Declaration of Love, "You and I" - most of the songs from Bricuss, some of them performed in the voice because the characters they have examined their emotions, are easily forgotten and do not increase the film. Eliminating the score completely, and "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" works pretty well as a drama. Terrence Rattigan's scenario retains the elements of the original while extending and updating it over several decades. He created several scenes between Chips and Katharine that beautifully define their devotion to each other, and infused a couple with a comic relief of courtesy Katharine's friend and cohorts, over-the-top actress Ursula Mossbank (wonderfully played by Sian Phillips, O'Toole is in there real wife). He also captures life at a British public school - the equivalent of a private academy here in the states - with infallible perfection. Ross does well as a first-time director, liberally sprinkling a movie with breathtaking moments photographed - a sequence of introductory credits, during which the school anthem echoes in the vast stone corridors of the school, perfectly adjusts the tone of the film. Costumes and sets are a faithful period. Students, portrayed by non-professionals who were enrolled in a school used as Brookfield, handle their various small supporting roles well. The highest praise is reserved for Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark in the lead roles. O'Toole has been a longtime dramatic actor, so his Oscar nomination is no surprise. Clark, a veteran of two dozen B-films in the UK and "Finian's Rainbow" of last year, is absolutely bright as a soubrette of a music hall that leaves a theatrical career for life as a teacher's wife. Her golden voice enriches her songs and almost allows us to overlook the most unpleasant of all, and more than O'Toole does in their dramatic scenes. The chemistry between them is palpable and leaves us no doubt that it is a couple in love. This version of "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is not a classic as its predecessor, but hardly a disaster that many critics have described when it was released. Ignore the score, focus on the show and enjoy the atmosphere Ross put on the screen. It's a nice way to spend a rainy afternoon with someone you love.
