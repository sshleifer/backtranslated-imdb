Surprised to know that the director (Sebastian Gutierrez) was a young Venezuelan (28) and bored with so many predictable films, I was pleased with the screenplay that shows so many small stories and allusions. With black humor and taste, I loved the tension between Boggart Rickman himself and the very natural but beautiful Thompson. Every gang member deserves attention, Gil Bellows in his best field. Gugino is remarkable.
