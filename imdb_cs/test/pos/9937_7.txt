The opera (American title is in opera horror) is somewhat disappointed after some other Dario films such as Phenomena, Tenebre and Suspiria. (I still can't find Inferno anywhere.) It's one of those movies that have a great first half, but in the middle of it it's like someone has been slowly dropping air from the script and logic. The basic plot includes a beautiful opera singer who is haunted by a mocking obsessive fan. this killer starts killing the people closest to her. he ties her and gags her and, under the eyelids, taps a tiny sharp pin, so when he tries to close his eyes, he pulls his eyes out. this forces her to watch while the killer murders her friends in the typically brutal and cruel mode of Argento. unfortunately, probably in the middle of the movie it becomes slow and illogical. (This is especially focused on the motivation of the killer. I still didn't fully understand why he is such a matrix.) The end comes mainly from the left field in the worst possible sense. But for the first hour or this, these are some of Dario's best movies and working with the camera is breathtaking. too bad it couldn't keep to the end. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7
