"Showtime" is a humorous movie starring funnymen Robert DeNiro (Meet Parents, Bronx Story) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is as follows: At the beginning of the movie Detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective going to the tv store trying to destroy some criminals. When the cops arrive, the Tray (Eddie Murphy) cop tries to arrest Mitch without knowing he's a cop. During this scene, there are lots of funny things that will catch the attention of producer Chase Ritz. She is so excited about their adventure together, she decides to make a TV show called "Showtime" to play Tray (Mick) and Mitch (Detective). But that's just a funny part. The rest is tight tension and action. There is an alien who sells and produces extremely dangerous weapons. While playing LAPD on the show and doing it in real life, DeNiro and Murphy have quite an adventure in this story. On a scale of 1-10, I give it seven or 8.
