It was good to see John Denver again, though he went through a few years ago. I found that this film is a very gratifying and great movie to sit by the fire in the cold winters, remembering what Christmas is about. The scenes from Georgetown, Colorado were wonderful and you wanted to move right there. As I sit here in my own mountain to see in So California I loved the story and plot. I hope everyone who sees this somewhat older film is enjoying it just like my mother and me. Merry Christmas! Great movie for the whole family. Hear and tell others about it. Thank you for the memories. We need to have more movies like this from Hollywood.
