A generous soldier kills a man for being Jewish and tries to pin him on a soldier colleague. Not as good as the novel he was based on ("The Brick Foxhole") in which he was a homosexual who was killed ... but Hollywood didn't touch it in 1947. That means it's still a very good movie. Anti-Semitism is being treated very well, but the viewers have been told that bigotry is bad. But this was in 1947. The whole photograph (especially Robert Young and Robert Ryan) was good and the tone was very dark ... how it should be. Very atmospheric. Well deserved big hit in his day ... worth seeing.
