High School. Some years and decades later, some look at them with kindness, others with embarrassment. Few forget it, however. It is one of the most critical phases of our lives when changes come quickly and furiously, whether we are ready or not. No more children, even adults, irresistible forces bring us, push us and pull us in all directions. "Fame" has tried to capture this turbulent, chaotic time of its cast of young characters. Usually it did. She passed, but felt like a bit of life. This film has a special place in the hearts of '80. We have just said goodbye to the decade and soon to the end of three or four stimulating and sometimes difficult school years. We went to the cold, cruel world and left home for college, then the unknown. When we approached our basin, this newly released film was like a two-hour yearbook for us. We can't escape the titular song on the radio. We were on the screen. They were our friends, rivals and classmates because we faced our own dreams, frustrations, achievements and failed situations. It is particularly favorable for those who have attended one of the other elite high schools in New York. , especially Stuyvesant, Bronx HS of Science or Brooklyn Tech. Like children, we were considered the best of the best. We had no auditions but instead a rigorous entrance exam. Perhaps even more than the Performing Arts children, we expected to change the world, though not necessarily famous. Like them, not everyone. The pressure cooker environment, however, was supported by extraordinary camaraderie and esprit de corps, not unlike the "Hot Lunch Jam" in a coffee shop. In our own promotional day, our spirits rose almost like a jubilant crescendo in the finale of the finale. The film leaves us on one triumphant record at the end of "I Sing the Body Electric", which shows a brilliantly clear, boundless future and all the promise it made. <br /> <br /> "Glory" couldn't be anywhere else. This story would never work at a small or suburban school. Los Angeles has a stronger identification with movies and television, but NYC is a mecca for all arts. Home not only for what was then called PA, but also the world-famous Juilliard, NYC is a cultural center that has no other city in the world. It is also the time capsule of the rest of the city that shows how New York is still struggling with a fiscal crisis that has almost destroyed it. But above all it showed viability because of the muffled raids by Giuliani, Disney and tourism. What I wouldn't give to the young. But with "Glory" I remember at least what it was like.
