What is a memory journey? <br /> <br /> Don't look for great acting, trustworthy plot lines, or something like a quality movie. <br /> <br /> This is pure blaxploitation at its best. Huge clothes, unrepeatable dialogue, the objectification of women and the weakest cops you can imagine. This futile piece of "The Godfather Rap," Rudy Ray Moore, who left us last week, is the standard by which all blaxploitation is measured. Not only do you see blaxploitation at your best, but also look at his genius comedy, and see why his records were kept under the counter.
