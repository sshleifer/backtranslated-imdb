I was looking at a longer version and couldn't take my eyes off the screen. 219 minutes passed, yet only an hour seemed to have passed. The characters were very credible and fun, and the photo was excellent. The story pulled me in and caught me. I'll definitely watch it over and over again. This real story tells the best ... not just plain Hollywood cheap cheap excitement and deep flashes of skin. I've seen quite a lot of reviews on this movie. Most of the movies seem to be in the movie or praise it. Basically, it's a great movie that has received unfairly sharp reviews. watch it with an open mind. if you like western, historical period pieces, though historically inaccurate, you will enjoy the movie. Splendid!!! 10/10
