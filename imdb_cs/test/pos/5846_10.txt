Okay, so I read most of the reviews of this movie, as well as the comments left by the visitors to this site, and the feeling that it seems to me that most people who wrote reviews didn't like this movie very much. That's why I write now - I represent a minority because I did. I confess, I went to see the film because I am very impressed by Ryan Gosling's convincing abilities and the projects that have been recently included were nothing less than incredible. He's an amazing actor. I wanted to see this movie aside because it seemed interesting to me ... why? Because it's a whodunit where you know "whodunit" from the beginning, and that's kind of unusual. As it happens, two teenage boys try to commit a "perfect crime" because they believe in a twisted philosophy that only by committing crimes are human beings truly free - uninhibited, and remember, guiltless acting out of the will of the individual. The relationship between Richard and Justin was complicated, suggesting homosexuality, and was brilliantly acted by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. Gosling was a manipulating, controlling, smooth speaker, and Pitt was an extremely clever, socially unpleasant outcast. Enter the character of Sandra Bullock, which most people don't appreciate. I think that when people see he's an executive producer, they automatically take on any role an actor has in that it's a self-celebrating thing. I didn't see it that way. Without "Cassie" personal history about a former husband who almost killed her, who, surprisingly, did not share similar features with Richard Hayward, would never follow her instincts about Justin and Richard. The case was apparently airtight against Ray, an unsuspecting schoolboy and a boy friend. Even though the boys are being questioned at the end of the film, neither Bullock nor her partner has much in-depth evidence of them than lying about knowing each other and vomiting Justin at the sight. The genius of the film lay in it, because the philosophy that the boys tried to prove through the act of killing, without guilt without "true freedom," ended work against Justin, who eventually ended up with conscience (and ended up leaving part of his conscience in place of the dump). Without this key evidence, they had almost "murder by number". And to readers who were worried over my head, I looked at it and found that something that was going through "numbers" (such as painting) suggests careful and critical planning and challenging. There is also a Sting song called "Murder By Numbers", but it is next to the point. Many readers questioned the need for a relationship between Cassie and her partner, but I think it really should have shown how cynical and manipulative it has been because of its history. She liked it or not, her history plays an important role in this film, because without her she would probably never touch her instincts about Justin and Richard. Yes, it was a bit of a clich√© that the women despised, a woman who in every aspect of her life told a vendetta, but I think that without the depth of Cassie's character you only have another movie about teenage killers. with him. There's no movie. And to the reader who remarked that teenagers apparently did not commit a perfect crime, because the police were from the beginning, I can remind you that the reason was that purposeful and fully traceable prints of shoes. The boys wanted to get involved - it was a game. They were so convinced that they had committed a perfect crime they wanted to see firsthand as investigators would have to discover what they thought was true. They didn't expect Cassie Mayweather to have too active an instinct on her side. A little incredible? Maybe. But many crimes were resolved by the police who followed their instincts. However, this is a movie! I've seen this movie in theaters about three times, and every time it turned out, a little more for me, and I liked it a little more. The more I watched it, the more I was charmed and frightened by the psychological depth of Richard Hayward - they are the people who really like it. My main complaint about the film would be that they should have Justin and Richard's interactions a little more central (because, let's admit it, we put the intrigues into the whole movie) and my main props go into characterization - each character was very different and interesting way. It was very well acted, though I would have given Ben Chaplin a character a little more in depth to work with (he is a good actor), and maybe missed Bullock's character smidgen. I think everyone should keep in mind that for Hitchcock type thriller like this basically say "whodunit" in the beginning, it presents a very big challenge for writers to keep the audience's attention to the very end. I think they did it quite well by using a few small plots around the world, a slow revelation of the dynamics of different characters, and lighting up the screen with some really emotionally charged performances by young actors Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. I think that if we remove innate cynicism and try to figure out how psychologically complex the characters and their interactions are, we can be able to look beyond any apparent plot and see the true structure and quality of that film if it is only characters that have been brilliantly depiction. Especially Richard Hayward. Not that I was biased. :)
