I saw it at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2008. There are some wonderful descriptions of this movie from other commentators here and it seemed to be really enjoyed so I won't be too far away to film synopsis, but you can see a little Woody Allen and maybe a little Federico Fellini in this movie collection of about 50 short sketches or vignette strung along with no real singular chart. Several vignettes are correlated in their character and plot lines, and the corner strip is often used as a central scene, where they always give the last call. The starting and ending scenes also have a common theme that the film concludes. It took three years for it to be filmed, and a lot of time had to be spent on finding the brightest and most charming looking people in all of Sweden to occupy. This is Sweden's official submission for Best Foreign Language Film for the 2007 Academy Awards. It's a nice movie, but it hardly deserves to be officially filmed for the best foreign film. Last year, Farväl Falkenberg was very weak by the official submission of Sweden, and a year before that, he was expensive, but boring, ZoZo, so Sweden would not have a chance to pick up an Oscar. This film has its moments and would make a good short film 20-25 minutes, but for the feature film it is a bit old and cool. Roy Andersson manages. Gustav Danielsson is a cameraman. Anna Märta Waern deserves a lot of appreciation for the work she has to do. Benny Andersson of ABBA Fame provides a fun musical score. It's an interesting movie with lots of dry humor and I liked it, but it's nothing special and it could be just 7.0 out of 10.
