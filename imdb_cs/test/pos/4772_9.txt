SPOILERS <br /> <br /> As you may know, I have been commenting on a lot of silent short films in recent months. Now I have no idea why commenting on Steamboat Willie, I think I desperately wanted to comment on something, so I watched it and now I comment. This, or of course, is one of the first cartoons and I believe it is not the first cartoon with sound. <br /> <br /> Here's a graph. Mickey Mouse drives a steamer when Pete throws him away and drives him. When she stops behind the load, Minnie Mouse tried to get on, but failed. Mickey picks her up with a crane. Then her goat dreams of her sheet of paper with turkey in the straw. They use a goat to make a song. When I say I mean a goat like Victrola. Mickey plays animals on a steamer for song tools. Then the angry Pete throws Mickey into the potato room and Mickey is forced to peel the potatoes for the rest of the day. Overall, this is another breakthrough silent short film. This is the third cartoon of Mickey Mouse. Yes, third. It is also not the first sound cartoon. I believe there were still two of them before. Either way, this film is really groundbreaking. Mikcey was also more violent than he was. I mean, he's throwing a potato on a bird and maybe he's brutally killed. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> Featured Films: Crazy Airplane.
