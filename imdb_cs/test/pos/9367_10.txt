The actual 1947 Best Picture also deals with anti-Semitism and is superior to GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT by Elia Kazan (eventual winner of this year's Academy Awards) in virtually every department. The almost perfect direction of Edmard Dmytryk, the stunning screenplay of John Paxton and the expert in expressionist lighting J. Roy Hunt, are superbly complemented by the excellent cast of the ensemble. Although Robert Young (playing an easy, methodical and very sympathetic cop) and Robert Mitchum (who have an occasional occasional funny note) are the stars of the film, Oscar Robert Ryan and Gloria Grahame are nominating him - just like Paul Kelly, in a small but key the role of Grahame's pathetic husband - which gives the film the most memorable characterization; Ryan proved to be as convincing as a murderous racist who was finally cast for a while, excelled in equally malevolent roles in movies such as ACT Violence (1948), CAUGHT (1948), RACKET (1951), CLASH BY NIGHT (1952). , NAKED SPUR (1953) and BAD DAY ON BLACK ROCK (1955). The film is also notable for its atypical structure in that Ryan's "flash" sequence, a complete fabrication, is shot in a straightforward manner, while real truth emerges from the hazy, distorted memories of the real protagonist of the film who, further, isn \ t stars! Also CROSSFIRE originally treated homosexuality (according to Richard Brooks' original novel, "The Brick Foxhole"), but this taboo theme was unacceptable to the Hays Office at that time - far from the situation we have today (at least 3 homosexuals are running for this year's main The Oscars! <br /> <br /> The DVD-printing used by Warners shows some regrettable signs of occasional wear and tear, but the sound of the noir experts, James Ursini and Alain Silver, is good, though I do not share their opinion that Dmytryk's career has been steadily declining after the HUAC problems, such as the excellent films such as SNIPER (1952), CASTLE MUTINY (1954), BROKEN LANCE (1954), YOUNG LION (1958), WARLOCK (1959) and MIRAGE (1965); his collaboration in RKO with producer Adrian Scott and screenwriter John Paxton - MURDER, MY SWEET (1944), CORNERED (1945, hopefully this will be part of the next fi Film Noir Box Set by Warners) and CROSSFIRE - these are his best works. In any case, in my opinion, this is not just one of the key films of the 1940s, but also one of the most beautiful noirs in history.
