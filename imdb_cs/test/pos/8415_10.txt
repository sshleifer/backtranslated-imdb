Hadnt heard a lot about this movie, except it was National Award and Oscar. It's a Marathi movie, I can't tell an apple from an orange in a marathi. But when I saw a movie that plays on DD1 on Sunday night, I just got stuck. Now I'm not a judge of film techniques and acting skills. But I watched a good number of movies, different genres and I highly recommend this movie to the average viewer. The feeling is very earthy and realistic, although there are some melodramatic moments. See how one feels. Recently, he has seen no film that touches the heart, especially in Hindu film. crowning the success of a movie is when a young guy returns home. The camera moves to expose the baby, wearing black glasses, lost her eyes, the baby hears the other children splash into the water and start clapping. I was impressed. And the two hours I spent watching the movie - it's worth it :-)
