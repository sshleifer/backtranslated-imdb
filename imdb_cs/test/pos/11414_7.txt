I don't follow many "horror" movies, but one night I sat down and watched it with my cousins. Now we are teenagers, so we tend to do a lot of things, but frankly, acting really wasn't very good, especially at the beginning. One line that stood out was when Scarlett says Jill and Tiffany: "That's so ... high school!" While The Next Scene Shows Jill To Walk Around The Sign With Their High School Name On It ... Many parts in the beginning reminded me of a corny, poorly-written, poorly-played Lizzie McGuire episode. However, as the story progressed, and the cast moved to almost just Jill most of the time, I was able to appreciate the film more. Camilla Belle did really well in this movie and I think other actors and actresses have destroyed her. And I have to admit it was one of the most scary movies I've ever seen. Well, no, there weren't big monsters and white faces appearing in dark corners and obsessed with dolls, but the thing that made this movie more frightening than those that include these things is that it really could have happened. And this movie really reminded me of what's really scary ... We all know that we aren't likely to stumble on the living dead at any time in our lives, but the idea of ​​having a killer inside the house where you were babysitting. really happened. The only mistake of this movie is that it's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. He has all that any horror movie ever had - turning the keys and starting the car, shadows in the corner, turning the corners of the stairs with tension, turning and seeing the dead body, ending with a deadly scene with vigil on the dream, very predictable, but overall I would give him 7/10. Certainly worth seeing. By the way, this is my first review, so I don't know if any of these things were spoilers.
