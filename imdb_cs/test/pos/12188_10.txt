"The Queen of the Damned" is one of the best movies I've ever seen! The film had tension, action and gore. The combination of the queer and the star's rocky mood, a well-functioning Stuart Townsend, makes a stunningly finished movie that only this combination can create. I am always the one who advises my friends and family members on which films are worth renting, and when they ask me if the "Queen of the Damned" is worthy, I tell them that he is worthy of buying. This movie is surely a must-have in all horror movie lovers' homes!
