This is one of the best early "Star Trek" episodes, with Kirk and his crew embarking on the unknown to make a battle with the enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they find that the feared Romulans are racial offshoots of the Volcanoes! Young Mr. Stiles, a well-played Paul Comi, is one of the few really unlikable characters in the "Star Trek" universe. His barely disguised hatred for Mr. Spock is miraculously similar to hatred and suspicion after 9/11, when many Americans have people of Arabic or Middle Eastern origin. The atmosphere of war paranoia is too real. Then there are the Romulans: they are the ultimate nemesis of the federation. The Klingons are ugly, but basically harmless; more than harassment. But Romulans mean trade: they are the ancient Romans rebirth in space age; Despite their Vulcanoid qualities, they clearly remind us of Imperial Rome, with names like Decius and titles like "centurion" and "praetor". Chain mail armor is really cool. The well-known guest star Mark Lenard, who continued to play Spock's father Sorek, as well as the Klingon commander in "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" is suitably grizzled, a war-tired commander, a character who bears remarkable resemblance to Crassus Laurence Olivier in "Spartacus". Also, his interrogations about the unquenchable thirst of the Empire after the conquest recall similar doubts that Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) expressed at the beginning of the "Gladiator." It has to be for both Trekkies and epic sword and sandal fans.
