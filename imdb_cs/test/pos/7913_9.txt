I honestly can't believe this movie isn't rated more. Claude Chabrol can be described as something like French Alfred Hitchcock, and while this movie is just the second of his what I saw (the first is Le Boucher), I already see that this person is something special just about these two movies. The film is a French and Canadian co-production and is held in Canada. The cast is made up of British and Canadian stars and high-quality performances well reflect the rest of the film; most of them are also of high quality. The film is a mystery of murder and begins when a young girl covered with blood is brought to a police station. After the investigator Carella challenged him, it seems that the young girl Patricia and her sister Muriel were attacked by a man who killed his sister and only allowed Patricia to flee. However, as the investigation continues, Patricia goes back to the station to give new evidence that reveals a much shocking identity to the killer. Performance in this film is excellent. As usual, Donald Sutherland is subdued, but he suits the role he gives here very well and I wouldn't hesitate to name his performance in Blood Relatives as one of his best. The film also features turn support from British stars Donald Pleasance and David Hemmings who both give a good turn; Especially gratifying, who shows how great an actor can be, and points out what a pity that he himself has wasted in Halloween movies. Unknown Aude Landry also gives great performance in her role as Patricia. The film is very mysterious for the first hour and really keeps the audience hooked. When Inspector Carella reveals Muriel's diary, the film turns into a more drama that shows the girl's most recent actions; And while this part of the movie is not as good as what went before it, it's still interesting and leads to a big twist at the end! Overall, Blood Relatives is a great movie that deserves to be better seen. Le Boucher is a better-known effort from Chabrol, but at least it's so good for my money! Very recommended viewing.
