I saw this movie when it came out. I thought it was an average movie. Now I realized that this director was ahead of his time. This is a great movie and a great soundtrack. I saw my share in rock movies, but even though it's not far from the backbone tap (which I didn't like)> This film takes us to the life of rockers of the 80s who want to be nothing else. It's nothing more than our inner child who wants to grow up and be * ROCK STAR * Yeah, I said it. Everyone wants to grow up and be in place (Weather said or not). This movie just gets you into the core of emotion and you can almost feel the excitement of Izzy. I have to admit that playing was less par, but the music and story was enough to get you into it until the credits came back. It is worth watching, especially if you are a fan of ye Ole mighty hair band.
