In this approximately 34-second Thomas Edison short series, we see Annabelle Moore performing in "Serpentine Dance" in two different fantastic, plush robes. Moore was one of the greatest stars of the late Victorian era. She was featured in a number of Edison Company shorts, including this one, which was among the first Kinetoscope films shown in London in 1894. Loie Fuller actually patented a Serpentine dance that Moore plays here in Robes (as well as entire frames) ), which are often hand-tinted in the film, represent one of the most common symbolic devices of the silent era. Probably, Moore movies were popular enough to be often reworked (including refilming). The version available now may be a newer version / remake. Moore became more popular when it was said that she would look nude at a private party in a restaurant in New York. She later went on to star as "Gibson Bathing Girl" in Ziegfeld Follies in 1907. She appeared there until 1912. <br /> <br /> Short is notable for his motion framing, which, especially during "the other half," becomes almost abstract. It somewhat resembles Morris Louis Painting, although this is nearly 60 years before Louis's relevant work. You should be able to find this short on DVD on a number of different early film anthologies.
