I wasn't sure how to get this movie on DVD because I really have something against people who make black and white movies in the 21st century, but I still bought it. I still don't understand why it must have been black and white, but that's the only negativity I see about the film, and it's definitely the perfect example to see the definitive rise of Brazilian cinematography. Not everyone can understand a movie like this, but it's quite a reward for those who do it. Unlike O Homem Que Copiava, this surrealism is well suited to this film, and acting is at least as good as that, or other successful Brazilian films like Bicho de sete cabe√ßas, Cidade De Deus, Brava Gente Brasileira, etc. that this gem is not offended and raped by a silly remake of Hollywood. It's amazing to see how these guys spend billions of dollars and still can't make a movie that is 1% as good as this low budget movie. Bravo to the whole crew! 10/10
