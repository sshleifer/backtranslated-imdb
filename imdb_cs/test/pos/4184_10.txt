I can't understand why people are surprised that this film doesn't make sense. It should never make sense. (Duh! The writers were totally useless at Frodis at the time.) It was supposed to be fun and ridicule, both amazingly. Monkees are good actors. They wouldn't be hired if they weren't good actors. Mike has something for the corpse and the dark, Micky is the best in total psychotic comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran and Peter actually has people who believed he was so stupid in real life. Don't tell me they can't act because they can. <br /> <br /> They can also write. Sure, Jack & Bob gets a single credit, but he actually got a big hand on that Monkees script that was also in this smoke room. <br /> <br /> (it's totally impossible to spoil this movie) The head is very symbolic. Among the more remarkable elements is a black box, which was actually based on 2 things: the Monkee image to which the boys were bound, and the real black box on the Gems screen where the band was held together. There is so much more symbolism in the movie that I'm just gonna watch you and figure it out. <br /> <br /> Music is amazing. "Circle Sky" is one of Papa Nez's best tunes and "Porpoise Song" & "As We Go Along" will inspire you. If you'd rather be excluded, then "Ditty Diego", "Can You Dig It?" And "Long Title" should be satisfactory, great songs that are. And then there's "Daddy's Song", undoubtedly a tribute to Davy's Broadway days, and editing / coloring for this sequence is excellent. (At least for '68.) <br /> <br /> Oh, for those of you who won't watch a 'PG' movie, you're missing. Especially since Head was originally rated R in 1968. The rating was reduced twenty years later! <br /> <br /> Where was I? Yes, yes: "We talked about faith. Faith and conditioning."
