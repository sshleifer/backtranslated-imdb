"If I die, someone will bury me. And if not, what is the difference. Who gives damn what?" Thus, the philosophy of life (or lack of it) is summed up once and for all in this less than classic, yet entertaining spin, "Sergei Leon". In the opening scene, three apparently evil militants go to the western city, intimidatingly staring at all the miserable normal people who are hiding in their homes. The observer observes that each of these three bears a remarkable resemblance to the Leone's For More Alarms. In Eastwood's poncho there is one boy, one in a black suit, Lee Van Cleef, and one looks like Indio Gian Marie Volonte. But this movie is not about these guys. First, they get to the city when someone is colder than them, a mysterious rent-hunter who is simply known as Stranger. <br /> <br /> No. This is a completely different story. <br /> <br /> In the obvious copying of Leone the Good, the Bad and the Ugly, three shooters are again competing for a hidden treasure. Again there is a hunter hiring and a Mexican bandit. The Stranger (George Hilton) is a super-round bounty hunter with a penchant for shooting as a priest. He is a reward for the bandit Monetero (Gilbert Roland). But when the Monetero gang steals three hundred thousand gold coins, Stranger gets turned away from his normal line of work. <br /> <br /> To Round the Trio's Edd Byrne is a corrupt bank executive, Clayton. He also wants money for himself. But after the money is hidden, the only person who knows where to get is shot. The only guideline for the shelter is a medallion that shows the family crest. The game is also to find treasure than anyone else. And every weapon can play. With plenty of gunfights, fist fights and double crosses, the action takes these three up to the final ripoff showdown, three way draw for the hidden treasure of The Good, Bad, and Ugly - but with a twist. This movie isn't as good as Leone's movies, of course, but in the end, who the hell is it, huh? This film is fun - the 60th nihilism, the western style of spaghetti. There are no rules, no lasting loyalty and no right or wrong - just treasure and whatever is needed to make it possible. And although the film is not classic, the end is definitely. Hey, maybe we could all get one hundred thousand pieces after all. <br /> <br /> If you like spaghetti westerns, check out this. It's fast, furious and worth a look.
