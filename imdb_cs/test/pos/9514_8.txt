Last year, in a Japanese magazine, I captured the JAPAN SINKS ad and wondered what the hell was until I saw the movie trailer. Then I remembered seeing the English translation of Sakyo Komatsu a few years back. I got it and it was pretty good as well as freezingly realistic. It's enough to make the reader horrible to hear any news of an earthquake in Japan. Now I read the book, and saw this version of the movie 2006 (the first movie came out in 1973). And you know what? I thought the movie was pretty good, though there were big changes from novel to movie (but that is understandable). The story is simple - the main tectonic shift will cause Japan to fall over the year. Massive earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis rock lands as frantic efforts to evacuate as many people as possible. One scientist has a plan that could stop the sinking of the earth and save what is left of the land, but can be implemented in time? I saw JAPAN SINKS in Otakon 2007, and when I had a few problems with him - it runs a little too long and a few character moments were a little too pathetic - I was still blown away. The pure concept of the whole nation, immersed in the sea, was frighteningly real and its effects were some of the best I've ever seen, competing with anything Hollywood did. The film also does not play any favorites with the main characters, with some not making it to final credits. Frankly, I was surprised by some negative comments about this movie. I think the difference of opinion. I personally enjoyed it. I read the original book.
