This groundbreaking film is truly a work of art. I went to a screening at a conference in Indiana with very low expectations, when I saw 2 more "player" movies in the headline (both were so bad that I chose one of my own eyes with my straw by the end of the second and the twisted paper clip I found between the seats, but Dorkness made the introductory titles. they face every day, face fantastic dramas in the Lodge setting down.After the first scene (set in the world of fantasy they inhabit) they are forcibly returned to a world that is so desperately trying to escape. that I was moved to tears, Rice's actress is so amazing that I'm in the first 20 Indeed, in the minutes of the film she truly believed she was indeed a 22-year-old man suffering from frustration, male baldness, and an annoying group of "friends" who couldn't understand the terms like right and wrong. Friends cabins have a note here: Leo, the oldest and hardest of the trios, seems to be the only other character to have a job out of the chat. But he seems to be attracted to Gary, the youngest group. At first glance this seems just a little strange until you realize that Gary is actually a sexually confused sociopath with very little prospects outside his "fantasy" world. This dichotomy serves, not to confuse, but to inform and raise the audience about the importance of diversity in our society. My only complaint about this is that the actors who portrayed Leo (Scott C. Brown) and Gary (Christian Doyle) seem to play characters for laughter occasionally, as if they were informed that they act in comedy instead of hard film. hitting action / drama. Speaking of action, Brian Lewis makes his film debut as Cass, the third and most influential member of the Lodge's colorful crew. The tension is always high when he is on the screen, both when he is passionately arguing about his beliefs at the Lodge or displaying his fantastic martial arts skills as "Silence" of his fantasy. Or even if he suddenly turns to face the viewer, and you reflexively tile in the audience so that you don't take his fantastic chin. Lewis Illuminates the screen no matter what it does and I hope to see more in the future. Once the action starts in this movie, it just won't end. Drama and action blend so smoothly when you can say whether you're in the middle of a frenetic action sequence or a moving dramatic moment. Really excited to ride Epic proportions, I would recommend "The Gamers: Dorkness Rising" as required by viewing for anyone who loves the movie. It was almost a loss of sight. Chip Deedlenick
