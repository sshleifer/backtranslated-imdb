This film was full of tension and was well controlled, making the black and white effect a great secret. Fay Emerson (Hilda Fenchurch), who was twice married to the famous musician Skitch Henderson and also to the son of Elliot Roosevelt, (FDR's Son), fell in love with Zachary Scott (Ronnie Mason / Marsh). Ronnie wins the hearts of all the women in the picture, even Mona Freeman (Anne Fenchurch) and proposes marriage whenever she can. Rosemary DeCamp (Dr. Jane Silla) (a famous radio and television actress in the 1930s and 1940s played mostly small town MOM'S) warned the ladies of Ronnie Mason's sick mind and the abused childhood he had when he grew up, causing his love / hate relationship with women. Fay Emerson and Zachary Scott would be bigger stars with more reward roles, but their lives were short in real life. This film is out of criticism, it's a really great 1945 classic movie for many generations to watch and enjoy!
