Kramer Vs. Kramer is an encouraging drama about the shocking, drastic expansions of two unsuccessful married couple subjects. Meryl Streep, in the throat of her maternal sensitivity, plays an unhappy mother who feels limited to such a role and leaves her inattentive husband in the fantastic performance of Dustin Hoffman during the first five minutes of the film. Find a different role for yourself. Hoffman is intrepid, has absolutely no idea what to do with himself when he is so obvious that he doesn't know the first thing to get his son to school in the morning. Hoffman without any problems characterizes this husband as such a succulent load of failures. He is restless, unrelenting and impatient, but while the positive side of these three adjectives should include the opposite, he is constantly fixed on anything that turns his head. He focused on his career in advertising, and when he himself raised his son Billy, he immediately introduces chaos. He is the one who throws irritable bouts of anger and moves angrily away. After a while, when he befriends his neighbor and Joan's ex-girlfriend, played by sexy Jane Alexander, Hoffman cools his jets enough to understand why his wife has gone. Meanwhile, his boundless energy redirects to raising Billy and losing his job. The effort for the title is a brilliantly gray circumstance. Even though the end is a bit unmotivated, subjective to the audience, the last line and the last shot still have that funny touch on the screen that seemed to shrink after the magical seventies.
