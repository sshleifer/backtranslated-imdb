"Hail The Woman" is one of the most moving movies I've ever seen in my whole life. I watched him twice and sobbed my eyes. This silent film work deserves a much wider audience; Unfortunately, the only surviving print is so badly scratched that most people won't follow it all the way and they will miss the gem shining beneath the rough. This film could use digital restoration to help reveal its beauty, but I doubt it will get it from anyone because its main theme is the spiritual restoration of Christ's family unit, and this is not politically correct today. But it remains a strong theme for those whose hearts hurt painful family relationships. The cast is spectacular, especially Florence Vidor, which literally shines like Judith, the daughter; the ethereal Madge Bellamy like Nan, a poor girl who gets pregnant and is pushed aside; Theodore Roberts as a whimsical old dominating father who destroys all around him through pride; and handsome Lloyd Hughes, as son of David, is afraid of his father, but of life itself. This is a nice movie that will watch Christmas, especially. You will not regret being patient and observing it in its entirety despite its deterioration.
