I first saw this movie two years ago in a cinema and fell in love with this dark story of two tense teenage sisters, who met their father and stepmother at home in their big country house. Their relationship with their stepmother is at least tense, with the stepmother becoming increasingly unstable in her struggles with younger girls. Although the film is oblique with oriental effects and the horror of the oriental style, which gives the story a strange and disturbing aspect that is not clear at first glance, but more interesting. The direction is incredibly good, and acting is overwhelming, with the step-mother especially incredibly good swinging from one style mood to another in the movie. The big house adds weirdness and there are enough points in the movie to jump from your seat. This film clearly shows me why Korean cinema is perhaps the most beautiful in the world. In the Western world, you will not get anything like that, and unfortunately I see that it will affect filmmakers around the world in the next decade. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it is recommended to observe real joy and fear ...
