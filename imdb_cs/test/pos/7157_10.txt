Forgiveness Franklins is the best movie I've seen in years. Acting was fantastic ... especially Mari Blackwell, who was really remarkable in the role of Peggy Lester. She brought Peggy to life with incredible skill and made her as real as my neighbor. I also enjoyed Robertson Dean as a father ... he is a true professional and has managed to pull out even the most intimate scenes with precious grace. The performance of the entire cast was very good, excellent, but Peggy's role, played by Blackwell, was a film. The film was beautifully executed and was most impressive. The only criticism I have to offer is the weakness of the ending scenes that have been too drawn, repeated, and too focused on the bad character. I would like it to end on a remark about forgivenessâ€¦ but despite this tiny mistake, it is worth watching and applauding for everyone who has been involved.
