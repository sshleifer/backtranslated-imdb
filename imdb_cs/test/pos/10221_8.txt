I experienced Nightbreed for the first time on television a year ago and I was pleasantly surprised by the results. somewhat. What is the unfortunate thing, because, like the Midian people, this film seems to be misunderstood. Barker created in this story a cross breed of genres - starting as a traditional horror movie but soon becomes a myth regarding men's inhumanity to man. Invoking the devil's sympathy is hard at the best of times, but when the characters are as visually demonic as they are in this movie, it becomes almost impossible. Practically a clan-like human rebellion (pitchfork and holy anger!) At the end of the film it becomes doubly upset in the face of what was before. As a parable of ethnic tension and white domination, this film can be quite evocative. We have a real forgotten gem and the sooner the studio and Mr. Barker make a nice time and spend some time on it - the better.
