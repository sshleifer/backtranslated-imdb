I must admit that I have approached this film with a sense of expectation and fear. Louise de Berniere's best-selling novel is one of my favorites, and anyone who has read it will realize that there is no way any adaptation to the screen can be 100% true to hell. All the while, I made sure the movie was unsuccessful, and I stripped the book to make it redundant. But the ending is much better than the one in the novel and then I couldn't stop thinking about the movie. Still, plusses (John Toll's magnificent cinematography, Stephen Warbeck is a great score, etc.) I felt not outweighing my initial negatives (Cage is a mistaken, heavily diluted script). But two days later I was in line again to see Corelli, and although it is not perfect, I must admit that the film is the best anyone could expect. Cage is truly brilliant in the de Berniere role, not fully rounded: his carefree spirit, which gives way to shattered remorse, is in place and complements the great double act of Penelope Cruz and John Hurt perfectly. David Morrissey is quietly effective as Weber, a Nazi officer who tries to balance his feelings with his newly found Italian friends and his inbred complex of superiority to those around him. And the subtle Greek-Italian supportive will bring de Berniere's enthusiastic world of Cepholonia into a great life. Leaving the cinema for the second time, I finally released my passion for the novel, which prevented me from fully appreciating the story of World War II Cepholonia in film terms. My hat goes to John Madden, who, despite the almost anticipated critical drunk he receives from British critics (every director who has had a great success like Shakespeare in love behind them, is always the target for these ninies moans!) a big-screen book with such a heart, verve and humanity (the basic virtues of the novel, in fact) that it has created another classic love story that is likely to be fully appreciated only when dust has settled in a few places <br /> <br / > If you're a fan of the book, just like me, it's hard, but try not to make the same mistake when you first browse. Try to erase the book from your mind for two hours, swim in the wonderful Mediterranean atmosphere and discover Corelli, Pelagia, Mandras, dr. Iannis, as if it were the first time (pretend to follow something from the original script) and guarantee that you will not be disappointed. In fact, you'll be eagerly awaiting your own copy of this wonderful movie on video or DVD. <br /> <br /> 8/10
