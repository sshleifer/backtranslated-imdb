I'm an opera enthusiast and opera is full of sex, blood and death. This can help to know the libretto of operas that are really appreciated from aria - my mileage is very different from Tug-3. I am a classical music lover and I liked this movie. I loved Ken Russell's "Nessun Dorma" segment and would like to see him produce Turandot because the opera is supposed to be a stunning, really multimedia experience, but then I loved Lisztomania. I love * Turandot * and knowing the libretto so well may be the reason I don't find this segment that Tug-3 should do. The Buck Henry / Rigoletto segment is probably the most accessible for the average viewer segment - they probably recognize the melodies and the classic bedroom. I like a bedroom farce, so wisdom hated me. <br /> <br /> The "Liebestod" segment is so excellent that I recommend people follow it on their own. "Depuis la Jour" was beautifully spiritual for me. And Carus' recording of "Vesti la Giubba" (aka I Pagliacci) with John Hurt as a clown was amazing. But people who want only naked women may feel too much music and bare body and sex are not enough.
