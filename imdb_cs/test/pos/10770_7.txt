Mas Oyama was the most successful karate master of the late 20th century. He rejected the "training" of karate clubs of the time focusing on intense not holding the form of training. He eventually built his system into a huge business empire with hundreds of schools around the world, without compromising his teachings. Testing in schools Kyokushin is still one of the most physically demanding tests every martial arts school requires. One non-physical hardness Oyama was struggling with was his prejudice over his Korean ancestors and spent time proving that loyalty was Japan and Japanese Karate. This series of films was part of this effort, although anyone who had a chance to meet Oyama (I) would never question his allegiance to Japan. In this series, Oyama is the most famous student, Sonny Chiba, is called to portray his master. Oyama arrives from a country where the training itself was. She questions and does the short work of established Karate schools she encounters. Oyama disgusted with the state of karate returns to his solitary training. He eventually takes a student, falls in love, and gets in the way of gangsters who are linked to established karate schools. In the middle is a legendary bullfight with a mad bull. What part of the film is true is questionable. It is true that Oyama could kill a bull with his bare hands. He was called to repeat this performance many times. There are filmed cases of Oyama actually doing this, though sometimes bulls seemed to be tethered as Oyama started in years. Sonny Chiba portrays his master with conviction and karate is pretty good. Chiba may not have been the best karate practitioner, but at this point he was certainly above average. The film as a whole is good, much better than most of the martial arts in the theater department. I've always wondered why it's not better known. Maybe it's a very realistic depiction of martial arts. Unlike 99% of the action movie, where the hero is an unlimited fountain of energy and every stroke immediately sends an opponent to death, people are tired and injured. Chiba seems so exhausted at one point that it hurts to watch. Perhaps viewers prefer not to reflect their entertainment so closely. Especially recommended for martial artists.
