I was 13 years old when I saw this very underrated movie at ADAMS in Newark, NJ, I bought the Program and later I bought the soundtrack ... I still have both .... I'm now 55+ years old. and have not seen it since (maybe once on network television, in the sixties ???) One of the biggest sets, great score and production, please let the next generation see this great movie ... It was my introduction to the opera, and helped with my understanding of Tolerance .. Please family Gerswhins or Premingers, release this classic soon !!
