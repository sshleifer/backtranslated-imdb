We went to see Mann from Heaven, my husband, two friends and I and we all enjoyed the movie. The characters are funny, the story is fun and just like real life. I think that's what I liked the most, just seeing something believable, no murders, no science fiction, just good, clean fun. It's something you could take your kids or older parents in charge. How many of them are around !!
