Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy, what a team. While Rene Russo, William Shanter, and the guy from the daily video are next to the ride. This is a funny and great movie. Not only is it so, but it's a good friend of the swing. Tom Dey (Shanghai Noon) manages this damn movie. From the beginning to the end it was a masterpiece. No humor. But the good old time laughs. Make fun of all the other cops (name a few Lethal Weapon, Beverly Hills Cop, Fifteen minutes, etc.) You'll love it. He has an amazing cast and crew. So, get off of ** from watching "COPS" and watch "Showtime" for cop movie. And remember that they will break your neighbor at um ... um! Friday night at 8:00 (one says I'm a bad writer).
