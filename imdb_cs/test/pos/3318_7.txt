The Best of Everything is a high-gloss big soap opera that follows the career of four women in career, Hope Lange, Suzy Parker, Diane Baker and Martha Hyer at New York Publishing. What is best for some women is not necessarily the best for everyone. Presiding this group of young lads is a wise old mare Joan Crawford who has been around the track several times on the screen and in real life. She looks directly at home as a lady boss as well as she should have at this point. Around the time she did her best, Joan Crawford became a widow when her fourth husband, Alfred Steele, died. It was a particularly traumatic event for her, she woke up one morning and found him dead in bed beside her. She inherited all of his stock in Pepsi Cola where he was chairman of the board and during the same period as The Best of Everything was made, she picked up the queen bee at Pepsi Cola. Life sometimes mimics art. So the authority, when it barks dictation and orders for coffee to Hope Lange rings, is real. In fact, all women except Lange are in some rough sledding. It's also tough for Lange, but it literally makes it the best. What is a collection of stinking men in this movie. The best of them, Stephen Boyd, is a heavy drinker. Other Louis Jourdan, Robert Evans, and Brett Halsey are like a slimy collection of rodents ever gathered for one movie. I can not forget Brian Aherne, who is the false pinching head of this publisher. firm. Half of that office should have sexual harassment suits go today. Some nice location shots from New York in the fifties to make a real gift movie. Catch it by all means.
