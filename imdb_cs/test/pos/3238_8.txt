I just checked out Northanger Abbey from the local library and didn't expect much. Imagine my surprise in this gothic treatment! Northanger Abbey is one of the most scary places you've ever seen, with empty corridors and decorated rooms hidden in hidden secrets. The movie's glory is that it never reveals everything: your imagination runs for free, runs with the imagination of the main character, one Kathrine M. It's a girl of wild imagination, a reader of the gothic fantasy he brings to her (and our real world. <br /> < If I used one word to describe this excellent film, it would be surrealistic, dreams woven throughout the film and mood, sometimes it's hard to say what's real and what's not, I believe it's intentional. The atmosphere is sovereign, music is not what you would expect from a Jane Austen movie: it is scary, flute and drum, tall and scary with an undercurrent of fear. it's a positive invitation, now it's a premonition, a grim and mottled madman's palace. (But! Characters! You'll have to see them for yourself!) <br /> <br /> If you're looking for the most enjoyable evening, don't look for anything else it than Northanger Abbey.
