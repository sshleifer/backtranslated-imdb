This is one of my favorite movies, if not in the car, then forget it! This movie contains 1 of the largest Aussies muscle cars, XYGTHO. Yeah, so acting isn't the biggest - he never managed to win oscar. Car Events keep you more and more. There is a great collection of muscle cars from the 1970s and an amazing Chev - with a real cool cat! Also there is a really great song sung by Terry Serio the main actor. Acting is pretty funny when it comes to light, but the main focus of this film is smokin and drag racing. Big fast cars with durable steel (NO PLASTIC CARS), and some cool street towing. I recommend it only to people who are in cars and not to someone who is looking for great acting.
