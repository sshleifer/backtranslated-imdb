Young Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are excellent in this excellent movie about two boys who promised to "take care of their mother," and how they cope when their new stepfather starts beating a younger boy. The support cast around the boys is also top. The script really gets into the mind and heart of an imaginative child. It's hard to believe that Wood could grow up to look like Tom Hanks, but it's nothing new in Hollywood. This is frankly my only critique of the film.
