Spin-off, for someone who doesn't know, isn't usually successful because most of the original characters are missing. Here they are and you couldn't ask for a better set in what is basically a stupid little cartoon, it wasn't meant to do anything but have fun. J. P. Manoux, who has replaced David Spade, admires the admirable retention of Kuzco's ego and yet does not appear to be annoying as the character of Spade (the character of Spade has done for decades and after a while gets on his nerves). She has a softer voice, but somehow fits. Eartha Kitt, who has given up her role as Yzma, is great. Since she had turned to Batwoman centuries ago, she wasn't much appreciated by her, except perhaps her ugly part in Boomerang. It's funny how much a character looks like it was. And Patrick Warburton. There is no way he could be humorous except that he was thoroughly wasted in Men in Black 2. I have been a fan of him since Seinfeld, but unlike this character, he plays a real sympathetic guy who is not sucked in nice things. The animation is really beautiful because all Disney is usually, but sometimes the character design is too sugar. Oh, good. Two out of three are not bad.
