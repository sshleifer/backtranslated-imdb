I recently came across this show when ABC Family had a full day marathon before Season 2 premiere. I remember seeing previews on the show in 2007, and I thought it was going to be a short life and not very well written because it was on ABC Family. Never doubt the ABC Family Show! This show surprised me in the best way possible. Not only is the show well written, the story lines are realistic, fun and fun. I've been expecting a lot of relationship talks, something like "this guy dating the girl who fired me for the boy ... etc." But this show is something else! Characters are attractive and you really feel the connection between them. There is a lot of chemistry between actors and they can really feel that this is happening right in front of their eyes. Don't doubt this show, it's really nice to watch. .
