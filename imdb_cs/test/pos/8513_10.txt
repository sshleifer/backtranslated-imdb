Allow me to deviate from the many comments I have read here and say that this film is one of the top five bonds, along with the On Her Majesty's secret service, from Russia with love, the killing license, and your eyes only ( Just time Roger Moore actually played the role of Bond, instead of futzing around). Of course, Sean Connery pulls the whole thing together - as a co-creator, co-producer and in his best performance from From Russia with Love. She is fit, energetic and obviously pleased. His acting is mature, self-confident and laced with the right amount of humor. This is in contrast to his mechanical performance in Thunderball, his sleepwalking through You Only Live Twice, and his hilarious, crazy frolic over that cartoon known as Diamonds are Forever! This is an imaginative reworking of Thunderball without the sets and machines stunning characters and conspiracies. This cast is also much better. Klaus Maria Brandauer brings her unique style into the role of Largo without relying on the eyepiece, SPECTER ring or boring uniform. Kim Basinger is athletic and nice, Barbara Carrera is dynamic and for one we have great Felix Leiter at Bernie Casey. Figures M and Q are original and the addition of the damping agent Small-Fawcett is fun without being in a slapstick. Director Irvin Kershner makes good use of his sites (Bahamas and French Riviera). ) without losing sight of his actor. Although close control reveals some moderate special effects and fails in continuity, Kershner holds the film moving at a good pace, unlike Thunderball (which even its director, Terence Young, does not like). Obviously, fans lack a barrel trademark and 007 music, but eventually they are owned by Eon Productions. Michel LeGrand didn't have to write the most memorable scores, but he captures the atmosphere of the places without being too disturbing. No wonder his most beautiful moments are in the south of France, and his French love song (in the spa) is particularly attractive. And tell me how much he really remembers Moonraker music? Personally, I'd rather forget about a man with a golden gun and a look at the killing! The people of Eonu can smirk on this movie if they like it. (Yes, Octopussy made more money.) At least Connery's mature 007 didn't move the jungle radiating Tarzan's scream. He did not deal with a Bengal tiger, nor did he move the "Indian" snake magicians with a tennis racket. Despite Eona's desperate efforts to stop this production, Kevin McClory and late Jack Schwartzman put together a great movie that I think Ian Fleming would appreciate. But if you'd rather see James Bond use the Dwarf to kick your shin, join another tedious fight with "jaws," jump in bed with Grace Jones, or lead a slapstick chase through San Francisco movie for you!
