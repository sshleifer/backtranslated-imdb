This must be one of the most powerful films I've seen lately, absolutely flawless, absolutely original and provocative. The story is unusual and original and the characters make this story very powerful. It's about a man who kills his former brother, who is a former girlfriend, and when he is sent to a juvenile prison, you get into the story through many memories of the memories and don't let him go to the very end. The murder he commits changes the life of every member of the family and the family of the deceased, and when you look and realize that everyone has their own story and their own dark side, you will appreciate this film even more, it's a total tour. these actions cannot be described in simple words. His motive for committing murder is incompletely explained and viewers think so. The acting was almost flawless and the cast was very good, with many familiar faces. If you like movies that are provocative and that just do u think during them (eg 'Donnie Darko', 'Mulholland Dr.') then 'United States Leland' is an excellent movie choice for you, otherwise you should go through this film and watch when you are in the mood for serious thought provoking movie. <br /> <br /> 10/10
