Main cast: <br /> <br /> Vlastimil Brodský .... František Hána Stella Zázvorková .... Emílie Hánová Stanislav Zindulka .... Eda <br /> <br /> Director Vladimír Michalka gives this charming story to the elders People's charming twists that make characters appealing, truly versatile. František Hana is retired and retired, his previous job unknown. He lives in a very nice apartment with his forty-four wife, Emilie. His son Jara covers a spacious apartment as a solution to problems because he needs to accommodate one of his former wives and several of his children. The son is not a bad schemer, just a guy with one of the past husbands too much and a blind look at the attachments that his father has for an apartment (who moved after giving up his previous son's residence). Hana and her older close friend Ed are spending more than enough free time doing small jobs, not for money, but for the pleasure of cheating on one of the people who love it , such as real estate agents. A favorite trick is for Han to act part of the retirement of the Metropolitan Opera New York to return home in need of a large mansion. Ed is his companion as a gullible estate agent falling all around, offering limousines and delicious French restaurant meals in the hope of lucrative sales. When not involved in well-planned scams, the duo engage in quick tricks such as pretending to be rail safety agents to catch brass and no-teen kisses trying to sneak into trains . Chaste kisses, that is, there is no thing. Hana is a long-standing wife obsessed with lots of money to make sure that the couple, individually and together, has a great funeral, an event of life. Loving Francis is in no hurry to experience. Disagreements over money and the promiscuous disposition of Francis' matrimonial funds lead to a crisis whose solution is both real and cute. Michalek hunts for the viewer's emotions, but does it openly, honestly and efficiently. <br /> <br /> The "Autumn Spring", of course, with the subtitle, is the result of the ever more vivid Czech cinematography. It has not been very proven in the US, but its DVD availability, hopefully, will bring this film to a wide audience. Unfortunately, Brodsky recently succumbed to cancer, so this film is a valedic for a subtle actor who has filled his character with a passion for life pleasure that has to reflect his own values. 9/10.
