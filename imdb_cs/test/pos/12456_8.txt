While it is not closer to Tarzan from Edgar Rice Burroughs than, let's say, Johnny Wiesmuller flicks it has it has its own special and fun, the storyline. It's a good Tarzan movie. Nice scenery, good photography, functional continuity, and Tarzan yelling that echos one that described Burroughs. They all play well. The only bad points I found were, I think, related. It moves slowly. The slow motion? Makes this image long. It could be 15 to 20 minutes shorter, which I think would help the natural flow of the plot line and character development. But the rest of the film works so well that it can carry it through these two rough spots and is still satisfied with the film. A short version of all of the above ... It's a very good Tarzan movie.
