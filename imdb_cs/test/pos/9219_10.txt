I was looking at this film as a child and still viewing it once in a while for the nostalgia factor. When I was younger, I loved the movie because it was a fun story and interesting characters. I still love characters today. In addition, I think of a conspiracy with a higher regard because I now see morality and symbolism. Rainbow Brite is by far not the worst movie, and although it's outdated, I'm sure I'll show it to my children in the future when I have kids.
