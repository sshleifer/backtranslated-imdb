I read the book before I looked at the movie and left me emotionally exhausted, but I felt that it really brought me to Afghanistan, a culture I know very little about. I had great hopes for this film and did not disappoint. I watched it with someone who didn't read the book and enjoyed it. They had to cut some things in the movie, but it was a well-played and well-shot movie. He lets you think about a movie long after it's over. You feel for the characters and their sorrows. I highly recommend this film to those who like emotionally exhausting drama and want to experience Afghan culture. There are some disturbing scenes not suitable for children to watch. It is a heavy drama depicting the horrors of life in a restrictive regime.
