Körkarlen (1921), a classic film with a cult status among silent films, directed by Victor Sjöstrøm, who also plays the lead role of a man, is based on the story of Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf. The film tells the story of a brutal drinker, David Holm, who beats his wife, neglects his children, seduces his brother to drink, and is blind for Sister Edit's love (Astrid Holm). David sits at the end of the year with his friends in the city park and tells the story of Phantom Chariot (Körkarlen). But David gets into a fight with his friends, suffers from bleeding and sinks the dead in the soil. Meanwhile, Phantom Carriage is approaching. The driver is none other than David's later friend Georges, who seduced him into alcohol and died a year ago. Since David refuses to get on the carriage, Georges forces him. Together they go to the stations where the people who suffered from David live. They visit Sister Edit, whose love for David could not be recognized, and whom he had infected with tuberculosis, so now he is dying. But her unconditional love for David will save his soul. They are filled with their spirit and come to David's wife and children. David is able to prevent his wife from killing himself and his children because he does not see the way out of the suffering David has thrown her. They also visit David's brother, who committed murder after being seduced by David. David asks Georges to return to his body because he finally sees his way wrong. Because it was Georges who once led him into drinking, David's wish is given, he gets a second chance and Georges must be a Phantom Carriage driver for another year to pay for his sins. This film is probably one of the strongest and most impressive films ever made. Unfortunately, it is still not available on the international DVD.
