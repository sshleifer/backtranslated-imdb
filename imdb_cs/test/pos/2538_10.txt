"Pixote: Lei do Mais Fraco" deals with what is perhaps the biggest of all Brazilian themes: poverty. And along with poverty, other unnatural feelings and actions it brings; prostitution, violence, crime, rape and murder. Brazil is a land of paradoxes and its social problems are present everywhere. The difference between rich and poor; beautiful and ugly; happiness and deepest human decline. "Pixote" is one of the movies that dare to touch and open these painful wounds, without the slightest glimpse of hope, in the sincere portrayal of a country that is lost like Pixote.
