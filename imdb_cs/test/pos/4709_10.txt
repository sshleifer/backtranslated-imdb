It certainly proves that this is not a shadow of doubt that Patricia Arquette is what she is promoted to: ACTRESS! This is undoubtedly her most beautiful moment of acting and she certainly deserves credit for her work. She was never entirely believable and authentic in any of her other films, with the possible exception of the Holy Marriage. PLOT: A young woman finds herself in Southeast Asia and is suddenly thrown into the political turmoil of the country. He witnesses mass murder and totalitarianism and escapes. It's one movie you have to see or you haven't seen all the Hollywood's best. I have included him 58 in the 100 best films of all time. Thanks to Bob
