I just saw this movie on Showtime at night. I looked at the beginning with one eye open, but instead of hovering into sleep, I invested in this crafty film that was upstairs. It was very credible and engaging. I could have done it without so much profanity (as with any David Mamet movie I see), but I enjoyed this experience. I know teenagers swear, but I don't have to listen. By the way, the story has some interesting surprises that I can't detect, but if you have a chance to catch this movie on Showtime, I think you'll like it just like me.
