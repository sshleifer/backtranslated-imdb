River's Edge is an excellent film and it is a pity that no more has been done in the history of cinema. There have been a number of daring films based around school children made in the 1980s, but all of those I have seen; it is certainly the most dramatic and unpleasant. The film takes a story that is intrusive in itself and adds the theme of teenage sloths and their steadfast attitude to things that move the story to another level. The film works because the central story is interesting and plays with complex characters. The film begins with murder. Then we follow the killer, nicknamed John, when he returns to school and tells all his friends about what he has done. Rather than the expected reaction, most of them hardly react at all and the strongest reaction the killer gets comes from Layne; Who makes it his number one priority to help John clean up the mess he is in and get him out of it. Other friends are thinking about the crime, and before one of them goes to the police ... <br /> <br /> River's Edge presents a number of great performances of his young cast. Keanu Reeves has a reputation for playing wood, for good reason; but it is very well suited to this early role and this performance is easily one of its best. Crispin Glover is the biggest standout as slightly crazy Layne. Glover always stands out in all the films he is in, and when he outperforms a little bit; He convinces in this film well. Reeves and Glover receive good support from a talented young cast that includes Daniel Roebuck and Joshua John Miller, as well as great Dennis Hopper in another wild role. The film has a very brave image that captures its nihilistic tone. The central characters are the slacker / stoner generation, and the way they don't really seem to care for the murder of their friend is more shocking than the murder itself; and the point at which the film seeks for modern society is strong and well defined. The film is also somewhat humorous, given some of the lines of characters; but humor is black and clearly this film should never have been a comedy. Overall, this is an excellent and unforgettable movie that is definitely worth seeing!
