... The reason I like this movie is because of the spirit it has. It's a brilliant film in a summer camp, so jokes aren't meant in a durable way that makes one character a lasting mockery. Guys are taking place, but you feel that the respective pellets will be able to look back and laugh when they were enough to fall for them - and without being too cheesy, it's pretty pretty that everyone is still friends. end! It's a special bonus when Bill Murray is the champion of all these fun races. For me, he is still seen as a god of comedy without peers when he gets a chance to relax. No one is better at creating a sense of relaxed crazy anarchy without really hurting. The tone of the whole film has the same style as his front man, created with a great opening scene showing how to prepare Murray for the day. Everything is stupid, yes, but more important than being an adult is having a lot of fun. "Meatballs" promises and eventually delivers a nutritious watch.
