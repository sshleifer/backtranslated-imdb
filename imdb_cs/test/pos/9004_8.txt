Like most sports films that came out in the past, this film is similar to reality. What sets this film apart is that it's about a rugby team, a sport that isn't too many Americans know. This film is very rewarding for film noir. That reminds me of "We Are Marshall", but with a smaller budget and independent film impression. Its director Ryan Little will bring us a story about a rebellious teen playing Sean Farris (Never Back Down). Despite several pinhole lines, this film has a heart and rewards each of its viewers with good characters with whom we can identify. Also a good performance by actors Gary Cole as coach Larry Gelwix & Neal McDonough as Coach Penning (Ricks Father). I felt I was going through a lot of different emotions watching the movie, at the end I was left with a feeling of faith in humanity and hope for the future for my children, especially if there are coaches like Gelwix.
