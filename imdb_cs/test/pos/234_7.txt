Although I'm not crazy about musicals, COVER GIRL is a pleasure for classic movie lovers and especially for Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly fans. The film can be dated to today's standards, and the story and the songs may not be anything special, but the music numbers are greatly staged and there's a great movie that fits the film. In addition, the film is a good introduction to Rita Hayworth's fans ... it's just breathtaking in the famous Technicolor. his songs in SWING TIME (1936), but the songs serve the film well. The dance is nothing better, especially from the solo number of Gene Kelly and my favorite music number "Alter-Ego Dance". Fun Phil Silvers almost steals film as Kelly's partner. Otto Kruger, Eva Arden and Edward Brophy perform well in their dramatic support roles. And Rita plays a sweet, charming girl here; a role that is far from her femme fatale babes in movies like BLOOD and SAND (1941). All in all, this is a wonderful movie worth watching, even if you're not big on musicals. However, the music of this film could be unforgettable if only my favorite composers, Irving Berlin or Cole Porter, wrote the songs for this film. However, it is a wonderful cinematography of Technicolor and imaginative dance, which is a true enjoyment of film production. When I watched Rita Hayworth do things, I don't think I've ever seen a more beautiful or elegant redhead dance on the screen because I saw Moire Shearer in Michael Powell's masterpiece, RED BOTY (1948). Just watch Rita in COVER GIRL and fall in love with her.
