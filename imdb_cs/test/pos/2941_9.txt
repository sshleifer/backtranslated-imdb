Yes, I am ashamed to admit it, but this show is positive DEVINE !!! It's so fun, and I have the greatest time to watch him. From cycle 1 it's great and I haven't noticed the fall in it Fame AT ALLYyra Banks, as you know, is a host, and as wonderful as she is, there are also other judges and co-founders like J. Alexander, Jay Manuel, Nigel Barker and Twiggy. it is for every girl invited to become the American Next Top Model, she has to work her way to the top by completing and winning the photo shoot competition. It sounds great, and let me say it's great !!! ! It's amazing to watch all the different types of girls photoshoot, and each one is different, cool and bold. Anyone who hates this show has no idea, and I'll tell you that this show will be on for LONG TIME, so WITH TEM!
