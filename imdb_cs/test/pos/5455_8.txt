*** SPOILERS *** This film depicts the brutal bloodshed caused by Johnny Carson's retirement to determine who would follow him. The personification of David Letterman and Jay Leno is performed satisfactorily by John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck, although the performances were not great. Reni Santoni is the most powerful of "execs" (played by John Agoglia of NBC), and Warren Littlefield (played by Bob Baliban) is close to second. I was shocked by the way Littlefield eagerly discussed Johnny Carson's dumping. That was Johnny Carson! This scene stands out on TV that is fashionable, what's what you did. Kathy Bates brought the best film performance as Agent Jay, Helen Kushnick. Another commentator claimed that Leno was portrayed as a simpleton in the film. I disagree with respect. The relationship with Kushnick concerned something similar to domestic violence. She orders him, and when she revolts against her at the end, she tries to play a sympathetic card (mention of her dead husband and son); however, when Jay closes their relationship, he turns around again, shouting, "You won't leave me, those two faces, bastard!" Overall, the film is cheerful and I wish it was more frequent.
