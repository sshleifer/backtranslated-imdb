Blue Night The Blue Night was actually a good modern noir. Three young nomads escape from their own lives with something from trips across the desert in the middle of nowhere (like most modern noirs). One woman discovers her husband is cheating on her, and when she finds him in the hotel room, she decides to leave and start over. Surprisingly, she travels with her husband's mistress, who is forgiven because sleazebag never told her she was married. And together, while driving in the pouring rain, they meet a third, very mysterious young man with a suitcase full of secrets. While they are envious and free and suspicious of each other, the cops in the city call them suspicious in the death of a policeman. Black Night The Blue Night begins with an instant confrontation and throws it into a pretty good story with all its twists that could lead your suspicion of one character after another, leading to a very unusual ending. This means that the film begins with an immediate action confrontation, and once you think the story is resolved, you are immediately drawn into another corner of the conspiracy, revealing just a little more than you expected before the film ends. But, as some viewers have written, the end is somewhat confusing and somewhat lethal. The killer is not the one you would expect immediately, and once you reveal it, it becomes somewhat confusing because of the somewhat thin explanatory memory that reveals all the necessary motives to solve the mystery. But in fact, there is a final behind what I would think is the most interesting of the movie. Since a modern noir always includes a criminal suspect circle, almost all of them are guilty, it is also a genre that always involves money. And so the question in these films always happens - how far are the characters willing to go for money? <br /> <br /> If you like this rendition of modern film noir, I would recommend watching Red Rock West (it's also got JT Walsh and some girls in the blasted desert)!
