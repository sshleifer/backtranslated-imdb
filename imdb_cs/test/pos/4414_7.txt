In many ways, this film defines the essence of everything I love about cinema in capturing those strange, elusive moments of unguarded truth. In other ways, it is an undeniably amateur, restless result of drug addicts who are indifferent to the camera. Finally, it comes out somewhere between pure brilliance and inattention (fortunately much more than the other). Part of me wants to reward only for absolute innovation and moments of pure sublimity, but at the same time I cannot completely ignore the sometimes horrible "acting" and obviously bad production values. The adjustments initially seem overwhelmingly careless and unnecessarily distracting (or perhaps just "innovative"), but after a while I got used to it, which is a real sign of whether the film succeeds on its own terms or not. I think the answer basically summarizes my versatile feelings about the film. This means that, despite the fact that it is a trivial shortcoming, it works very well on the whole. And if nothing else, a film like this really shows how untrue and fictitious a faux-documentary, shaky-cam style can ever be when it so clearly applies purely for effect (for example, in films like the otherwise admirable Roger Dodger). The aesthetic is obviously derived from the needs of the film situation and is not just used to look cool.
