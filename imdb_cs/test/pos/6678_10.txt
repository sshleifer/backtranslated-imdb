He just watched it and it was amazing. He seriously doubted renting a DVD or not. So if you're ... and like watching other than mindless action movies ... don't hesitate any longer. Do not let the blunt cover discourage you. The script is one of the best. Smart, witty, original, touching and keeps you on the edge of the seat with the entire movie. I've been watching another movie before this movie and I was sleepy and usually bored watching a second movie in one night, but this one really woke me up and I had no boring moments. It also made me think in life and gave me a really good feeling. Also acting is great (one of Kevin Spacey's best roles). The visuals are beautiful and the music is very well chosen. If I have to come up with something negative to say ... well ... I can't find anything ...... Enjoy it! 10 of 10
