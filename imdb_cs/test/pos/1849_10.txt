I love this movie !!! This beautiful, charming love story pulled me instantly with his love characters and heartbreaking romance. In the course of the film I stood up with the characters that I personally recognized them. The storyline is very charming, and it brought me to tears in a few moving moments. Duchovny and Driver have a very cute, chaste relationship that you can't help getting involved with. This is worth watching more than once and showing all your friends. I'm just wondering why it wasn't a big hit? I give it 10 out of 10! Spectacular movie! (And this comes from a guy who thinks 9 out of 10 movies don't even worth watching.)
