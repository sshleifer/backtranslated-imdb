I am very surprised that so many people do not like this film. I think it's much better than most of the teen movies that came out recently - ten things I hate about you (we can say it's a crazy bopper movie and what was the principle of writing those porn novels?) the character gives up their virginity for a fun car ride), and she is all (average). If you're looking for something that's just fun - I say go with Never Been Kissed. My mom loved it and hates movies (one of her favorites is BEACHES). This is a great fantasy about what you would do differently if you could return to high school. People who have been thrown out in high school are likely to like this movie. It reminds me of "Roma and Michele's High School Reunion". And the end gives me the best mood. Of course, the plot was done, but how many recent movies you can honestly say they weren't made in one or the other. The cast is also charming. And for those who think Drew can't be freaking out, he just pulls it down. Another good teenage comedy I recommend recently was OPTION, but it's rather satire in school and politics.
