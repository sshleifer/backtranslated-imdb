It is true that Alex has become a bit of a podgey, but they are still (for me) the biggest rock trio. I strongly recommend this DVD to every fan. I was very disappointed that they canceled their planned recent Munich concert (logistics) and regret not trying to see it elsewhere. DVD is a little consolation - the biggest incentive to get a proper DVD playback setting. Naive maybe, but I still don't understand the importance of drum dryers on stage; I would be grateful for any explanation. Cheers, Iain.
