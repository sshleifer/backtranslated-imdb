This film felt very true to life. I liked the end that looked naturally without great moments, but with a lot of little moments. You could say it's a sincere love story. It doesn't matter what the "sexual orientation" of the main characters is, it's still a story of love and understanding. <br /> <br /> There were lots of scenes in the family. Setting up is what is a very stressful time for some people. Namely "holidays". Christmas is accurate. Like most good movies, this one also deals with the issues of love, adaptation, expectations and the inability to overcome distortion. Eventually Alexandra and Casey choose each other because they know that love is difficult and that it gives. Great.
