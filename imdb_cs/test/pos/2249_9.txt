Being an Israeli Jew naturally sarcastic, as well as a lover of various and independent films, always gives me the pleasure of seeing a movie that looks at the Holocaust, which is both sensitive and respectful and original and unusual. While I wasn't reading the book? or have they even heard of his existence before watching the movie? and therefore, like some other reviewers, can not comment on how they compose in comparison, everything that is illuminated has brought me great pleasure and I can certainly comment on it. Marking everything is illuminated by the Holocaust film would be a great injustice, even if it is undeniably about the Holocaust. So it would be a comedy or a travel movie, even if it's about a journey and it's as extremely fun as it moves. Everything that is illuminated is about Jonathan Safran Foer? played at minimalist perfection Elijah Wood, in the most impressive dramatic performance I saw him still, with a poker face that shows nothing and reveals all ?? a young American Jew and obsessed collector of family heritage and historical artifacts who travel to Ukraine to find a woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. It's also about Alex, his guide to Ukraine and Alex's grandfather. What is fascinating about these characters is that at the beginning of the film they look like comic relief to match the melancholic nature of Wood's character; but both Alex and his grandfather go through fascinating changes throughout the film, and they turn out to be at least as important as Jonathan. In fact, as a grumpy, confident blind grandfather, Boris Leskin will prove to be the most beautiful dramatic performance in the film. In addition to the surrealistic nature of film and characters, the beautiful mix of original acoustic music and Russian folk music, sensitive cinema and the chilling contrast between the beauty of the landscape and the horrors of history, making everything light and powerful for me was the reality that we get a very different and original view of this painful subject from Alex and his grandfather; several outstanding films, such as the Gray Zone and the Fall, have already given us a look at the lower Nazis who are presented as human beings who are not fully aware of the moral consequences of their actions, but are captured in the reality of war. Everything that is illuminated is a rarely seen look: Alex's view is the look of a young man who was born many years after the war, who considers him hardly more than a cold historical fact that must face the horrors of his own people? and maybe his own family? they were able. Change in Alex's attitude? and his grandfather? towards Jonathan, towards the Holocaust and generally towards the Jewish people, the film makes fascinating and original study of character development. Everything that is illuminated is a wonderful directorial debut for Lieva Schreiber and one of them. The most original and unique films from 2005. It's a highly recommended viewing experience, especially for the Holocaust and World War II.
