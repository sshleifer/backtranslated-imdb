I recently saw An Zhan. Not because it was a Hong Kong movie, but because I was looking for a change from the films that are made here in the US. In my humble opinion, I believe that the film could easily compete with the action thrillers that arise here, with the exception of the traditional idiocyncration of Hong Kong film. The one who still bothered me was the Chief Inspector. I still don't understand why there must be a complete character of the idiot-comic relief in the serious films that came out of Hong Kong, but I can live with it when the film is so good. The characters are believable, although they are not. The story is fast and really sucks you into it. The real scenic scenes for me were two bus rides taken by the character thief. Overall, a really solid movie.
