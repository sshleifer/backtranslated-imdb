Rarely seen by Peter Watkins Park of Punishments is a brutal, unreal political weapon that is in the endless desert. Escapades, who ruthlessly rely on authoritarian abuse, initially seem to be so militaristic and ugly that it might look like some faraway dystopian alternative history. But as soon as we delve deeper and pay attention to the fact that those who preside over the tent tribunal are disgusted, and also the shotgun who oversees the bloody affair, our eyes are really open. Suddenly we realize how Watkins' film work is, how predictable it is, because many of them are a type of neoconservative points about youth culture and the legality of divergent ideas that politicians are bothering today. It is true that much of it was also drivel, but it shows us how little it has changed and informs how we have somehow approached a world where Penalty Parks would be a real and terrifying operation. The main players in almost every scene are seasoned non-actors who are mostly chosen for their rash political views and the desire to get them on camera. This gives the whole experience an unprecedented pile of authenticity because we never question the reality of the whole chaos for a second. Filmed with a 16mm film, this looks like a bold documentary of some despicable government test project that has been classified only after several years. At least he seems to have this history now, perhaps not so much when (barely) released. This, however, gives more weight to all management and helps you to draw torture into this incredible universe for convicted dissidents.
