2:37 is an intense and fascinating drama that has some similarities in tone and theme with movies like Bully, Elephant and Kids (although in my opinion, 2:37 it's an excellent movie to the three). The film, my expectations were neutral, but thanks to an intelligent script, the perfect direction of Murali K. Thalluri and excellent results from a group of young actors, I made a very good impression. Rare examples of school violence around the world have inspired many films, television programs and books that pretend to seek and predict the external or internal reasons for these unreliable manifestations of rebellion, discontent ... and especially madness. too late for the artistic movement; however, I do not think this way because the delay allowed the film to do more artistic analysis, focusing on the situation with more subtlety and intelligence instead of an obvious reaction of cruelty and anxiety that impregnated other films with similar stories. The characters from 2:37 include a clich√© from a teenage cinema (director and screenwriter John Hughes -RIP-movies for teen horror movies): beautiful "princess", clumsy "nerd", antipathetic athletes, etc. very easy to become hollow caricatures defined by their functions in the script; but it is admirable that the scenario goes beyond stereotypes to become real people with trustworthy problems that more or less all people find on their way to adulthood. 2:37 is an excellent movie whose only failure is that the end feels a little hit, but that compensates for it with lots of positive elements. It will be very interesting to see other Thalluri projects because he has made a great debut with this film.
