I caught my attention on Netflix Instant Play because it was only an hour and a half long (it's approaching 4 hours here), and because it's a Norwegian I wanted to watch with Dead Snow and find out what else it offers in international cinema right now. This wandering film features a man, Andreas, who is transported to some purgatory of Brave New World, where everyone is happy and tasteless, nothing smells, or sex loses its appeal. . After his lack of common senses, which is driven to the edge, he feels almost ready to kill himself. After a cheerful attempt at confusion, Andreas looks at the men with similar complaints, and they both find a trifle, a vagina-shaped hole in the concrete wall from which the music comes out. Two attempts to penetrate to see what is on the other side, watching a small piece of light that they barely see. Of course, in the fantasy allegory of the earth, desire and disagreement are not allowed and the elements of the city operate to end Andreas's attempt at freedom and sensuality. Jens Lien and the crew create a simple, straight forward motion to the story, one that flows well with its themes and moves to just as much pace to avoid lagging. Similarities in other similar sci-fi are not worth mentioning, but the film still has a unique feeling and balances some very funny scenes with some pretty scary ones. I like the limited but effective use of gore in this movie, some disembowelment and flagellation that will make your heart stutter harder than the Passion of Christ simply because it is so perfectly out of place from the gray-toned mise-en-scene. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is a reliably squirrel actor who feels physically outside of his surroundings, which works very well. Despite the fact that the concept itself is nothing to write about, everyone who participates in it works and the film fully realizes its own world. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
