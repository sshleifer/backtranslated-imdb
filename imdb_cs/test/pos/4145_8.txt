If filming is about vision and real life, this film is absolutely perfect: NUOVOMONDO talks about immigration in the US from Italy in early 900, but it is also being spoken now that emigration / immigration still focuses. Must not be rich in becoming a visionary film. High-level actress, Charlotte Gainsbourg, star. Good Challenge for Oscar 2007 <br /> <br /> After Criales, "Respiro," an emotional but overly intellectual film, the lesson learned the lesson of Fellini and Taviani to name just two Italian masters. The fence is arguing, directing the exact, maybe just a little less melodrama would be more effective. <br /> <br /> If VOLVER (demanding for an Oscar next year) Almodovar is a mature film by always a great director, NUOVOMONDO deserves more, because his quest is to be a European film for the American scene. And that's it!
