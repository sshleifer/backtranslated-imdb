A very accurate depiction of the small time of crowd life shot in New Jersey. The story, characters and scenarios are believable, but acting drops the ball. Yet it is worth watching, especially for strong images, some still with me, even though I first viewed it 25 years ago. Young hood rising and starting to do bigger things (trying) things are going wrong, leading a local boss to suspect his end is gone, not a good place if you like your health or life. Martin Scorsese. Also, the persistent man, Frank Vincent, is present. Strong for characterization and visuals. Sound confused and most acting is an amateur but great story.
