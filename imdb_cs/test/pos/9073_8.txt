Flatliners gave me a noticeable impression in my head. The story is fast and leaves you constantly absorbed and often quite tense. Her five remarkable doctors (especially Julia Roberts and Kevin Bacon), among whom one of them invented a mechanism to stay dead for a few seconds (or get into the apartment) and then return to life. This procedure is very complex and involves a lot of medical panties - injections, electric blankets, oxygen masks and various esoteric medical terms. I strongly suspect that doctors have created all these words so they never have to get away. But happily follow KISS (Original version for engineers: Keep It Simple, stupid) (extended version for doctors: Keep it stupid, simple) also philosophy. With the risk of some of the doctors taking revenge by taking euthanization, let me continue. So the first person who gets hopes for housing units will find answers to a life that philosophy and religion cannot convincingly answer. He hopes to get her (and become famous) through applied science. He tensed for about two minutes and then returns to our world, which is totally shaken. During his death, he had a vision of the incident when he was young, leaving the strongest impression on his life. He killed another boy when he was a child, by accident, and still feels responsible for it. <br /> <br /> Successfully the first platformer follows the others and each of them extends its plane. time further and further test the limits of how long a person can stay dead and experience life after death. Meanwhile, monsters from the past and the future are constantly returning and haunting them. The first apartment is being chased by a young guy who tortures him when he is alone. The other, who looked at all the women he took to bed, sees the TVs all the time playing their videos. The third is being chased by a young girl he teased at school. The fourth is persecuted by her suicidal father, for whom she feels responsible. All these people are buried with these scary and obsessive disasters, thinking that the past seems to be revenge. The main focus on getting flat lines is for your whole life to go through the eyes, at the time of "dying", no matter what stage it is, and you have mostly been with the strongest impression of life in your mind. As they did not die, these strong impressions somehow resurrected and became the focus of their lives. Everyone is somehow dealing with (and extinguishes) their past demons. Everyone, except the first person who realizes that the only way he can move his life is still flat. During this flat lesson, he sees himself getting into the apartment for the first time and seeing the boy he killed, and this time trying to kill him. The boy kills him for a few minutes and tries to get revenge. For a few minutes in the movie one is left wondering if he gets to go back. Fortunately (because most of us love happy endings) the boy releases him from his past and comes to life again.
