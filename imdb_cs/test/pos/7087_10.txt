Someone wrote there, you can say it, but only if you were there. Excellent performances of Meryl Streep (of course!), Renee Zellweger and William Hurt. Many have said that it is a dysfunctional family, I think every family is dysfunctional when faced with this species. torment. It is NOT functional! Are you losing your family as you know it, can it be worse? People have to see this film, so when they face this nightmare, they may change as they do. Maybe they'll see that the father is leaning on a valuable time he never gets a chance. Maybe he'll realize how hard it is to die, or watch someone you love. They didn't miss most of the nightmare, it's hard to forget.
