In a time of bad, if not terrible comedies, the Queen of Queens is more than just breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! It is, in my opinion, one of the 5 best comedy shows of all time. Nothing was so good since she was married to children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are Comic Geysers! And believe me it takes a lot to call someone a comical genius. These guys really understand what's funny. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and I didn't get half the laugh when I saw KOQ only once. Other funny people in this show are Carrie, Janet Heffernan, Spence and Doug Pruzan (boss Carrie). I am so happy that they have managed to get so many seasons out of this jewel. The show was a cheerful winner at the time of most comic losers. Check it out if you don't!
