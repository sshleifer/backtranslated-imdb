the first movie was followed a few years ago by my daughter, who is now 13 and fell in love with a vampire. both we thought it was the best movie, then watched sub 11 then sub 111 now i found it to be sub 1v that i can't wait to get on my fangs and also there is a fifth in the pipe. if no one saw movies. they are the best of the best. I think it's a thousand Oscars. I could watch them from morning to night. I'd like to keep nails like him, looking at the girls. I love it because all the story lines continue from film to film. These ant typical vampire films are better. I would like to live in a life that is protruding in movies. it would fulfill all my dreams
