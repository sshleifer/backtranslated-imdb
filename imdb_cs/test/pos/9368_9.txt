The film as Crossfire builds another film that spreads around its social consciousness - ie, the recent Crash movie - almost to shame. Not necessarily because one of them interprets his message of intolerance is much deeper (although I would bet on Crash throwing a hammer much stronger than this), but because of how the narration and controversy never got in the way of Crash. Maybe it's not really necessary to compare these two because Crossfire is at its core deep into the film-noir vein, like it's going out of style. In fact, it was interesting to see what director Edward Dmytryk had said on a DVD interview where he mentioned that the budget in the photo was significantly lower (intentionally), so the actor could be more spent and the schedule went on a very fast, fast pace. But then what happens to be unbelievable is that you think you're looking at the many light sets that need to be done. Just for a small scene, as Keeely Robert Mitchum sets out for interrogation under Captain Robert Young for the first time - the shadows in the room are beautiful. That there are many other light sets that go even further with such small markers is something essential in the realm of the noir era. All you have to do is look at the figures on the staircase, the stripes against them, and see what I mean. But back to the fabric part of the movie - it's really a story that consists of a murder mystery, but one that we as an audience do not suffer long before we come to the answer. It is then more about something other than the mind and soul of a murderer who would not be in a common picture of crime because there are actually no "criminals" in the film. There is a very calculated risk, with the characters being too thin to support a (valuable) message against anti-Semitism. But Dmytryk's leadership of his top cast, along with John Paxton's truly amazing script, crowds out characters from which at least what they should not be too thin beside the message. And then what should be noir without having any attitude with it? Mitchum helps, even in scenes such as between him and Young, where he relies heavily on the moment of the story (ie, Detail on the Conspiracy) by pushing some funny jokes into some dialogues. It may already be in the lines, but it helps the character with a good lead for his scenes. Then there is also Robert Ryan, who excels at Montgomery as the man you know, t first, just through his bs performances, but you're not even sure. After starting to clarify ironically through the subjective view of suspect Mitchell (George Cooper) in the apartment of the late Samuels, his performance becomes a great balancing act that is full of bullshit and also somewhat scary in his deadlock. It is a good performance when it is also against Cooper who has the real personal problems he faces and comes with regret and humility. It's actually after the movie is over that you think a lot about it, and when you watch a movie, it's more about getting into the dialogue and the flow of scenes. actors, so the report is secondary. Not that it is not important, especially for the time period (coming in World War II), but a few years later his performance of actors, even those who do not get the status of a large awning like Gloria Grahame as Ginny (femme fatale from the picture, if it could have time for the one who doesn't have it and William Phipps as Leroy ("hick"), who hold each other strongly in a compacted scenario. Dmytryk is also very wise in choosing to limit the music score being powerful too, because for very long stretches we hear nothing, and mostly when it comes, it's random to the surrounding character. He just as easily disappeared with added musical notes on some dramatic scenes to emphasize, especially the opening audience-grabber to the movie. By avoiding and gaining the correct attitudes and nuances in the camera and casting, this increases standards in genre materials to a very subtle, unforgettable level. My favorite scene would probably go to Finley's story of an Irish immigrant, to Leroy, where all these elements fit well. At the top of my favorite noirs, it might not be too high - and I would still return Murder My Sweex as a director's masterpiece in this type of picture - but it's certainly higher than something at level B.
