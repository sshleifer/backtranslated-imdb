For fake documentaries (anyone?), This is there with the best! It looks very real and that is what it is trying to do. In the recent light of events (Guant√°namo), this film is even more frightening, so you can say it was a time ago when it was released in the 1970s! One can only hope that such a government does not exist! Looking for terrorists and conversations with people? Of course, the people we talked to looked the same (70's mentality): Screw politics and politics in general. Maybe it wasn't so clever that he thought ... but hey, remember: It's just a movie! ;O)
