If you like your movies to pull your emotions out of you, if you like your movies with a guy you can root, and apply if you like your movies in black and white, you need to see this movie! Watch it from start to finish because you don't want to miss the rhythm. This is sometimes slow, and you are wondering when something will happen, then when the plot begins to develop, you will be on the edge of your seat! I know I was! My mother told me about this movie because our family did the same thing as a movie. We loved Frankie, who plays convincingly. What do you think of Frank Sinatra, put aside, in the film, is skinny and does not sing, so keep your mind open. For the era in which he was created, he tells a story that is still being said in homes throughout the country, and perhaps in the world. Please watch if you like older movies, try it.
