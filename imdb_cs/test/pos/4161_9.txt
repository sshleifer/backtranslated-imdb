The Golden Gate is enriched with Agnes Godard's expressive cinematography (Beau Travail) and is a visually remarkable poem that follows the peasant family's journey from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island in New York at the turn of the century. It is a surreal, mysterious, often strange but ultimately rewarding experience. The latest film, Emanuele Crialese (Respiro), blended with dream and symbolic images with bold realism, is like an impressionist image - portraying what the immigration process could be for our parents and grandparents. Crialese's "magical, mysterious tour" came as a result of his visit to the museum on Ellis Island, views of the faces of immigrants pictured in the photographs he saw, and his research into the harsh policies and practices used in hiring immigrants. Based on the letters he read about immigrants sent to relatives who stayed at home, Crialese identifies himself with those impoverished immigrants who were able to see the positive side of things beyond their suffering. For Salvator Mancus (Vincenzo Amato) and his older son Angel (Francesco Casisa), America is a distant dream that they know nothing about. After climbing the rocky mountain to pray to the saints for signs, they are rewarded when the postcards of the younger son of Salvatore Pietro (Filippo Pucillo), a deaf silent who portrays a new world as a country where they can bathe, are displayed. in the milk rivers, sit under the money tree, or harvest the giant onions and carrots. After the destruction of his animals in exchange for shoes and suits, Salvatore, his two sons and his older mother Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) set out on her adventure with more hope than anxiety, but the equation will soon move to another. side. When he boarded the ship and settled into the crowded driving space of the third class, the film is watched by the most watched scene. By using a top camera that shows the masses of people as the ship moves away, the frame is divided into those aboard the ship, and those who wave goodbye from the dock and the way they are separated mean they are torn from everything, what is known. Br /> <br /> The ship is a mysterious English woman named Lucy (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Crialese does not reveal his past or the reason he travels to America, but he seems to be behind the advent of the modern world they enter. Even though they look carefully at each other, Lucy is interested in Salvator and asks him to marry her to allow her to enter the country. The cruise is treacherous with a violent storm that beats the ship. Shot in almost complete darkness, the passengers in the lead are tossed to the side of the boat and, then, the bodies lie tangled and twisted on the floor as if in a horrific Totentanz. The ceremony of passing through the immigration process on Ellis Island will not become easier and Crialese attacks as illiterate peasants in the name of preserving a "civilized" society are forced to compose puzzles together, perform mathematical tasks, and undergo degrading medical examinations. prove that they are "fit". The marriage mediation ceremony feels like an auction block, and young women look desperate when they are overweight with overweight men in middle age. This is the only way they can enter the "Golden Door" because individual women are said to be rejected if they do not have partners, allegedly to prevent the threat of prostitution. Through the mist, immigrants can barely see the land of milk and honey and there is no Statue of Liberty that asks for tired and poor, humble masses eager to breathe for free. But in its imagination the river still flows, waiting for it to jump in. Although the end is ambiguous and the door opens to an empty wall, the next door symbolizes the rebirth of the soul and the course that we all must accept. the old world to the new.
