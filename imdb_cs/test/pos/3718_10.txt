This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut film. Keeps all the rules. Short scenes, to point, cheap shoot, gerilla-film-making, no files (just disused buildings) and maybe empty hospital wing. Even the black-and-white film was a brilliant move that was rather chosen for its low cost than the film effect, but it worked. Reno was amazing as Brute. The actions of all were brilliant. The storyline was simple and effective, and no cowardly pieces lost attention. A solid, well-crafted, cost-effective movie budget. Published in 1983, it would be done just before the art of spectacular action spectacular theater performances became a refined Hollywood engine. and making movies was more exclusive and therefore more challenging and needed for the right people in the right places than the current internet world, so Luc Besson would have to do quite a bit of negotiation and promise to achieve this result, which makes the product more remarkable. But again, the French film industry has always maintained an excellent reputation (yes, I know Luc Besson is a Belgian, but the film is French production) and has been the source of many remakes in Hollywood. If I have one criticism, it is that the cover picture on the DVD (and perhaps the original sales poster) bears resemblance to the film at all and seems to be a rather bizarre picture rather than representing any of that movi Themes e - at first glance, he seems to be a man in a post-apocalyptic armor on a swing, but at the second inspection he reveals a man in armor with a spear on an office chair with his feet on the table in a tilted self-service chair. confident attitude. It never happens once in a movie. It's a black-and-white film movie, zero dialogue, physical performance, tight scenes, and brilliant actors, which is worth adding to your private movie collection. Excellent movie.
