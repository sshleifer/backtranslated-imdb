All right, when I first saw "Talk Radio", he was in the video store for just $ 2.00 per VHS or not, and I looked at it and I thought it might be about Howard Stern because he looked at it for about thirty. seconds, then he hasn't seen it yet. Then I went to another store a month later and found "Talk Radio" on DVD for just $ 5.00. So I see it was directed by Oliver Stone, and I picked it up. So after the movie was over, I was without speech. I've never seen such a movie. Here's the main plot, then I'll tell you what I thought about it. It's about being a radio host in Dallas, Barry Champlain, a Jewish radio host who talks about what other people are raising. and takes it seriously. Now he wants to put his show live all over the US. So Barry's show gets a lot of interesting phone callers like Chet (neo-natzi), Kent (rock n roll drugged kid), John (rapist) and more. . Now some of the callers sound like the same actor / actress. But I still think it's okay. Now I really like dark corners and the paranoid atmosphere of the radio station on this movie. Dark background music is also very nice. She also has a flashback scene in the movie, starting with radio, which I think they are doing well. But the great movie about the movie is over. It surprised me, and you feel a little paranoid about phone calls from the air and everything is amazing. It also tells you how to tell people over the big city like Dallas the right thing. One of Oliver's Stone's underestimated / weakest films mentioned, but I think it's the best thing in my opinion. However, this movie is sure to be enjoyed if you like paranoid movies like dark atmosphere movies with sinister background music. I'm still watching this movie a lot of time when I'm bored because I noticed it tonight. Yeah, if you want the movie to look ominous, look at it at night when the lights are off. Maybe it sounds crazy, but the movie is better! Another thing I forgot to mention is that the reason I don't think the movie did so well was maybe in my view because of the title. "Radio radio." It doesn't sound too deceptive or nothing, it's kind of plain. Better title like "Talked To Death" or maybe "The Abusive Radio Host" or something catchy and not simple "Talk Radio". Or maybe because of Universal Pictures? Usually Oliver Stone didn't do Universal, I don't think so. Paramount could be a good company. I don't know, something about this movie didn't do well, but I love it. <br /> <br /> "Sticks and stones can break bones, but words can cause permanent damage."
