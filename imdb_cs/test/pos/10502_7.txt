Progeny is about a husband who is losing time in making love. Absolutely unaware of what this bizarre experience means trying to continue life. The wife starts to question the bizarre event and gets help through a very unpleasant psychiatrist. He believes that extraterrestrials are responsible over time and that the unborn child he once thought was his and his wife actually belonged to foreigners. If you ask me, it's a great scifi / horror story. Taking a very doubtful real-life scenario, involving the kidnapping of foreigners and hybrid breeding, is a step away from this boy. I love all extraterrestrial things and this story has certainly brought some good ideas. So if you are also interested in extraterrestrial things, you should be satisfied with Progeny. At least the same story. Unfortunately, the movie is quite average. With the average of all actors. Yeah, even consistently amazing Mr. Dourif, who still provides the best performance. Although a black doctor, he supplies his lines really well. There are a few points in the movie where some of the supplies are crouching or laughing, which is fine in my book. I like them cheesy, and this had a pretty smelly cheese and I mean it in a good way. By the way, with less than a star scenario, you can't blame all the actors. Especially I didn't care about the mother Hysteria, for which the film went. She wanted the child so badly that she would neglect and reject everything her loving husband (who is a doctor!) Told her. Almost reached the point where you didn't really care about what happened to her. Progeny is another film by Brian Yuzny from the film icky-sticky film, Society. It brings again some slimy effects and again brings a totally unique story of horror. If you are at scifi / horror or you are a fan of Dourif or Yuzna movies, there is no real reason to look at this movie if you have a chance. Generous 7 outta 10.
