"Cat In The Brain" is a series of extremely violent sequences that are put together by a conspiracy that feels more like an overview that describes the best known years of director Lucia Fulci. The film can also be seen as a dark comedy of sorts, effectively spoofing various claims that violent cinema causes violence in real life. Fulci goes further than he, throwing himself like a star, the central character of the film, showing viewers who are men behind all the film gore. "Cat in the Brain" is not about introducing a clear story and following it. Instead, he jokes at some clich√©s that fly in the horror genre. Lucio Fulci plays as a director of horror trying to keep his humanity intact. Years of violent filmmaking have finally come to him. Beginning slowly, steaks and meat generally start to disgust him, his colleagues assure Fulci that all he needs is rest. But this does not help and soon the grotesque ideas for his films begin to overwhelm his everyday thoughts. In an effort to find a cure for his dangerously spreading mental state, Lucio begins to go to a local psychiatrist. Unfortunately, it is more bad than good and Fulci is thrown into an even bigger mess as the psychiatrist turns out to be a psychopath who mimics Fulci's murders in real life. The film retains all the Italian trademarks of splatter cinemas, good or bad they are all here. Thus, any comments regarding gaming or technical aspects and budgetary constraints are completely irrelevant in terms of film quality. It's a visual experience, no doubt about it. Fulci throws in an incredible amount of violence that easily overcomes everything he has done. Chainsaw amputated, cannibalism, child murder, decapitation are just a few of the many grotesque acts in Cat In The Brain. Some of them are probably recycled from several of the smaller director's films, but they do not look out of context and actually feel at home here. As I mentioned earlier, the film is much better than a satire genre rather than a serious piece. The way some violence is presented helps to create this idea. Such sequences shortly after the climax are rejected by the reality in the film because they are actually revealed as scenes within the film that controls Fulci's character. This kind of "movie in film" presentation somewhat reduces the impact of gore. But in no way is it easy to watch a movie. Oh no, that is far beyond the gore that is in mainstream horror, and gorehounds will undoubtedly be satisfied with that fact. Lucio Fulci was a very polarized character. People either hate his work or love her. "The Cat in the Brain" does not convince any of Fulci's critics as opposed to, but it is an interesting part of his filmography. One that fans should really try.
