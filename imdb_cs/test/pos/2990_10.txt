I saw the film in 1972, and like the other people who commented on it ... I came back many times to see it again and again ... I think 9 times in all. It's great as I describe it ... I was impressed by the soundtrack, the beautiful panoramas of southern France, the lifestyle that the children themselves began. The ideal way to live is what they have established ... of course, the forces to be interceded, but when I forget that part, I find myself in a movie and live like that! So good it is now available on DVD ... it hasn't been for years! <br /> TL / TLW
