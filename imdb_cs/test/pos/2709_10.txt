I first saw this movie in 1994 or '95 during my high school year when it was on Lifetime. When I first saw it, I thought it was amazing. Sure, it doesn't have to run any longer, but it's as accurate as it can be in my opinion (no matter what someone else might think). Cynthia Gibb was great at portraying Karen and Mitchell Anderson was fine as Richard. Louise Fletcher (Yes, who played Nurse Ratched in 1975 in "One Fly Over the Cuckoo's Nest") was also fine, but I found her version of Agnes (Karen and Richard's Mother) to be a little thrilled. I am EXTREMELY a huge fan of carpenters and I believe Karen's voice was and is so amazing. I'm really sad to be gone and leave this country too early, but thanks to the endless popularity of her music and her angelic voice, the music will continue to live. By the way, back on track for this movie, it is really a mystery to me and maybe other people (fans and non-fans of carpenters) what happened to what caused Karen to end up getting this problem with my health. Was it the media that was responsible, or was it just Karen's decision? I wouldn't believe it was her decision. It could have been an article from an article that was printed about it somewhere in '70 when their hit "Close to You" came out of it. There are some other moments in the film as well. Richard's fight with drugs and Karen's marriage. I haven't heard of her loss in February 1983 because I haven't learned about the news yet; I found it was a few years later. I don't know if there will be another film about Carpenters or Karen in the future, but by then this movie will be fine. I will say it, though: If Karen overlooked the fake details of this article or any future articles that could be published with similar content, they called her "chubby" (which must have been quite an insult), she would still be here on this country today. I know he's in heaven and he likes to enjoy his beautiful voice. God bless you, Karen!
