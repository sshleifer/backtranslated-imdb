I suppose this film will get enthusiastic reviews in Canada - especially in Quebec. That's because Canadians have traditionally loved hockey and the Montreal Canadians have been like gods in Canada for decades. As an American, the closest thing we have to them is the New York Yankees. If you are a fan, they are the biggest and most successful team in history. If you are not a fan then they are a Satan team !! At least it was when I grew up in Washington, DC when it came to the Dallas Cowboys. So I'm pretty sure when this movie showed up in the north that everyone immediately had a strong emotional response - their national sport and the closest thing to the NHL national team. Now the cartoon itself is of medium interest when it starts and the main character talks about growing up around Ottawa and rooting for Canadians and Maurice "The Rocket" Richard. However, when his mother accidentally buys him the Toronto Maple Leafs and forces him to wear it, I immediately knew what a horrible and shameful thing it would be for a little boy. This ability to connect with a character - even if he lives in the distance - is what made it a very special short film. The way other children treated him and his conversation with God in the end are making this beautiful nostalgic movie. Very clever and unforgettable.
