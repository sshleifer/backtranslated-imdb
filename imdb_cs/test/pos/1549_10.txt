In the 1960s, this grim study of the young proletarian's wife Joy was an introduction to Ken Loach's career, one of Britain's most distinguished and respected filmmakers of all time. At that time, I knew very little about Brecht, politics or the underestimated reality, and I was impressed by the aesthetics of the film, its free style, its austere color cinematography, and Joy's monologues before the camera. I was also very surprised to find that Terence Stamp (which, thanks to "Billy Budd", "The Collector" and "Modesty Blaise") had become so short on screen. Although the 20th century Fox distributed the "poor cow" in Panama, Loach did not stay in the mainstream cinema (which this film hardly is) and I lost contact with his films. I've heard of his successes, "Kes", "Family Life", "Black Jack". until I caught in the 1980s. By the way, Donovan's beautiful title track is available in his "Troubadour" anthology.
