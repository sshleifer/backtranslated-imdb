If anyone has any doubts about Lieva Schrieber's talent, all he has to do is look at his new film, "Everything Is Illuminated", which clearly shows a man who is not just one of America's best players, but a new director whose first effort is truly an inspiration and a harbinger. what to follow. Mr. Schreiber edited Jonathan Safran's novel Foer into a film that will live forever because of the way the director adapted the material. The film clearly exceeded our expectations because we had no prejudices. <br /> <br /> For those who have not seen the movie, maybe you should stop reading here. Jonathan is a collector. His love for grandparents is unlimited. He watches his grandfather die and his grandmother is on what seems to be her deadly bed. In a clear moment, this dying woman gives Jonathan a picture and amber decoration for his collection. Looking at the photo we married long ago, we see a young couple together. Watching doing Jonathan thinks it shows grandfather and his girlfriend, taken to happier times. Watching the film seems to be the motivation for this intense young man to look for the past of his ancestors in Ukraine. Jonathan has agreed with a travel agency, Heritage Tours, Odessa on his way to Trochenbrod, a mythical place where his grandfather came from. The agency is dominated by an older man who claims to be blind, and his grandson, Alex, a man who loves pop American culture that captured his imagination as well as his contemporaries in the country. Alex speaks English, no one speaks and his conversations and translations, because Jonathan's contribution is cheerful to our ear for ever unprecedented English terms. The old man insists on taking his dog, Sammy Davis Jr., against Jonathan's wish not to sit next to the snarling and barking animal during the trip. As he searches for Trochenbrod, it is clear that his companions, especially the old ones, have no idea where he is going. At this point, the film becomes a road movie, as three characters ride on the country's back roads become more familiar with themselves. When the trio finally reaches the sunflower field with the house, it means they really got to the right place. Some places are a clear reminder of past conflicts. An older woman living in an isolated place is a missing story story. She is able to put things in the right view. But here's where the story changes his emphasis from Jonathan, who apparently came to the land of his ancestors, to the old man. We look at how this older man remembers things about himself. This in turn changes the film's dynamics when we find out how Jonathan and his guides have been constantly connected. Some criticisms on this site have expressed views on the accuracy of the story that, after all, is the work of fiction and freedom. It would be impossible to make another film, including as much as is contained in the book. A great way to divide a movie into different chapters is a clever way to let the viewer know what they're going to see. Mr. Wood is one of the best performances in every movie with his main character interpretation. The good cast of Eugen Hutz as Alex, a Ukrainian assistant and translator, seems to be in heaven. Mr. Hutz is about the best in the movie. His mysterious use of English gives the film a funny angle that will please the viewer. Boris Leskin as Alex's grandfather and cruiser driver is a valuable contribution to the film, as is Laryssa Lauret, who is seen in the last part of the film. <br /> <br /> The outstanding cinematography of Matthew Libatique Brings the splendor of the Czech countryside in all its grandeur. Paul Cantelon's musical score is heard in the background, which enchants the film in a way that adds wealth to the film. First of all, it is a triumph for director Lieva Schreiber, who will be performing at the festival for the first time. they certainly go far into what they decide to do next.
