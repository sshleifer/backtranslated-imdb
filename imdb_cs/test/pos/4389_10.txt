They loved him and turned him into a horny toad! God, that gets me every time. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. The memorial lines, from "Thank God your mother died of childbirth; she'da saw ya she'du died of shame" to "I don't understand Big Dan." Great scenes, from the introductory scene of the train (laughing so hard that I cried) to bluegrass. Watch it. It's good, it's great, it's funny and it's based on a famous story. Worth it, trust me. Do not look at it if you have a weak bladder.
