Let's be righteous: there are no script writing rules, so I won't say that the film should be something other than it. I just give my opinion. OK, I really liked the script, the way things are said and the characters are introduced. However, I think that when the game is adapted to the silver screen, it could try and fit into other media. Since this film was directed by João Falcão, the same man who drove the game is not too surprised that the film was a bit theatrical. It's the man's first movie for cryin 'out-loud! I say there are parts in the film - just like the city of Nordestina, which is somewhat similar to the set of "Dia de Maria" - it's a feeling we're not in the movies. We're in the theater! The lines are spoken too formally, the characters move choreographically, and the lightening is clearly meant for the stage. Sure, maybe it was the intention, but it was done. On the stage. Wonderful things have been done when editing the game into a movie - for example, the beautiful "Closer". But when I went to see this one, I didn't feel like watching a movie. But overall it was good to watch. It's a nice love story, fun sometimes and sad with others. My vote is 7.
