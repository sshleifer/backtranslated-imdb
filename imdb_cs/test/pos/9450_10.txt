Well, I'm not a film critic or something. But I have my opinion on this movie. I think the best in this movie was Amanda Bynes, she played her role for my look very well, I watched many of her movies, this one I liked the most when you watch this movie , you can just relax, come down and watch him. You don't have to try to search for subtext or something like that. The movie is really great. Maybe I liked the actress, maybe for all the scenery, but I liked it. The whole atmosphere that was created. In one moment I felt like I was at that university, in that room. did win an Oscar, it is just a nice movie to watch in your spare time.
