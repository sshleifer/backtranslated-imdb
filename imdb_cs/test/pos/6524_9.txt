Fans of apocalyptic films will enjoy this well-made, low-budget thriller, which is basically a remake of the classic film George Pal "When the Worlds Collide". The comet is heading for an almost collision with the country, and when his fellow scientists overlook his warnings of destruction, eccentric scientist Peter Crawford (Dennis Hopper) gathers a group of private investors to secretly build an underground shrine. The story unfolds through the eyes of veteran Yak Lowe (Peter Onorati), a Gulf war-bound war veteran who unintentionally exposes Crawford's hidden shrine and then decides that Crawford is bad when he left his project hidden before the rest of mankind. As the comet approaches, the topic of who should live and who should die makes an interesting drama. While special effects aren't in the same league, I enjoyed the story more than Spielberg's World War, because I feel that this scenario is better. There is a need for some suspension of scientific reality, but it is worth creating a good story. I highly recommend this movie to fans of this genre.
