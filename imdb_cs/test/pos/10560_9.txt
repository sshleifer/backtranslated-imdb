I've never read Sarah Water's book. Although I didn't read the book, the 3-hour movie is very interesting. It starts with an interesting story with a twisted end. I have to say these two actresses are amazing. Sally Hawkins is overwhelming, successfully portraying a character in love with her mistress and betraying her love. Their romance slowly blooms when they spend more time together. The loving scene is very tender and emotional. The end is quite interesting and these two ended up blessing together after they were all. Overall, it's a great movie, a very interesting plot with great performances.
