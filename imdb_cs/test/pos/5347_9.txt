Imaginative, fast, satirical! Americans do "zany," but the British do "funny" - and they love to laugh at each other (chaos: uninteresting teeth, big lips / nose, "science" or "science" snobby, "gahden" obsession). Inside jokes for older people in the audience, lots of action for kiddies. Gentle use of equipment from other classic films (watch "Back to the Future", "Indiana Jones", "Harvey", "Tremors", etc.). Also, a handy 'mate' movie (Gromit is a silent but resourceful sidekick). Add the great work of Bonham-Carter and Fiennes (is that true? The best acting in animation these days?) - Enjoy! I saw it with grandchildren. fun time for everyone. - canuckteach
