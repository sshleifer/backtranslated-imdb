Jim Henson always seemed to broadcast beautiful TV shows. Unfortunately, this was one of the shortest. It was nice to hear every story with their wonderful morals. Each episode was a new story with new characters. John Hurt did a great job at Storyteller and Brian Henson's sarcastic tone as the dog was always nice. <br /> <br /> The set of designs and costumes was very good. Muppet's work, if required, is the classic work of Jim Henson. You know it's Muppet, but it's more cute than forgiveness. You will be captivated and forced. When each episode is over, you realize that you were quite entertaining. Fun that meets, not the kind that wears out after a few moments. You sit down and think about every episode, realize that every story is really timeless and a strong story of morality. that's more than family fun. I urge you to find it on the DVD and grab it. If you can't do it, then you will surely find it.
