Quite well, don't expect anything that high culture ....... Acting is wrong, the story fails, but it's still a pretty nice movie to watch. why? because it is dark, a little silly, unpredictable and fun and entertaining. Don't expect anything, as I said, just look at yourself and you know what I mean. it's a movie without a plot or unforgettable gameplay, but there are enough scenes to make you laugh, cry, or at least feel compelled to watch it till the end ... <br /> <br /> that's all I wanted to say ... <br/> <br /> 7/10
