This film has some of the best dialogues ever written. The really good lines are given to George C. Scott, the man who knew what to do with the juicy piece of dialogue. I've seen this film again, for the first time in 20 years, and dialogue is as good as ever. Bizarre hospital events are so imaginative that they dazzle you. Often it is such an amazing poetic justice to approach the beats of genius. I love this movie !!
