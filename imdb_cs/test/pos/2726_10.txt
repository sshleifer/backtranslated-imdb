Once in a while you come across a film that forces people to rethink society's response to people who differ from their definition of normal. Mitthi, who suffered in the hands of non-social elements, let himself cope with her tragedy, retreats to his idyllic world .... one that, according to her, is the real world ... Surreal (Mitthi's World) overlaps with the real (her family). Mitthi, suffering from schizophrenia, forces us to reconsider our priorities for trying to rehabilitate "patients" like them. Are we right to drag them back to our reality when we have to offer them pain and suffering? What is our right to get rid of their source of happiness? What is our right to distract them when we cannot help them in their grief? 15 Park Avenue is one of the best films on social issues ... showing us that every patient needs empathy and not simple compassion.
