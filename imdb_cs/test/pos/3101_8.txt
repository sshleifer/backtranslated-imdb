Another adventure of Ma and Pa Kettle almost lifts up where Egg and I left. A new writing and director team is introduced for the first Kettles solo adventure. Leonard Goldstein, backing producer for The Egg and I, was the producer of other adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle. With many characters playing the same actors and actresses, MacDonalds' focus on Kettles is doing very well. There is a reference to Ma Beat Birdie Hicks for the first prize at the fair for her blanket, importing the scene in Egg and Me. The cost of money from the quilt competition was to be used to send Tom Kettle to college. In this film Tom returns home as a college graduate. <br /> <br /> Two charts blend in this movie. One of them is the comedy of a simple mountain family that turns into a modern modern house. The second is a light moral play about how the environment affects children when they grow up. The Pa Kettle (Percy Kilbride) wanted free tobacco to enter the competition, and ended up winning the house. His disappointment at not having a free tobacco case is playing a little laugh. When Pa plays with dynamite, the explosion is completely forgotten. Kilbride had never moved in the scene as debris from the explosion broke around him. He played this role to perfection. In his autobiography, Jack Benny mentioned how stunned he was with Percy Kilbride's corpse delivery. Kilbride has taken this comedy device to a high level of perfection. Ma (Marjorie Main) and Pa have moved to a new home with modern conveniences that confuse Ma and Pa almost as much as they help. Ma adapts much faster than Pa. Part of modern conveniences is television, a very new home in 1949. Moving walls, hidden beds and plumbing are used as comic props, but attention is paid to Ma and Pa, never. Props themselves. Tom Kettle (Richard Long) meets Kim Parker (Meg Randall), a magazine writer who feels that hygiene and the environment are essential for children to succeed as adults. Tom is a bright, self-made man who contradicts the theory that success can only come from a pristine environment. This topic is briefly discussed in several scenes but left to retreat. It was the only serious discussion in this otherwise whimsical movie. When we see Kettle moving out of their old house to move to a new house, it would be almost a disaster if it wasn't for the characters to remain true to themselves. Ma was the practical one, just as she was in Egg and I Pa was the water fish that provided the best comedy. He'd never felt at home in the new house, but the real location of a comfortable bed would never interest him.
