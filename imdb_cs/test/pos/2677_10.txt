This show is amazing! I love every episode. Carrie is a spitfire and Doug is a nice and sometimes moron. Arthur, Spence, Danny, Deacon and Carrie's Boss just add a nice ending to the concert, taking all the funny, pissing moments. In one of the seasons, Doug tries to get Carrie drunk because he's nicer when he's drunk. Nice husband? Carrie is not much better off when her boss needs an IPS driver to testify in her little work, Carrie hesitates because she sees Doug as a lance and doesn't want her to be shamed, so hires Doug's friend. . Wife of the Year. But who I believe is the funniest is screaming-on-random Arthur. He's angry and angry. Hey, you'd be, too, if you had to live in the basement, where the mold has a funny smell and makes you dizzy. This show is cheerful, and if you haven't seen it before, you're not alive!
