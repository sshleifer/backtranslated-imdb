It's the best movie I've seen in the last 5 years. It will certainly be in the same row with such masterpieces as Platoon, Apocalypse, Doors, Dog's Heart (Russian film). Indeed, the game of boy and his parents is so good that you can't even say they "play". No, they lived like it was happening. Notice the smile on your cheeks when the main character agrees to take a walk with them. Hate and love in one piece. And the last scene! Really, I'm still under the impression of the movie. It's very difficult, even impossible to combine humor and tragedy, but if you succeed (and Frederikson did), the impact will be twice as strong. I compared it with "ONE FLEWEM OVER CUCKOO'S NEST". I like this movie (even the novel itself is good), but after Frederikson's movie it seems simple. (I noticed the same difference when I watched "American History X" and "ROMPER STOMPER" - the latter is deeper). So Milos Forman just showed a material look at the problem. You look at it, then you say Yes, it's a good movie, I like it, I don't like it, and that's it. But "angels" allow you to think. There are no bad and good boys in the movie. Because each of them has the right to behave as they do. As a friend of one of the patients. Of course, she is young and pregnant, and it is a problem for her that his husband is in the clinic, but the President's feelings and emotional experiences are even stronger (the result is his suicide). Why ask him what he did? Aren't you crazy to ask? Why don't you support him, help him, understand him? Finally, it's even funny when people talk. They call brilliant things! There are many things I would like to say about this movie, but I'm not that good in English. But I'm sure those of you watching the movie understand me. Good luck! <br /> <br />
