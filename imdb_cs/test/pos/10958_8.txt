Seven months after the face was unveiled, I finally found a rentable DVD copy of the first Cassavetes feature. Shadows, shot in a Manhattan line and on his ad hoc set, was the culmination of months of improvisation rehearsals in which (mostly amateur) actors developed ties, invented their characters, and polished their techniques to give them the right tenor spontaneous familiarity. This intimate approach has led to some incredibly daring work in the Faces, ie Seymour Cassel pulled his hands to Lynn Carlin's throat in an attempt to revive her overdose - just as the actors' total conviction here brings proud sincere moments like Lelia and Tony's postcoital evaluation of their relationship and Ben's resistance touching a black woman as a manifestation of his racial confusion and self-determination. Domestic production in the best sense, out-of-synchronous dubbing and sound recording, and granular cinematography and up-close camera setups, to build an immersive atmosphere that perfectly fits Cassavetes' nuced vision of human relationships as a continual ongoing work, marked by desperate emotional swings and proficient attempts at communication and understanding. Charles Mingus' largely improvised jazz score is an ideal complement to the film's vision of living in the moment, the mantra Cassavetes worked and seemingly lived.
