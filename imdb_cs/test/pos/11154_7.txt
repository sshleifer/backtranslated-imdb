Like many stars on the big screen, as their career collapsed, so many people turned to television where they probably secured a reputation for offspring. Donna Reed is an example. I don't think Donna Reed ever thought Donna Stone was anything demanding, not a woman who won an Oscar for playing a very different type. for eternity. She was certainly better prepared to play Donna Stone's wife, mother and granddaughter after playing Mary Bailey in The A Wonderful Life. Donna was always beautiful and wise and always beneficial with the problems of her children and her husband. Carl Betz wasn't an idiot, he was a pediatrician who had his office attached to the house. Talk about the man being ready for the crisis. Although it was Donna Reed Show because it was Donna's husband at the time, Tony Owen made it. But it took as long as it was due to the popularity of both children, Shelley Fabares and Paul Petersen. Fabares had the best-selling teenage record, Johnny Angel, at the show. She successfully accomplished the transition to an adult star, best known for her coaching role as Craig T. Nelson's wife. But Petersen was a teen chewing idol. Donna Reed Show dares to say that most of his viewers are for him. She forgot it now, but Petersen also had the best selling record, My Dad. I didn't make half or Johnny Angel. Now Paul Petersen runs a support group for former child stars like himself. So many end up so tragically, it's a good job he does. Stone Family was the quintessence of Central America. They lived in the suburbs near Chicago, leading healthy lives. Mom and Dad were always there for the kids. The problems they usually had were nothing but a violation of the curfew. It is this series that I believe is the model of the TV city of Pleasantville, where Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are sucked. I have pleasant memories of The Donna Reed Show. Easy, but not too serious.
