It is clear in Truffaut's interview with Hitchcock that Big Al's fear of the police goes back to his childhood. His father sent him to the police station with a note. Note: "He was naughty, imprisoned him for an hour." Police officers were required, and since Hitchcock was deeply afraid of being accused and taken by the police. "Aliens on the Train" is probably one of the best in its "badly accused" series. The film is based on Patricia Highsmith's novel. This is the same author who wrote the Ripley series. She has always been fascinated by clever criminals. Hitchcock's opening is very strong and will immediately lead you to the protagonists: Guy Haines, famous tennis player and Bruno Anthony, an aspiring criminal. Two boys share a chemistry that was probably much more than what the viewers could chew on that day and age. Bruno tries to convince Guy that they could commit a perfect murder (without getting to the clues) if they change the victims. Bruno kills Guy's wife, who wouldn't give him a divorce, and Guy would kill Bruno's father. Motives are love and money. Bruno's performance is supposed to be seductive and homoerotic. This is not something that happened by chance. In fact, Hitchcock edited two versions of the film: one US, one UK. In the American version, the volume of Brun's seductiveness has been quite a bit reduced. "Strangers on the Train" is a very deep movie, but more importantly, it's another excellent thriller Hitchcock. An excellent example of a thrilling scene is when Guy climbs up the steps to Bruno's father's room. Hitchcock concluded that the audience's attention had to be dispelled at this point in order to find out what Guy would find in the room. Hitch treats us to a huge, menacing dog at the top of the stairs that provided the necessary distraction. <br /> <br /> The most famous film in the film will come during a tennis match. Bruno constantly watched the guy make Guy finish his deal (kill his father). When Guy looks at the audience, all the heads turn back and forth. All but one - Bruno. He looks straight at the guy with a smile of "i'll-get-you". The end is another example of tension. Both men are fighting for one key piece of evidence on a merry-go-round that is turning at a crazy speed. The worker crawls beneath him to get to the controls. When we finally get out of this ride and the film ends with Guy, who proves his innocence, we are exhausted and nail free (for those of us who still bite your nails!) one of Hitchcock's best "wrongly accused" films, some also attribute it to one of the best villains (Bruno).
