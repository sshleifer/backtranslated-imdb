Growing up as a child from movies, one of the trilogies I won't forget is the Karate Kid. You can give Ralph / Daniel everything you want, but his message behind movies that are important, its important to be respectful to all the big and small creatures, but to stand up to each other when time calls for it. Returning to film at hand, it's a bit funny because I saw Boys Don't Cry and was really impressed by Hillary Swank's performance, and when I flipped the sea of ​​channels at night, I came across this movie. the movie and I didn't realize at the time of my first watching this movie that it was in it. The story is centered around Julie, just like Daniel, they don't know where he can fit, or if he wants to fit into it, and the teacher is brought to help her cope and guide her. I really liked this addition to the series, as it gave a good feminine side to the story and yes, even some of the clothes that Hillary were in me, we'll say stimulated. <br /> <br /> Overall 3.5 out of 5
