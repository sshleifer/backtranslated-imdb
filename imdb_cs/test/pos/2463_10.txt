One of my wishes is to be a filmmaker and I just have to say that in no way will I be able to compete with the powerful drama War at Home. The reason is that acting is perfect, and when you see a movie, you'll know what I'm talking about. All I can suggest is watch it, get into it and it was very impressed. Estevez and Sheen's relationship on the screen was absolutely amazing. Relationship with Mother (Kathy Bates). Some of the best scenes are: <br /> <br /> Just like the relationship between Sheen and his daughter, Estevez's sister in the film. <br /> <br /> 10/10, and certainly in my top 10. I want a DVD!
