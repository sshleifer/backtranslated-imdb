The Ator series is a shining example of what B-films should be. They will not succeed in all aspects, but in such a way that they are funny than sad. "Ator l'invincibile 2" aka "The Blade Master" aka "Cave Dwellers" shows us European favorite clone Conan, Ator, where we left him in the first movie - after showing us the lengthy recap of all the first movie events. This time the world must be saved from "The Nucleus", a kind of bomb that is displayed on the screen as a bright light (I think they couldn't afford it). He presents invisible invaders and samurai. As with the first movie, a lot of stop tracks are used (including one quite obvious piece from "Star Wars"). Thoroughly ridiculous and unforgettable bad - this is an exceptional B-movie.
