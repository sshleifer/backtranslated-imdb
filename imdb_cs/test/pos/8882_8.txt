This movie is basically a spoof on Hitchcock's Strangers on the train that I thought was overestimated as well. Danny Devito's story will be seen by Strangers, and then he thinks Billy Crystal wants them to exchange murders, murdering his mother and Devito to murder his wife. Both Devito and Crystal are great, as is Devito's mother. This is Devito's directorial debut and it's better than the Rose War.
