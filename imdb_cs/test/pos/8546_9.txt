Anthony Quinn is a master in capturing our heart and sympathy. She portrays a Romanian peasant with a below average IQ, bothered by his wife to do more. It is World War II and the Nazis took over his country. He soon discovers that he is digging trenches that he hopes to enjoy in his wife's eyes. The Nazis have different ideas. Over the next few years, we are watching events that unfold through his naive eyes, but all he wants to do is go home. His manipulation and bad luck get him into another hot water. Finally, without his own guilt, we see his painting on the cover of "Der Spiegel" as a perfect Aryan. The war is over and allies have brought him to justice for war crimes. But all our peasants want to return home to their wife.
