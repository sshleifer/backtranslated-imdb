From the point of view of making films that are not offensive to people with strong moral values, it's definitely worth it. This is Bruce Willis' second film in a row that tells his story without nudity, colorless humor, profanity, or gratuitous violence. (Of course I refer to Sixth Sense.) Both films deal with more than one level. This one is also suitable for children, although, as others have pointed out, it is not a children's film. I bothered that the time travel device that drives this land is never explained, except we know that Russell himself initiates it as a 70-year-old. Also, why must his dying mother come to school to win him when he wins the fight; Why, when his older I says he has to fight this guy over and over for the next few years, his mother doesn't have to come and get him every time and why he doesn't learn to kick his ass in the process. I also found that the score is somewhat unpleasant and not always suitable for action on stage. <br /> <br /> Good use of the red plane as a metaphor.
