When the circus arrives in town and places the lion cage directly over Bugs Bunny's home, Bugs ends up within range directly between angry and fearless. Despite the title of "Acrobatty Bunny", it's just at the end when Bugs and Lion perform acrobatics. But even that makes it quite funny what Bugs does to escape; somehow he always manages to use the weakness of the other character against him and then pull out any suitable object from the air! Bugs later ended up in a circus in the "Big Bunny". I liked it better because this one got some drugs down by giving the antagonist an East European accent (I know it was during the Cold War, but still). I recommend this. And with the end, we can confirm that it will never be Aloha Oe for this cartoon.
