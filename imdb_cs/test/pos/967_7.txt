Big Fat Liar is a pretty funny movie. But as I watched, I was thinking about something. Some of the events in this movie are incredible. So really, the movie is a big fat lie. There is no way that all this could get away. Here are all the incredible things. 1. When he fell, his father choked on a meatball and behaved like a father. Jason (Frankie Munez) couldn't get it. Well, fortunately not for us. So it didn't, blatant. 2.How if grandmother were blind, she would still find out she wasn't her granddaughter. 3. They couldn't get on the plane, fly to LA, act as if they were coat merchants, sneak into the studio and then, and then ... Well, some movie is a bit unbelievable. But he won't hurt you to tell a little white lie. Trust me, I'm doing it all the time. Big fat liar, though sometimes incredible, is fun. It's also very fun. But before I go on with this review, I will just say one thing. If Paul Giamatti wasn't in this movie, it would really suck. It would be terrible. Big fat liar is also quite funny, though occasionally. I give him thumbs up. Big Fat Liar: *** / ****
