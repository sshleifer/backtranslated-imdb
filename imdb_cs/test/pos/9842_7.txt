One of those social dramas that WB knew how to put together and guaranteed boxoffice hits in the 1930s. This early "dead end children" are sent to a reform school where they are mistreated. Cagney, a gangster as part of the business, is appointed school commissioner. At first it doesn't take it seriously, but it changes and makes the necessary changes to improve boys' lives. The goal is to let the boy rule and manage his community. Whether it is a healthy social reform, it is beyond my faith, but it is a film. It's a lot like Boys Town with a slight darker tone. The useless happy ending will carry what turned out on the scene before, but it's still good. WB would later do this same movies with Bogart in Cagney / Father's Role.
