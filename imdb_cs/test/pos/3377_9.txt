I wanted to watch it to see the show. It told the story more about Robin Williams, then Mork and Mindy. Yet he thought it was great. We have to see, Robin is always "on", no matter what. Diamontopolous was amazing. The main players' performances seem so real to me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was amazing. He was so charming about it, which helped me through all Williams' energies. Little backstage of his other shows (Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley) were instructive. I also thought Richmond-Peck's Harvey was a nice rock in the pond. (That's a good thing). This film told the age-old story of Hollywood people, going through the ups and downs of glory. He kept me sticking to my TV, and I learned to love Robin, well, hell, most of the times, they all seem to be great people I think Hollywood is. Go picture. Sometimes I wonder why people in the network always play idiots. We've never seen ABC's head. He had just heard him, like Charlie of Charlie Angels (wondering if he was planning that?). It seems so sad that the show on number 1 could be destroyed by their own network. I think this story could be told about the life of someone climbing the ladder of any job. Film and TV stars are always loved or hated by so many people that you grew up with, want to get back to the past, remember your own past. I remember watching the show, and I always wondered what was going on in their personal lives. Mork and Mindy will always be part of me and I'll see their part. It may not be true, but it's not even a lie, but in the end he told me an amazing sad, happy story.
