Anne (Natalie Portman) tells us how much she hates her mother, Adele (Susane Sarandon). So the movie starts. Adele decided that she and her daughter were moving to California without asking anyone and leaving their husband without any reason. A story about the relationship between mother and daughter. Thanks to the great work of the actresses, it is really deep and moving. Natalie was nominated for the Golden Globe for this role. She is one of the most talented actresses I've ever seen and Sarandon. They really look like a daughter daughter. The soundtrack is also great. The movie is incredible. * 10 of 10 *
