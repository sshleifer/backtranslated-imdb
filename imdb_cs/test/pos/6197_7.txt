If you look at this series, you will get interesting 10 chapters about the story of the sleeping cell and each character. And more intense with the FBI infiltrate. Nice story, nice characters and performance, but something is wrong (of course for me). The final is bad. You are expecting ten chapters hoping for a great final (no matter if they meet their goals or not) but ... well ... I don't think that's enough. It's a small final for a big series. I also hoped for further definitions about the characters' stories. But again, it's an interesting miniseries. If you don't want to wait with big series (22-24 chapters), watch it. I give 7 out of 10.
