I'm addicted to TV shows, live shows and everything they do. And that was the last piece of work they did on television / film as "Gentlemen's League". <br /> <br /> If you love the show, you'll love the movie. It's a nice end to their TV series. It's smart and funny. While not focusing on some of the most popular characters, it's still great to see all the characters along with the writers. And he has to see every league of fans. Watch it!
