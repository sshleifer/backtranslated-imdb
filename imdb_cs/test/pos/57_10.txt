I gave this movie to my rare 10 stars. When I first started watching him and realized it wasn't a movie with a strong plot line, I almost turned it off. I'm very glad I didn't. It's a character-driven movie, a real story that revolves around Rachel's "Nanny" Crosba, strong, beautiful (inside and outside) Black Woman and how she touched the lives of so much in the Lackawanna community. Very interesting are not only her strong characteristics of Nanny and the people who lived in her guesthouse, but it also gives us a look at what life and community were for the Americans in the 1950s, before integration, and the good and bad sides of segregation and how it ultimately affected and changed the black community. In addition to the excellent performances of all cast members, there is some gentle singing and dancing ever since.
