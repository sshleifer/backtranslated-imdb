Rock Star is a "nice" movie. They're all nice. Even the guys who aren't supposed to be nice are really nice. Chris is a nice guy who learns about life. She returns to her girlfriend Emily, who is also pretty. It's a good movie, despite all the good. Maybe I'm just used to all the X Gen. music anxiety. In some ways, the movie was a caricature of rock stars and wasn't that hard it could be believable. Playing Mark Wahlberg is pretty good. Jennifer Aniston played her role well but was uncomplicated. She was a nice girl. <br /> <br /> Take a look. If you've ever been to a rock concert or seen Spinal Tap, go check it out.
