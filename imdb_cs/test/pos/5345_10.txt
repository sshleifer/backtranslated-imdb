Who can ask for more? I admit that I married two and four years old children. But it's worth it. They were fascinated by the loan loan, with their parents beside them. I took the kids to movies before with mixed results: too scary, too boring, too sophisticated, anything. With this movie, however, I was glad to see a clever movie with wit, style and passion from the screen. Any movie that takes 5 (!) Years of production to be good or bad deserves some respect for bravery and patience that needs to be done like this. <br /> <br /> O.K. I jumped a little. And again, why can't I get excited? Looking through the film footage, it just reminded me today of the poor quality of distributed movies. At least at the moment, the W&G film is well made. Perhaps the originality was not the most inspiring, however, well said and walked well. Too much humor for adults? Too many sex links? Maybe. Although my children didn't catch them. Too young. So in my case, I didn't notice. Well, no need to say I liked it.
