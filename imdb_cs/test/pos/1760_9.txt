The excellent book by Leslie Carbaga on Fleishers tells the whole story of the big move of their entire animation unit to Florida and their subsequent sacking by Paramount. Mr. Bug Goes to Town did not destroy Paramount's pioneer animation credit, although this is often said, and this was his favorite version. According to Carbaga, a large studio, more than anything else, wanted to get their gloves in the animation studio and get rid of the great quarreling brothers in the picture. Mr. Bug gave them an excuse to do it. - Sad closing of a big unpredictable, innovative chapter in American animation. I also wanted to comment that the film actually made its debut on December 4, 1941, not December 7th. enough to do the trick, as well as when it comes to the national mood damaging the success of the film. Another part of the legend of this troubled little movie is that he was killed by having bad luck in theaters at the same time that Dumbo (released October 23, 1941) was still making a very fast feast. I did not survey the numbers at the box office, but I would say that the current presence of Dumbo in the theaters had an impact on Mr. Bug. Film-go was all the time high in this period, and successful films could go strong in the moon theaters. - Something unimaginable in these typically short, fast DVD days.
