My friends and I saw it at the San Diego festival. It was great. Stormy is a strong black woman and Nana reminds me of my grandmother. Rene is FINE !!! Seeing him take off his clothes was definitely worth the acceptance. Can someone send me their contact information? <br /> <br /> My friend thinks Flex is the best of two. He's a Flex fan for years, so she might be a little biased. The cousins ​​were funny and just as Nana described them. LOL. I look forward to returning to the theaters.
