After the successful success of MY NAME is BARBRA, CBS television allowed Barbara to create an even more complicated sequel as her second special. Streisand wisely knew that in order to follow the breakthrough success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, her second special would indeed have to lift the bar even further in ingenuity and spectacle. No wonder she succeeded again. Even more so, Streisand managed to build this great production without sacrificing the intimacy and vision of MY NAME, BARBRA. Again, special is divided into three distinct laws. Filming on-site at the Bergdorf Goodman department store was so successful in the first special that Streisand and the company decided to shoot again for the first act of this second special. Ruled-on location this time was the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which would allow endless chances for Barbra to "enter" various works of art that would match with the songs being performed. In addition to the numerous artistic possibilities that this site has made possible, the museum would offer the ideal opportunity to use color shooting. <br /> <br /> After recording "Draw Me and Circle", which is set against the opening credits, Barbra then dashes past the museum's maid costume on Kern and Harbach's tribes is "Yesterday." He ceases to admire various paintings and sculptures, often becoming a figure depicted and singing a theme song. Streisand performs a bittersweet rendition of Hammerstein and Romberg's "One Kiss," as Thomas Eakin's CONCERT SINGER brings the hilariously camped performance of Chopin's "Minute Waltz" as Marie Antoinette, which includes the abstract art with Peter Matz's "Gotta Move" frenetic rhythm and performs a rough rendition of "Non C 'est Rien' as upset girl Modigliani. The highlight of Law I, however, is when Streisand compares profiles with the bust of Queen Nefertiti's Egyptian sculpture, while Rogers and Hart sing "Where or When". The Act II circus mix allows Streisand to communicate with various farm and circus animals, while singing various songs with farms / circus / animal themes. These include Barbra singing "Wine Thine That Special Face" to an elephant who acted as "Sergeant I put on that face" as a serenade to a piglet, camp "Sam, you made pants in long" sung a group of baby penguins, and Barbra comparing profiles with an anteater when she went "We have so much in common." Streisand also swings on the horizontal bar and jumps from the trampoline to the chorus "Spring Again," and then slows things down by performing a haunted version of "I stayed too long at the fair" while sitting alone on stage. Barbra also gets a chance to show off her pet poodle Sadie in this segment, and even speak a little French. Act III is again the highlight of the hour. Dressed in slender white woolen dresses, the concert segment is performed on a uniquely designed stage with a partial staircase that goes nowhere. Streisand opens the act with the hearty release of Harold Arlen's "Wherever I Hang My Hat Is Home," before launching into the hearty versions of the well-known standard "It Must Be You" and rarely-heard "C'est Si Bon (That's So Good)" "Streisand then stuns the audience with an amazingly strong, octave-hovering performance of the Sweet Charity ballad" Where am I, "from which Streisand delivers a definitive rendition. Streisand will also introduce the newly-written Richard Maltby, Jr.-David Shire Ballad" Starting Here, Starting Now ", which includes a passionate singing Streisand, which is among the best vocal performances of its long career. More than anything, Color Me Barbra was a showcase for the ever-increasing, megawatt star power of Streisand. the presence of even more visually dazzling, Streisand is always the main attraction, and her voice was as beautiful as ever, and this special was the first Like MY NAME is BARBRA, COLOR ME BARBRA was another rating-smash and spawned another Top-Five, a Gold-selling soundtrack album. Simply put, COLOR ME BARBRA defies tradition and appears as a sequel that is almost on the same level as the classic.
