I thought this movie was really good. Eventually, it finally shows viewers that Leila should keep what she has. Leila was sick of her husband Jim, who was more worried about the job. He was so in his work that he forgot his anniversary. He was also very sloppy. She couldn't take it anymore, so she left to see if she was missing. The film shows that she is missing, even trying to eradicate the night he has spoiled. She goes to her and tries to bring her home. Finally he finds another man named Schuyler. He seemed to be the man who always wanted to be elegant and noticed. Finally, sorta predicts when he looks at Schuylers shoes and how he let his cigar ashes fall to the ground as Jim did the same. They end up doing a lot of money and cleaning up. Leila finally thinks she should keep her husband because that's all she really wanted and he changed.
