For all intents and purposes, 'Teen Devian' may seem like another lightweight Bollywood musical. To some extent this could be true, especially since manufacturers had to be sure that the film succeeded with the masses. But somewhere behind the scenes, either Sadashiv Brahmam (who had the 'idea' for this story) or Amerjeet (who directed the film) decided that there would be a twist to the usual formula, and perhaps succeeded beyond their own expectations. Br /> <br /> It's not just a handsome man who flirts with three women undecided about who to choose as his life partner. Dev Anand's character was in love with each of the 3 women at different times, and they with him, although they were aware of the other two. Deva Ananda's relationship with Simi and Kalpana is particularly interesting - in that every woman relies heavily on it. There is a lot of suggestive examples in the body language that fit the imagination depending on the viewer's maturity. The theme is surprisingly adult and after all that it was ashame, the end was tame, apparently designed to please the masses and avert criticism.
