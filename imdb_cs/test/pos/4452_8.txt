I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development. Fulci was a master in creating a terrible atmosphere using camera work, live cinematography and yes - a wonderfully explicit gore. This film is no exception to its later films (The Beyond, Zombie 2), The City of the Living Dead, House at the Cemetery, etc.) The characters are very well developed here and the emphasis is on the supernatural And there is more about the tension created by the classic, which is among the lush hills of Italy. The scenery is in moments reminiscent of precious folklore, and then immediately contrasted with the mud and blood-soaked terror shrouded in crumbling ruins. Gore is not so prevalent in this film and seems to be limited compared to Fulci's later movies, but splash and giallo fans will most likely be saturated with several detailed shots and the last 5 minutes of the movie. > <br /> A totally fantastic and mature film by one of our great Italian horror directors.
