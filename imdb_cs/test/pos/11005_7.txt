I think Gerard's notes to the doctor were hitting the nail on his head. Interesting movie, but very long. It's definitely the opposite of a new school of flashy, sexy, Moore-style documents. There is no narrator, no facts or side information, and no other tricks. What you see is what you get - a look into the disappearing world of Tibetans. As a huge fan of doc, I was surprised how much I lost my attention with this film, due to the length and lack of dialogue. But in the end I would recommend it if it is interesting. It is beautifully shot, informative and represents a valuable (and final) window to the way of life of Tibetan solitaires (and women :) - all important attributes of good doc. But have a big cup of coffee, it will help.
