I've never seen a movie that has a worse release than this. And that's a shame because it's the funniest movie of the year! You would think that the line item ad "From Office Space Director" would be enough to be a big version! However, there are no ads, no posters, no websites, I doubt the stars even knew that this weekend was coming out. What is 20th Century Fox Thinking? Mike Judge's Sci-Fi comedy is set in 2505, but it could come in about 10 years (if things continue as they are.) Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph get frozen in top secret military experiment and wake up in the future full of zombie consumers inbred retarded. The film reminds me of Woody Allen "Sleeper", "RoboCop", "Planet of the Apes", "Blade Runner" and "Network" and the late Big "Futurama". Try to see it before Fox burns all the prints!
