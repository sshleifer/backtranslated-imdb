Apparently Se7en was inspired and sometimes even more horrible; More bloodshed and very graphic details (a little too much for my taste). Great screenplay and play (Ken Stott was especially impressed with me and there were no weaknesses in the series). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen since years. Although it was scheduled on the BBC in three parts I watched the Messiah on the video in one take. One point of criticism; the villain's motivation was not very convincing.
