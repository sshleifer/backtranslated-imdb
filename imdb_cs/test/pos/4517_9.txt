Amazing, stunning, brilliant, excellent. These are the four adjectives that appear in the head when I begin to describe "The Kite Runner". Khaled Hosseini's book of adaptation has already captured many minds, in fact it is said that he himself fell into tears after watching the premiere. I have to say that before I start, I read the book before I saw the advanced screening of "The Kite Runner". So my judgment and opinions can be slightly distorted. First of all, let me say that although, in my opinion, the book was better than the end product of the film, it is by no means a bad adaptation. I mean a two-hour film that has a well-deserved answer. Things seem to be very fast in the past twenty minutes, but in addition to what the book did. It has captured the mind and imagination of millions of people around the world. The spell woven by Chaled Hosseini to give us a regret of joy, sadness, pain, loyalty is amazing in this adaptation. Especially on the first scene, when young Hassan says, "If you tell me to eat dirt, I'll be. But I know you won't ask me." Such a moving line is bound to capture the hearts of many. Two young actors were brilliant, absolutely excellent. Especially the boy who played the innocent but loyal Hassan, the boy who refuses to give up the dragon he caught because he promised his best friend to bring it to him only to be exploited by the great chicane who beat him and used it sexually, and then he was rebuked by his best friend as a coward. The whole act is so touching that it can't, but wet eyes. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is well placed to save the last bit. When Amir learns of his true relationship with Hassan and reads Hassan's first and does not hold it when he falls into tears that are helpless, lonely and remorseful, it seems a little hasty and he felt Amir standing behind the facade. In this book, Khaled Hosseini dedicated about 10-12 pages to describe Amir's mind in this position. But what he invented in the penultimate segment of the movie when Amir stands behind Hassan's boy, his nephew, Sohrab in front of his commanding father-in-law. The end was deserved and I am sure it will be well appreciated. It witnessed the torch going from generation to generation. <br /> <br /> Switching to technical aspects. First, acting. Just one word-Superb. From beginning to end, young Hassan and Amir, their father, his friend Rahim Khan. Everyone was excellent, especially young Hassan. Second, the direction was amazing, along with some great camera. Also noteworthy was the background score. Right from the start of the credit line until the end of the loan, and I especially loved the one when Amir is in a mosque in Pakistan's Western and Islamic merger, he did that extra special. All in all, that's all Definitely one of the better movies, and this is a welcome break from all those Iran's inspired movies we've been hovering throughout this year. 9/10 !!!
