Attention-possible spoilers ahead ?? .. Just watched 'Joe' a second time. For the first time, it was more than 30 years ago at an air base. It reminded me that the Air Force Air Force with Tech. Sgt. stripes worn by a friend / seller; We are flyers with a pretty laugh for the first time that appeared on the screen because it is a 'lifer' position. Over the years, I've been carrying some more movies. The front was absolutely beautiful and vulnerable daughter of the executive. As someone remarked, you couldn't get out of it. Until now, I didn't realize it was a 20-year-old Susan Sarandon in her first film. What a loss she didn't do more movies when she looked like that. I also remember the irony that the countercultural countertop, like Peter Boyle, plays a major role in the right-hand pistol matrix. It's not unlike George C. Scott playing generals in Dr. Strangel and Patton. And, of course, the shocking ending of a lasting impression. More than 30 years ago it was the most spoken of the movie he had ever played at the base. We thought it was a great movie, and I was reluctant to see it again because I was afraid it would be as disappointing as Easy Rider. But today I watched him go well. It's a very powerful multi-hole scenario, though you have to be interested in a friend who comes out of the bathtub immediately when Sarandon comes into play with him. I have to think it has something to do with perfect physical casting. Boyle was physically believable as Joe (as others pointed out his portrayal would inspire Archie Bunker's character a few years later). Did Ted Knight model his 'Caddyshack' character-judge Smails after advertising manager Dennis Patrick in 'Joe'? They look similar and the like. Patrick was absolutely believable as a powerful manager who was wrapped up in a too high middle class. And Sarandon's innocent eyes with the Ragget Ann doll still evoke all the spectators' protective response - perfect casting. Actually, Nude and drug scenes (they were very provocative for their day) are as explicit as anything that can be found in "Thirteen." The only thing that dates this film is that violence is neither realistic nor graphic. 'Joe' was at the same time as 'The Wild Bunch' and the tone of film violence just started to change. Another reason for this film is that the events over the past few years have brought back the meaning and context of this film. In the film, both types of "conservatives" are depicted as full of fear and hatred of unconventional ways of counterculture; and filled with the envy of their free and hedonistic lifestyle. Counterculture is portrayed as mocking a straight culture; and although they are paranoid toward conservatives (legitimately such that it was only a few months after Kent), they cannot resist their lifestyle in an attempt to antagonize. The political landscape is no more than 30 years later. I'm not sure if the conservatives are envious of young people and liberals until 1970, but they're more afraid of them and hate them more.
