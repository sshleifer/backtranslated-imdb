Haruhi Suzumiya Melancholy is an anime that has left me impressed. Partially for characters, many of whom fall into anime fantasy / sci-fi stereotypes, but placing these stereotypes in a rather secular high school environment is what I appreciated. Then there is a somewhat crazy titular character who is something else: stubborn, almost amoral, a girl with a nonsensical amount of talent and a secret she is not aware of. <br /> <br /> The series setup is a bit of a journey. Essentially, Suzumiya, unknown to herself, is a super-powerful being capable of divine deeds of creation and destruction because it can destroy and rebuild reality into its whim. Our narrator and primary character is Kyon, a college whose Haruhi sympathy / curiosity causes him to drag, against his will, into a club that begins to spice up his life because he is bored with normal life. Looking for adventure, he claims three more unusual members, each with a secret, and they all end up being drawn into her crazy schemes. The beginning is a little crazy but pleasant, philosophical thinking. a debate about whether the world is just Haruhi's creation when bored old and whether our characters exist to serve or serve it, to continue to exist or to exist without it. It's a little conundrum but nice. While sci-fi / fantasy scenarios sometimes appear in the series, I think the joy of the series lies in how normal things are, while this tension remains aware that if things are too boring, Haruhi could destroy the world in hopes which is more interesting. The art is clean and consistent with what I expected from anime that is usually imported to the US; I like the character designs and when there aren't a lot of actions in the series, I think it fits better. The series is narrated from the mind of Kyon and does not play the omniscient narrator, but merely comments on what he knows and feels. He's got a lot in his head, but he doesn't really talk a lot, so it's good to hear that. The voice in the English Oak is acceptable enough, but I prefer the Japanese to act on it. There are some strange aspects in the series, some of which parody and run fanboy-ism that I found fun. In the first season, I have to admit that there is no deadline because the series doesn't really have a bigger story arc, but it seems to take things one by one, so it's an easy series that you can pick up and put aside. , although I think that because of its somewhat fun features it's still hard. It is also based on a series of light novels, and the author was directly involved in writing the series. Although it is based on novels, I still wished that the series had stronger storylines, but I love how naturally we can look at how these characters evolve and how well you are. the series can play in quiet moments and on the craziest ones. When Haruhi grew, it was quite good, as was the observation of relations between the SOS Brigade (Haruhi's Club). It is not for everyone, given his thoughtful assumption and "extraordinary beings" in the secular world ". Probably will not be fancoys who are in action / sci-fi / fantasy, and maybe it would be a little more for players who would like to pursue relationships, but for those who are willing to try something a little different, or They like a weirdly unpredictable series like this, I think that Melancholy Haruhi Suzumiya is a relatively refreshing unique and fun series. More please. 9/10.
