Chris Nolan's labyrinth as a noir about voyeurism and identity is amazing from start to finish. The first movie is as complex as "Memento" or "The Prestige", though maybe a little harder to get. It still smells of originality and creativity, and has a "twist" as intellectually challenging because it is a realistic pulp. Few filmmakers have made their editors a good use and attention to the narration Nolan has. The story is about a bored writer who likes to watch random strangers on the street until he follows someone he has noticed is following him after the others, and followed him in the pond, where complexity and identities are escalating. Even more naturalistic and realistic than Nolan's later work, but as sharp as a razor.
