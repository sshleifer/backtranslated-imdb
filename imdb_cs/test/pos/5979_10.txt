Shepitko is the wife of the Russian filmmaker Elem Klimov, who directed the commercially known 1984 film COME AND SEE, generally regarded as one of the most realistic war films ever, bar zero, remarkable for its poetic intensity of poetics, but I believe he lacks the intrinsic complexity of this even bigger a Russian film that explores not only graphical external horrors, but also truly inspiring images aimed at individuals or small groups of characters that reflect the absolute madness that takes place within these human beings, whose end is simply amazing. Bullets are flying and the bodies die in a shooting battle over the introductory credits where the film's intensity never ceases for the duration, focusing on the gloomy faces worn by soldiers who have nothing to eat, the frightened occupation population, starving children with fossilized mothers, all contained in a vast landscape of endless white snow. Like CRANES ARE FLYING (1957), it represents the Russian army in retreat, a traumatic shock early in the war, when it was almost destroyed. The Russian landscape has been overcome by German Nazis who terrorize citizens, stealing what food they have, forcing them under pressure to become their informative eyes and ears. What Russian soldiers hide under the woods is forced to send food expeditions to neighboring farms. This film follows two soldiers who are on an almost impossible mission from the outset, with little food left in the dead winter. One is healthy and fit, Vladimir Gostyukhin as Rybak, while the other, Boris Plotnikov as Sotnikov, is slowed by a tuberculous cough and finally a bullet in his leg that almost leaves him, but his partner saves him. As they walk through the knee deep snow curtains, they crawl on some points with insufficient protection against cruel elements such as so many other Russian films, nature is becoming their hardest enemy. <br /> <br /> Spoilers !! Everything is limited to the question of survival. When they arrive at their destination, they demolished the farm and left it in a state of rubble, pushing forward to the German occupied territory, where an older Soviet co-worker, who fears Nazi retribution, occupied another farm. Guerrilla soldiers consider him a coward, but go on where they are finally captured and brought to a Nazi camp in a nearby town and held as prisoners, along with a proud and protective mother (Lyudmila Polyakova) who hid them. Tarkovsky's permanent Anatoli Solonitsyn appears to be Portnov, an investigator, a Russian teacher from a nearby academy who turned the Nazi sympathizer. The Russians torturing and executing Russian fellow citizens are the depths of the destruction of war, and Solonitsyn is brilliant in a contemptuous role for which it is perfectly suited. From what we see as Nazi officers chatting jovially in close proximity to each other, an outsider is even among that group, instead seen as a gruesome black-gray business that routinely sends people to their graves. The audience is not spared from the testimony of torture on Sotnikov, who offers nothing but contempt, while Rybak speaks freely, hoping to save his life, but both are condemned to death, although Rybak is offered the opportunity to serve the German empire. police agent. A mother, an older co-worker and a child are added to this group, spending one last night together, where they discuss the merits of the soldier's mission, being a patriot, mother, coward, or co-worker. Everyone seems to be individually driven by the desperate need to survive, but Sotnikov offers himself as a selfless example, attempting to admit his guilt to save others, where the aptly chosen title reflects his spiritual redemption. The next morning, Portnov seems to be slightly amused, laughing at their sudden willingness to speak, but nobody but Rybak, who changes sides to keep his life, rationalizes his thoughts that if he is alive he has at least a chance to escape. But is there no escape from this misery? What happens is shown with excellent subtlety and poetic grace because we are witnessing a betrayal of war without firing a single shot because hanging execution turns into a public show where villagers are forced to testify at the gun site. The pace and harsh intensity of this film is unrelenting, because there is never a moment without a threat, beautifully shot by Vladimir Chukhn (who died in the same car accident as Shepitko), with a perfectly composed landscape and lots of camera movement. it close to the use of portraits, especially that of a wild young boy at the end who eyes the condemned men, who makes a surrealistic connection to the next generation without any words being spoken, highlighted by the psychologically frightening music of Alfred Shnittke which resembles a transcendent, but furiously disturbing monolithic music from Kubrick's 2001 : SPACE ODYSSEY (1968). The sound design of this film is highly advanced and uniquely modern, where the use of off-screen sound constantly exposes the raw nerves of every moment, barking dogs, wind blowing, bullet firing, close Nazi clicks in untranslated German, or sad laughter at their helplessness that bite the nasty tension into crazy heights. In many ways, reminiscent of Dreyer's PASSE OF THE WORLD GARDEN (1928), there is complete insanity, a relentless knowledge that you have no choice but you are still forced to do it. The horrible inner thoughts at the end are expressed without words, where the nobility of the dead speaks loud, where the voices continue to echo in the heads of living beings, such as the blast of endless echoes, but only silently fills the sharp winter air with sad reverence and deep feeling of loss.
