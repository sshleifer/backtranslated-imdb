As one of the best Argento movies I rate OPERA. Render holes and discrepancies? Sure, but I don't think this film is getting worse than many other reviewers. Lots of elements that are in many Argento movies are a bit "out of the wall", but this is part of the drawing of his films ... <br /> <br /> Short Story: The psycho stems of a new opera director lady. Typical Argento spins and turns, leading to a decent top payout. It's not the best Argento, but I pull this from time to time. It is definitely worth seeing if you like his other things - just don't get this mixed with the abysmal divide of PHANTOM OF OPERA that Argento did, he is really awful ...
