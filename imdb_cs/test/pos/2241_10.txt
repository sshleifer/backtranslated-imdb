This is one of the best episodes of Doctor Who EVER. We have cybermans, cyber conversion units (they can scare little kids) and a gross doctor who does one of his best actions. David Tennant Bravo. Good scenes like it was a movie, with thrilling scenes on some streets, an invasion of the Cyberman base and leaving the world different from our, basically a 45-minute film. Being Part 2 Rise would never disappoint. With that big line up to the finals. The doctor plus the evil enemy (Daleks, Cybermen, Master, Sontarans, Davros, Autons, or even Macra) is a battle to death, just watch out for the little kids watching it.
