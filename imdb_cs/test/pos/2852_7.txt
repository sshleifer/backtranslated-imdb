This is the story of a guy who went to see a comedy and it turned out to be a horror movie. The real story of a guy who is infatuated with pictures and got scared when he unexpectedly identified with one of them. The incredible story of GUY, which was more frightening when the female and the hero lied, as was the man-villain. Gosh, is that the life that made us? People fooled about the perfect face that they imagined, how should this face be perfect inside? "This, I think we're not in Kansas anymore".
