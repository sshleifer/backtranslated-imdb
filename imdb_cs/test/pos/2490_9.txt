It is said that this film is or has been banned in the US since its release. Since there is no information about IMDb, I have to rely on my other resources and believe it. If this is really true, the film is even more harmful and scarier, and so is it. The film is called Mockumentary, although I think this topic is too serious. It creates a scenario where America is a military state and all revolutionary objects are immediately arrested without evidence. After a mandatory tribunal, they have to decide whether to go to prison for a few years or to choose a criminal park. In that they must pass through the desert for three days to reach the American flag, he sent 50 miles ahead, while they are followed by the police and army units. The film pretends to be a documentary about these events, watching both tribunals and wilderness hunting filmed by European film crews. All the facts are explained, interviewers ask questions and film everything. People look straight into the camera and yell at her. It seems very, very real. Talking about realism is nonsense. This movie is not about how to make a realistic movie, it's about how such a film would look like if it were real. And it would certainly look like this. If it was shot anyway. In such a utopian state, there would certainly not be a European film crew to film these things. There are many things that scare us. Defendants are people of all social classes. Political leaders, musicians, authors, philosophers, the unemployed, etc., seem to be hopeless, rebellious or afraid. They're not heroes. They talk a lot in the tribunal because they know it doesn't do anything, and yet they said everything they said in speeches and books and songs. One says they are not afraid to die. Is it true? Well, he doesn't have to run across the desert hunted by cops. The defendants have no chance, or at least their only chance, the decision between the prison and the criminal park is not really a chance. The way they finally decide, and the way the film ends, makes it clear that this kind of heroism is suicide. These tribunals remind us of many Tribunals in the Third Reich. Officials use the same kind of idealistic expression, ignoring the defendants' arguments, shouting at them, and then telling them that they should be calm. They warn defendants to "watch their language" and insult them much more. They ask them questions, defendants cannot answer, but they never want it. These scenes are statements about what we call justice. The scenes in the desert are at a different level. When we first see prisoners, we realize that they realize they have no chance. When they see the desert and the mountains, they feel the sun and thirst, they have no idea how these free days should stand. The film crew follows them and talks to them while trying to escape this madness. They argue they should play the game, or escape, or rebellion? All this leads to the same and no one is surprised. Some will ask whether such parks would actually exist in such a state? Why not? It empties prisons and allows the government to punish revolutionaries as they want. It is not a gas chamber, but the Nazis killed Jews before the construction of concentration camps. The comparison is fair because it is not a real difference. The film is scary and depressing. Problems about the sound to be ignored. This is not science-fiction. Talking about poverty, unemployment and crime is not utopian. The film shows us that government and democracy, as presented to us, are not only useless but also dangerous. It also shows us that revolution is definitely not a solution. Defendants seem confused because they don't know how to fight it. They do things, but for nothing. Even if it doesn't give us a solution, it's still a statement. For me, the scariest thing is the fact of banning this movie. Here we have a film that blames the loss of freedom, morality and peace. He blames the government, the fictitious government for being dangerous and inhuman. And such a movie is forbidden. Think about it the next time you see the American flag.
