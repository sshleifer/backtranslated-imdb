You think the police are always right. <br /> <br /> Do you think that "eye witnesses" are always fine. Do you think that prosecutors will not close the case to court if lazy cops failed to conduct 98% of the basic investigation. Do you think the US city could have a "few bad apples" in law enforcement, but that "good cops" will quickly lose those who systematically engage in bad evil in the bud. Do you think the possibility that a former football lineman will be installed as a detective just because his dad is a county sheriff and is allowed to defeat him. confessions "of randomly selected teenagers with absolutely no fear of negative consequences for themselves could happen in America in the 1930s, but not today. <br /> <br /> Do you think a judge will NOT send a case to a jury if someone with a brain in the head can see that the accused is a totally accidental passerby who has been caught by the police because he was hot and didn't want to work that day. <br /> <br /> Do you think that all innocent people imprisoned for six months here or for 20 years are there "Exceptions to the Rule" and injustice like this could NEVER involve your family member, someone in the middle class, or someone like you. You think you are aware of all the terrible, undeniable, 100 % of proven indignation over the past 10 years in America - yet you have not seen this movie.
