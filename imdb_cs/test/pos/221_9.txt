Police Unit! (1982) was a fun show that ended too early. But I think it was before it was too repetitive and rude as many American TV shows. Gejzi for this entertaining show was Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker. Since his direct act in comedy hit AIRPLANE!, Leslie Nielsen has found a new career as a comedian. In this short-term t.v. a series that once again had a chance to play a straight man in a crazy comedy. The bizarre titles of each episode were ending. But Lieutenant Drebrin (Leslie Nielsen) has come into so many strange cases to be seen to be believed. Tooo bad they never made it to D.V.D. If the show had to be reissued, it would have to be this. The whole new generation is waiting for this show! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended!
