I really liked this movie. Everyone has something to be blamed for, everyone is real. No cardboard heroes or cold, omnipotent, knowing characters. I have read many other viewers who have complained about Anne's morality and James that she will keep her love for her, despite being cheated, but I disagree. Anna (Emily Watson) I found absolutely amazing and I felt love for her. She was a heavily suppressed woman, her actions were not planned: as she began to relax, she was confused and made many mistakes. But it's in real life, when you gain freedom, you'll probably make mistakes (especially at the start point). Was she too ungrateful? Maybe. But we must remember that for the first time he runs with his feet. He knows that after all, James is a good man, maybe a little hard, serious and focused; but she also feels the urge to live life like her. <br /> <br /> Does he blame more than he? I think not. But the turnover that takes place in their lives causes some changes. Instead of letting his wife leave his life (as well as the other viewers proposed as a right). choice) bites the bullet and waits, hoping for better. He begins to understand that what is superficially, even if he is in order (his marriage) is in fact a control game he plays on his wife. It is not a story with characters who are too emotional and insecure in nature (ie the usual clich√©s of Latin American or Italian jealousy), it is the story of men and women who use both heart and brain. It can be very painful, but if you love a man (woman) or a man) and if you are not an unstable nature, you will probably forgive his cheating and let him go. Unless you are jealous, prehistoric, criminal-passion-inclined, wealthy and mentally unstable. Really good movie. The last scene where James - despite all that has happened - goes with Anna to the train station is really moving: She is free and understands what freedom means to man. Guido
