Tim Burton, the man behind Batman's original film and Beetlejuice, brings to the world the continuation of Batman, which crosses the original in more than one way. First, Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny De Vito are a great mix of Batman's enemies. The dark, deadly and sexy Catwoman works well to keep the rattle of some head in the story and the penguin working the same way that the joker worked in the original. The sets are stunning and immaculate. Gotham has so many dark alleys that you never know what is happening at once. The only thing that gives him a bad name is his scenario, which sometimes seems extinct and then doesn't recover for a while. Tim Burtons direction will bring superhero movies to a new area. Beats all superman movies and other Batman mile movies. Although in terms of realization a new Batman begins has a bite where this lacks, but Burton is more original director than Nolan.
