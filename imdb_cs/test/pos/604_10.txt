Jim Henson's The Muppet Movie is a charming, witty and brilliant movie that can be watched and enjoyed by adults and children. I feel it's my favorite kid movie because it combines great characters, a great story and a big joke to be irresistible. The plot includes Kermit Frog (puppetry and voiced Henson) in his odyssey across America following his dream in Hollywood. On the way she meets Fozzie Bear, Big Gonzo (my favorite), Miss Piggy, Rolf and DR. Teeth and electric chaos. This movie has so many good things I can't even say. But it is unforgettable and every time I think of a puppet or muppet, I think of this film. Check out the portraits of Mel Brooks, Dom DeLouise, Paul Williams, Madeline Kahn, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen (and Charlie McCarthey), Elliot Gould, Carol Kane and Big Orson Welles. Excellent and magnificent, one of the best films of the 1970s. A ++
