I'm not sure what fascinates me in this movie. It is grainy, poorly written, faded, often absurd, and in many places insensitive to dullness (the person I watched fell twice asleep). And yet there is something in this film that fascinates me, even though I'm not sure what; maybe the figure of Sam, a giant ex-patient who was lobotimized by a former chief physician and who was constantly sucking on icy pop), or an amazingly acting doctor (I forgot her name). Anyway, watch it and create your own opinion; has one of the biggest endings I've seen in the movie.
