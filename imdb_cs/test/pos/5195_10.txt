One of the best war movies I've ever seen, if not the best. It is very difficult to talk about such films because it is very difficult to point out any film mistake. The "problem" is that it looks too realistic to draw you into the wreckage of Stalingrad and cause you to suffer on both sides. This is because, unlike most Hollywood films, this film does not mean war or the heroism of the main characters. Instead, the film makes them heroes just because they are human and thus anti-war as well as the reason they can offer. Extremely convincing war scenes and impressive performances, most scenes look like isolated theater pieces. The German army is also played by the Germans, who are so convincing. The film is produced and realized by the Germans, where you can see their love for details to perfection. That's why "Stalingrad" is one of the movies I can watch a million times and I never feel boring. I watched a movie with my father who fought in World War II, and the first thing he said was: "It's like real, like the war against the Germans". This is where you can see how it seemed to be a soldier in the worst nightmare of war in human history and the turning point of World War II: Stalingrad.
