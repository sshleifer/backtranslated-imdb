Kramer vs. Kramer is a story of marriage breakdown and its consequences. They can be devastating for partners and even more so for the underage child who is played by Justin Henry in this case. <br /> <br /> What I really liked about Kramer vs. Kramer, It's the Biggest Force as a Movie It's the way Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep's parents are presented to the viewer as all people with many aspects of their nature. Although the film is inclined in Hoffman's direction and more about his relationship with his son, he is not presented as any saint, nor is Streep a completely black villain. Hoffman is a career-oriented man in an advertising game. He is largely ignored by his wife's dreams and desires, but it is a big shock to him when Streep says love is no longer there and he wants to go out. She also wants to get out of her mother, at least for a while. Hoffman and Henry do their best they can. The pressure that they are both parents will cause Hoffman to lose his job and have to pay a lower salary in another agency. At that moment, after more than a year, Streep decides he wants to be tied up. Both parents make compelling witnesses and beautifully report their case, but in these situations the tie is always broken for the benefit of the mother. Br /> <br /> Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep won their first of the two Oscars for this film, in the Supporting Actress category. I'm not sure how these things are being decided, Streep has less time on screen than Hoffman, if it's a determining factor. The film focuses on Hoffman's relationship with his son and his growing awareness that he has his share of guilt for marriage failure. As for Meryl, it is Hobo's choice for her, as well as for many women to match her career and motherhood. Conflict in her psychic registers for everyone to see on the screen. Dustin Hoffman may have won that Oscar partly for the same reason that Spencer Tracy picked up his first, by performing the impossible task of not letting the scene steal the baby to steal the movie. Defensive children are natural actors and Henry is great because he comes as a real boy, not a Hollywood girl. I wonder if Hoffman saw the Courageous Captains and saw Spencer Tracy dealing with Freddie Bartholomew. Dustin could do a lot worse in his performance than Spencer Tracy. Kramer vs. Kramer Kramer also won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director Robert Benton and Best Adapted Screenplay. It is an intelligent and convincing drama about how adults look out of love and try to treat them best with themselves for themselves and their child. Don't miss it if you ever broadcast.
