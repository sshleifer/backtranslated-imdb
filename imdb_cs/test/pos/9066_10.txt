He saw it at the Newport Beach Film Festival the next day. The film is really special. The crowd I went with everyone loved. Funny, engaging and brilliant acting. Am I tired of the tried and true Hollywood romances that may apply? David Krumholtz (Max) is really amazing as a sure and true lover of ultra-clever Grace (Natasha Lyonne, who is also excellent). When Max falls on Grace, we believe it. Why? Because love at first sight is crazy and we are dealing with two lost and possibly not so insane souls. Also notes are Giullmo Diaz as Hector and Rosanna Arquette as sexless / sexy neurotic, both "roommates" Max and Grace before they embark on their trip to Sheboygen, WI and find themselves. Don't miss this, something special! P.S. The soundtrack, led by Kevin Hearn (from the Bare Naked Ladies fame) is also super super cool.
