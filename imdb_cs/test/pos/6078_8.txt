In World War II, poorly burned amnesiac known only as "English patient" is found in the African desert and is transported to Italy, where he joins a line of medical troops and others at an abandoned monastery. Among them are Hana (Juliette Binoche), a Canadian sister whose lovers generally encounter unpleasant ends; Kip (Naveen Andrews) and Hardy (Kevin Whately), two explosives experts looking for bombs in the monastery; and David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), a Canadian wealthy soldier who knows the identity of an English patient and has a score to settle. Through the flashbacks we learn the story of the patient: he is Laszo Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), a Hungarian explorer who in the late 1930s belongs to a group of British cartographers, including Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth) and his wife Katharine (Kristen Scott-Thomas) while mapping the deserts of North Africa. After Clifton leaves them at government level, Katharine and Clifton fall in love in the desert, resulting in an affair that is naturally less than a happy ending. If one is able to ignore the illogical parts of the story (eg why would a patient in Africa be sent to what is essentially the first line of war in Italy?), then you can appreciate the "English patient" as the return of the intelligent, layered, extensive epic of David Lean in the 1960s. Much more than "Titanic" or other epic late romances, this film puts one in mind "Doctor Zhivago" and "Away with the Wind" - an epic love story based against a vast historical background. You should not expect a war movie, although there are some noticeable (if too short) scenes of violence that stand out more than the romantic sections, as is usually the case (Caravaggio's interrogation by a sadistic SS officer (Jurgen Prochnow)) in particular). The film is very ambiguous about almost everything. The central question of the film is: How far are you willing to go to love? As film critics are quick to point out, Almasy's, on the surface, a far-from-sympathetic character - he has an affair with a married woman and betrays his country by giving maps and intelligence to the Germans, causing death. his friend Madox (Julian Wadham) and torture Caravaggia, and actually kill a British soldier who is supposed to arrest him at one point. The fact that Almasy is punishable in many ways is such a point - he is in love with Catherine and sees the world closely in his love that loyalty to the earth (or anything else) is secondary; as Almasy says, he hates "Ownership." Two are more concerned with a courageous love affair (plunging into the hundreds of people at a Christmas party) and it is clear that Katharine is more attracted to the mysterious, exciting Almasy than the rather boring Geoffrey. 1944 subplot is somewhat uncertain and seems unnecessary; The romance between Kip and Hannah is never quite believable and I feel the film could do without it. But these movie sequences add an interesting mystery and complexity structure so I won't complain too much. Like the above epic, the film is capable of conveying time and space to simple devices such as crowd scenes, strategically placed posters, and military presence. We don't have to worry about it being 1938 in Cairo, but it is useful to know. Anthony Minghell's direction and John Seal's desert cinematography are superb; Sand dunes, sand storms and ghostly caves of the desert are captured in beautiful detail. Gabriel Yared's score is creepy and atmospheric. The meeting is generally solid. Fiennes gives a very layered performance as a character that is mysterious, complex and scary. The difference between Almasys 1938 and 1944 is remarkable; one exciting and somewhat carefree, the other scary and reflective. Kirsten Scott Thomas is as effective as Katharine, an explorer looking for adventure, and Colin Firth gives one of his best performances as Geoffrey, who soon realizes that there is no competition for exciting Almasy. Willem Dafoe does a nice job like Caravaggio, a handy, hunted thief-turned-spy revenge. Jurgen Prochnow gives a performance reminiscent of Jose Ferrer in "Lawrence of Arabia" (and similar in nature): very brief, but more memorable than some of the main characters. Some of the 1944 actors are unseen: Juliette Binochette is nothing special, while Naveen Andrews is good, but not remarkable. Kevin Whately, as Kip is an unfortunate partner, does what he can with a somewhat diminished role. <br /> <br /> The "English Patient" is not a perfect movie in some way, but the vituperative attacks on it by a lot of movie public are not at all deserved. Maybe it's a show of how film sensitivity has changed since Leans and Kubrick, or maybe people expected something simple to understand. The "English Patient", which is complex to failure, brilliantly directed and filmed, is a wonderful modern epic. <br /> <br /> 8/10
