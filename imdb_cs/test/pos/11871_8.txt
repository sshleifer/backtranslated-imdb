This movie will never be on the top 50 movies of all time, but if you're compiling a list of "fun movies" it's not a bad place to start. Liv Tyler is amazing, captivating and seductive, and everyone else is dead on their part. It's the 21st century counterpart "Tom Jones" - in other words; just good, bawdy fun. I think it may be Tyler's breakthrough film on the road to great fame. With no nudity, sex radiates in this film. No wonder all the boys give her toys. How could they help, but do it for a helpless, innocent like Liv's gem?
