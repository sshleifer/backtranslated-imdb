First, despite the low ranking on this site, I saw something quite worthy in this movie and would like to defend it. And no, I'm not in any way connected to the crew ... <br /> <br /> I happened to come across The Wind DVD and I had a strong feeling that it wouldn't be like the video pack. So I took a chance and was pleasantly surprised by this strange, very different drama. I am assuming that DVD marketing and summary were the work of MTI Home Video Hook rental or sale (tag line "Love Comes in Many Forms" has been changed to "Terror Comes in Many Forms"). Certainly, borrowing and selling smaller films depends heavily on grabbing the attention of a person, especially if they have never heard of a movie (a similar case has happened with the ITEM). This is probably what works against this release because horror fans read the description of "ancient wind" that carries the "sign of the apocalypse". It is easy to think that this is what this film is all about, and will turn some college students into a crazy savage story that goes to a deadly spree. Therefore, at the time this review was presented, it is most likely the reason for the lower IMDb rating. I can understand that people become angry and think they were confused by this summary, see the apocalyptic intro, but then experience a dark drama. I can forgive the marketing option because I enjoyed The Wind and I thought it was a refreshing change in pace from the big Hollywood offerings, it's just that if the intended audience were given more attention, it could say a higher rating. "Wind" in this film is basically just a metaphor for society, and it's the story of four friends who make bad decisions and how their lives quickly turn into desperate self-preservation. After going too far in 'teaching a lesson' to one of their own, death occurs and every person tries to save his own position. Manipulation between them is becoming the norm and we can see how their self-esteem becomes their main motivation for good judgment. Basically civilized to wildness. This is very evident throughout note that using knives, branches like clubs, fists, and digging are tools of violence instead of weapons. These characters in a way do all the bad things for the right reason, just to stay on top of the situation because they've taken things too far. While there are many implied violent images, it is interesting to see that there is no cussing and nudity. <br /> <br /> What works for The Wind are "unknown" actors. Larger stars were originally intended, but I find that it works better when you have less known, capable actors. In this way you can get into the story without ever thinking "oh, this is Tom Cruise" for example, instead of a real troubled person who deals with an emergency situation. Even unusual conversations (such as between Mic and Billy in the field and Mic confronting Claire in her bedroom) are well-held and naturally in the strange universe of Fairview ..., which has cozy homes, a forest and a wide open field. I was thinking about quiet landscapes that hide the darker secrets in Reflecting Skin, which director Michael Mongillo mentions as his inspiration in his commentary. The wind can get the news without trying hard. Certainly, if you look closely, you will see many symbols and a dialogue that other directors might let you over your head. I even understood the infamous "kissing scene" between Claire, John, and Billy in the context of the story, without being surprised that it happened. I'm still overwhelmed by how some people (especially boys) complaining about two men kissing the scene would obviously have no problem if two girls were instead. Everything is nicely done here, and other views will make things clearer without moaning and saying, "O man, how I miss THAT ...." Things gradually fall and I appreciate it. Or you can also listen to DVD comments for more revealed things! <br /> <br /> For those of us who have "received" the intentions of this film, The Wind is the breath of fresh air (no pun) when most of the movies are made to make JUST make money and knock to other films from their "box office contest" that is worth mentioning on Entertainment Tonight or CNN. A few years later, it's always big little discoveries like the wind that remain in my mind, not processed by star-controlled blockbusters. <br /> <br /> Contact the marketing trick from MTI Home Video and you could find this interesting story really. I highly recommend to friends looking for unusual movies like this.
