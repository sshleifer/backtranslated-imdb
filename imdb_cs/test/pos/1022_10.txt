I was in school in the late sixties and early seventies and this movie is how my school was. The school plays where the leading actors kiss, which happened at my school. Mad gang of boys, my school again only when we went for a cross country run, we would smoke! "Make it a blow", someone in my school blew up the light and broke the sticks! then they were kept safe !!! And as for some night activities! What I can say .... The film actually came out in 1982, I remember it when I bought a house and the movie showed up simultaneously. If you like British movies and movies about school, adolescence and times, then it's for you. Some movie very happy that, 'SWALK', came out a few years earlier and I for one would like to see it again, also 'Kes' is in the genre. Highly recommended. (But believe me, 1982 is when it came out)
