This movie combined some of the old Spinal crews for another mockumentary film, this time revolving around the world of exhibitions as their owners prepare and train for the show before moving on to the show itself. We meet several teams because they hope to win the best prize - The Fleck's, a Cookie that seems to have slept with every man, and Gerry, who is trying to cope with her wife's old escapades and by having literally two left legs. Harlan, whose dog talks to him and enjoys ventriloquism. Swans who took too much coffee and shouted at each other. Donalan and Vanderhoof Gay Couple, and Cabot and Cummings, who have won the last two years. Fred Willard comments on the show and is very funny as ever. Fun scenes include 'Look at me!' scene, and all with Levy. Unfortunately some of the best scenes have been erased or filmed later - Willard's Leslie Cabot interview, and an alternative Gerry epilogue is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. If they were included, I would give the film an extra mark. But ... <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
