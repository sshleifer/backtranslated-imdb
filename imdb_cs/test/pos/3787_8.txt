SPOILERS BELOW <br /> <br /> "Dog Life" was most notable for its excellent comic timing. In another 1918 film by Charlie Chaplin, "Shoulder Arms," ​​the silent film genius focuses on a completely different brand of humor. His war comedy specializes in surrealistic, exaggerated pieces in which Chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition. When a soldier's bunker is flooded, the water level reaches the right height for Chaplin to perform his gags most successfully. In a later scene, a soldier dresses like a tree, a disguise that denies Chaplin's much increased ingenuity and goofy. Naturally, when the enemy finds out his fury, the soldier turns right into the forest. The following chase is a visual miracle: Chaplin not only hides a soldier from the Germans, but also uses a forest to mask a soldier from the audience, as well as a masked soldier standing in the middle of the frame, but somehow. invisible. All the time, we thought our little hero was pulling a quick hand on the German army; to our pleasure there is a joke to us. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
