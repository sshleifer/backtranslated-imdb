"What Alice Found" is the biggest movie no one has ever heard of! I underestimated it when I heard about it, and though it was all sex, no spike, and really stupid, but in fact it was really good. It is said that all India movies suck, but this one, and "Napoleon Dynamite" was not sucked. I asked my friend who saw it before I did it and said that Alice has all these three ways, and you see all these nudity, but no, there is no three-way path I remember and little nudity. The film made sense and taught me never to trust the trackers. I liked it in the end, they got Alice a little dolphin in the end, en route to Flordia. I highly recommend seeing this movie.
