This is a surprisingly big low budget horror / comedy, it's funny and pretty well done, with good performances and a really great ending! All the characters are pretty cool and the story, while the unoriginal is very good, plus Eric Jungmann (Adam) and Justin Urich (Harley) had fantastic chemistry together. One of the most exciting moments in the movie for me is when Adam is trapped in the bathroom, and Harley wakes up to find that a monster truck is sitting there and decides to take a car and Aimee Brooks is just sexy! and that's one of the best low-budget horror movies I've seen for a long time. It's very bloody, but in a comic form, and I thought it was also well written, and Michael Bailey Smith is fantastic as a Monster Man and had some bad makeup !. It's like movies like Joy Ride, Duel, Jeepers Creepers, etc. Etc. And it has some exciting moments here and there, plus Gore effects are really well done for the most part. This is a surprisingly big low budget horror / comedy, it's funny and pretty well done, with good performances and a really great ending, I highly recommend this! The direction is very good! Michael Davis is doing very well! Work here, with great camera work, good angles, good use of colors, and using great settings, plus he kept the movie funny and at a very fast pace. There's a lot of gore! . We get extremely bloody nose bleeds, bloody stabs, bloody stings, the guy is cut in half by a monster truck, human remains in boiled goulash, guts everywhere, guys fall out, pencil in the eyes, bloody slit throat, bunch of people walking without limbs, bloody dead squirrel , the heads are squished, separate limbs, bloody and broken corpses, a decent amount of carnage, one very cruel scene at the end and more!. <br /> <br /> Acting is very good for a low budget movie. Eric Jungmann is fantastic here like Adam, he was a nerd, but very nice, he had fantastic chemistry with Justin Urich, he had some cool lines and I just loved his character, he also seemed to be having fun. good at the end!. Justin Urich is excellent as the best friend's ass, but I couldn't help but love him because he was very funny and often stole a lot of scenes, I really kicked him out! Aimee Brooks is beautiful and did great with what she had to do, had a good chemistry with Jungmann, and like Jungmann she was particularly good at the end because I loved her mysterious character. Michael Bailey Smith is amazing as The Monster Man, who was very scary looking, had some amazing makeup and is now one of my favorite slashers!. Do the rest of the cast well. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this one!. *** 1/2 of 5
