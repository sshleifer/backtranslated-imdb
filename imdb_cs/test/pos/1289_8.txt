Christopher Nolan's first directorial effort, a year before he did "Memento," and this is almost as brilliant as that of a classic. He uses time differences in a similar way to tell his story, and it's very clever. Bill is this young writer who begins to follow a complete stranger just to see where they live and what they are all about. One day he follows this man, Cobb, who turns the tables and confronts Bill, who breaks down and confesses what he has. Cobb is a thief and takes Bill to several jobs to teach him the ropes. Both men are voyeurs of kind and the bond begins to grow between the two of them. But Cobb managed to take care of the side motive that supports this relationship, and in the end it all cleverly follows. No, I'm not going to spoil it, but this is a very cool movie and I'm starting to think Christopher Nolan is a genius. <br /> <br /> If you like thrilling movies with surprising endings, this is a must-see.
