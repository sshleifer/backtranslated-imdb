It's the perfect movie you can watch with a loved one in a cool and snowy night. If you like some laughter with your horror, then this is the movie for you. Ideas of a true cult classic. He has everything you want to see in a horror movie. Beautiful girl, hero, Buffoon, MONSTER TRUCK and of course the family of mutant Satanic killers. This one is full of blood, guts and gore. I highly recommend watching this in the morning, and watch out for who sees you enjoy the sounds of Monster Trucks, Bad {But Funny} One liners and our hero eating eye balls. Not as good as Evil Dead, but a close second. Just remember WARNING ..... DO NOT OVERVIEW THIS FILM ...
