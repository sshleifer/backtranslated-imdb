This movie was a surprise. I saw some good Fulci horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that it was the same director. He also wrote a screen game that shows that the guy was quite capable of crafting a detailed, complex story. Dubbing is not good, but far from the scary scales, which only further prevent later howlers like 'Manhattan Baby'. <br /> <br /> The photos in this movie are fantastic. In a film that focuses on a small town where young boys are murdered, a strange, almost futuristic highway appears. The scene involving the beating of a woman is unpleasant to watch, but refreshing compared to the usual violence in the cinema. <br /> <br /> What happened to Lucia? Perhaps there is a strong case that suggests that it has reached its peak with this film, and then slowly went down.
