That would certainly not be my kind of movie, but my husband saw it on TV and said it was really good. On his recommendation, I bought a copy because I didn't know if it would ever be on TV. I've never heard of anyone except Armand Assante. At first I was hardly able to get into the story because the first part of the film is a tangle of images - and that doesn't make sense. It's only later in the movie that it all comes together. The scene editing, if it is called, is a bit uncomfortable - sometimes it looks as if several shots were cut from each scene, and the scenes are jerky - but I think the addition to the unusualness (if it's a word) was done. The story revolves here and there, and just when you invented it, everything turns upside down and you have to set your mind again about who is a bad person and who isn't. Or a bad woman. Acting is very good ... I thought how much Norman Reedus looks like Leo Decaprio. The end was a real intervention, totally unexpected, which I liked. Good show.
