Halloween 666 (1995) Production Review! Halloween 666 begins with a recap of the terrible end to Part Five. If you thought the last chapter was dark, this really throws your mind away. The mysterious "black man" raided Haddonfield Police Department and freed Michael Myers. In this process, poor Jamie Lloyd was kidnapped by strange bodybuilders. What do they want with her? Who knows, but let's say her long suffering is about to end. Dr. Loomis spends the rest of his twilight years trying to stop Michael Myers from killing other innocent people (good luck). Doctor Wynn, a friend of Loomis, returns after four sequels to help the good doctor. Another old face from one part of the visiting star as well. <br /> <br /> This dark and grim continuation was dismantled during post-production editing. For some reason, distributors believed that the end product was not worth the average time of a horror movie watcher. So they decide to do it. After sitting on the shelf for several months, he put the egg in the box office. No matter what they did with the film, they made it worse. They should be pretty good. Hey, film company knows better than filmmakers now ... no? Producer cut: Highly recommended <br /> <br /> Release: Not recommended
