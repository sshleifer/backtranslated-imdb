I was just watching "return from a lonely dove" and it was very good! I've seen a lot of negative comments about it and I don't think viewers are real about it! In the television / film industry it is hard to get all the actors back to the 2nd sequel or the third part. WE ARE LUCKY WHAT ARE OTHER MINISERS IMPORTANT TO YOU LENGTH !! This production was top-notch with the original musical score and the actors put a heart into it (you can say it). If you want to watch lonely dad with Robert Duvall and tommy L. J. then watch the original. Back to L.D. she didn't have so much joke and she takes a more serious tone, but she is absolutely charming. From the moving moments to the villains, this winner is! "Great!!!"
