Muppet is an instant classic. I remember the opening scene with a bird's eye view of the swamp and Kermit, starting (in my opinion) the most popular song in the history of songs. At this point my mom would always sing with Kermit. Watching this title as a young adult makes me smile. I can still sing according to the wishes of my heart. Like many Muppet movies, adult jokes that are (in my opinion) still funny. My favorite line of all time is actually from this movie, it's the last line of my green hero who looks at glasses, Kermit "Life is like a movie, write your own end". That's what I intend to do! Thank you Jim Henson.
