This is a type of film that may need to be viewed several times to capture all of its beauty and intelligence (as well as the 1957 curse of Frankenstein). If you don't like strange, unconventional movies, avoid this masterpiece. Artworks in this film are worth the purchase price of a videocassette for me. The plot is a bit fantastic, but it seems to be a reality in our world today. The film, which was made in the 1980s, is a prophetic vision of what to do with the Great Government and the Big Brother who wants to control and follow us. There are many slow sections and dialogue can be quite hard to catch in many scenes {that's why I watched it 6 times now}, but if you can spend it all, it may well be worth your time. The film is basically about a world where people have evolved into robotic machines that have lost their individualism. They are only concerned about accumulation and multiplication. The film's hero was not subject to this illness and was not "labeled" and followed by a big brother. His mission is to release a secret drug into the tap that will change the way human robots think and allow humanity to become part of humanity again. Yes, his very low budget, but for his time the computer effects and sound effects are very unique and the images are absolutely fascinating. If you have an open mind, this film should impress and its prophetic visions are chilling.
