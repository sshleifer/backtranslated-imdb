In 1965 producer Kevin McLory-who owns part of the Bond film rights-affiliates with EON Productions (Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli) for the production of "Thunderball", the fourth movie of the 007th Star is of course Sean Connery. In 1982 McLory wins a legal battle and can produce an "independent" film Bond. "Never Say Never" (NSNA) is one of two "unofficial" 007 films made outside EON (the second is the 1967 "Casino Royale" comedy). The NSNA is a remake of "Thunderball" and the star's original Bond, Sean Connery-who returns to the role after many years of absence. The film is released several months after "Octopussy" with Roger Moore, EON 13 episode. At that time, the press says "War of Bonds" ... Both films are a great success in 1983, although "Octopussy" makes more money at the box office. The NSNA is a luxury movie created by excellent engineers - director Irvin Kershner who led "The Empire strike back", Douglas Slocombe-cameraman of "The Lost Ark Raiders" - and screenwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr -who wrote "Three Days" Condora "- among others ... <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent with Connery, then relatively unknown Kim Basinger, Barbara Carrer, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max Von Sydow, Edward Fox ... <br /> <br all that the film remains worse than the original "Thunderball". It lacks many essential ingredients for being a real Bond movie: there is no traditional weapon barrel sequence, there is no "James Bond Theme", M and Q are not played by traditional actors ... This is the reason for copyright: EON only is to use these elements . In short, the NSNA lacks the classic film atmosphere of 007. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film is exciting and enjoyable. Brandauer is a very good villain and women (Basinger and Carrera) are sensual and gorgeous. The main advantage is Sean Connery! He is amazing again in this role, he is older, but he looks better and nicer than in "diamonds are forever", his latest performance as a British super-spy against the NSNA.
