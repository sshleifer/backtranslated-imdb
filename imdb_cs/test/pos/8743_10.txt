Traffik is an excellent miniseries dealing with drug trafficking in Europe. This is the European series of PBS, which is based on an Oscar nominated film. If you loved traffic then Traffik needs to be seen. Overall, I highly recommend this miniseries to anyone who is interested in seeing drugs from a social point of view. The scenario is exciting and unexpected because it goes through the lives of drug dealers, human traffickers, farmers, police officers and police officers. Unlike other films that sensitize drugs, Traffik presents her as an IS.
