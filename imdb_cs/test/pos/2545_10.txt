The majesty of Ramin Bahrani's second work is that, like the work of a poet, he portrays the very soul of mankind and leaves the screen to bloom. Beyond most other independent movies, CHOP SHOP is wise, radiating the best of the great cinema of ages; we can look back on the works of Bresson and Pasolini and compare Bahrani's work with them, yet the PDO SHOP is fresh and pressing for modern society. Can we see the master's work here? a certain sense of beauty, style and content combines in a film that reminds us of what it means to be alive. Instead of focusing on NYC, do we often see, live and breathe with our young hero, Alejandro, in the abandoned Willits Point? fascinating quasi-sub-world of our culture ?? And yet it is a very, very real place. Alejandro, trying to stay on the water, must support himself and his older sister. Watch this movie and feel the sense of raw spiritual understanding that Bahrani leads us towards? all with deep and concise realism.
