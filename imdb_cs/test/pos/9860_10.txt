The Moving Museum in New York recently presented a comprehensive retrospective of Jacques Rivett's films. When I fell in love with my "Parisian Nous Appartient", I decided not to miss it. Expanded with extensive footage and flexibly structured scenes, the film captures two avant-garde theatrical companies that prepare their releases. Aeschylus "Seven Against Thebes" and "Prometheus". In addition, we have shown that the daily lives of two people who are connected to society are boundless: a working class woman named Frederique, who finds creative ways to free a man from their money, and a young man named Colin, who visits local cafes to act as deaf -mute, and playing a penetrating accordion at the patrons before they pay him to go away. The first four hours are devoted to the creation of characters and their patterns, rather than the somewhat relaxed, moody drawing finally emerges with the plot and decoding of secret secret letters. The film is largely about marginalized life. Theatrical companies are a desperate problem, using their complicated, emotionally exhausting exercises (which are really something to be watched) to turn away from the fact that their actions are unlikely to be staged or even seen. Colin and Frederique both have very few friends who only briefly find some excitement or purpose after the plot touches them because they are encouraged to learn more about it. The film meditates on the consequences of rejecting a normal society in several unforgettable sequences, including a long shot of Colin as he travels the streets of France screaming poetry for himself. As such, the film was referred to as the 1960's counterculture analysis. There is no film frame that is not bursting with energy and vitality. The fact that most dialogue and movement is improvised makes the characters more spontaneous, much more immediate. The camera also becomes an important feature in this regard; shadows or other similar errors are visible throughout the movie, yet they seem natural and fit into the flow of action because the camera is as important as the player. More than anything else, it seems to me that the film is a great example of another way of making films, the venue of a film outside the usual pattern. For me, it was an experience opening the mind, even more so than "Paris Nous Appartient", although the latter has many similarities to theme and structure. He must see anyone who thinks about the nature of art.
