An unusual movie for viewers outside the US. Lena Horne looks wonderful, just like Ralph Cooper. There is no step background like in other musicals, so you don't hear the rhythm of taps, which is a great realism. The music is subdued to hear the dance steps. Acting is somewhat stilted and casts speak slowly so you think the movie is older than it is. Costumes are bold for time in dance routines at the end. You often feel that you are part of a theater performance. What furniture you see is very modern, giving the movies a sense of different secularity. Necessity for all film enthusiasts.
