But this movie was definitely in line with the current times. No happy endings, superheroes or wonders here. Just a fiction coming down to earth to stimulate our minds in the spirit of terrorism and what. Kudos to Percival and Mickery for an excellent script and excellent direction Percival. Films like this are needed to be aware of what's out there. If every man and woman who loves peace has stated obviously suspicious activities, I believe that terrorism could not be beneficial. This film has shown how difficult it is to subvert these terrorists, even with good intelligence. Although the film is a bit of a propaganda against Islam (using a Muslim police officer as the main character), I believe it was completely realistic. The bombing incident was supposed to be a shock value. As a very clever tool to impart humility and indignation to people who have been attacked, they have shown that women are decontaminated after the attack. It didn't take me long to realize that it was even more to instill the viewer who thought we were not in a situation like this. Although this took place in London, with the usual high level of British playing, it makes a statement for any part of the world. Great movies may not be a blockbuster of epic production, and this film is very worthy of watching.
