What's on the movie? This movie is just wonderful. A true feast for the eyes. In the same way that the game set the standard for 3D role-playing games 7 years ago, this film sets the standard for future CG movies. Many of you have seen trailers and amazing details in every picture and let me tell you that this movie will not disappoint. You can see your hair in the Cloud vest. The music is also very good. The movie features several rearranged video game songs that fans will recognize and appreciate. The film's main weakness is its story. It's not a bad story, but this story is meant exclusively for people who played video games. For the first time, viewers may sometimes get lost or may not notice the importance of certain events. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone, even if you never played the game, because what we have here is a special movie. Watch it and enjoy the beautiful show.
