I was able to see a preview of this movie through the UCLA pre-screening program and let me tell you: THIS FILM IS THE BIGGEST GOOD !!!! I've seen many movies, but few people laughed so frankly or talked about the movie like that. I had a respectable respect for Tenacious D before I saw the movie, and now I'm MAD about them. I will definitely buy their album when it is released on 14th and will see this movie again. <br /> <br /> If you were on the fence to see this movie, GET OFF and go look! Nowadays, it is worth an extremely expensive ticket price because you will surely be sure that the matrix will laugh throughout the event. Besides comedy, famous and divine music that comes from the KG guitar and Voice JB is amazing. The audience is left stupid that such beautiful harmonies and amazing riffs can be created in conjunction with such ridiculous (and cheerful) lyrics. If for nothing but music itself, this film is worth the acceptance. With a wonderfully coherent story tying in almost all aspects of the traditional "D" history and hallmarks, great new songs, hilarious comedy, and some pretty amazing portraits, this movie ranks there with the best! Go see it!
