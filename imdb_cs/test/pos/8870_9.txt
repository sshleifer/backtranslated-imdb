I do not understand these films clearly average rating?? I really enjoyed it, I even stayed until the early hours of the morning to watch late night television <br /> <br /> there are three outstanding characters, excellent characters. Danny DeVito played the gem, which was a pretty good performance when he was also a director. His descending laugh occasionally character was brilliantly written and was unreal in an absolutely believable manner. There are people like this, Owen was just on the line without going over it. Billy Crystal's comic book son and the sense of timing were perfect for his role. His frustration / comedy was interesting and captivating, and moreover ... he understood his feelings. To truly feel that you know that a character is hard to reach from the writers' point of view, to find the right actor to pull it out is an art in itself and both have been achieved here three times. Third Who else could play Momma? There is no one who can play this part so well. There is a style, unlike others, something that you like to watch, I found that I was waiting to appear on the screen ... and not because the rest was bad, oh no, but because Momma's character was again So on the line without the transition, it was excellent to watch. <br /> <br /> What's more? Happy ending with new found friends, nobody gets hurt and everyone gets what they want in life ... With a big piece of cheese at the end. <br /> <br /> Brilliant script, great idea, perfect cast, great movie.
