I admit I have been a Harrison Ford fan for many years, so I wasn't surprised that I enjoyed his performance. But I also enjoyed the way the story evolved and thought casting was well done. I do not know if I "buy" Kristin Scott Thomas as a Congresswoman, but she is a fine actress and a beautiful woman. I noticed her in the first Impossible mission. Although her part was small, she went to the screen. Here and her Ford play people whose husbands are killed in a plane crash. They sit together and that's where the plot starts. Apparently Ford, a police detective in Wash D.C., finds out his wife has an affair. He further finds that the matter was with her New England Congresswoman's husband. The story insists on many subplots like Ford and Thomas find themselves together uncovering their marriage, uncovering a deceipt, and pure grief and anger at the loss of a loved one. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is worth either renting or grabbing the cable.
