I'm not usually on a dark / psychological type. However, SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work. The story, playing, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are really very complex and convincing. Rose plays the complexity and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman quite accurately. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way to solve energy exchange problems. It was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves that we left three quarters to get tea, and I felt the need to have a shower. The story clutched, but clearly we couldn't handle all the energy in one straight shot. (Dives into the courageous and dirty side of the people, but doesn't leave you there). I have long been thinking about characters and deeper meanings. I highly recommend this. Always be prepared for the experience you do not expect.
