I have a strong feeling that what you think about this film will depend heavily on your reference framework. If you've never seen a Miyazaki movie, then it'll probably be a damn thing. If you've seen the Miyazaki movie before, then it's probably going to be damn wrong. That's because I found out that when I first saw one of his animated films, I was trying too hard to figure out what was going on and why - and that affected my movie experience. Now that I've seen almost every Miyazaki movie, I see bizarre and all that - I enjoy the beauty of it all. In many ways these films (at least for Western viewers) are drugs - lots of strange and beautiful images that don't always make sense at first, but they certainly feel great! Of all Miyazaki's films, this could have the most unusual and incomprehensible storyline - even more than SPIRITED DAYS and PRINCESS MONONOKE or MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO. But like these and many other Studio Gibli movies, if you just sit and watch, you're rewarded with a wonderful story. But because it's so hard to describe (and others have already done it), I won't even go there. <br /> <br /> For some of these Japanese films, it's very typical of works of art. there was one noticeable change. There was a very wide use of what looked like crayons for the background. It wasn't a bad thing at all - a beautiful pastel-like look was very nice and unique. In some ways it looked like a small piece of Bill Plympton's art style that was filled with the typical Miyazaki movie. With high frame rate, exceptional character animation (which has given them a lot of personality) and a great "wow-factor", this is an exceptional film for all ages. Although it is clearly intended for younger audiences (especially TOTORO fans), it is a little scary here and there (during the thunderstorms), but there are plenty of great things for adults. As an adult (at least chronologically) I loved cute things and applauded the other worlds of the film. Great movie - among the best Miyazaki. It doesn't give me 10 because I was hesitant to do it sometimes - and I did a bit more of the other studio films (especially TOTORO). But that doesn't mean you shouldn't rush out and see it - do it and do yourself a favor.
