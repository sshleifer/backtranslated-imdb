Over the years, I have been very interested in the life of this teenager who has left such a deep, indelible mark on the world. My fascination was also born out of fear, as if it might happen again. And in the coming years, yes, I'm afraid it's still happening around us, and of course "it" has been going on long before Anne. Of course, it is possible for a so-called civilized society to turn to its own or to an innocent country / race / continent and murder the citizens in cold blood for the weakest apologies? I'll leave the question there. At the beginning of the document is a statement about leader Adolf Hitler that one deep fact about Hitler, which he never mentioned, is that he was elected democratically and all the atrocities committed were made as a consequence of the poodle's satisfactory propaganda and fear propaganda that has reappeared over and over again for the learning population. One of the atrocities was Anne Frank, who looked into the death camps by the miracle of her diary's survival. Kenneth Brannagh does a great job of commenting and interviewing, he has the precious gift of minimizing his own personality, allowing subjects to speak for themselves. Many of the new facts and people we've never interviewed before are being revived in careful research, which I won't go to because they disproportionately contribute to the reality and intestinal grief of the film. /> <br /> Glenn Close reads diary selections and her voice is ideal for the game, bringing a naive and fresh role. Anna's old friends, who are old with childhood, are talks in length and her last days before death are well recorded and witnessed along with her live and live music. a malicious personality. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this. A beautiful and respectful film rarely saw Anne. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
