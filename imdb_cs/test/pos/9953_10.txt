Hi. good day and goodbye. but before I go, I want to talk to you. I just want to quickly mention a few key points about this movie. the first is eroticism. especially homo-erotica. <br /> <br /> Yes, fine. Let us start. When a person and a man love each other, they join together in a magnificent, despite the gentle explosion of a movie we call a Venetian merchant. homosexual erotic love was worse. and, at best, more sensual. it was hard and emotional. she touched me ill and I'm sure I touched her. and when no one looked, I touched myself a little. I laughed because the portia was denied. she was second in line with our friend, erotic love homo. oh antonio. antoni. only toni. I love you. more than you loved. who can or may not include a "B" name. he was very ugly. antoni was very greasy. He threw his body into the sheath of his hair and sensual juices and continued to wriggle behind the screen and presented himself to a person with this name I liked the film, go to a movie, if not homo-erotic connotations for the love of a man like antoni. only toni.
