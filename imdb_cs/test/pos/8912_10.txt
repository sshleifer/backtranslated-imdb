Alien Warrior is one of those 80s gems that you have come across by mistake, then look at the stunned, admiring, how amazingly stupid and up it gets. There is a somewhat hungry stranger on earth (LA to be exact) and hit the world of drug dealers, gangs, and corrupt cops. She falls in love with a flaxen, a beautiful teacher who just wants to help children in the city to read more. He also manages to anger the coke-sniffing queen drug who promises to destroy him. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this movie for the first time ... it's definitely a hokey, stupid and low budget. But you can say that the filmmakers had their hearts in the right place, and the hell if the thing didn't work! I just pray it will be soon on DVD. It's a hot soundtrack, break-dancing, violence, nudity ... all with a positive, healthy message! You see it.
