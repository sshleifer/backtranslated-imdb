This can be a bit creaky now, and it certainly can never have an impact it once had, but it is still an exciting reminder of what Michael Jackson could have done once. Looking back at it now for the first time since its initial salient, I wasn't hit by horror traps - quaint but fun, and Vincent Price never sounded so real, un-camply (sic?) Menacing - than his horror absorption that allows Jackson genre and makeup to boldly reveal a portrait of male sexuality. Because THRILLER is not really about horror, in fact, horror is not really about horror: it's about this old theme, the sexual awakening of a young woman. The film opens in the cinema, with Jackson's girlfriend uncomfortable with the pictures, and aggressively with gender response. Of course, she's on a date, and she's less frightened by the movie than what she knows her boyfriend will expect. The mainstream imagery of the movie they are watching, the atmosphere of the group all suggest socially conditioned expectations. This not only leads her to think of a disgusted body - that is, all crumbling werewolves; Loss of virginity is considered a kind of death - but the sexual ritual is not just about her friend, but her peers, her company, her visualization as a gang disruption. This is a great, disturbing thing, the best director Landis has done. Jackson, the most popular artist on the planet, was still willing to show that the solid star image contained crowds, not all of them comforting. The song itself rose remarkably, spooky, urgent bass rhythms, extremely delicate lyrics, a beautiful disco in the 1970s that smashed the choir, shook the timelessness, and revealed the milky desire for fear.
