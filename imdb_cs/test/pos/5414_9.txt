This movie is full of surprises, many of which are funny. The fact that it is written and directed by a 24-year-old man makes me think. Some of the scenes where high school children use ecstasy have made me very concerned because I have a child who is at that age and could have imagined it. As a teenage parent, I found that the display of parent-child interactions is in exact condition. I liked the many little jokes of the movie and I enjoyed not having made perfect sense, and not all the questions were solved to the end. To paraphrase Mark Twain, truth is alien than fiction, because fiction must adhere to what is possible while truth is not. This is a movie that plays with the viewer, allowing us to believe that people are what other people think they are just to let us realize later that people, which we thought were fine, they didn't know the real situation. One of the strongest scenes of the film, a scene that we feel very relieved and compassionate about what the character is doing, seems to be based on a totally wrong premise and the character, although admirable, is totally wrong. I think it's very finely done. Very realistic. I really enjoyed the score - I thought the movie really helped, really helped set the mood - the movie has a few moments, and background music helps. Valedictorian speech is hoot and half - got a big laugh! The movie is really in my head right now - I saw it this morning. She tries to see it again, time permits. Dozens are hard to come by, but they have nine in my book.
