For most of them, romantic movies have never been my cup of tea. But Valley Girl is one of the few Romance films I could not only sit but enjoy. Nicholas Cage is great in his first role and Deborah Foreman is cute for faith. There are some side stories that tend to become confused, but not enough to shrink this film.
