I was part of the cast of Space Odyssey, playing FIDO in the mission. I just want to say that none of us actors, especially those who were in a mission who had to respond most of the time to the green screen, had no idea how amazing it would be. I knew it would be good only if it was for utter friendship and professionalism that the production team had given all involved to Impossible Pictures. but when we all saw it for the first time at a screening in Curzon Mayfair, I felt very proud. I was so glad that none of us looked like Star Trek. Joe Aherne, a screenwriter and director, is the most amazing man he can work on. Quite a good team gets together and then they just implicitly trust them to do what they do best. I'm really happy to have been part of this show. Who would know that something like this and the complexity to be understood will be so tempting to watch. and my god is a beautiful universe there.
