I've never seen a movie like this, or funny. I laughed at my damn ass and repeatedly watched him. Infact I'm watching it now. Chad from CKY is also hot. By the way, if you never liked it, blow it up, you don't feel like it. The film includes Ry (Ryan Dunn) who just broke up with his girlfriend who turned to Valo (Bam Marger) and Falcone (Brandon DiCamillo) to help find out exactly what she did with "Hellboy" (Rake Yohn), and Raab (Chris Raab / Raab himself) just do it. Fender bender scene and cactus scene in Record Bin were cheerful.
