I first saw Nightbreed since I saw it in the theater almost 20 years ago, and when I liked it at that time, I don't remember blowing it like this today. I really can't complain about this movie. Craig Scheffer is excellent as Boone's main character. I've never understood why he doesn't have a more successful career because most of his early work is excellent. Like Scheffer, Cronenberg is even better. His depiction of psycho Dr. Decker is unforgettable and steals the show. The rest of the cast, which includes Doug Bradley, is very good, except ridiculously over the top sheriff. The visuals are good and in some shots great. Danny Elfman's composite score is as good as he gets and is among his best work. The end was epic, with nonstop events nearly twenty minutes. Overall, Nightbreed is a huge success for Clive Barker and one of my favorite movies, just before Hellraiser. 9/10
