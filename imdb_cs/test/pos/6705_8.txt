Something I think some people are missing about a big science fiction is that it predicts some part of the future. No other theatrical film I remember supposed that when the shuttle went to study Halley's comet, there would be a disaster! Some differences were: "Churchill" (a shuttle in the movie) actually went to the comet, "Challenger" was only in the low orbit of the country; "Churchill" was just burned inside, while "Challenger" exploded - hey vampires had to get back to the ground. One big resemblance (and that's always bad!) Both had mixed male / female crews - the legend of Halley's comet and disaster continues! this film, which has not yet been mentioned. As a space / sci-fi / horror / sex movie, it didn't provide anything new, but as with all great foods, it's a combination that counts. And together it was a very original and satisfactory combination. I just wish Mathilda May left her victims through another part of her body!
