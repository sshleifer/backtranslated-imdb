This very entertaining short film is considered one of the best shorts ever and I certainly won't argue with it. Even in a country where first-class animated shorts are created with regularity, this film can still stand out. If you ever see this movie, please do so. It's only ten minutes, and yet it contains a man who is obsessed with saws, a woman who sucks a bath and a nuclear war. What more would you like in the movie?
