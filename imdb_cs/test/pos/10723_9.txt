Life went great for New York's advertising artist Ted Kramer. He had a great job and a loving wife. No, actually, his wife wasn't so loving, because when Ted returned home late that night, his wife, Joanna, had a packed suitcase and started out the door. He tried to stop her, but she just got into the elevator and Ted's life. Now, besides his work, he now has in mind the house and the six-year-old son Billy; Ted assured his boss that his wife's departure would not affect his job. However, he influenced his performance as a father. He blew up when Billy spilled his punch on his client drawing! A little later, Ted and Billy get a letter from Joanna, and her letter made it clear she wasn't coming back. Ted was upset. Well, he was late for work on Billy's birthday, which made him feel pain. Ted someday came to work and his boss shouted at him because he missed an important client meeting. When he returned home, he shouted at Billy to sneak ice cream at dinner. Later he told Billy that the break between him and Joanna could be his fault, not Billy; Ted invited the good friend, Phyllis Bernard over that night, and Billy got a first look at the naked woman. When Ted took Billy to the park the next day, he fell off the jungle gym and landed on his toy plane. Ted literally ran him to the hospital where they had to manage the stitches. After that, life began to take a downward spiral for Ted. Then one day he received a phone call from anyone other than Joanna! They met in the corner of the cafe. At first they have a pleasant conversation, but then Joanna informs him that she has come back to pick up her son and take him with her. Ted wouldn't do any of this and go out. Life got worse for Ted when his boss Jim O'Connor took him to lunch and suddenly fired him. Not only that, but Joanna decided to file a lawsuit against Billy and no job, Ted had no chance of winning in hell. He hired John Shaunessy, a lawyer who charged a nice penny: an exact change of $ 15,000. And that's because they win. Ted was also able to find a new job. In fact, it was a step away from what he did with a significant cut in pay, but he accepted with great determination. Eventually, the date of the trial came, January 9, 1980. President Atkins. Joanna took the booth and Shaunessy came to the question of why she left Ted and her other relationships and how the failures were. The next day Ted stood up and Joanna's lawyer really grilled him like a cheeseburger. Ted's good friend Margaret also took a position and didn't really help. Well, the judge took some time to change his mind and certainly, one day Shaunessy informs Ted that he has lost. Joanna had Billy's exclusive care. How typical! He always decides in favor of the mother. Ted and Billy were just devastated in farewell. They said goodbye to us when Joanna suddenly stopped. She and Ted have a little talk and good, rather than give away the end, let me assure everyone that everything will turn out fine for everyone! That was a very good movie. Dustin Hoffman was very good. He won this academic award. I also saw him in Hook, Meet the Fockers and Rain Man, who also won an Oscar. Meryl Streep was good. She also won an Oscar. Justin Henry was good too, so where was his appointment? I think the academy had the rule of not giving the children Oscars, but the rule was abolished when Haley Joel Osment arrived. This film has a great drama, a light comedy and is very subtle. He does a good job of keeping your attention. In the evening I watched the rain on the TCM, then it came and I couldn't help it. And that's what you should do. If you like Dustin Hoffman or Meryl Streep or movies of this genre, then I recommend Kramer vs. Kramer! A breathtaking film about the pains of two divorced parents fighting for their child. I liked Ted's little talk about governance for the benefit of mothers all the time. What was sex about doing good parents? It's actually a child. But seriously, he's right. Why always rule in favor of a mother because she is a woman? Also in cast, George Coe, Howard Duff, who died in 1990, and Howland Chamberlain who died in 1984. Watch up-and-coming JoBeth Williams in nudity in the hallway scene. See Kramer vs. Kramer today !!! A good movie !! <br /> <br /> -
