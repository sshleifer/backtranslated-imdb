More fun than any gay orgy in "300" together. More heartbreaking than Shakespearean tragedy. More poetic than the most dramatic poems about lost love and blah blah blah. And besides all the biggest he ever did. Black comedy testing the limits of human senses, John Waters' cult film "Pink Flamingos" is a story of a conflict between two families. ends with humiliation, death and, of course, consumption of dog excrement (yeah, by the way, it is not actually humiliating part). No no, it's not about impossible love, there are no Romeos or Juliets on these 90 or so minutes. This movie is about a battle for prestige if you could call it. Battle for the title - Filthiest man alive. On the one hand, we have a divine (played cross-dressing Waters regular ... um ... divine) caring daughter, good mother, cannibal, killer, pervert and current owner of the title. She loves her son Crackers too much. Crackers themselves sport sexual attraction for chickens and young ladies sometimes mixing them in threesome. Family friend and loyal companion Cotton gets her satisfaction from watching Crackers during some of his ... acts involving the earlier objects of attraction. Last but not least, the Divine Mother and Grandma Crackers, Edie. Â£ 400,000 woman sleeping, eating and basically living in a baby cradle. She is dependent on eggs and loves the egg man (the man who brings the egg ... lol). Four of them live peacefully in a caravan outside the city until they become targets for the Marbles. Actually, exhibitors, manipulators, crooks, very bad people. Their main source of income is the kidnapping and impregnation of young women. For the impregnation part, they use their trusted and loyal butler cross-dressing to provide sperm. After they sold the born child to the highest bidder. It was Marbles' envy to Divine and her title that would lead to an inevitable confrontation between the two families. An epic battle of dirt, perversion and violence. <br /> <br /> "Pink Flamingos" is an unbeatable masterpiece in the genre of garbage film. Charged with peculiarities and strange acts, John Waters is hated and hated by traditionalists, critics, and the average film audience. But for those few who are overwhelmed by these generalizations, the flamingos are an unforgettable experience. Funny and sick, violent and poetic. It's really a bad taste
