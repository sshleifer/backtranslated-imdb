Here's a movie that almost gets it all right, with good performances from everyone, and three powerful front performances from Hanks, Seymour Hoffman, and fine turn from Julia Roberts that make me a spell tied from the first few seconds, these are performances that raise production to the stars and keep it there all the time. In addition to one or two very minor factual issues with the script, the only thing that leaves this film is the technical direction, there are too many bad fudged continuity, and a series of camera "scams" that just don't work . This is surprising for the movie of this character, and is a little uncomfortable to watch, but does not destroy the otherwise beautifully crafted movie.
