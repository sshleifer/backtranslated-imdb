In the 1960s, Hong Kong, a man and a woman move to adjacent apartments on the same day with their respective husbands. They soon believe that their sometimes absent spouses have an affair with each other. Strange ties appear between a man and a woman that deal with their sadness by alternating with their wife before a more complex link appears ... <br /> <br /> For Hong Kong, auturo Wong Kar-Wai is "In the mood for love" is nothing less than a miracle. A story of sadness that can be moving and sometimes funny. A romance that never feels forced or fake. The director's method has a lot to do with it. The director of a non-existent scenario (although this concept largely follows from a Japanese story) to prioritize improvisation, the film is immediately separated. freshness of his performances. The whole movie revolves around, and the rest is a pure improvement. At the heart of the film are two characters who are released into your heart and stay there long after the credits end: Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung are simply amazing and no language barrier interferes with the single fragment of immediacy and truth they portray. The additional material is also top-notch: the movies are amazing to watch (partly limited by Christopher Doyle "Hero") and the music is heartbreaking. This is something everyone has to see, just because it is by far the most sensitive, mature, and authentic "love story" out there. Inadmissible.
