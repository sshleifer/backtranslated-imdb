The European musician and composer is trying to capture the musical diversity of Istanbul. A lover of sound experimentation, Alexander Hacke (German avant-garde band Einstürzende Neubauten) roams the streets of Istanbul with his mobile recording studio and "magic mike" to create an inspired portrait of Turkish music. His journey leads to the discovery of a wide spectrum, from modern electronic, rock and hip-hop to classical "Arabesque". As he goes through this seductive world, Alex collects impressions and songs from artists such as the neo-psychedelic group Baba Zula, DJs Orient Expressions, rock groups Duman and Replikas, rocker rocker Erkin Koray, Ceza (Turkey's response to Public Enemy), breakdance artists Istanbul Style Breakers, digital dervish Mercan Dede, renowned clarinetist Selim Sesler, Canadian folk singer Brenna MacCrimmon, street performers Siyasiyabend, Kurdish singer Aynur, "Elvis of Arabesque" Orhan Gencebay and legendary theater Müzeyyen Senar and Sezen Aksu.
