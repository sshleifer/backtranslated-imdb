This early Warner Brothers talkie "Son of the Gods" (1930) deals with the racial intolerance that Anglo-Saxon Americans point to the Chinese. Chinese-Americans are considered second-class citizens, and whites are in no way other than contempt. Barthelmess "Just Angels Have Wings", who experiences racial prejudices first-hand when girls who his college buddies bring for the party to reveal their racist feelings about Sam once they learn about his legacy. Sam goes to his father, Lee Ying (E. Alyn Warren "Away with the Wind"), who is a wealthy Chinaman with offices not only in New York City but also in San Francisco. Sam feels deeply injured by racial curses and wants to leave New York and go where the Americans can't hurt him. His father warns him that racism is a reality of everyday life, and tolerance is the only solution to racism. Sam has not yet learned this lesson. He refuses to take more money from his father and catches the ship to London, England, peeling potatoes while he is on board. During the trip, he meets the British playwright Bathurst (Claude King of "Arrowsmith"), who needs some help writing the Chinese game. Sam and he get into a friendship and Sam provides him with cultural information about the Asians. While relaxing in France, Sam meets a beautiful young woman, Allan Wagner (Constance Bennett of "Two-Faced Woman"), who falls madly in love with him. Allana and her rich father seem to spend their holidays in the same motel. Everyone in the motel knows Sam is a quinaman with the exception of Allana. Sam is sensitive to her racial heritage and holds Allan's arm length until he convinces him that he can't change anything. They fall madly into love. Allana's father drops the bomb on her when she reveals that Sam is a Chinese official and all the memories of life in San Francisco and dealing with the cold floods of Allan's mind. She enters the motel's dining room and publicly floats Sam with the riding stand in front of the room full of on-lookers. Of course, Sam is terribly devastated by this change of events. He thought Allan loved him, but he didn't. About this time, Sam's father Lee Ying falls tragically ill and Ying's kind secretary, Eileen (Mildred Van Dorn "Iron Man") sends Sam a telegram about Ying's disease. Predictably, Sam rushes home to New York to be on his father's side. Since his public humiliation, Sam has promised to show no favor to Anglo-Saxon Americans; Eileen is an Irish-Catholic and probably one of the few white friends. Lee Ying dies and Sam takes control of the business and practices his anti-White racism until he learns that he is an Anglo-Saxon founder who has put San Francisco policeman Lee Ying and his wife in the fight. The cop forgot it until two white types of employed social workers wanted Sam to break away from Yings. Sam learns of this revelation at the same time that Allana comes to New York and gets sick. During her illness she repeatedly pronounces her name in her sleep, and her devoted father goes to Sam and asks Sam to visit her to help her recover. Allana is unknown, Sam visits her and improves, but she has no memory of her visit. Eventually, Allana learns the truth about Sam, who is not a Chinaman, and marries and lives happily ever after. An hour or so before the apparition that Sam had no Chinese blood to live in his veins both surprise and spectator. The reconciliation between Allan and Sam follows credibility, despite their self-assured undying love for each other. However, in the name of a happy ending that would wipe out all the negativity that came before him, he would end up in his arms. Surrender at a race with the revelation that Sam is not Chinese is damaging some of the film's moral powers. Incredibly, "Son of Gods" is a precoding movie that almost seems to be cautious; for example Sam is an American, not a Chinese! Constance Bennett gives a wonderful performance as a beautician and she keeps your attention as she whips Sam with her riding crop. Claude King is good as Bathurst and E. Alyn Warren is convincing as Lee Ying. Interestingly, Warren portrayed Asian characters from his career. Richard Barthelmess is as flawless as Sam; delivering highly zero performance. Despite his age, "Son of the Gods" is the son of good film!
