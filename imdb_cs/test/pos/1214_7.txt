That was a very good PPV, but just like Wrestlemania XX about 14 years later, WWE had so many matches on it, some matches were useless. I will not go through every match on the card because it will take forever to do. However, the main attractions included a huge pop for Demolition winning the team tag strips from Haku and Andre Giant, the first ever mixed tag match featuring Randy Savage and the sensational Queen Sherri vs Dusty Rhodes and the late Sapphire and the first ever clash between The Ultimate Warrior and Hulk Hogan. Some matches were a complete waste of time. Like the Bolsheviks vs. The Hart Foundation was only about 40 seconds long, Koko B Ware vs. Rick Martel was short and Big Bossman vs. Akeem was too short. Mr. Perfect vs Brutus Beefcake and Ted DiBiase vs Jake 'Snake' Roberts was really very good. <br /> <br /> Total grade - B
