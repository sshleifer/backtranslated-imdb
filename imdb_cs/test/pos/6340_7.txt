On a lonely road in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, a black man driving a car is being chased and hit by a truck falling off the road and dying. His daughter Cassie Robinson calls her former friend Dean and asks him to investigate a mysterious accident. Sam and Dean see that three African-Americans and Caucasian major cities were killed in strange accidents on the same road. When the truck threatens Cassie, her Caucasian mother, Mrs. Robinson, tells a tragic racist murder that happened thirty years ago, and the brothers realize that they have to fight the hate spirit in a truck. In this episode, Dean reveals his first and unique love for his brother, surprising Sam and showing that he has feelings, but also that his hunting wish is stronger than his love. The story is just sensible, it effectively touches upon the sensitive topic of racism and mixes it with the supernatural event. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Company 666" ("Route 666")
