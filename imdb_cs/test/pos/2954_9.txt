I always thought my father had a second life and waited impatiently for the development of 51 Birch Street as I sat down and looked at it for the first time. It is surprising that this film took me to places I did not expect and forced me to reconsider the assumptions and judgments. A remarkably remarkable personal story told in a smart but straightforward way. I was especially pleased with the use of a filmmaker who pulled out the type of her mother's diary - very effective. I read the previous comment and would like to note that the sound was fine when I watched it and suspect either that the film was somewhat altered or the theater could have contributed to a worse sound quality for the other writer.
