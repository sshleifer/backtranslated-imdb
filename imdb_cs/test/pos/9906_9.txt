This wonderfully funny comedy-drama stunned the crowd at the Philadelphia Film Festival and ended it in a wild applause. Underlined by sophisticated performances that took place in incredible casts, Jeff Hare's stunning show, fast pace and one of Peter Falk's best performances in the years, the film appears to be a loving tribute to the highlights and fears of family life. Falk stands out as the Jewish ninetysomething Morris Applebaum, a wildly eccentric Shakespeare thespian who decides to end his life, but not before he completes his three adult children and throws a "big fat Jewish suicide party". The film bends with indelible pleasures. There's Morris's "peaceful peace"; Laura San Giacomo is a passionate rendition of Morris's cynical daughter; a quick comedy dialogue that recalls the work of Neil Simon and Woody Allen; the timing of David Paymer, who plays the son of Morris' wounded psychotherapist; and Morris's patented egg creams (but be careful to drink them too quickly, causing ugly freezing of the brain). It's all surrounded by the feeling, intimate atmosphere of New York. Director Jeff Hare proves to be a master craftsman who tells an unforgettable performance from his cast and loan the film to cheerful humanity. I was happy to see the earlier film Hare: The Dark and Mighty "Perfect Little Man", starring Neal McDonough ("Minority Report") as a man in Los Angeles that is spreading into madness. The visceral grain of "Perfect" and the nostalgic breeze "Checking Out" are proof of Hare's eclecticism and broad talent. I look forward to checking his future work. <br /> <br /> I heard "Checking Out" lacks a distributor at this point. Some wise companies would well pick up this crowd-pleasing gem, it's a potential box-office titan in the spirit of "My Big Greek Greek Wedding." Most noble would give people around the world a chance to experience the joy of this film.
