Soul Calibur has always been my favorite series of fighting games ever. And SCIII is my favorite series. The graphics are very good. Much greater improvement over torn polygons in Soul Edge / Soul Blade. Characters have facial expressions, hair blows in the wind and even blinks. Soul Calibur has always been known for its interesting plot and characters and SCIII is no exception. Each character has a story that is detailed and well done. My favorite character is Chai Xianghua. She's cute, she's funny and she's a strong female character. Yeah, I know she's wearing pink and she has a friend (who will eventually save the BTW), but it seems to be more than her. Xianghua, like all other characters, has flaws and ups for his personalities, so no character is perfect or good guys. <br /> <br /> Music is beautifully composed for a series of fighting games. It doesn't sound like a cook (Vampire series), nor does it look like the soundtrack of old film pornography (Mortal Kombat). Characters have their own themes and many themes are designed to fit the culture of a part of the world. I don't think there's a song on this soundtrack. I do not like. Another great thing about this game is to create your own character similar to anime (Create a Soul). You might look cute or sexy or even ugly if you want. However, if you found a customization character that you like, remember the notes, otherwise you will not remember how you created this character. I found myself very dependent on CaS. Overall, I think Soul Calibur is my number one combat series of all time. He has everything I asked for. What more would I want?
