This is by far one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. Top 20 of my life. I laughed more than I had the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and shouted more than I had ever seen The Notebook. If you're looking for a moving movie without a clever edge ... this is one. It's real and powerful. You see it and you won't regret it. At first I was reluctant to watch it because I had to do a school project about speech disability. But this film is much more. It's about life, free and independent of the way you hold the world. It's about the disabilities every one of us has to keep us from seeing and missing us, but leaving everything else in the way.
