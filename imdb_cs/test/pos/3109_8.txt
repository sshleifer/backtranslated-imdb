Gosh, I learn very quickly that sometimes, when you see a movie as a youngster and then 20 years later, you get a different perspective - especially because you will learn more in 20 years. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - how big the director was and how much of this film he did. All I can say is .. I really liked this movie when I touched the area that accompanied me: a lifelong friendship between two women. Can EVER exist? Well, at certain doses, yes ... and this movie was running a bit ... "how". Being a youth who didn't have a life experience for the first time. So I focused more on the "rich" and "glorious" part between the two. At that time, I had no idea that there was a difference and what would happen to the two women who had appeared there ... and how it would affect their friendship. Through their men, their careers, the decades that defined them. And to realize that one thing remained stronger than anything else ... their friendship and mutual knowledge more than anyone else could have. Then I aged, studied the film a bit ... and watched the movie again with my best high school friend. We understand the "rich" and "famous" angle ... and we are still the best friends ... but this film is not a movie masterpiece ... sometimes it can be seen as a little bit ... A little over the top at the points (a little on level 'Dynasty' and 'Dallas' to me ..) and honestly I can identify the "teddy bear" scene because we share a bear, which means much more than a fun stuffed toy through our trials and tribulations with men / careers, et al. not like on top, it seems ....! As many have said, see Mega Ryan and Matt Latanzzi and Dack Rambo and David Selby are great in 1981. this is a nice "chick"!
