Brilliant Biographic FILM ?????? .. <br /> <br /> Well, that's definitely one of my very favorite. Biographical film. This movie came to me as a complete surprise. I have avoided this film for a long time. Now it was because I'm not a Jamie Foxx fan. I'm still not a big fan, but I'm sure I'm a FAN now. Well, every BIT deserved the Oscar. Its performance is one of the best performances I've seen in a long time. It's really sensational! Well telling or flowing the story is great for a biographical film. I'm a DRAMA fan, so I wasn't bored at all. <br /> <br /> I was too surprised to have the movie so glad I didn't see any shortcomings in the movie. I think there's no mistake in the movie. Maybe some event bugs But hey, who Cares? The performance of a woman who plays Ray's mother was also really good. And well Kerry Washington? she has so much potential .. if she is given the right role she could be just another Oscar winner. I Cried very badly ???? <br /> <br /> I don't give damn if things were crazy or not cuz this movie crazy me crying? And that is a lot for me! <br /> <br /> Everything in all the super movies ????. One of the best in this century! <br /> <br /> 10/10
