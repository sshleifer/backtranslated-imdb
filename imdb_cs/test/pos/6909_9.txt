I saw this movie as part of Midnite Madness in Sitges. Set in the 18th century England, the plot covers Arthur Blake's life from his first trip as an apprentice grave thief to his last confession on the eve of his execution. The storyline moves along a series of misadventures involving Arthur and his partner, who encounter various unfavorable characters and bizarre situations. The first thing that will hit you about this film is how precisely they managed to capture the look of the horrors of the Hammer period, the atmosphere set with lots of cemeteries loaded in fog, scenic pubs, and excellent stage design. For a movie called I Sell the Dead, did I expect the focus to be on horror? Don't get me wrong, there are some nervous moments and gore, but the tone is very comic, driven by the character's situation getting into their dialogue. The closest comparison to the scenes between the two leaders (Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan) is the interaction of the characters seen in classic English comedy Fools and Horses, Two Ronnies and Morecambe and Wise. Being strong and casting very familiar faces in Ron Perlman and Angus Scrimm picks up a film over many of the others on the lookout in Sitges. Overall, the film offers something very different from current mainstream horror revenue. and leaves a smile on her face.
