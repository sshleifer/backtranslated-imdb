I feel that Lisa Krueger is easily overlooked. I personally found her first film, 1996's Manny and Lo, to be a beautifully detailed character of the studio and performances were uniformly beautiful (with a special Mary Kay Place award). The film played a week or two in the big city centers and disappeared. One or two critics really liked it, but many considered it mild. Krueger's second film, Committed, was released this year (2000) (after almost two years of delay) and similarly disappeared. Again, the critics rejected the film as mild and pushed the film aside, praising the presence of Heather Graham's screen, but rarely her acting skills. And again, for me, commitment is a solid success. I feel like Krueger has a real voice and personal visual style, and these are features that should not be so easily ignored, simply because they work on a very limited screen. The title has several meanings, but mostly it refers to Joline (Graham )'s refusal to let her husband Carl (Luke Wilson) break in and leave her. Watching him from New York to El Paso, he is one of the most interesting stalkers in recent film history. Her respect for marriage promises leads her to Mexican mysticism and self-discovery. And yep, the plot is so simple and so easy to ignore. Joline is, of course, a crying voice of the generation whose parents divorced at a rate close to fifty percent. And for me, her personal revolution against broken promises and heritage of ruse is quite intelligent and powerful. Joline believes that people simply do not have enough faith in themselves, Joline must inevitably find that her beliefs are not in sync with the faith of society as a whole. A few remarks about her refer to her character as one-dimensional and I'm afraid this is a simplified reading of the film. Or maybe wrong. If Joline was just innocent, she wouldn't be interesting at all. It is the fact that he understands the world and refuses to play according to the rules of "normals" that make her so interesting. Sociologically, she is absolutely deviant. Krueger sometimes falls into the moment of the cutesy dialogue and her direction of this film has a somewhat strange dependence on cloud shots moving across the skyline of El Paso. However, her mistakes are quite rare and in this film, as in Manny and Lo, it's the day's performances. Graham has never been better because she never had a character so perfectly adapted to her as Joline. For the first time in his career, Graham seems to be playing with an adult, even with a slightly arrested development. The film carries perfectly. Luke Wilson and Casey Affleck (as Joline's brother) both have a number of subtle moments, as do Alfonso Arau, like Mexican Mystic and Mark Ruffalo and T-Bo, a slightly psychotic truck driver. As in Manny and Lo, characters are part of their environment, well-detailed absolutely organic creations. Sometimes these characters may seem unreasonably unpredictable, but they have a sense in their context. Even Goran Visnjic, as an artist turned on by Jolin's devotion, fits in some strange way, even though the stranger of his character is never discussed. Another commentator talked about stereotypical Mexican portraits. And again I'm tempted to call it wrong. Joline is looking for her own justification. She knows her determination is out of control, but she is looking for some spiritual path that could help her to realize herself. Arauin's character understands that most people don't believe in him and play their own faith when they see a woman who respects him. I think I can understand how this film can be considered erratic, I just disagree. It's consistently funny, often cheerful, and all the characters radiate warmth that is pretty beautiful. I give it one 7.5 / 10 and when I vote for it, it will go up to 8.
