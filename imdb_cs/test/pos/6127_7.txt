A very strange, disturbing but interesting movie. I don't think I ever needed to see what a human being can do with his ass, and I doubt I will ever want to see it again. This means there is much to be amused, such as Divine taking a classic stroll through Jayne Mansfield's "The Girl Can't Help It" and putting her legs in the grocery store between her legs. The whimsical feeling resembles Russ Meyer. Generally bad behavior, with a remarkable exception of divine.
