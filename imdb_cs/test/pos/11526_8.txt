I loved it. I was just sitting in the middle of the "Glass House" (turning it off ... God, what is morass predictable plot and bad acting) and then I saw this movie. I thought it was amazing. They loved both Cameron Diaz and Jordana Brewster in it. I liked the escape of the whole environment, traveling in Europe in the 1960s - but it was more realistic by showing the dark side and all the bad things that might have happened. I was quite intrigued, though I thought the parts were incredible.
