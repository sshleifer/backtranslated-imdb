This program is definitely my favorite TV comedy. Australia produces very few good programs - most of the TV I watch (and live in Australia) comes from the US and England. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this show is how controversial it is. Just as they went through a security summit at the APEC summit, which they pretended to be Canadian diplomats. The show consists of pre-recorded stunts, a general satirical discussion of current world events and sometimes on stage. parody. All this together to make a wonderful, very funny TV show. Segments like "Ad Road-test" and "Message from Osama bin Laden" are cheerful. For all those interested in watching a merry satirical television comedy - then it's definitely a show to watch. <br /> <br /> All the guys are great and doing a great job in half hour entertainment. <br /> <br /> A lot of it 10/10.
