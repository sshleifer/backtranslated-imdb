Like many sitcoms, "home war" is getting better with every episode. The characters are becoming real and I believe them as a family. I agree with many that the first few episodes were not so much fun; I thought the show would be canceled. But with the absence of "Malcolm on Wednesday" and "Arrested Development", "War" provides a much-needed live FOX action comedy on Sunday night. And compared to the rest of the sitcoms being broadcast right now, there's an even better choice. Her attraction, at least for me, lies in his real situations. Teenagers having sex. Not every parent likes how their children turn out. Parents fight and call names. But rather than relying on being "mean" like many shows, everything is nice at the end, which is the number one rule of a good sitcom. One of the deviations from the show is the narrative during / between. scene. The "Arrested Development / Family Guy" flashback style works fine, but the story can be too much. So everyone who needs to watch something on Sunday night should look at "The War at Home". especially with regard to what is at that time on other large networks.
