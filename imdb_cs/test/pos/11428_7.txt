If you want to see a movie starring Laurel & Hardy's Stan Laurel, it's not a movie for you. Stan would not start looking for the character and rhythms of these films for the next two years. However, if you want Rudolf Valentin's BLOOD AND SAND, which was produced in the previous year, to be good, it's a movie for you. All stops are pulled out, both in the physical comedy and on the title cards, and if the film is not held together by character, the plot of Valentino's film is used.
