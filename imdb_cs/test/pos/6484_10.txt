My first IMDB review, after several years of using this site constantly ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, he saw it on the second night tube, loved it. It's in the mind of Dangerous Minds or Substitution, but much better. For a moment he was sure that Rex was Speedy Levitch, at Waking Life, but it doesn't seem to be after the check. I see why he has many problems with this conspiracy and his poetry, but I also think that these people are close. It is true that the end was not exactly what I had hoped for, but overall it was so unique and well behaved, I cannot complain. I wouldn't say this cheesy, as one reviewer did, it was better than most 80's movies. And they abstained from playing any truly datable 80 music. Rex's beliefs or not, I love the original attempts to describe the meaning of life. And his theory of mutants is, in my opinion, original. He ran a lot, but showed how confused he was, and why he might have some psychological problems. And then in his moments of clarity, the philosopher was extraordinaire, a man who noticed the tiny details in his life and tried to express them. John Savage also impressed me very much as a teacher. Usually, actors fail in this role. He pulled it brilliantly. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed Waking Life, I wonder if you get a chance. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> pk
