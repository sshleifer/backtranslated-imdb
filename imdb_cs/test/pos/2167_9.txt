I'm crazy for a decent superhero movie. (I don't count the super budget bug, no Batman's story is one) A few of my favorites are The Phantom and the budget movie called Demolitionist. Black Scorpion can be added to this collection. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Demolitionist then take this movie. It's basically a copy of the heroine. (Even the stars in both movies) <br /> <br /> If you don't, let me explain to you that the cop's father is murdered and she is looking for revenge. She laces a black outfit (a sexy catwomanish, a modest outfit that looks absolutely great at Joan Severance) and goes out to kick some booty. It's a fun, action movie, you think, you don't want kids to see it ... without first checking it to see if you agree with the nice graphics sex scene that He's got Severance in it. Which was, in my opinion, a bonus (okay, give him a star of <grin>)
