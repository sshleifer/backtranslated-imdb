It's a movie that let me breathe ........ want to learn more about Afghan history and traditions. With today's "evil agents" mantras of reality, it was inspiring to experience the beauty of people and their beliefs. Casting was perfect, the scenery just amazing. The action was the first speed, and the fact that the academy overlooked it (except music) is unforgivable. The scenario is an amazing and emotional way. Calling an "ugly scream" from this guard. <br /> <br /> The film is worth watching the second and third time.
