I am a huge fan of M Lillard, so I ended up watching this movie. I sincerely doubt that if he wasn't in the film, I'd like to enjoy it or even watch it, but as soon as I watched, he realized that the story was pretty decent. I have to say the wrong end, but I saw it coming. It's a low-budget movie and some actors weren't really good, but in all this I rated this movie 7/10. The tension that Lillard actually was was what kept me interested in this film. <br /> <br /> Its a good rental! <br/> 7/10
