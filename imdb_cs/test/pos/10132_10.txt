Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. It's a hearty story that reaffirms the belief that we can all make a difference if we take care of it. I think there was a lot of realism with the characters. The screenwriter did not include racism in the way most movies do, which I thought made a more realistic story. they usually go overboard. There are so many cities like this where people of different races live harmoniously. Ed Harris should be nominated for an Oscar because he was brilliant as a leader and coach, realistic as a father, and showed warm care with the radio.
