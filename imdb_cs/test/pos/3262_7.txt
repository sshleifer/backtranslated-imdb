This Aussie movie filmed in 1999 makes OK work to display a bunch of small-time crooks at Kings Cross, Sydney. The story focuses on the unpleasant situation of a young bureaucracy who is threatened with life after pulling work for his future boss. Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown behaved very well. The storyline is quite believable with some very funny moments in one scene that revolves around bank robbery. Setting up various central themes for the story is pretty well done. E.g. When one crim is looking for bullets for his gun. I personally like to do gratuitous violence in movies, and in this regard, the film offended. He tried to show us the human side of baddies like Bryan Brown. The rest of the cast did OK, without any real prospects to remember. The direction was very good when he managed to create a believable movie that provided good entertainment. The main feature that makes it a good movie is Heath Ledger's acting and direction, and his successful portrayal of a naive young man who makes silly mistakes in short-term satisfaction thinks he's indestructible and doesn't realize that sinister people are waiting. leap on every mistake. Special mention goes to director Gregor Jordan. Rating in my book - 7 (out of 10).
