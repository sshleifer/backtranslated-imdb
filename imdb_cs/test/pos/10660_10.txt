Silent Movie Masterpiece The Battleship Potemkin (1925) was commissioned by the Soviet government to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the 1905 uprising and set the event as the heroic foretaste of the October 1917 revolution. Ironically, the film's director, Sergei Eisenstein, was one of the earliest and most influential advocates. formal approach to film art. Subsequently, Eisenstein's formalism and suspicious politics would cause innumerable conflicts with government agencies insisting on "socialist realism." Influenced by the Russian film theorist Lev Kulesh and through him the intolerance of DW Griffith (smuggled into Russia in 1919), Eisenstein built his films from a "collision" of quickly edited images, editing shots of various lengths, motion, content, lighting, and camera angle. Undoubtedly, the most memorable illustration of Eisenstein's stylistic approach - and probably the most cited and most studied sequence in the history of world cinema - is the "Odessa Steps" sequence in Potemkin. In the structure of Potemkin, the "five reeler" is divided into five narrative parts, an organization clearly derived from a five-member arrangement of Western drama. In "Men and Maggot," Eisenstein dramatizes the pre-revolutionary oppression and dissatisfaction of the working class sailors, because the situation inevitably follows the rebellion. Even before the senior sailors and their officers are visually introduced, Eisenstein is setting revolutionary conditions symbolically in the collision of waves that are spreading and threatening at sea. We see crowded, unhygienic conditions on board the ship. Eisenstein emphasizes the dehumanization of sailors with shots of arbitrary whips, cruel work, and - most reluctantly - meat infested with a worm for evening meal. The ship's close doctor is shown by other officers to declare the meat perfectly suited to serving with the dark soup, which is brewed like angry sailors. In accordance with the Marxist maxims, the Church also fails in men and we see that one of them smashes a plate written in words from the Lord's prayer from two different camera angles (perhaps the first deliberate "jump" in cinema history). Br /> <br /> Identified by inter-titles such as "Drama on Quarterdeck" and "Appeal from the Dead", Potemkin's second and third portions depict the true rebellion and burial on the mainland of its leader and the first hero of the revolution, Vakulinchuk. The united Vakulinchuk is appealing to the fraternity, the initial rebels are joined by the entire crew in attacking officers. A chaotic scene arises, whose violent passion is well served by Eisenstein's editing techniques. Officers' quarters are trampled and their privilege symbols are destroyed. The ship's doctor is thrown overboard, accompanied by dramatic junctions to deer meat, and his glasses are metonymously swinging in rigging. Tragically, Vakolinchuk's death is the price paid for revolt (without an omelette without breaking eggs) and he is interpreted with dignity at the Odessa pier. Hundreds of ordinary citizens of Odessa meet with sailors to honor him and promise "Death to the oppressors". Fist shots gripped and opened the signal of the birth of revolutionary consciousness. The complex and unforgettable sequence of Odessa Steps represents the fourth act of the film. It starts with uplifting music and a series of detailed shots and medium shots on uplifting faces of different people on the shore and selected objects (parasol, glasses, stroller). Suddenly (as he announces the title card in huge letters), musical stops and lines of soldiers with drawn rifles and fixed bayonets appear at the top of the stairs. Here Eisenstein gives the full power of collision adjustment, because almost a hundred shots are combined to contrast with the panicism of the chaos and victimization of the citizen with the relentless attack of soldiers who drove the citizens to pedaling horses and flying sabers waiting Cossacks. . The Mise-en-scene is framed by a statue of Caesar at the top of the staircase and a church below, symbolic metonyms for Russian repressive institutions: the Imperial Monarchy and the Orthodox Christian Church. <br /> <br /> Punctuation sequences are two scenes involving mothers and children. In the first, mother and young boy who was introduced among the joyful faces in the crowd, he is among the first victims of defeat. The boy is shot, but the mother continues to run until her cheeks are secured by a horrified look at the fallen body's son. A camera with a much slower rate of editing follows the mother when she carries her child's dead body up the stairs to face the soldiers (shown only in the diagonal line of shadows). Gather her dead. After this calm, the carnage continues another dozen cuts until the other mother is shot by the stomach (mother's womb of Russia?) When she tries to protect her baby in his carriage. In the scene superbly imitated in Untouchables, the carriage slips incoherently across the staircase. The horrified faces of wretched citizens are watching the slow progress toward its destruction. When the carriage reaches the bottom, it cuts into the Cossack's sword control, and the classic Kulesh effect suggests what we don't see: the defeat of this pure and symbolic innocent. The last series of shots in the Odessa sequence is from three stone lions, one at rest, one sitting and one roar. Editing animates them into a visual metaphor of awakened people's rage. The Fifth Act returns us somewhat contradictory to the battleship when the rebellious sailors flee the high seas and wait to meet other ships from the fleet. They and the viewer expect retaliation, but when the meeting takes place, no shots are fired and instead all sailors rip and throw their hats into the air with a friendship symbol. Eisenstein was rewriting history at this point because the revolution was not successfully launched for the next twelve years. But this Potemkin battleship is one of the key works of the silent film era and retains extraordinary cinematic power.
