It was a sweet, intro for the most elegant soldier Sailor Sailor Mercury. It consisted of a new "in croud", Merciurios. In the beginning he wrote a love letter Ami, which would of course starltling and of course Ami thiks is a chibi-Einstien, and he is appealing (ended up as Umino (Melvin)). This was halarios (Minako's exesialy is "it's not skin from my throat" scene (HOT!)) Well, I really like the Bishojo Senshi Sailor Moon series, I personally think its the best anime ever !, But, this movie was nice, funny, but not like an adventure like Sailor Moon R- It was more like an "S" movie. I saw it @ Sailor Moon Univewrse, with a real player, and it was pretty good. (Over all)
