Who said it must be credible? Do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit down to see this movie. You will enjoy the experience much more. You will forgive some of the more exotic plots of the film and simply accept it for what it is - a great family movie. I appreciated that I don't have to worry about "controversial elements" in children's film once. That's the ticket price for me. And he can maintain his impeccability without being obvious - the older film will enjoy this film. Good enough humor to be interested in adults. Very good movie.
