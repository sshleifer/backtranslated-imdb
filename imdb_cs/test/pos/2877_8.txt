WWE did so. They spilled into the film, the first of which is No No Evil, playing his own Kane. I caught this movie and didn't expect it to be a great movie ... It seemed like a clich√© and it looked like nothing new. To my surprise, it wasn't really bad. The viewer said it was a good B-horror pastime and honestly this is the best way to describe it. Now I asked how Kane would stick ... Well, let's say he made an absolute bad ass from the character "Jacob Goodnight". He sold the role really well and looked menacing. But what can you expect from someone who is almost 7 feet tall and weighs about 320 in a solid muscle. The game was decent and of course the story wasn't new, but we all know it. Direction, as well as cinema, was done very well and the background of the hotel really looked dilapidated and well done. Since it was directed by the director of a porn movie, I was quite surprised. I recommend this movie if you are looking for mindless gore and killing and just some general entertainment. Think of this film as a modern day on Friday, 13th. And to save space for the end, it's good. And sticking to credits too ...
