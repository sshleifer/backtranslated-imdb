It was / is an incredible movie, with incredible cast, music, singing, story, etc. It is a tragedy that some arrogant families (Gerswhins or Premingers) can keep it generation after generation. I wanted to see it all my life again. I just found this page and read why it wasn't available. Too bad for these families for their pettyness. My wife is from Germany and she never saw the movie. Neither my children, nor my grandchildren. It is very sad that a film of this depth and quality is not available to them. Where these families will perform to make such a sophisticated, self-sufficient, egoistic, condescending decision to ban generations from enjoying this movie, these stars, these performances, this music! Make a video and let them review and enjoy!
