The Earth's final conflict began as a new world, a new vision from Star Trek creator, something fresh and unique full of great elements. A very good cast with extremely trustworthy Kevin Kilner like William Boone, a former good cop, is starting to work as guardian of a mysterious extraterrestrial ambassador (Talons), after his wife's death in special circumstances. But soon Kilner's character joins the group with the mission to find out what the alien's intentions are, why they seem so nice and take care of the human race. Soon this group of resistance will begin to discover the ominous plans of the Talons that use people in their own problems to survive their own destruction. As I said earlier, the show started great, everything was almost perfect, including characters like Da'an, the original Da'an was a great secret because it seems to be a nice creature but at the same time has its own evil plans. manipulating people in the country. Soon, Zo'or, who was not bad, came to ... he marked the beginning of the fall of the show because he became the first great enemy of the people, the incarnation of evil and killed what might be something bigger in Da'an. The first season ends in a great way with the dead Boone and the second shows a new lead character (Liam), a hybrid human being and Kimer (another alien race) with some very interesting abilities. It will replace Kilner's character in a good way, so other stories will be better, including conflict with jarids and atav. But as I said the lines before Zo'ora's evil became more important, new conflicts were less realistic than the same Talons. Over time, the whole story of the alien roots of Liam, where it almost totally erased the same thing with other things from previous periods. So when the original Earth conflict began in the last season, it was almost forgotten dreams, all the magic was missing, just to let some futile intentions leave the show alive, including the return of Kilner and Liam to a few episodes. The final episode was just proof of how bad the show was with so many bad changes (thinking that the writers of some episodes didn't know anything about the first stories) was one of the worst results I've ever seen in the TV Show. The real shame, because the Earth's Final Conflict began as something unique, fresh, cast stories, after watching so many shows from the USA, something from Canada, the creator of the Star Trek was amazing, but in the end everything got worse. I hope that once someone will make a remake of this show, without, of course, using the fourth and fifth seasons (except for the cast, everyone was perfect in their work). I can still dream about better things.
