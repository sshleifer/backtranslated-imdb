This version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is truly original. Same parts of porn, fairy tale and musical comedy - this movie is definitely a strange piece of adult film history. Alice is a sex naive librarian who ends up in a "Wonderland" rabbit where she meets all kinds of "experienced" quizzes like Mad-Hatter (who likes to pull his dong out whenever he is) possible), Humpty Dumpty (who broke his wiener with his shell), Tweedledee and Tweedledum (brother / sister sex -crazed duo) and bi-sexual Queen - among others. <br /> <br /> This version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is actually quite tame by the standards of time - the time when a lot of porn was average. lively and ugly (as he remarked on the "rough" sub-genre) - this one is actually quite funny and strangely persistent. It is such a thing that you would show your children - if it wasn't for graphic sex. A little slow to get to "good things" ... but really fun. Oh - and some music numbers are downright cheerful. If you are a drinker - you have a couple if you are a smoker - throw a pair and give this one shot. 8/10
