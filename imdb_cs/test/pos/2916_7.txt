I'll start at the beginning and say, "I like the movie." It's amazing, it's great, it's grip and it's fun. Sinhue doctor, sitting in front of his little stone hut to write his memoir. And what a story it is! Taken from the river and raised by an older couple who stabbed him, he became a doctor for the poor. She brings herself to Horemheb, who sees glory, while Sinhue sees healing. And they both get into the future Pharaoh Anknaten (forgiving my spelling) who endures an epileptic seizure. And this pharaoh has another "mistake": he believes in one god instead of the pantheon of the gods. It was absolutely revolutionary then. Sinhue and Horemheb grow up. One night Sinhue sees a woman who loses him. She gives up her practice, sells her parents' house and even their tombs to spend the night with her. Does it? I won't say it. Meanwhile, Merit, a pub serving a sweet simplicity that was a strong force of Jean Simmons, falls for Sinhue. It falls under his spell and under the spell of faith in one god. Victor Mature works perfectly like Horemheb. Edmond Purdom is sincere as Sinhue's lost doctor (he finds redemption? Stay tuned). Even Bela Darvi, the woman who steals Sinhue's heart, is not as bad as everyone has said. The fact that she was the mistress of Daryl F. Zanuck had nothing to do with the casting? Yeah, right ... all the time, she wasn't that bad - I saw worse. I think she did better in Egyptian than many young actresses today. I said it earlier and I will say it again - I like the movie. I recommend it. You think that despite some hammy acting. Have fun with this movie; it's worth it.
