A bright young man interested in "serious" music (certainly a vanishing breed - who will play the violin when no one can play the violin?) - that could be an interesting fiction about street children and great music stars. Indeed, the greatest violinist of his generation and the film gives him a rare chance on the screen to show his technique, children, especially Gene Reynolds, are fine and everything is a good example of a first-class studio family fare at the end of the 1930s. but it's a nice way for a smart family to spend a rainy afternoon with AMC or Video Store --- good luck at the blockbuster !!! !
