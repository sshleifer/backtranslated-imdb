Especially looking at the amount of crap that made on DVD. I found this movie very funny. Rip Torn is classic with its spikes; Rob Schneider, if he's very annoying as an overcompensating midshipman; Bruce Dern is a great "villain". The whole cast seems to have a blast and it's not at the expense of the audience. If you just like the ordinary funny comedy and aren't too deep in the sense, you can just fall in love with this.
