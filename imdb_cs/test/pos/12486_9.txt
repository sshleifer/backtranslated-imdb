H.G. Cluozot had problems working in France after producing "Le Corbeau" in 1943, which was made by a German company and later judged by French as a piece of anti-French propaganda. Louis Jouvet, an admirer of Clouzot's work, invited him to direct the "Quai des Orfevres" thriller, where he played an ambiguous police inspector investigating the murder that happened in the Paris Music Hall. Without mutual knowledge, seductive cabaret singer Jenny Lamoure (Suzy Delair) and her jealous piano-companion husband Maurice, who is madly in love with her (Bertrand Blier, father of Bertrand Blier), tries to hide (without mutual knowledge) what they believe is their participation in the murder? He enters a tenacious police officer (Louis Jouvet) who is determined to discover the truth. Jouvet practically stole a movie with a beautifully cynical and sentimental performance. "His character, his eagle profile and his unique way of speaking made him unforgettable." "Quai des Orfevres", a humorous and atmospheric observation of human weaknesses, was a great return to H.G. Cluozot, the fine director of "French Hitchcock".
