Norma Shearer is dazzled when she is transformed from a poor, blind house to a tempting potential divorce. Most of the 1930 films have creaking edges on them - working with the camera is sometimes slow - but we have to forgive them all these excitement for their long qualities. As a guest of eccentric world-trotting Marie Dressler - Shearer mixes with a strange assortment of lovelorn types, including her long-lost husband. Dialogue is fun, clever from time to time and cue performances. Shearer and Dressler shine the most. Shearer even performs his piano experience in musical brevity. Her strange, yet appealing posture and "camera affair" are visible throughout the text - and affects all emotional notes, truly and on purpose. For his time. . .and a good show.
