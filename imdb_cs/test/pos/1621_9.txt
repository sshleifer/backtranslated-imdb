I recently got a movie and all I can say is a good movie. There are plenty of famous Roman monuments and historic sites. He comes from the same writer and director of The Da Vinci Code. Tom Hanks plays with Ewan McGregor and Ayelet Zurer. The film begins with an experiment with space and time in Sweden until one of the canisters is stolen the most hated enemy of the Illuminati Church. It is difficult to discuss conspiracy without spoiling anything. It is the race of all Rome that follows the Illuminati journey to reach the Illuminati secret meeting place. While racing against the time to find the Illuminati way. Despite all his film worth seeing hell I watched it 3 times, and I still like it, so eventually go buy it. It's much better than movie 2010. And the end has one amazing twist.
