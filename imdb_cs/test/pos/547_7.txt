Major Attraction Anywhere But Here's Outstanding Performance by Natalie Portman. She gave her rather ungrateful character and much appreciated emotional depth. Susan Sarandon, a great actress, is as honest as a mother. I thought the chemistry between the two stars was credible, chemistry that could be developed more with a more inclusive scenario. I'm not saying that the scenario was in any case bad, I just say it sometimes seemed insufficient. I don't think it was the scriptwriter's fault. The film suffered to be too long, and sometimes became blurred in longer scenes. The film looks beautiful, with a good direction and excellent performance. All in all, attentively, but perhaps for an older audience. Bethany Cox.
