This is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated Bruce movies, his amazing stunning movie with a neat story and amazing performance by Bruce Willis! All characters are great and I thought that Willis and Spencer Breslin were just amazing together, and Bruce Willis is just amazing in this!. This is definitely one of Bruce's best comedy performances (the thing waaaaaaaaaamabulance was great) and I thought it was also very well written and done, plus the final is especially cool! It's nice and it was great as you see Russell (Willis) change in the movie! plus the end was pretty good. I think it should be higher than 6.0 and it's one of the best movies I've ever seen! and moreover, it has many surprising moments. All the characters are extremely likeable, and it also has a cute story angle too, plus Bruce and Spencer Breslin both had really funny lines (Holy Smokes!). This is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated Bruce movies, his amazing stunning movie with a neat story and a brilliant performance by Bruce Willis and I say he must see it! The direction is great! Jon Turteltaub has a great job with a really good camera and just keep the movie at a very fast pace. Acting is excellent! Bruce Willis is amazing as always and is amazing here, he gives one of his best comedy shows, is jolly had wonderful chemistry with both Spencer Breslin and Emily Mortimer, had some humorous lines, and was dead in all the movie, he was one of the main reasons why I really liked this movie! (Willis's rules !!!!!!!). Spencer Breslin is fantastic as the younger version of Russell, he was very funny and he didn't get nervous once, he's one of the better actors. Emily Mortimer is good as Amy and she was really cute, she liked her, she also had a good chemistry with Bruce. Lily Tomlin is funny like Janet. Jean Smart is good with what she had to do, which wasn't much. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall, he must see! **** z pf 5
