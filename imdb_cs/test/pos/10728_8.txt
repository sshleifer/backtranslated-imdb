I thought this movie was pretty good and pretty funny for a movie heavy on emotions. I agree with what another user wrote about a script that is likeable to the three main characters. I think that's what made the film good. It was neither wicked nor Mrs. Kramer, and I think it was refreshing to see that two people were basically working on the problem themselves and eventually doing the best for Billy. And although it was a bit weird, in fact I liked the music in this movie. For some reason, it seemed that the music was appropriate for the trip to which the three main characters set out. This movie shot quite well and not doodle, as some emotionally heavy movies tend to do. He dealt with a serious situation, but didn't take it too seriously. He just told the story in a straightforward way and worked pretty well.
