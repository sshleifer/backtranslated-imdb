After the success of "Muppet Babies" Warner Brothers created "Tiny Toons". Instead of creating Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and all the other gang kids Looney Toon, they created new animal characters that were children with their own personalities, but personalities who, however, reflected their predecessors. Leadership included Buster and Babs Bunny (no relationship that became their running gag or catching phrase), Puck Duck, Hampton Pig, Dizzy Devil, Shirley '' Loon, Elmira, Montana Max, Furball, Sweety, Rats and Assorted Animals \ t Perfecto Prep, and original Looney Toons cast. "Tiny Toons" lived in Acme Acres and attended the Acme Looniversity, where the Looney Toon gang worked as teachers who served as instructors for the younger generation of ins and out of comedy. <br /> <br /> During the show, various different shots were taken at Bush SR. administration, pop culture, and associated with various other gags and spoofs. Buster & Babs, probably show the main characters as mentioned above, were similar to Bugs Bunny in some ways, but they also had their own different personality ticks and comic styles, namely Babs' tendency to impersonate anyone and all while Buster, able to be himself, usually played a straight man (or straight rabbit) on Babs' rumors. The Duck Regiment was a virtual copy of Daffy Duck (not a Daffy screwdriver, but Daffy's egomaniac), with almost as big an ego as Daffy, as well as an obsession with Buster and Babs when Daffy had a bug upgrade. in his experiments, he was flat on his face, yet he came out strangely. Hampton was still a shorter version of Porky Pig and had an ungrateful job of playing Porky on Plucky Daffy. Shirley, a blond duck, was the new age girl Plucky would go in and out of the mocking stages or rivalry for her affection. Dizzy was a purple version of the Tasmanian Devil. Furball was a quiet Sylvester and Sweety was a pink Tweetie. There was also a purple female skunk who longed for a friend and pint size version of Wile Coyote and Road Runner. Evil was defined in the form of Montana Max, a rich child who was always out there to make the dollar or people lives miserable. There was also Elmira, a terrified animal lover, all afraid. And then there was Godo Dodo, a strange thing-and-ma-gig creature that had no clearly identified species except that he was from "Wacky Land" or something like that. References to pop culture included Batman (quite often), Michael Jackson, Vanilla Ice, Dances with Wolves, Indiana Jones, Star Trek, Supergirl, Fast Food links, The Ten Commandments, Twilight Zones, Saturday Night Life and even the Simpsons. Not only funny, but also managed to be warm and touching, something that is his successor to "Animaniacs", which has never been achieved. This is followed by "Taz-Mania".
