Here's another fun movie Clint Eastwood with tension. I'm not his fan, but I have to give him: he knows how to make fun movies. This is another example. Nor did it hurt that John Malkovich was his star. Now there's an intense actor! In this story, Malkovich plays the killer and is fascinating to watch, thanks to his various disguises and the amazing dialogue he has been given. He also has an interesting voice. Rene Russo is quite low (for her), but that's okay and Eastwood plays the usual lottery-pony role that his superiors didn't appreciate, but showed them all up at the end. I think he couldn't stop playing "Dirty Harry" -types, but he played them well. There were a few negatives to this movie, however, and that: credibility in parts like there was a couple if it was real life, the killer would do it with Eastwood. Especially the climate scene had too many holes in it. There was also too much abuse of the Lord's name. Overall, it's good, escape fare.
