The third record in the "Stepford" franchise, but apparently the three made-for-television obscure sequels are incredibly obscure and difficult to track down, while the 70th original as well as the blockbuster remake with Nicole Kidman are commonly known and very popular. I haven't seen the Revenge of the Stepford Wives in the early 1980s or The Stepford Husbands in the mid-1990s, but this "The Stepford Children" is a pretty charming and very fun little movie. It is basically the same film as the original; obviously less mysterious but much cheesier and incredibly 80th to nth grade. The main difference here, as the name suggests, is that not only the liberated women, but also the rebellious and punk teenage descendants of the city undergo a typical and highly effective "Stepford treatment" licensed by the local men's association. For some reason, the scenario attempts to keep the Stepford secret until the end of the movie, even though no one will know that this sequel will be tracked before the original is checked out, and probably everyone also knows about denouement. The Harding family is full and ready to move from the grisly city of New York to the small and quiet Stepford community. Especially Father Steven is excited about their new life because he has already lived in Stepford and has always wanted to return since his first wife, whom his new wife Laura and teenage children Mary and David know very little, has died under mysterious circumstances . The city is almost too perfect, with picturesque neighbors and model students, and especially modern teenagers face tremendous difficulty to adapt. Their efforts to modernize the site and take local youth to Stanford in the campaign to cause confrontation with major burghers, especially members of the Men's Association, and give family relationships under great stress. David meets and falls in love with the last "normal" girl at Lois School, but when he turns into a home figurine overnight, David can persuade his skeptical mother to explore the ominous Stanford secret. The first hour of "The Stanford Children" is slow and somewhat tame, but the finale is cheesy and cheesy, like the VHS promise, and as a thriller from the late 1980s it should really be. The Modus operandi behind Stanford's secrets is illustrated in more detail and I think it will be appreciated by horror fans and lovers of the original film. At least I did. The overall plot still makes no sense, and the script is full of irrational aspects, yet it is an engaging pattern and undoubtedly one that evokes an atmosphere of tension and fear. The performances are far above average. Especially arrogant and uncomfortable members of the Men's Association display credible characters, and even teenage players Tammy Lauren and Randall Batinkoff perform impressive performances. We recommend without hesitation!
