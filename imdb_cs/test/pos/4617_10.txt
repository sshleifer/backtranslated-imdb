I have to admit that I fell into a cynical trap because I believed the Australians could not do drama unless it meant a lot of crying and I was an Australian. Sad, isn't it? While this film includes crying, its not a dramatic cry, its sincere emotions shine through. Also this movie is whodunnit. I knew what the end result would be when I started watching, so I tried to guess who would do it. I missed a mile. I was impressed when I found out that the director, Murali Thulluri was only about 21 when he made this film. I'd like to shake my hand. He knows how to make a movie. I hope she has more arrivals. <br /> <br /> All the characters we meet before the main credit title (about 12 minutes) are opponents. Everyone was worried in their own way, and they were all selfish as others. Even if they are nice. The saddest scene in the movie, and there are some that are hard to watch, is the last scene in which we are formally introduced to the true main character and we talked about his nephew. This scene made me cry. My belief in the Australian drama has been restored. We are masters of comedy, but I was bored with comedy. Murali, if you can check it, you touched my soul and thank you for that.
