That was really one of the most enjoyable specialties I saw on TV. He's just an incredible artist. His personality shines through every song he does. I really wish it was available as an uncut DVD so I could watch it again and again without -beeps-for explicit language. I had no chance to see him live, but that's something I really want to do right now. I can't forget my backup singers. They really added a lot of show and humor. With their campy style and beautiful dance moves, they really complement Dan's true talent. I wish there were other songs on his live CD, which is also incredible. It's refreshing to see someone like him. Just incredibly personality and reality, I really can't say enough good things about Dan and this show. Once again I wish it was available as an uncut DVD.
