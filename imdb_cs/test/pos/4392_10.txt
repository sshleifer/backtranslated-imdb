I thought this movie was great! I saw it when it came out in the theaters so I don't remember all the details. I remember being based on Homer's story of Odysseus. The names of places and events are changing, but you can still see the similarity to the story. <br /> <br /> I found it funny how they get in trouble and how they get out of it. I really enjoyed this version of the upgraded old stories much better than Romeo and Juliet with Clair Danes. I agree that in some parts of the story they sometimes get a little silly, but it's all a great adventure with some great actors.
