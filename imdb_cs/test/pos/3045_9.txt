I first saw this movie when I was in grade 8 and I remember that it had a profound effect on me. I saw again about a year ago (I'm 29 now) and I still moved it in a similar way. It's a great movie that embodies the struggle of "principle vs. pragmistism ‚Äù. Voight's character is an idealistic teacher who doesn't give up any psuedo-racist inclination of Mr. Skeffington's superintendent. The story also embodies the struggle for how older people often resist change and more specifically cultural change. Often at the expense of children. When these battles finally get to boil, Pat Conroy loses and pragmatism rules victorious. Or yes? The children they have to leave are better off when they know it, more exposed to the "real" world and classical music. The second school teacher respected him and learned a lot about himself. Great movie with a refracting end. I recommend that everyone who has enjoyed the film read Pat Conroy's "The Water is Wide". He'll stay with you!
