This is probably the biggest war movie and certainly one of the biggest movies. There is no sentiment, patriotic agenda, or a hopeful message of universal brotherhood in this gloomy glimpse of what we can only call hell. It is this calm rigor and lack of manipulation that give the film its stunning power. There are no attempts to make the hero of Ichikawa a hero of Tamura. It's just a bad condemned sap trying to stay alive in a world of horror she hopes, but she's not sure she can hang her humanity in this process. Ichikawa is a wild lack of cant and illusion to make fires on the plain state itself. Ichikawa died February 2008.
