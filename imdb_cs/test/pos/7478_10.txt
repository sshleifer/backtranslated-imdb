I loved this movie! Fantastically original and different! A strong, intense, hard and exciting movie that has the right touch (dark?) Humor. If you are tired of a typical, exaggerated, ridiculous Hollywood B.S. Movies, how many big blasts and horrible and unrealistic shoot ups in combat with weapons that offend your intelligence, we can take, then this movie is for you. Fantastic characters that are beautifully original and credible, and solid performances of all actors, not a weak character or performance in the movie. Skip Woods's film is the breath of fresh air and I appreciate his originality and effort, his film has a cross between Quentin Tarantino and Cohen brothers (in my opinion, not a bad mix at all). This film catches your throat and doesn't let go, there's nothing boring or chewing about this movie. The only disappointment is that no one knows about it, I have all recommended it to thank me and share my opinion. This film is a welcome change / alternative from the canned Hollywood main garbage being produced today, even with its big actors, big explosions, special effects and huge budgets. It's terribly wild, intense, violent, graphic, witty and raw (I mean in a good way, without a fake Hollywood Polish here). Thank you all who are involved in the creation of this film, you have done an incredible job!
