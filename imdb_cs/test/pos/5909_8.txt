Billy Wilder created a somewhat conventional biopic about Charles Lindberg's flight. It structures the film using flashbacks to tell Lindberg the story of the famous Atlantic flight that is currently happening in the film. Flying by air an hour by hour is not a matter of excitement, and Wilder does not deviate from his Lindberg theme as a common man hero, so things are predictable. However, James Stewart is well occupied and quite credible as Lindberg, and many obstacles he has to overcome just to keep his plane in the air keeping one watching. The film goes through the most successful way Wilder connects parts of the story together in a way that creates tension, then relief, then tension again. Cinematography is pretty good, Franz Waxman's score improves the scenes and Stewart seems to come alive, so one might think Lindberg could be. In the end, there is a little religious schmaltz from the fifties, but the overall direction, playing and high production values ​​overcome the predictability of the story (would anyone really see this picture and do not know that Lindberg did it across the Atlantic?) since. Billy Wilder has made films of a wide variety of types, and this is the one that represents his craftsman-like best.
