Finally, I was struck by watching the Christmas VHS in Connecticut, what another movie reminded me. If it wasn't because the second was done 20 years later, I'd say it was a remake. Just like Rock Hudson was a fake fishing expert for Abercrombie & Fitch, who had to get some Barbara Stanwyck plays the 40th version of Martha Stewart on a fishing tournament. Stanwyck is a cooking columnist who has built this whole picture of life in a small Connecticut farm with her husband and children. These wonderful delicacies. The problem is she is unmarried, childless, writes her new York column and doesn't know how to cook water. But her writing is a hit with the public. Problems come when he is kidnapped into a home cooking Christmas dinner for a war hero sailor played by Dennis Morgan who gets to sing a few songs as well. I have to keep the image at all costs. And her publisher Sidney Greenstreet likes the idea so well that she invites her to dinner. So, with the borrowed farm, baby, and Reginald Gardiner, who wanted it to happen to Stanwyck, he was trying to get over it. Christmas in Connecticut is now Yuletide's classic and deserved. Leadership is warm and human and has a great deal of support from the assembled players. S.Z. As a Hungarian restaurant owner / friend of Stanwyck, from whom she gets cooking information and Una O'Connor as a housekeeper, Sakall has a nice chemistry between them. Reginald Gardiner and Stanwyck have no chemistry at all, it's clear to everyone, but Reggie and he's funny in his stuffed shirt way. Most people remember this movie as one of several Sidney Greenstreet comedy businesses. If it's not a complete villain, a cynical observer of life or a tyrannical tycoon, Greenstreet is just a few other things on screen. Christmas in Connecticut gave him a rare opportunity to see his own image and make the most of it. In Barbara Stanwyck's biography, she mentions that she appreciates Christmas in Connecticut as a welcome change from some of the Terrible parts, like the Double Compensation she recently did. One of the things that made making the film so enjoyable was between taking, director Peter Godfrey and Greenstreet would make some improvised entertaining cast and crew with English musical Hall numbers. Made for a relaxed and warm set and fit accordingly. Now, if only someone shot those numbers.
