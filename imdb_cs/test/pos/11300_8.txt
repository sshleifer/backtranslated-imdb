You've heard about this movie a long time ago and finally found it on eBay for five bucks. I didn't expect much, but wow, I was sometimes surprised. It's the story of a boy and girl in love trying to escape an evil king who wants a girl for himself and takes place in a huge castle, reminds me of an ICO for PS2 because some shots give you a sense of vertigo.Sounds quite standard, but this movie is insane! It is hard to believe that such an original animated element was made in 1952. The king was also probably one of the most beautiful characters I have seen in a long time, with a woman's walk, strange eyes (usually crossed) and a soft but frightening voice. The only problem I had with the film was that the boy and the girl had no personality and almost no lines except the call for Mr.. Wonderbird (Big Talking Green Bird) Save. The animation was fantastic in most areas, but some cells were missing in some scenes that were sucked. It's incredibly original with flying police and giant mosses and sometimes laughing out loud, it's a real pity it's such a dark title because it's a really good movie. Try it sometime.
