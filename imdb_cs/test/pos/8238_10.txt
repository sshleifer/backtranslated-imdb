Light, uplifting and engaging movie. Watching Irene Dunne is a pleasure! When you look at her, Irene Dunne stops being Paula Wharton in every way. Irene Dunne enjoyed all the movies I saw and that would be almost all. What a pity that most of her films need restoration so badly. I hope Irene Dunne's movie will be restored before it's too late to be such treasures Thank God it's not a case with over 21. funny comedy with serious undertones. I agree with the previous commentary on "World and Apple Pie" that was one of many movie highlights. I read somewhere that Irene Dunne helped write this speech with Vidor (Irene Dunne was a very good and charitable person in private life) and she seems to be appearing in the movies!
