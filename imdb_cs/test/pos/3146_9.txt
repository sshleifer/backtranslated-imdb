In the world of "shorts" (most of them not) this film is a jewel. Quiet, apt look into the world of a young woman who is a reader for a blind woman, here stellar Elizabeth Franz - this film carries textures, layers and a visual narrative of a sumptuously painted still life. The dialogue is minimal, cinematography is overwhelming and the direction is clear, clear and convincing. I saw this movie at a loud and crowded Tribeca bar festival - and during the first two minutes (and for the first time in the night) the crowd lowered. <br /> <br />.
