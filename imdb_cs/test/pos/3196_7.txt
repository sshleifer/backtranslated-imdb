This short film was included in the fourth part of the "Short Cinema Journal" - a movie I rented from Netflix, but it seems to have been a monthly movie series for people who like average modern short films and love to have a full DVD advertising. So far I have tried two of the DVD magazines and I felt angry at the horrible journey the viewer had to navigate on disk to see movies. Talk about an exaggerated and overly complicated way to do this! While I am and will continue to see as many shorts as I can, I really wonder if I will bother with the magazines because of these factors. Now it could be because I wasn't happy with the disc that I was not favorably favored with this Portuguese short animated film. This is certainly possible. However, even though this is the case, I feel that other reviews were too positive for this simple little movie. Some of the works of art were really nice - I liked how simple black-and-white drawings suddenly became a 3-D environment because the camera went from a boring remote shot and sank into the city below. That was beautiful and he did some work. But as for the story of a cat that wants to go to the moon, nothing has done it to me. / 09. It was a pretty unusual collection of art films. But this time I saw the CAT STORY and MOONA with a completely different soundtrack, and the boy did it. Instead of Portuguese with subtitles, it had a French accented narrator who spoke English in Noir Style. Although I usually hate dubbing, this time it really made a movie. Telling the Portuguese version leaves much to be desired if you do not know the language or understand the subtleties. If you don't speak a language, try searching for a different version (if you understand English).
