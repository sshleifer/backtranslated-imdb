Well, I admit that the Loky Tunes Inki cartoons are pretty offensive and I understand why Warner Brothers withdrew them. Today, a huge blow and a very stereotypical Inki is politically correct. However, cartoons were well made and it's a shame they're not released with some explanatory prologue (such as Leonard Maltin, who is part of some recent politically incorrect Donald Duck cartoons recently released on DVD). In other words, blowing up cartoons is completely forgetting our history. In addition, Inki, Little Black Sambo and other racist cartoons are there - mainly on the Internet. This Inki cartoon has our little hero out of the hunt. Initially chasing a cute caterpillar, it later happens to be a lion - a lion who is more than happy to make Inki a dinner. However, through all this, a strange Minah appears over and over again, and finally you will see why this bird is so important to the story. <br /> <br /> Cute, well done and smart. I like Inki cartoons. In addition, I am pleased to have shown them that extremely loyal liberal friends are just to look at them for having apoplexic seizures or even heart attacks. Lots of fun, people!
