Like a sci-fi fan, I also like Alien. But Pitch Black is definitely better than Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. He plunges well into the Alien series. But he's not a stranger, it's something else. OK, enough comparisons. This movie, but I think: Why do people fear darkness. You can't escape from the darkness. It is impossible. You have to be confronted with darkness and what's in the dark. I also liked in this movie that Vin Diesel Richard B. Riddick is not a typical good boy. He had a secret and had done bad things in the past. For other people, the hero is trying to save them all. First he wants to get out of this planet himself. There are other metaphors in this story. Every big science fiction fan should see this picture.
