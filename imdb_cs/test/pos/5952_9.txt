OSS 117 was fun from start to finish. It is difficult to define why one film touches or connects with you or not, and I will not try to analyze such a perfect comedy, so politically incorrect that even academic papers should be devoted :) ) <br /> <br /> Everything is old fashioned, from ladies' clothing (sigh!), Mambo dance, "heroic singing" ... ("Bambino" sounds like Italian canzonetta sung in ... Arabic :)!) . Hubert is physically impressive but stupid as hell. She looks like Sean Connery of all 007s, but it's definitely more sympathetic because he's ... stupid, talking all the time with his mind, giggling, even having some homoerotic fantasies and rumors about him. In short, as an anti hero, he rocks :)! Sometimes he just raises his eyebrows or frowns, and that's all you need to laugh at. Bérénice Bejo is the true queen of the movie. Graceful, treacherous, but with ideals. Conversely, Aure Atika is limited to the femme fatale. It's surprising to see that "sexy bomb" you. You can't compare it with "Austin Powers"! I agree with Amazon D. Hartley (Seattle, WA) that he is respectful of the genre. <br /> <br /> What is your favorite scene? One of my favorite scenes is "fighting chickens" with a masked rogue. But it is really perfect when you talk to a cocktail with his contacts, how everyone mutters with shocks with confidence ... This scene itself makes a comedy genre useful.
