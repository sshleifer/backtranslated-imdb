I have a completely biased view mainly because I live and enjoy the lifestyle of club culture. Being a DJ and a frequent visitor to the club I see honesty in this movie and I love it. If you don't know the club / rave culture, then it will be a great foray into this culture for anyone who doesn't know it first hand. The honest portrayal of human emotions and problems in the Jip section I loved. The characters were well designed and I enjoyed this movie very well. I really don't like that you need to write ten lines on this site. I'll write at least 6 or 7, but I feel like I can see my point with less than ten. Here are some more lines to make IMDb gods happy.
