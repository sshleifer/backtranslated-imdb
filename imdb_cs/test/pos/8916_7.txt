If you're looking for an erotic masterpiece, it's not like that. If you're looking for a comedy masterpiece, it's not like that. If you're looking for something hard, it's not it. If you're looking for an example of European erotic comedy art from the early-mid-seventies, that's right. . I see that many people complain about quality, please understand that it was made in 1974. Yes, women do not match the modern ideal of attraction. They are by no means ugly women, but they do not have the same look that is idealized in our silicone culture. Yes, dubbing is not great, but it speaks German and everyone who speaks German realizes that it is difficult to copy a word with 12 syllables. <br /> <br /> If you saw a DVD before the last release it is sold with 2 covers from the 80s and recently 90s of adult stars. The film is a film R, so those who complain about hardcore should be aware of it, the film is adapted from the original BUT, but it was also modified before it was launched in productions in the late 1970s. For the first time I saw this film as a young man, and judging by some comments, there is much in the same boat that saw Cinemax. Many people get angry when they don't live up to their previous memories later in life. It's understandable given that the raunch and nudity wrapped up in today's eroticism. If you compare 2069 with modern soft-core erotic comedy, you may be disappointed. The film, while outlandish is actually quite fluid and jokes while generally cues and double meanings still hold on and can still gather laughter. If you compare it to a hardcore movie, you will be even more disappointed than today. It is still one of the best examples along with Bottoms Up and the 70s' Other Cinderella of European Erotic / Comedic Cinema.
