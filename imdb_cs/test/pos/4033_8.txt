OK, so this movie may not have won any Oscars, but it's not a bad movie. Original "D.O.A." It is undoubtedly a better film, but that doesn't mean that this movie is bad. The film plays Dennis Quaid in one of his early roles when he first became known as "The Right Stuff." made him a star, and a very beautiful looking Meg Ryan, when she was still now quite famous. This is a more "update" of the 1950 movie, rather than a remake, since the setting is different and the characters are also different. The story is almost the same. The man (this time an English professor at the University of Texas at Austin) is poisoned and has only 24 hours to find out who poisoned him and why. Meg Ryan plays a young college student trying to help him. Jane Kaczmarek plays Quaid's estranged wife in a low key but intense performance; He steals every scene he is in. Quaid's colleague plays Daniel Stern (also in an early role before "Home Alone" made him famous). Charlotte Rampling is also in a supporting role. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is excellent; The film is stylish, with a fast pace that will keep you guessing to the end. I think it's a movie that is definitely worth watching as a thriller, and as a modern version of classic film.
