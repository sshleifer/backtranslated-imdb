Simply put, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly were remarkable. The film is less about the raw science of Darwin's beliefs and focuses very much on his relationship with his family, especially his wife, Emma and daughter, Annie. Toby Jones gives a great turn as Thomas Huxley, the great defender of Darwin's beliefs, and the rest of the cast is on the task of sharing time on screen with Bettany and Connelly. But the film is borne by the two. Their real chemistry is evident from start to finish, but it develops transcendence as Darwin faces his demons. The scene where Darwin joins the end of the orangutanic story of Jenny, with his dying daughter Annie, is completely grasping. The world premiere at TIFF was overwhelming. Bettany's performance will be recognized as one of the best of this year. Equally spectacular is the work of Connelly, who plays the religious wife of a man who "killed God" in Huxley's words. The film is moving slowly through the whole spectrum of Darwin's grief, enjoying every detail of Bettany and Connelly playing. <br /> <br /> Brilliant.
