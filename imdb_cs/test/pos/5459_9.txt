Late Shift is a great book, I read a book a few years ago, and I was exaggerated on anger that continued when Johnny Carson retired and Jay Leno and Johnny Carson tried to catch his place. When the movie came out, I captured a VHS copy of the movie, and having read the book recently, it's hard to say which I enjoy more because they're pretty much the amount of information they have said. Two major actors, John Michael Higgins, and Daniel Roebuck, two actors I have never heard of before, and who I haven't heard of, play Leno and Letterman convincingly, despite Letterman's refusal to portray him as poor. They play games quite well, despite a lot of people looking for imitation of both. I didn't care. The story is what counts. And that brings me to Kathy Bates. Kathy Bates, playing Helen Kushnick, is this movie. He plays this evil bitch so horribly that you realize how this woman can control Earth, much less a national TV show. Yikes! It should be a sequel !!
