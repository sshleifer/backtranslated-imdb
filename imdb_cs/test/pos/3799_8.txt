I saw this movie in late night Buffalo TV about thirty years ago and I'm dying to see it again before I ... well ... you know. The interaction between the main characters after Tiger (Eli Wallach) "captures" his prey (Anne Jackson) in an attempted kidnapping kidnapping is absolutely cheerful. The depiction of a neurotic university dean (?) Or Charles Nelson Reilly's head of department is invaluable. How many movies can you name that are able to shed light on the struggle for the meaning and fulfillment of humanity by laughing from start to finish? This film reminds us that we are all in the same battle regardless of class, race, sex or religion. And who can forget the scene of a suburban homeowner on his hands and knees and attack those few tiny weeds that dared to appear overnight on his perfectly manicure lawn!
