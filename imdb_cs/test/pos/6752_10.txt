Mascot is a masterpiece of Ladislav Starewics. This tells the story of a plush dog who searches for an orange after hearing his mother say her daughter has no money. The dog collects with other toys to be sold out. In the car, after the others jump out while the vehicle is running, the dog remains and waits for it to be picked up from the warehouse before hitting itself. After biting a woman's leg he manages to get an orange when he holds and sells fruit. When he runs, he meets the devil and accepts his offer to stop at the nightclub. There he meets other toys that have jumped out of the car. The cat that was next to him in the vehicle is particularly determined to get the dog into orange. I will stop here to mention that in the night club there are other amazingly bizarre things that you will have to see for yourself. Suffice it to say that if you love Starewicz and are interested in all the past animations, I strongly recommend that you choose it!
