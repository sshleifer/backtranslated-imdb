Robert Florey and James Wong Howe look scary, expressionist. The scenes are shot at strange angles - especially on scenes with figural and literal murderer Lady Zachary Scott. His sociopathic behavior represents more than two decades another great, medium budget movie, "The Stepfather". <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent, though (although it's not her own fault), Joyce Compton is hard to think like anybody other than the singer in "The Awful Truth." especially, and although she plays an older woman who looks beautiful) - they couldn't be covered. Setting up a haunted guest in a house of women's psychiatrists is a risky trick that pays off beautifully. Nothing to do. Nothing at all. Unfortunately, the resolution is a bit pat. Emerson doesn't meet Bennett. That makes sense. But Scott is sent too fast. It seems to me that it is rather Mr. Ripley's character who could have escaped everything - botulism, murderous rap, jealous sisters - and disappeared into the great world beyond this story. This would not hinder the lucky end of the secretary and her boss, who was finally meeting.
