The main reason for checking this out is to watch Laura Gemser in her beauty. That's good enough for me. He leads to Africa as guests of another rich guy that seems to be all around these movies. Huge mansion near the jungle. Hunters staying at a party when they are not hunting zebras. And the aforementioned parties become drunken orgies. <br /> <br /> It seems that all types of high-level companies in Emanuelle films are out of control. And Emanuelle has most of them. Joe D'Amato didn't do it. He just tore it and used the same cast. And has anyone noticed "subliminal" sexual images at gas stations? And why did most men remain dressed during sexual scenes? Coherence? Hardly. But GODDESS GEMSER IS BEAUTIFUL.
