There's nothing much about the story. A young woman steals some money from the bleak Vermont supermarket where she works, decides to escape to Florida, where she has dreams with her friend Julie, where she dreams of visiting school. If you remember an older couple from "Rosemary's Child", you have an idea of ​​what these two are. Bill has a comical face and left the army. Sandra is a former stripper who has now become a truckstop skirt, even if we don't find it at once. They are loving, accommodating and full of common sense. More or less adopt a girl, Alice, and promise her to go in her complicated RV, even if they don't go directly to Florida. <br /> <br /> There could be a movie on One hundred percent wrong All filmmakers had to make an older couple in the epitome of evil They take virgin Alice (handcuffs to bed or anything) and sell her body to a greaseball driver who has a lot of money and likes rough sex. But the couple is really nice and Alice is far from the virgin, Alice overhears Sandra with the customer, asks for a deal and tries to change the trick on her own. , and insists she does it right if she does it at all. She doesn't talk to her. They lead her. <br /> <br /> Alice produces several hundred dollars, which is several hundred dollars more than when she met Bill and Sandra keep the money in without She does not find whoring a very pleasant job, and she thinks she will never be repaid, because every time she asks to be dropped, Sandra answers, "What? No, honey. Not in the middle of nowhere. "However, after talking to handing over their weapons to Sandra, the couple eats the money they want and rather lovingly release her to continue her trip to Florida. <br /> <br /> You know what I found the most tragic moment in the movie? It had nothing to do with prostitution or thievery, Alice expects to have a room with her girlfriend Julie after she comes to Miami Julie is a legitimate student, but when Alice calls her friend from a former place in Alabama to reassure her that she is on the road, but it will be too late, Julie hesitates and says, "Well - my mother doesn't think you should be with us. I invited you, sure, but I thought it was like a visit to a week or so, go back to Milford, Alice "There's a long silence before Alice hangs." Br /> <br /> There is only one shot (several white shots of the movie) and no one is hit. Nobody else is shooting. No car explodes into a fireball. The direction is sometimes clumsy. Too many cross-sections between Sandra are trying to disarm Alice and Alice's hand holding the gun. There is hardly any musical score. There is a short masculine and feminine nudity, and it is unpleasant as expected. Alice is not unattractive, but not babalicious. She sports Asian eyes, a robust version of Molly Parker. The film looks cheap and colors wash out. The direction is a straightforward story with several light flashes. Nothing is unnecessary. And that was obviously shot around Danbury in Connecticut. The city keeps in my head, because after one of his floods I went through and remembered the cars clogging with the mud film up to the door handles. <br /> <br /> I don't know exactly what Alice found. (I'm even afraid I think the answer to the puzzle is that "she's found herself.") Acting isn't bad at all. Judith Ivey is better than that. It is definitely worth seeing, a quiet, proper movie that treats viewers as adults.
