At first I remembered how the neglected Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams returned to Comedy Central in the early days. These days (the 1990s), their programming consisted of repeating Benny Hill and the original MST3k, supplemented by a bearded host. Capt. Frank Drebin (played by Stone Faces, Dead Filbuster, Leslie Nielson) is a process created first from the merger of various stereotyped police TV shows of protagonists (Think Dragnet Meets Starsky and Hutch Show), boiled in a full flask . It is distilled, three times to produce the purest policeman each made. Forget Simon Pegg at Hot Fuzz (save for later). Frank Drebin is in most cases a clueless, terrible driver, a terrible shot, but at the same time sensitive and vulnerable. He is a champion of police investigative methodology (a.k.a - ask Johnny of Leather Old Shoe). That makes him a bad cop. Cops are also lucky. Captain Drebin (note he's the captain here) has perfected him. Along with his partner, Nordberg and the rest of the force, he parodies the police drama perfectly during the 6 golden episodes. The show is a treasure trove of cheerful dialogue and quoted quotes. Most gags are a bit outdated and stupid. But magic never came out of sight from the gags. At the heart of the nonsensical and direct conversation and foreground activities, crazy things appeared in the background. The movies can best be described as a 90-minute compilation of the best gags in this series. Think about Monty Python's and now for something completely different ..... <br /> <br /> If you liked the 1 & 2, Naked Gun 1,2,3 or Top Secret, then you're sure to enjoy it. I've always liked the series better than movies, even though I saw movies for the first time. Why? 2 words: No O.J.
