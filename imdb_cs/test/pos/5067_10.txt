To solve a difficult problem, you have to start with the right questions. Without them, even the largest library of information is useless. This film does just that - where other movies direct your thinking along the board of the story, this film pulls your emotions and your understanding of justice and what is permissible. These questions will pull you all over, challenging your assumptions about how to develop characters. This movie is important. This is important and must be seen by anyone who remains informed about current issues. The fact that it's very fun and involves killing movie stars just improves performance. My advice: watch it with a serious crowd or better yet, not as opposed to reading the editorial from your favorite magazine. In this case, there is one difference: the answers will be your own.
