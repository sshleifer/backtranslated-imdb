Lana Turner has proven that this year in 1940 she could win a storm over the final victim that her sister (Joan Blondell) is doing for her. When both sisters come to New York, Blondell's beau, the amazing George Murphy, follows in this film. As fate will be, the show's director is overwhelmed by Turner, but he sees nothing that would be anything but a cigarette job for Blondell. Not only does Blondell miss a star, a friend, Murphy (Eddie) also for Turner. To avoid hurting her sister, Turner is ready to bring with him a producer, a rich groom who married 4 times. The story ends as much as possible with Blondell, who quickly returns to Nebraska. Look at Paul Ford as a commentator in the film. It is difficult to recognize due to the date of the film and the fact that it is much thinner. The film asks you if Ford and Blondell could ever meet. Blondell, as a devoted sister, sacrifices her career and her sister's love. This film is sentimental and could work better if it was taken at Technicolor. Few realize that George Murphy, a future Republican Senator from California, was in his time quite a song and a dance.
