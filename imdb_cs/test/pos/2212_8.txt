I had the opportunity to capture this independent film and was impressed, despite the lack of excitement on the plot. The meeting was very good for everyone involved. Amy Madigan was involved in a mother who is tired, yet well-intentioned and determined to replace her younger daughter. In this process, however, she neglected her older sister, who is more interested in her sibling syndrome and lives in a world of escape. The men in the film are very powerful in their secondary roles. Christopher Lloyd, in a very underrated role, shows us why he has such versatility. He plays a teacher who is dedicated to his profession and literary research, but starved for a meaningful relationship. He and Madigan are very well connected in their scenes, but both know that their friendship can be nothing else. Their fruitless farewell is nothing less than a brilliant, acting lesson for beginning artists. <br /> <br /> In a small role, Fred Savage is fun to watch. <br /> <br /> You can tell why the movie was based on the game, it's probably very good on stage. It is not particularly exciting on the screen, but it is still very thoughtful and powerful in its subtleties.
