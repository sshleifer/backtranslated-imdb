This is one of Marion Davies' better conversations - and one of the few who allowed her to show her abilities as a physical comedian who was so quiet in her silent films. OK, so he's doing a clumsy tap, but Ruby Keeler's dance from the era doesn't keep the younger generation either. The problem is the scenario. The story falls into an incredible melodrama on the last reel. It's quite a lot, and of course it's adapted from the game ... but not good enough. But there is still some humble dialogue and grotesque. It's worth a look.
