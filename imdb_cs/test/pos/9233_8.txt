I'm not sure if the TV series discussion is exactly where the comments should be, but it's on TV where The Lone Ranger really made a name for himself. I have no reference to the original radio broadcast of this masked rider. Plane, Iam though refer to the point where in a little boy, about 9 or 10 years old, I should have seen the movie "The Lone Ranger" and never forgot it. I can remember that I was on the line or we were moving towards the Paramount Theater - the theater was in the theater district if I remember correctly. It was just across the street, from east to west of the building that has a ball that falls on New Year's Eve - that is, of course, if somebody don't know New York City. what turned out and so on. I've never been as overwhelmed as I was when I looked at that billboard to make it Lone Ranger over the roofs of the roof - It was great - It made an impression and I never forgot it. This day we went on a tour of the Lone Ranger - It was a story about how Lone Ranger was born - A terrible ambush that the Texas Rangers drove into and the subsequent rebirth of one of their fallen heroes. In this movie, we learned that the Lone Ranger won't shoot to kill but hurt so that the law can be a judge. that we could learn something from history. There, they learned that Tonto would find the fallen Ranger and, after seeing the childhood friendship symbol that the Lone Ranger had founded years ago when he, as a younger man, came to a wounded young man's assistant in Tonto-Adjutant given, Tonto gave his loyal friend a symbol of his gratitude, which was now part of a necklace that Tonto recognized. Ton said, "You're Kemosabe". Lone Ranger said, "kemo-Sabe, that's known? Then Tonto tells the story of this" t rusty scout "(meaning Kemosabe) I think the Lone Ranger is one of the real heroes of the silver screen and one of the great television heroes. it is said that these highly respected individuals, Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels, tried to live there, according to the legend of The Lone Ranger - It may be very well that the story of Lone Ranger and his loyal companion Tonto is an inspiring story. The ability to find and buy DVDs that I stayed all Saturday morning and watched many episodes now available. Long Live Lone Ranger and his loyal companion Tonto-Hi-Ho Silver-
