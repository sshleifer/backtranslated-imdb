As part of the dedication joke Julie (Meg Tilly of Psycho 2) must spend the night in the mausoleum, but Karl Rhamarevich, the master of telekinesis, recently died and was listed there. When Juliet's confreres sisters desecrate, where the real horror is found, it begins. <br /> <br /> This little movie had a lot of atmosphere and I enjoyed the building, and the last twenty minutes is just great. Anyone looking for a lost horror gem from the 1980s may no longer look. Highly underrated. Plus Elizabeth Daily is lovely. <br /> <br /> My Class: B <br /> <br /> Blaster DVD Extras: Disc 1) Commentary with director Tom McLoughlin and co-author Michael Hawes; and trailers for "The Being", "Frankestien's Bloody Terror", "Just Before Dawn" and "Devil Dog" Disc 2) Alternative Director Editing (This Is Almost Unnoticeable For Bad Printing)
