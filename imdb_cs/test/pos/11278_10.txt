This kind of anxiety can only be inside a young person who is looking very seriously for his religion and his place in this world. As the text says at the beginning of the movie, these images are dead: they are a thing of the past and have been since the product was ready. But this is only for the creators of these "products": Perhaps for someone who is in the same spirit of mind (I think many people, at least those who are seriously interested in religion, are going through the same terrible anxiety and doubts about their personal development). And of course this is the reason why art is created first: Identifying and comforting human beings. This film uses the very "classic" technique of experimental cinema. And this is where these techniques are, in my opinion, in the best possible use: As a tool in telling stories and creating an atmosphere for them, not just as pure abstraction or as a goal in themselves. These "tricks" have been created quite often. Some other films that I think have influenced / inspired this director are "Eraserhead" and "Nosferatu". It is interesting how this technique makes this film totally timeless: there is nothing contemporary in this film. Or nothing else from another specific time. It could have been created thousands of years ago. It is interesting in this story how these people treat this newly born holy child: they use it selfishly for their own purposes and do not even try to listen to it. They beat him, tore his intestines and castrated him. They attract their (living) body violently from place to place. And they do violence against their mother. The story also reminds me of the story Borges "El informe de Brodie". Also criticism of the practices of Christian institutions reminds me of the great "El Topo". Annoying watches occasionally, but beautiful. Very simple, thoughtful and concentrated. Very strong film, almost too strong. All human energy has focused on it. Also, this movie shows that if you have passion and ideas, you can make a round zero-budget movie. But I have to admit that it was a little hard to watch the "current" viewer like me because of the experimentality. It was so slow and challenging. After all, it is worth suffering. I have to give ten points just for the effort someone makes this kind of movie.
