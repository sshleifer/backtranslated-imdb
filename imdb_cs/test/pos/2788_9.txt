As a former Erasmus student, I enjoyed this film very much. It was so realistic and funny. It really took the spirit that exists among Erasmus students. I hope that many other students will follow this experience. However, I wonder if this film is so interesting when I look at people without international experience. But at least one of my friends who never went to Erasmus enjoyed it. I'll give it 9 out of 10.
