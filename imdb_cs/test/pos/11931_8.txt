it didn't sound like a fantasy movie. The film is dark, with dark overtones. The soundtrack is too uplifting to bring it into the visual. I'm sure they were heading for something militant, but it just didn't work. The scene where Astin tries to escape is a perfect example. Why does it sound like Goonies? There is no comedy, it's not brightness! The film's idea is great and the performances are also very good. I enjoyed showing everyone. It is available for online browsing of Netflix. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth a look, but write your own soundtrack !!
