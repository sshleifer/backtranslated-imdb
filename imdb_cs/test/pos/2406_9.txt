I wish the series wouldn't end soon. Although acting doesn't have to be the biggest in the world, it ends in a positive response and teaches the audience morality and values. Hilary Swank did a good job of portraying a high school student who lost her parents, etc. If you are not in a happy ending, this movie, like the previous 3 in the series, is not for you. This day we live, you can't see enough about the bad guys who get what they deserve, and the good guys who come to the top. The Bible teaches that good always prevails over evil. That's exactly what's going on in this. It's a great family movie. Please see if you don't have one yet.
