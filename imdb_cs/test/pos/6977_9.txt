Newly Knight Knight Screws from the spouse for non-specific reasons that are obviously connected by themselves. On the way he gets involved with Caan, a former football star damaged by the brain and Duvall, a mad but offensive cop. A type of film that could only be born in the 1960s. It is worth looking at his non-pattern plot and for the early performances of future stars. Disappointing resolution does not take too far from the rest of the flick, which shows an interesting piece of life.
