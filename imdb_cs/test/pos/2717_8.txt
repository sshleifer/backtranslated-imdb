Our family and friends enjoyed this film very much. The theme was well done by the director with great performances Shabany Azmi, Konkana Sen, and well-supported by the second cast. The peak was built well but for the end which was far from being called "good". Still trying to understand what the director was trying to pass on? Were there few ideas or was the end beyond the understanding of ordinary movie lovers? A better end would create a lasting impression on the audience and increase the viewer's ship. However, this should not take away the loan that is due to Konkana and Shabana Azmi for behaving so well with the characters!
