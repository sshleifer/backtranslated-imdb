It helps the best film by far. Very funny, very surreal. If Bunuel made a movie with Buster Keaton as Krusty the Clown, it would look like this. Brilliant casting performance we already know from other Schneider films, especially Helmut KÃ¶rschgen as sidekick 00Schneider. (Andreas Kunze, who once again plays a woman, is a bit annoying). And of course, help, because Nihil Baxter is absolutely incredible. P.S: If this movie had proper merchandising, I'd like to buy a replica of this "Holz ist" image.
