I am fifteen and I have seen thirty-three Sinatry movies (not counting TV and documentary videos). As long as the clouds are not released, and the "miracle of the bells" is in fact not counted, however, given that in the first everything he does is sing the magnificent "Ol 'Man River," and in the other it is not half the evil - just the picture is pathetic My favorite recordings, radio shows, TV shows, and movies about Sinatra are changing every day - everything that happens every time unlike connotations, and sometimes it seems to be the best thing ever done and sometimes worst. until the cycle reappears, but there are a few things that are beyond comparison when it comes to movies, "The Man with the Golden Arm" leads this list, anyone who knows something about Sinatra knows he thought he was its his best. was always nominated for an Oscar, it was the first serious look at drug addiction, etc. etc. Jazz score is unforgettable, sympathetic Kim Novak despite the ridiculous accent, Eleanor Parker is annoying and too dramatic, turtle - like Arnold Stang is fun from time to time, but more embarrassment, and Darren McGavin makes a beautifully slimy drug dealer, the kits are unconvincing - at first glance, it seems to be a strange mixed bag thrown together by great Otto Preminger with a spell outside the center. Then you will come to Sinatra. Like everything else in his life - apart from music - the reports of his acting are always divided in half. Directors such as Fred Zinnemann, Frank Capra, Billy Wilder, Stanley Kramer, Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich and Otto Preminger, all agreed that Sinatra worked on his films as hard as on singing, he would be among the greatest actors in the world - if not the greatest . Humphrey Bogart even said, "This guy has the most natural acting talent I've ever seen." It's not bad for a man who has never done an acting lesson in his life, and has also produced a discography that would make him "the greatest singer of the 20th century" and make almost all his scenes in one shot. In direct conflict with all the others, these are other reviews and biographies that sneakyly smell of what was a miserable actor, Mr. Sinatra, and how many "bad" movies he made. The question will never be answered to the satisfaction of all, because the controversy was one of the greatest possessions of Sinatra, and in some sense both arguments played in his hands. In any case, at this time, in this role, Sinatra is magnificent. The reviewer said in the late fifties, "Sinatra may not be the greatest actor in the world, but is not more fascinating to watch." No matter what Sinatra does in the movie, it's hard to tear him off. This is, of course, "charisma" that I saw only in a few other people - Orson Welles, Richard Burton, Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift - maybe James Cagney. There are no real definitions for it, and it often makes it hard to see if you are really enjoying performance or just overwhelming, but that the quality of the display is what makes the movie. Sinatra is downright riveting, real, intense - over a decade and thousands of pop doll stars with something called quality. Like it or not, it's a one-man show with several character actors hanging in the background. It covers all emotions with remarkable softness, from sweet, lonely tenderness to Kim Novak to the terrible shock of Frank Sinatra (Frank Sinatra!), Screaming and screaming in the agony of "cold turkey". Sinatra was right - that's his best performance. No question. I was eight when Frank Sinatra died. I haven't been bobby-soxers and '' Anchors Aweigh, '' Ava Gardner and '' From here to eternity, '' albums with lamps and '' swingin 'lovers,' Kennedy, Vegas, ding. Reagan and concerts from Madison Square Garden to South Africa to the White House to Sands I can't say I like Sinatra because I heard him at Paramount, or because I heard autobiographically - the usual excuses. eleven, I was watching a movie called "On the City" ...
