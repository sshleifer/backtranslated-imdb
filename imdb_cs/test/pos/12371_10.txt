Victor Sjostrom's Masterpiece Film Phantom Carriage was recently released on DVD with the new KTL soundtrack. Duo with American guitarist Stephen O'Malley and Austrian portable artist Peter Rehberg has conjured up an extraordinary collection of sounds that accompany and emphasize the original 1921 film footage and feedback and the flow of the grim drama. The film is as impressive as the new soundtrack and remains a true star with a timeless rendering of a dark and dystopian fairy tale. According to this story, the last person who died before midnight on New Year's Eve was doomed to spend a year on the reign of the phantom car of the same name, gathering the soul of the dead. This is the fate of antisera David Holm, who, after his untimely death and subsequent encounter with the chauffeur driver, moved to a painful exploration of his life. This film is often referred to as a horror film, and although it is a suitable designation, the real horror is not in supernatural elements but rather in portraying human suffering in the hands of others. Sjostrom gives remarkable performance as a drunken, malevolent and menacing Holm in life, and a miserable, frightened Holm looks back from the land of the dead and shrinks from his past deeds. Phantom Carriage and more than compensates for the inevitably limited dialogue. The sick beginning of midnight is powerfully illustrated with a clock face that floats alone in the dark night sky like the second month. Equally impressive, the dead are depicted in a pioneering semi-transparent image, and the scenes of the phantom carriage on the ground and sea remain cool to look at. Sjostrom's film deserves its place as one of the most respected silent films. All-time movies and the new KTL soundtrack are an excellent accent on his themes. This is to be seen.
