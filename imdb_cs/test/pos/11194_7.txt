My interpretation is that the term "distant" is used in the sense of the opposite of "warm"; people who are not warm to others. The film reminds me of the teachings of the Dalai Lama in "The Art of Happiness", where his main point is that the key to happiness is to connect with others. Not only are the characters in the film insular, they are also humorless, bleak, shy, quiet and hostile. These qualities, among other things, seem to prevent them from forming and enjoying relationships and being able to talk about and solve their problems. And as a result, they are terribly unhappy. I see this as a strong justification for the teachings of the Dalai Lama (I am not a Buddhist by the way). If you are one of the people who think their behavior is a natural response to life in a big city, then I think you can be right, but I recommend the Dalai Lama's book. City life doesn't have to be like this. <br /> <br /> I see why some people find it boring - it is a little stretched in places and the characters are not particularly sympathetic. And it is contrary to Lost In Translation, where island features are much more sympathetic and mutually connected, even though they are not generally associated with people.
