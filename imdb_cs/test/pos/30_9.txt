'The Dresser' is one of those movies that are so perfect that you're really trying to find something they don't like. Written by Ronald Harwood (himself a former dresser for the legendary Donald Wolfit), sparkles with energy and true love of life behind the lights. As "Sir", the overwhelming actor and main focus play, Albert Finney is a pleasure to watch - whether to complain about a lack of storm during 'blow, winds ...' a little 'King Lear' or chatting with his loyal stage manager, Madge (Eileen Atkins, good as ever) about the old days. Tom Courtenay, Norman, his camper, gives fabulous performance, wiggles around his ear and calls 'Lear', collecting a bottle to go to a pub, or bitchily disparaging a former fool, Mr. Davenport-Scott (often mentioned, but never seen!) < br /> <br /> In the engaging support of the cast, there is Edward Fox as Oxenby (a typical arrogant second lead), Zena Walker as her Ladyship, Lockwood West as a substitute fool and many others. <br /> <br /> This film has great energy, brings with it some grease of its stage, it's true, but it's so good that you won't notice it. Very well done.
