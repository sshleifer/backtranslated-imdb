In the movie, "Falcon and the Snowman", when Christopher Boyce was passing the complex, the background satellite was a real Ryholite satellite that is now in space. TRW enabled internal shots. TRW also allowed both interior and exterior shots for one of the original Star Trek television series. (The episode is where Spock gets blinded when a chain of satellite lights is activated to kill a stranger). Christopher escaped prison (Lompock) and was featured on the US Most Wanted. When the show was broadcast, he drank in the bar. He said, "Hey, it's me". Needless to say, he was captured and taken to a maximum security prison.
