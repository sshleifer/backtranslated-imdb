Peter O'Toole is Arthur Chipping Latin Latin Teacher with strict adherence to detail and thoroughness in helping young thinkers understand the meaning and definition of Latin words and phrases. He is considered cold and unfair and is not in contact with the times. But after meeting Stage Actress Singer Katherine Briskit (Petula Clark) not only at a late dinner after a London performance in London, but at an amphitheater in Greece his closed-minded world is starting to open. Goodbye Mr. Chips is a MGM music remake of 1939 film also from MGM. During this time the musicals were gone and the Hollywood study system was in total shambles. When it premiered in New York, Los Angeles and London, the music numbers remained intact, but when it came to local major street theaters around the world, it was sans songs, so the film was shorter and strayed to the maximum. Thanks to Ted Turner's MGM / UA Home Video at the end of the 1980s, when VHS and Laser Disc were the main home video formats for music number selection, it was re-introduced and gaps closed. However, Laserdisc was the only format that was chosen to display Goodbye Mr. Chips in Letterbox Widescreen. <br /> <br /> For a while, the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was only available on the original outside of Vinyl and Cassette Tape and can still be found on Ebay today. With wonderful people on Film Score Monthly.com in 2006, the soundtrack was digitally remastered and remixed into a 3 CD set with a completely refurbished score, the original 1969 general release album score, and narrated by a sequence of music source and interviews a lot . You will also get 1 unused song that is a real lost jewel of "Tomorrow with Me" by Petula Clark, who would be chosen instead of "You and I" before the hand. This film is a classic musical and a true tribute to educators everywhere. Certainly I would have bought this movie if by Warner Bros. MGM and Sony put their money where the mouth is, and this movie should be restored from all the world's film sources and put it on DVD and Blu Ray with all the bells and whistles that came back with all the accessories you can find and stuff until release.
