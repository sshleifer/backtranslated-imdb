It was widely agreed that Hayao Miyazaki is a master at his craft when it comes to combining rich animation with thoughtful story lines and similarly imaginative characters. His films from NAUSICA, TOTORO, KIKI, LAPUTA and MONONOKE to recent HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE are not only beautifully portrayed in terms of art, but also filmmaking. Can't this person be wrong? Not quite, but it is impossible to expect each of his films to be five stars. His latest film, PONYO, an incredibly family-friendly story of "goldfish out of the water", is as lively animated and lively as interesting characters as you would expect ... and yet it's the first movie about what goes into the territory. Don't get me wrong, PONYO is by no means a bad movie. As mentioned, it is a sight for the eyes and is as charming and adorable as TOTORO and KIKI. The problem is that the story does not stay above water to satisfy someone who longs for another riveting in-depth plot. PONYO is for its opening hours a Miyazaki storytelling of the best quality in which noisy people argue. overeager a young goldfish (who later is called Ponyo) makes a forbidden trip to the human world where she is subsequently adopted by a boy her own age named Sosuke (modeled, interestingly, after her own director). This does not please Pony's father, a mysterious wizard named Fujimoto, who is very angry with people (their topic is not very different from other Miyazaki films) ... a problem he intends to fix by creating a jellyfish from the bow of his submarine. He separates the couple and tries to talk Ponyo to stay with him. However, the goldfish has already tasted both Sosuke's blood (a finger cut treatment) and some human food (a ham that becomes inexplicably dependent on her) and, of course, steals his father's forbidden potions, transforming into a hyperactive young girl (who is a spitting image of Mei) from MY NEUSBOR TOTORO). This triggers a dangerous tsunami that threatens to engulf the world with water. A conspiracy with his wife, Gran Mamare, a crazy sea goddess who alternates from super big titanium to human size, Fujimoto decides to test the love of two young people together. They do this by raising the sea to the level of Sosuke's home and encouraging young people to cross their ocean-infested ocean into excessive toys (made possible by Pony's own magical powers). It is at this point that PONYO starts to run into steam. Although Ponyo and Sosuke are delightful and the scenes with them are funny and cute, they slow down the film. Unfortunately, where the film is actually picking up water, there is a culmination in which Sosuke must show his love for Pony, which is presented in a way that is strangely anti-climatic and rushed, causing a charming stop. This will probably cheat viewers expecting another instant masterpiece from a man who has released a much more interesting final for many of his other films. Remember the destruction of Laputa? Satsuki is looking for a little Mei? Kiki is saving Tombo? Porco Rosso fights Curtis? Saving the Head of the Forest Spirit? Or even a test between Chihiro and Yubaba? All these solutions were much more satisfactory and more complete than this. <br /> <br /> PONYO cannot be wrong at technical level. The animation is absolutely amazing to look at, made without a single image of computer-generated images, and naturally Joe Hisaishi gives us another breathtaking music score; The best moments are exciting underwater sequences, accompanied by a chorus and a soprano voice. And the backgrounds are lovingly painted and described in detail as other Ghibli films. Once they are worthy of translating and copying previous Ghibli movies into English with high-quality results, Disney Studios and Pixar once again provide English dub complete with most capable cast actors. Frankie Jonas is surprisingly good as Sosuke, sounding very natural. Noah Cyrus like Ponyo, on the other hand, sometimes goes overboard when shouting her lines before finally settling down. Heads Aside, the rest of the cast includes Liam Neeson as overprotective of Fujimoto (who controls himself unsurprisingly well in character), Cate Blanchett as Gran Mamare (in the ubiquitous tone which is not much different from her Galadriel in The Lord of the Rings), Matt Damon as Sosuke is constantly a sailor's father Koichi (who is good but nothing to write home about), and Tina Fey as Lisa. Of these, Fey is the best voice in the entire cast, who will build a character with the right amount of spirit and personality. Her scenes with Sosuke show real chemistry. On the other hand, Cloris Leachman, who was magnificent as Dola in CASTLE IN THE SKY, is miserably wasted as one of three disabled elderly women (barely has ANY line!), Who are also voiced by Betty White and Lily Tomlin. Of these, Tomlin's character, a rough woman named Toki, shows any real personality, but if I cast the film, I would switch Tomlin with Leachman. Probably the only very unpleasant disadvantage of oak is the blasty techno-remix film catchy (but ridiculously repetitive) title song, which fortunately does not appear up to half of the final credits. <br /> <br /> PONYO is a good movie; a fine piece of animated work that is ideal for youth and family audiences. However, due to the loss of momentum towards the end, it does not reach the classical state. Since Miyazaki is at least even better than most other animated films, I will be generous and give PONYO a full stellar recommendation, because each of its features is still very interesting, especially on the big screen. (Make sure you can catch him in theaters as long as you can.)
