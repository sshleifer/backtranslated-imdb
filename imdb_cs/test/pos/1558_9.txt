Fantastic movie! Wow - this is really a treat. I can't believe I discovered such a gem of a movie. <br /> <br /> A pretty young girl traveling south to Florida will meet a friendly older couple with a RV after she has a flat. However, he learns that things are not as they seem, and the couple gets a little scary after spending some time on the road with them. Anyone in it has just been so perfect for their parts that you are just about believing that you are seeing it happening in real life before you. Emily Grace, a newcomer, has done a fantastic job like a really cute but rather shy Alice. Emily gives you the feeling that you can understand what she is experiencing, and you can see how she got into a situation that is developing in the movie. We will certainly see Emily in other films in the future. Contrary to what some have said, lighting and photography in this area were just perfect. Adjustments were also very good - just the right way to put together highway images to make you feel that you are traveling along with the cast on their trip. I didn't see it on the big screen, but I can only invite everyone to go out and see it. More such movies are * exactly * what we need. <br /> <br /> SF
