OK, so this is a complete burst of the first Karate Kid. But I think there can never be too many movies as the first Karate Kid. There is something about this type of story that especially seems to apply to people like me. You get the overall feeling that you are able to overcome adversity by finding new things about yourself. In this movie, Hillary Swank is a special gem as Another Karate Kid. You can really say it has a clear future ahead. <br /> <br /> Not to say that this movie is not without problems. Unlike the first, Mr. Miyagi seems to be a little eager for Julie to learn martial arts and engage in combat. It almost seems to have forgotten what his first film's values ​​are. People must also be distrustful when they examine monks. The film makes monks seem too simplified to look at life, and doesn't really explain why they do what they do in the plot line. The rogues are also a little controversial, though really hateful bad guys. I also suspect martial arts films that end Friday night. So maybe it's not a perfect movie. So maybe it won't be the biggest movie for rent on Friday night. However, in more ways than one, it is the blame of pleasure. Hillary Swank is just so loving and the story, though not original, works. In the genre of films that seem to be based on nothing but action and violence, it's the breath of fresh air. Unlike all of Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van-Damme, it's a film about spirit and heart. There are people who need such movies, and we'll take everything we can. My rating: 8/10
