Want a movie that takes you to places? That's a good tip. If you were adolescents in the era shown in this movie - the Motown teenagers - or if you want to get back and see what your parents were making so much noise, I suggest you take it and watch it. With the risk of cliching, you will laugh, you will cry, you will remember and remember. You will return to a time when school violence was a fist. You remember your best friends from school with love. It's a good movie with the edge of anxiety and pain and realism - misconceptions, losing friends, deciding what to do with your life. I think everyone, regardless of race, age, socio-economic status, can pull something out of this film and really enjoy it. So take a few hours of lazy day and watch this movie; There is a much worse way you could spend your time.
