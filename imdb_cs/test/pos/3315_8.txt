I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago, but after about 15 minutes I stopped. I saw it on the Stanford Theater in Palo Alto and I promised to make a 40-minute drive. Stanford is an old-fashioned movie house that begins with every curtain movie still closed Yes, they have curtains. They opened when she started playing the Fox Fox logo. When "The Best of Everything" appeared in the giant pink scriptures stretched against the New York skyline, I knew I was right when I waited. There were so many moments to the look and feel of the film: When Hope Lange first entered the label, the titles of the magazines that were published there are engraved on the glass (The Teenager and Elegance); Joan Crawford is an elegant apron she wore to serve her guests at her party without wearing clothes; the way the camera tilted to indicate how crazy Suzy Parker was (she was almost sideways at one point); as Hope Lange still lived in the cobblestone apartment she shared with others, though she seemed to be doing a lot more money than at the beginning of the movie (guess it was too scandalous for a single girl to live alone). Hope Lange was so beautiful; so was Suzy Parker. And what about Mark Goddard in the non-speaking role. I fell in love with him when I was a child watching Lost in Space. When I saw this gem on the big screen, he urged me to plan another trek at Stanford to see the Old Dark House. By the way, at the concession stand, I bought a little soda and popcorn and I was taken aback when a worker asked me for two money.
