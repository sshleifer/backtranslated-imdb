First of all, let me say that this is probably one of the 10 most underrated movies in my opinion, because this was released in 72. I absolutely loved this movie, it's very urban, courageous, no real Hollywood glam. to feel all the characters here, I love the blood that melts. Joe Pesci was pretty good here, but for me it looks like he was definitely ahead of the main character Joe Cortese, now I don't know anything about him, but the boy can really act .. I believe this movie is probably true because living in New Jersey living near Philly, you're still here. I think if a movie had a bigger budget and Robert deniro would say as the boss's head, you'd have a perfect movie, but hey, who am I to argue, was so overwhelmed by this movie that it's already in my mind, with average streets. I wish Hollywood would return to this urbanized, courageous portrayal of filmmaking. This movie is a great drama with great actors in it. and I highly recommend it to everyone.
