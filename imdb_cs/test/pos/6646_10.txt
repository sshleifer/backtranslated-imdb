Bergman's Skammen is one of the most realistic portrayals of the war ever made. It is not an action film in any way, although stimulation is faster and most of the other Bergman movies are the most action-packed. It is not even the romanticization of war or patriotism, unlike most war films. In fact, bold realism and deliberate ambiguity of character's loyalty has a very modern feel. Skammen is a darkly lit film that should be watched at night, so it works like a spell. Many of the effects are transmitted indirectly, but so efficiently that some scenes compete in intensity with the current, insanely huge budget movie like Saving Private Ryan. Of course, the event in Skammen is on a much smaller scale, but it is impressive without limitations. While the film style feels the present, the setting of the film is timeless and impeccable. The war-torn country and even the still intact provincial village could be anywhere and anytime. And this film is not so much about specific historical events, with specific names and dates, but about the universal reactions of man to adversity and chaos. Playing in Skammen, although typically impressive from Ullman and Sydow, is not of primary importance in this film, unlike most other Bergman films. Throughout most of the movie, viewers are just like us. Bergman put war on them and through them the audience and their reaction is perhaps what can be any of our reactions. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 10/10
