I studied Brazilian cinematography since 2004 when I came across "Cidade de Deus / City of God". Let me tell you something, this film is probably as good or better than the "City of God". Acting, cinematography and music surveillance make this film a unique experience. I haven't been to Brazil yet, but this film is a harsh reality that is plagued by SÃ£o Paulo citizens. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie if you're enjoying a good movie. This movie is disturbing and you may feel a little depressed after watching it. Something you want to watch, but nothing to go to sleep with.
