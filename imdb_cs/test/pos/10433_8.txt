Many teenage comedy sex movies come and go without a big fanfare, however, each so often a movie can come together that is honest, fun, fun and memorable. The last American virgin is a special film that has found its place and has passed the test of mixing all four components. This film follows three friends (Gary, Rick and David "The Big Apple"), a disaster in the world of first-class sex and true love. Along the way, he learns hard lessons and the value of true friendship. We follow the hopeless romantic Gary (main character) on his quest to win over the girl of his dreams, which leads him along an uncertain path with a surprising step at the end. If you haven't been lucky enough to see this movie, look through all the means ... sprinkled with many unforgettable 80s songs throughout the movie to keep things moving at a steady pace. L.A.V. it is an original film, a rarity among his genre films.
