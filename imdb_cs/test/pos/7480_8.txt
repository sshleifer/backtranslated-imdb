Very violent and nicely shot film. Paulina is a bad sexy girl who shows that even men can be raped. This movie has a lot of black humor. This guy will kill everyone just to forget he was a gangster. Sometimes it happens that you do not know if you are shaking or smiling and think, "Did I laugh at someone who kills people?"
