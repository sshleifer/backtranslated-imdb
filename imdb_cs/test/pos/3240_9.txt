I have this BBC movie "Jane Austen Collection" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and didn't like it at first. It's totally different from the others and lacks, or so I thought, one of the qualities I like in all the other Austen movies: cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sews her fingers together was particularly upset. I still don't like watching a scene that touches my fingers, but I like to hear Mrs. R. say, dreamily while she sews, "My only acquaintance ... has torn my clothes." This film is now my current Austen favorite. I watched it 7 or 8 times. The effect is, in my opinion, incredible. The way he noticed good behavior is when I am awake from everything I do (sewing, though not fingers together, hopefully, or boondoggling or anything) to watch the character deliver his line. It is the turn of expression, the casting of the attitude that makes the words come alive - that is what makes good behavior when it comes to me. Well, I'm watching almost every part. Northanger Abbey "because almost all actors play their part with such a charism." Peter Firth is as amazing as Mr. Tilney, the perfect blend of Bathian fop and a true male hero - until the end you're unsure whether he is after Catherine's money or not. I like his touch (Welsh?) Accent. Mr. and Mrs. Richards are charming: the combination of their behavior - especially Mr. Richard's high voice, providing counterpoint to his wit and wisdom - makes them real. General Tilney, as a stubborn father who may be a murderer, is also fascinating. And Captain Tilney, a grinning rake who enjoys so clearly ... and sisters and a brother who's called and who can't remember - two of them are so perfect, instant, smart and smart. Another reason I love this adaptation is that it's the most romantic of all Jane Austen's adaptations. I know it was one of Austen's weaknesses (well, it's what I'm concerned about): although all her novels are love stories, it's hard to feel that her heroes and heroines are really in love at the end. And if they're not really in love, what does that mean? All the other adaptations I have seen (other than Olivier / Garson) have pretty cold kisses at the end if they kiss. I don't like sex in movies at all, but it is really necessary to have a sincere kiss at the end. And the final kiss in Northanger is a doozy. Over-the-top access to costumes, music and lighting works very well for me. And the screenplay is extremely clever - the way we learned about gothic romance, highlife in Bath, Cathy's normal upbringing, etc., is very well done, as is usually the case in BBC productions. I also like the part where a small black page makes brushes. And I think Marchionesse was a perfectly suitable and very smart exposure aid. Some people have argued that this version is the opposite of what Jane Austen intended to do in Northanger Abbey. fun of Romanesque Gothic, don't promote it. But I don't think she wants to give "Udolpho Secrets" etc. Down. She only did that you had to distinguish between reality and fiction. And this point is made when Mr. Tilney starts Catherine in her mother's room. Besides, General Tilney was a villain, even prosaic. The point was sure to be.
