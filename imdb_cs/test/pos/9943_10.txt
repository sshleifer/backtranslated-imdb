Though many of them have mixed feelings about this latest giallo thriller from Argento, they still stand as another kind of testimony to the film brilliance, which is Argento. A young opera singer has his first power off and suddenly finds herself obsessed with a crazy maniac. In a way, Opera resembles a modern gialle on the Phantom of the Opera, which blends with all the famous styles and colors that Dario Argento would expect to add. Argento uses the amazing use of inventive camera techniques, reoccurring symbols (like the ravens!), The Gothic atmosphere and truly horrible killing sequences. One scene (which concerns a peep hole and a gun) will knock the audience out of their place! The story-wise film also manages to grasp with some strong tension and given the great atmosphere of Claudio Simonetti's wonderful musical score. The cast does some satisfying performances. Cristina Marsillach is good as our front lady. Later Ian Charleson will make a nice turn as director, as well as Urbano Barberini as an investigator, Daria Nicolodi as Agent Marsillach and William McNamara as Marsillach's unfortunate lover. Opera is an amazing second day of Argento and perhaps the last of his great works. They will certainly please their fans and even create new ones. <br /> <br /> **** off ****
