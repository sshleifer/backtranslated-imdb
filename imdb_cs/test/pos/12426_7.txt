Adam (Eric Jungmann) and Harley's annoying best friend (Justin Urich) ride across the country for a wedding. A sexy hitchhiker Sarah (Aimee Brooks) rises along the way. Then, for no reason, he tries to run the monster car off the road ... and maybe kill them. Who does it and why? Pretty good horror movie. Its energetic and full of flashy direction that gets you straight into action. It's also a horror comedy. Most of the humor is infantile and really rough, but actually somewhat funny. Also this movie really piles on gore at times - but that's a good thing! The game is fine - Jungmann overlaps his role as a nerd; Urich is stuck in the hopeless role of best friend who is obsessed with sex but pulls him; Brooks is too good in a limited role. But I saw that the "twist" end comes long before it happened, and the logic disappears completely (especially salvation). Yet it is a cruel, sometimes amusing and sometimes frightening horror movie. I give it 7.
