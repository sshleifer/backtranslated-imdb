Since I first played it in 1998, GoldenEye is one of my favorite video games. In fact, I recently bought N64 cleanly so I could own it and play it more often! The game is almost perfect: the single player mode does fantastic work, immerse yourself in Bond's shoes, with different mission objectives, compelling weapons, and great design. Although the enemy's artificial intelligence is, according to today's standards, very basic, it only adds to the GoldenEye challenge. The method of obtaining fraud (completing the level within a strict time limit) was also innovative when the title was released, and even now I haven't said any of them yet! <br /> <br /> The game comes with a stunning multiplayer mode for up to four players, and while it's not as advanced as Combat Simulator in the sequel to "Perfect Dark", it's still incredibly satisfying that you can fire your opponent with fire RC-P90! ;-)
