I came across this film as a teenager in the mid-1980s and immediately became one of my favorite holiday and holiday movies. As you can say from other reviews, this film has a very good story and great actors signed it. Stanwyck is great as a bride who has second thoughts. Dennis Morgan's acting is also strong. She is unnoticed in most movies, but was a very capable actor, check out KITTY FOYLE. In this film he plays a guest sailor who leaves his husband. It is a Christmas classics. The setting and story make a great Christmas romance
