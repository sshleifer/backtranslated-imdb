This is not a life-changing film; It's not an epic or something like that. But it's fun and it's fun. It is a movie that the whole family can watch together, and at the moment there are a few rare movies suitable for children that don't have a love story in them! It tells a good story in a lighthearted way, without trying to dazzle the audience with over-the-top special effects like lots of movies these days are. He has some pretty good gameplay and all the music that has been used will fit quite well with the content of the movie. Acting is also very good, the actors look comfortable and believable in their surroundings and mainly jokes are funny. I would recommend it to people of all ages - it must have made me laugh. :)
