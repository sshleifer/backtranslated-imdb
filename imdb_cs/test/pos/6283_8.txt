I was cast as Surfer Dude on the beach scene. He almost got like a muscular guy because the real muscle guy was really really late. Pauly had my brother, and I (a skateboarder in front of a tattoo place) did some things vj among the living from Venice, since he did his thing to MTV. This movie is also very good. If I wasn't in it, it would make my top 100 ...?.
