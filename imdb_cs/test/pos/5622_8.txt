Chris Smith is an excellent filmmaker who rarely has a talent for noticing a good story. Smith's "American film" is a faithful record of director Mark Marchardt, a loser who wants to get his older uncle for cash to finish his short horror movie. But never, under any circumstances, strive for gainful employment or to support children who are conceived. Such is Smith's skill that Mark looks more sympathetic than otherwise. Even when uncle Bill is attracted by sugar-spun dreams and executive producer credits, his desperation is to be someone to connect his name with such as Scorsese and Spielberg, which touch us. "American Film" also belongs to this rare, often tried, but rarely reached a sub genre that successfully blends merriment with horror.
