I tried to follow the age of kings for many years, many years. My theatrical life was filled with actors in this series. At that time, in 1960 I couldn't watch everything because I worked in the theater myself, lots of night work. Now retired LONG have it and keep it to yourself. Please, please, can't be released on DVD, I wouldn't mind what it costs. I see there are others who feel the same way. What can we do to do this? Something so big that it shouldn't be sent to oblivion. I have to write two more lines. OK, I can do it by saying that I want this series more than anything in the world. To watch some of the best actors of our age playing the best words of our amazing Shakespeare. It's not enough! Uzmen
