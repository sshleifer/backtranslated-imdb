I had to see a different version than the first person in the user comments section. It's really, really good ... Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are great together. The character of Val Kilmer is very similar to how he was in the novel, although Gus and Call and Comanches are emphasized. Let's see what happened to Call and Newt's mother. I won't spoil it, but it gives an insight into the character of Call. <br /> <br /> All the actors did a really convincing job. I thought Steve Zahn had the biggest challenge to follow Robert Duvalle! There's a lot of action, humor, tragedy. He has something for everyone. I can't wait to broadcast it, my whole family will be jealous.
