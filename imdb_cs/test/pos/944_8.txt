My mother Frank starts out as a warm, friendly comedy about a middle-aged Catholic woman (Frank, short for Francis, played by Sinead Cusack), who shakes from the wells by enrolling as a student at her son's university. Most of her friends and family are horrified, not least her son (Matthew Newton), who is busy falling in love with her best friend's girlfriend (Rose Byrne). Meanwhile, Frank aroused the anger of his dissenting English teacher (Sam Neill). Matthew Newton is absolutely disarming like David; relaxed and naturally in the role, even if the character is nervous. It generates valuable goodwill, directs viewers through some awkward, broad comedy moments of the film. Not long after director-director Mark Lamprell first appeared, he will professionally direct his film to a darker emotional territory and give Cusack a real chance to shine. welcome faces (Lynette Curran, Sacha Horler, Nicholas Bishop) and all directors (including more animated than usual Sam Neill) are excellent. While at the end a little twisting, My mother Frank makes more than she promises and is a real Australian crowd.
