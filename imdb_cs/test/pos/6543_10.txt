The movie started, the wheels were spinning, your car entered the race against Fox ... You're behind, you can't get ahead, you think, "If I go out, I'll take you with me ..." You break into a car parked on the side road, you turn to fox, but your target is bad ... bang, you went back to the VW and you broke down in the tank. Your car will light up. If you wanted to, you could get out, but the shame of losing you ... BANG! Your car explodes, everyone looks in despair, some cry ... The siren sound tells you the cops are coming. Everyone gets into their cars and bolts and lets you burn. Burnt remains of car frames sit there, chase the audience ... You're dead. <br /> <br /> This is one of the scenes; actually his first scene in the movie. There are many more. When you enter the Fox cockpit in his Ford V8 pimp, Terry Serio in his crazy GTHO, and many more in this past blast .... JOHN CLARKS MASTER, "RUNNING ON EMPTY" "
