Bravestarr was released in 1987 by the now defunct American animation company Filmation on the back of He-man: Masters of the Universe and She-Ra: Princess of Power, in 1983 and 87 '. The cartoon storyline was about an Indian cowboy named Marshall Bravestarr, who has the power of a bear, wolf ears, puma speed, and hawk eyes, and his faithful sidekick, a talking horse named thirty-thirty. who carried a weapon with the apt name "Sarah Jane" and with the help of Deputy Fuzz and Judge JB used to protect New Texas from the evil Tex Hex and his group of outlaws. Set in futuristic Texas, it has been and still is today, one of the few cartoons that take place in a particular city, the US, in the south-thousand light years ahead in the future. Given that this was done in the 1980s, the creators did an impressive job that tried to recreate the Wild West, but from a science-fiction perspective. Bravestarr not only evoked bad morals and good verses, but also taught children about life, but also emphasized the themes of culture and community and that we should not take things and life for granted. And despite the fact that it was an action adventure, many story lines, themes and themes he addresses resonate with children and adults in a way that makes sense to them. In addition, Marshall Bravestarr was one of the first major cartoon characters from a (ethnic) minority background to impact television. The sound effects were amazing, the music was great, the theme was just as unforgettable and the animation was amazing. The characters were well designed and the stories were varied and taught children the morale and importance of what is right and wrong. Some of what can not be said about today's cartoons, unfortunately. While Bravestarr has been overshadowed by the success of He-man, it is still a personal favorite for 80 years. Suffice it to say that I preferred Bravestarra to the He-man because the diversity of stories, characters, and the depth of the situations and problems faced by the characters were more than I would call a realistic and identifiable contrast. For some reason, they resonated more with people, such as "The Pledge", where a child dies of drug overdose, the fact that it was not a happy ending was important - in the sense that when children watch this episode, Well, in fact, everyone, who follows this episode realizes the devastating consequences of drug use and that no one should underestimate the dangers of drugs. Courageous, brave, and sometimes provocative, Bravestarr is definitely so bold, bold and provocative. The cult cartoon class dared to take risks for many years, but it finally paid off well and eventually paid off. Many cartoon fans will remember this as one of the most exciting and at the same time the best cartoons of the 80s, rightly <br /> <br /> 8 and a half out of ten
