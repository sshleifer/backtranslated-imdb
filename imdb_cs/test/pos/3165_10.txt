I saw it in Europe. Great movie!! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Body in modern times. The protagonist Jim Kirk, drives clumsy RV across America, stopping often to fill his gas-pet tank. He is middle-aged and confused. With its thick diabetic body, it stimulates cups of coffee and radio. It is the body: agitated and occasionally disassembled, quite oblivious to the growing tension around it, but it feels like a twitch of discomfort. The Spirit suffers from film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and goes in the visual field. Finally, the spirit collides with the body, and Kirk goes down, unable to understand what happened to him. He was in denial of how bad things happened due to his omnipresence all of us because we are all focused on the needs and desires of our body. We're all in the same denial, so we, like Kirk, are in danger of going downstairs and blowing through the desert sand just like him.
