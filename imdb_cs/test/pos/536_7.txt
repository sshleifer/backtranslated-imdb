Since I am a fan of Natalie Portman, I had to see the movie. I enjoyed every minute. This is very sincere. Throughout the film, Natalie seemed to be a mother and Susan was a mother. Susan's character was still making bad decisions, and she was still burning for that. I heard there should be a love scene involving Natalie and a guy (he's in Outside Providence), but Natalie would only accept the script if the scene was removed. And I think it's great. I think the love scene would ruin the film's tone. Natalie must have the talent to choose good movies because I haven't seen her in the wrong movie yet. So any movie that Natalie Portman has will undoubtedly see me. <br /> <br /> Good movie. 7/10
