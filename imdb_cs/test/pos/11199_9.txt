Perhaps many viewers who have been frustrated by this film live their lives without thinking deeply about life itself. I want to point out that "distant" is not just an artistic film, but one of the best art films. Of all the art films I have seen, it is a "remote" one that really stands out as a glittering piece of gold. It is even fair to say that cinematography and depiction of human emotion surpass Tarkovsky's Nostalgia. One commentator was right that sex, exhausted, a common feature among foreign movies, is surprisingly missing in "remote" and in a good way. The most interesting thing about "remote" is that it captures the details of life that we usually neglect, and the rich nature of our existence, which is often buried under the supervision and visual extravagance of our commercialized world. Fortunately, "remote" does not have enough to save the audience, and what we see on the screen is a plain portrait of human beings.
