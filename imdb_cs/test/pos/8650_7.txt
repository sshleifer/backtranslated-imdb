The whole film was thinking about Dante Inferno's first circle, where souls who "deceive" believe they are happy. They never realize that they are actually in hell, but nothing is pleasant, they just move without emotion. In this sense, Dante thought they were in the worse part because they would never actively try to change their situation. No one can die at this place, but they are trying to hurt. I'm not sure whether the writer based his story on this medieval manuscript or not, but the similarity is absolutely remarkable. <br /> <br /> When I watched him, I didn't enjoy the movie. the climax that never came. Yet it occurred to me and now I think it is a good movie - it is definitely sticking to it.
