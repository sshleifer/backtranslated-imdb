When I was interested in Akhenaton for many years, I was surprised to learn about this film through E-bay and bought a 99p DVD copy. I enjoyed the film, the twists and turns in the plot, and the file was mainly about the main character. Sinuhe makes her a "family saga" rather than an action movie. Costumes and attention to detail were remarkable for their time (1955). The rear projection while driving a car now looks clumsy. My main concern was the character of Akhenaten and his monotheistic religion. In this film, he was portrayed as "Jesus", as well as in his refusal to go to war with the Hetians even through attacking Egypt and in his closing speech on the futility of materiality and political power. Initially one makes a link between Sinuhe, who was cast torn in the Nile River in a reed basket, and the Old Testament Moses. However, this connection is beyond doubt that it will be fully explored in a new film, where a Moses-like character carries Achonon's monotheistic religion to the wider world if such a film is ever politically possible. It is widely accepted that these are women who are stupid creatures, but the relationship or lack between Sinuhe and Merit, the character played by Jean Simmons, is hard to accept. And that Sinuhe, an educated physician, would be so unhappy that the Nefer Babylonian "femme fatal" to the extent that he would give her the home of his adopted parents and Tomb is not really believable, nor that his parents would not even have a tomb. Nefer (Nefertitti) was the real life wife of Akhenaten. And although Horemheb became a pharaoh, it was after several others, including Tutankhamun, who was the son of Akhenaton. But of course it's just picking threads and the movie is nice to watch Achnaton and his monotheistic religion is a big bonus. Perhaps the following "De Vinci Code" book and film this film to be re-made with a central secret is the foundation of our present monotheism! I am waiting in great expectation for such a film, there are already many books on this subject.
