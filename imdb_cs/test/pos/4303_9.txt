What cast actors and actresses in this episode of Columbo, next to Peter Falk, are Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan, Martin Landau as twins. The old uncle mysteriously dies and looks like a heart attack on his bike, discovered by his fianc√© Julie Newmar, who plays so deliciously. Jeannette Nolan plays another woman in the house, a housekeeper who prides himself on her talent and hides Columbo's sloppy and often typical cigar-behaving. Martin Landau plays identical twins in this. Everyone blames the other for murdering uncle for money. Well, you just have to watch and see the result, but I can assure you it's worth watching this for cast and crew.
