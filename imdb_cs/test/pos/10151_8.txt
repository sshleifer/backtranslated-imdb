One of the finest films of director Alfred Hitchcock is the story of an American and his family (James Stewart, Doris Day and their young son) who are on vacation in North Africa. Stewart is a doctor and Day is a world-famous singer. They meet a Frenchman who speaks his native language and helps them in a local bus incident. Later, one Frenchman whispers something to Stewart's ear after being attacked and dying. The rest of the movie is a puzzle as Stewart tries to save and solve the mystery. The film is immersed in mystery and strangeness from an exotic place to special events. You never know what's going on in this movie, why people are appearing, ending and even not sure. The last scene takes place in the Albert Hall and is one of the most famous in the film, which takes 12 minutes without dialogue. Hitchcock originally made this film in 1934.
