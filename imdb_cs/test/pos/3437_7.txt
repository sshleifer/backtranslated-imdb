"Jaded" should not be considered an erotic thriller because sex scenes are not for the enjoyment of watching as opposed to movies like "Indecent Behavior" or "Friend Of The Family". "Jaded" is not easy to follow because his story is hard to imagine and it is not so common in society. From the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect stronger scenes. The rape scene was not (in my opinion) a well-designed scene. I think the director didn't use the right camera technology in the movie at all. That's why it sometimes looks boring and becomes boring almost near the end. Performance is very good of all five female characters. These women gave strong, intense but credible performances that demonstrate the dramatic skills of actresses. The legal concept has helped a lot to understand the difficulty of the plot because the legal concept of sodomy differs from simple rape. From Meg's point of view, sodomy must be punished like rape (huge crime B), even if it's another crime. Pat and Alex's defense claim to have enjoyed Meg and asked for it. This is where the film becomes interesting to find out who is trying to tell the truth. The only thing is certain that the sex scene fits into the legal definition of the crime. <br /> <br /> Watch "Jaded" if you like legal issues that aren't very common in your company. If not, try it because it's a very good and strong drama.
