Once a year in America, Saturday morning would release new cartoons, usually in America. Probably at the time the school started. I think this was to make school more bearable on Saturday. One Friday night before the premiere of the new Saturday morning cartoon, the movie came. "At Earth's Core" I had no idea who Cushing and McClure were. Of course they weren't from the same country, so I couldn't understand why they were traveling together. I remember seeing the mechanism in the mouth of a fire breathing monster. What connects this movie to me is opening it with molten metal and then suddenly we get the band we play as we see the factory. <br /> <br /> How do you end this movie? Music again, and two confused cops as the drill appears behind them. Whatever the reason, I remember watching this movie more than Friday night than I did any new cartoon that came the following morning. That was definitely the end of the seventies. It would be during the Jurassic Park cicra '93 mania, I believe that before I see this movie again. Yes, people in costumes. There was a fire again. He still loved the end of both cops. Finally, it would be almost ten years before I left the movie. DVD. <br /> <br /> Now I just look at the beginning and the intro. Oh, I love a lot of film. Of all these sci fi Jules Verne, HG Wells, ERB movies, this is like my fave. What I noticed is that one of the cops is starting to turn a little too soon, then turns back, then he and the other cops are synchronized as soon as they turn in again to look for yourself on a drill. Perhaps for me, this film is the best of Saturday morning performances, which is why I like it.
