Well, where to start. Did you know that some of the leading robots were offered to Shields and Arnez? I bet not. But they refused to complain about the make-up of the robot. Then they disappeared into the unknown. This movie has it all. Crazy killer robot who thinks he's dirty Harry. Lots of great robots. It's funny, it's touching, it's a perfect date movie for people who love science fiction and romantic comedy. It's the first romantic comedy of a robot. Now, of course, very few films are perfect and there are some character issues. However, they are very small and can be overlooked. I think couples will enjoy this movie and want to watch it again and again. 9 STARS.
