Naturally, along with all the others, I was ready to expect many Hollywood fantasy revisionism in their DIED with their buoy over the legend of Custer. All you need is someone like Errol Flynn Custer to have enough guidance that the legend takes precedence over the truth in this production. And for the most part my expectations were met (in an incredibly exciting and fun way). Yet in this apparently biased (and highly criticized) story of Custer's story, I was hit by some of them. the points that appear in this film sometimes, but subtly, but still firmly, seem to face the typical clich√©s of apparent fate and unusual heroism that usually occurs in the western countries of the early 20th century. For example, although the film was trying to wash it off, some scenes still suggested a more flawed and foolish character of real life Custer: <br /> <br /> 1) His initial entry to West Point The front gate in which his arrogance and pomposity is a clear aspect of his character. 2) His miserable record at West Point, which seems to be attributed to Custer's helplessness as regards military service requirements as any other factor; There are moments in the way Flynn plays Custer at West Point, where he seems totally stupid. 3) Custer's promotion to the general is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake, but is played as a grotesque comedy. I was half expecting to see Marx Brothers or Abbott and Costello to get on the scene. 4) Custer's stance against Jeb Stuart in Gettysburg is not faded as a brilliant military tactical leadership, but is presented as ruthless and wildly lucky. 5) Custer's drinking problem is definitely not ignored. And although the music and some ways in which the Indians showed up in this film were certainly reinforced by the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage, it seemed to me surprising that the film actually went into some detail as to why the Indians were entitled to attack whites. who moved to their country, and explicitly blamed for these battles. in the Black Hills right at the foot of a white man. In fact, no one can argue that the clear villain of the work is not Anthony Quinn as Sitting Bull, but Arthur Kennedy & Co. as white devils make false claims of gold in the Black Hills. Sure, that part of the story is true, but I didn't expect it to appear so unevenly in a movie like this. And one more thing: usually in these films, the Indians who are portrayed en masse as drunken animals seemingly unable to base common sense to avoid getting falling drunk whenever they approach alcohol. In fact, in this film, it's the 7th Army's track, and not the Indians who are displayed in this way at least in two scenes. All in all, in some surprising moments, this film slips into the middle of the Hollywood floor.
