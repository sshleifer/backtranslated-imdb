so. I was absolutely in love with this movie. Gaga for that, even with all his twists ... but one thing I found really worrying was the connection between the two best friends in Tim and Kyle. While the film's writer has given us such annoying moment between the two, and their sexual experimentation / confusion, then he gives us a plot that makes them half-brothers?!?! (Although the subject is not raised in the film .... and inexplicable and unanswered) I just thought it was in bad taste, and the fact that it wasn't even discussed is even worse. (Oops, we've created taboos ... we're not solving it now because it wouldn't really be P.C.)
