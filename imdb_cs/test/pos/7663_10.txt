I can never understand why people take the time to read movies they didn't fully understand. I know people will read horrible reviews on this film's pages, and that will prevent them from looking for copies of this forgotten, late 20th century, but a 1932 film that is likely to be referred to as "Indecent." name on major titles. Myrna Loy, best known as a comic actress in countless fine roles, turns out to be wrong in all. She was a real dramatic actress, something I didn't know before watching this movie, which precedes all her famous roles. It's exciting and moving here, two things that have never been the opposite of the sleek and refined William Powell. I'm still somewhat shocked at how good she was. Becky Sharp (1935), the first three-fingered Technicolor technique, is better known, but it is much more artistically and adaptively. It is also a very poignant as an expression of the film style that was about to die. You can't take my word for it, you have to see it.
