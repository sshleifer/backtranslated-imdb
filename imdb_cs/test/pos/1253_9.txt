While my kids enjoyed the movie (and then announced they wanted to buy it later), I think I got more out of it than they did. The scene at the airport shop is real life at the beginning (I didn't use cutting comments aloud, but I thought so). It's a good movie in middle life, a little happy and some scenes work less well than others (why does the baby stay with Bruce Willis after he knows Mom is dying?) But all at all times. It also gave our family something to talk about - I think my kids are boring? What do they expect for 40? How do you not like a movie that will have a good conversation with the kids?
