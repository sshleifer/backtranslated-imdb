This is one of the best films about the 80 punk scene. I saw it back on the bootleg for a few years and was impressed. Very few today's children know the real roots of punk and this film shows some of the fifties punk legends like The Germs and shows how it was then. Currently, so many punk went mainstream with MTV and radio and its nice to see the real underground rebellious movement of the original scene. Darby Crash (The Germs) is one of my heroes and this film shows why. He must see all the "punks" and everyone curious about the 80's punk scene
