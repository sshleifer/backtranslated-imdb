I also have to apologize for the somewhat distorted view of this effort when I contributed to the soundtrack. I still got my copy, sat down and enjoyed rolling the cast of characters that were perhaps more colorful than the characters that were in this film's sequel to Shanghai. For those who feel that George Bush is a "trustworthy Texan", you need to look no further than this movie to smash a picture that is Texas full of trucks, one-dimensional excavations. The cast includes some of the most intelligent, special and funny people you can find anywhere, when their stories of agony, bliss and disappointment revolve when you're going to a great movie sequel, no budget, a guerrilla style (ie "Punk Style"). each person helps to define). This is a great documentary with passion and guts and all the poison you will have to penetrate the other side of any industry bs and hope you have to do (take note of the authors, painters, musicians and colleagues). It is a return to the credibility of the first wave of American hardcore music when the term "D.I.Y." it was the standard, the period when courage, passion and determination matter more than technique, style or rare calculations. Not that there was not a lot of technology or style ... the tone of the document is quite refreshing. Edits in editing provide as much drama as dialogue in it. The idea of ​​creating a documentary from the sad demise of cast, crew, and director's early director is brilliant, totally Texas and punk rock. In the strict sense.
