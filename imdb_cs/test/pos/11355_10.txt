It is easy to see why many people consider Wong Kar-Wai to be the love in the mood. The softened appeal of the film, focusing on the study of the relationship that is put on the emotional ring tone, is a transfer to Happy Together, but without a hyperkinetic mosaic of breaking movies and hyper-saturated sequences that have become a trademark. Kar-Wai movies from Chungking Express. Like Soderbergh's The Limey, this is a different kind of curiosity for Kar-Wai; where dialogue and conspiracy are abandoned by mood and composition to create the story of two delicate lives in seemingly limiting emotional stasis. It's a proof of Kar-Wai's genius that he is capable of making such a simple story so resonant. Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) move in the neighboring house in the same apartment building. He is a journalist who dreams of publishing martial arts novels and is a shipping company secretary. Their connection is obvious from the beginning, but the way Kar-Wai draws such a path with magnificent master strokes is a pleasure. The key to the film's success is the use of Kar-Wai Inner Space, playing with the foreground and background of the plane in a way that is similar to Polanski's work. In the first half of the film, Kar-Wai, Leung and Cheung isolate the shots so that the other person in the conversation is never visible. Here, Kar-Wai deals with the environment and space, creating emotional dynamics among his characters. It also says that Kar-Wai never chooses to focus on the physicality of Mo-Wan and Li-zhen. Their anonymous partners are clearly absent from the film because they care for each other's own love affairs. This does not mean that in a mood for love it is a limiting experience because Kar-Wai manages to flood his film with wide splashes of motion and sound. There is one shot where Cheung's slow, sensual rise of a metaphorical staircase turns into Leung's descent through the same staircase; their movements complement each other perfectly, reserve the shot and create a sense of erotic duality between the two characters. Their souls joined, but they did not physically join. The erotic shifting of these scenes is both fascinating and frustrating, because two lovers of star crosses refuse physical consumption because of their humble loyalty. The other scenes in the movie are interrupted by the short slow-motion shots of Cheung erotically moving her inner environment, set on Mike Galasse's terribly beautiful score. Cheung's dress beautifully complements her outer space as she slowly moves past her surroundings. Her movements are slowly building on what seems to be an inevitable fusion between Li-szhen and her dream lover, though the process of seduction seems completely subconscious. <br /> <br /> If it seems to me that these two characters are more like two birds who release pheromones, it is probably not so much a loaded statement. The close connection of these two characters with their inner spaces is almost as intense as their relationship with the exteriors. The film rarely moves into the outer space and when the camera does, it is usually the top of the oval windows and symbolic stripes that always remind us that these characters are like closed animals. Kar-Wai is still irritating us, even when lovers get close to touching and breaking the closeness of couples by shooting each other through mirrors or gaps in garments placed inside the closet. Mother Nature seems to respond to her love, often launching a soft ridge of rain over the characters after their bodies slide close together. Karwai's haunting atmospheric footage of the waterfall has allowed Leung's Lai Yu-Fai to experience the Qatari release in Happy Together, even though Ho Po-wing from Leslie Cheung wasn't there to enjoy him. At the end of the film, love was so inextricably linked to a war act that a muted statement about the love of a third person signaled Yu-Fai's knowledge that his dreams of seeing a waterfall would bring him inner peace, even if he hadn't brought him back. lover. Mo-Wan's journey ends within the crumbling temple. His own emotional exhaustion is parallel to his country's political climate, and the absence of Li-szhenu is only tolerable by Kar-Wai allowing Mo-Wan to experience the release of species. Mo-Wan takes care of the ancient myth, and his secret release to the temple crack lets him live in his days hoping that all his loss and grief will somehow serve a higher purpose.
