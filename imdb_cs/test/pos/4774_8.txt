No doubt about it. This is an animated short film that puts Uncle Walt on the map of success. When Walt's older brother, Roy suggested that another Mickey Mouse short should include the sound, Walt jumped to a chance. The result: Steamboat Willie was an unfortunate hit for 1928. It was, after all, the first animated short subject with a synchronized audio track (mostly musical and sound effects, as the dialogue was minimal). Not that it doesn't sound like a wet blanket, but the short one is far from perfect. The pre-1935 animation was creaking and somewhat ugly (but once the equipment was upgraded, better art techniques were created, the rest was smooth sailing) and the sound was primitive (Disney wanted to use the then-known RCA Sound System, or the western electric noiseless sound system but both companies refused it, which led Disney to use the Photophone system with which PA Powers experimented at the time (here's the real line?) Is Mickey (as Willie mentioned above) a steamer pilot who is terrorized by Black Pete (Captain Pete to you), and decided that the ship will deal with the various animals on board as musical instruments (ASPCA, alerts). If you don't think too much about technical flaws, Steamboat Willie may be eight minutes away. fun (and a piece of history).
