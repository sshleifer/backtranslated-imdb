The family travels in the middle of the West. There is a widower Ben (Charles Bateman), his girlfriend Nicky (Ahna Capri) and Ben's little daughter K.T. (Geri Reischl). Then he came across a town called Hillsboro, where all acted more than a little oddly. Their car breaks down and they are forced to stay. Soon he will find that the witch squad has magic over the city and is up to an incredible evil. The story isn't so good. People just don't represent anything and they just find out where the witches are at the end. There are also a lot of gaps at the end. Behavior is also poor enough. Bateman and Capri are bland and everyone else is probably the same. Only old professionals Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones gives good performances. This movie still works. It gives up blood and gore (there are some but it is PG) and manges work with some very scary visual and atmosphere. The action prevents much, but it still works. Above all, Martin chews the scenery in his role. I can't explain exactly why I'm such a movie, but it worked for me. It is a quiet kind of horror that has not been done. Hardly a masterpiece, but it deserves to be rediscovered. A 7.
