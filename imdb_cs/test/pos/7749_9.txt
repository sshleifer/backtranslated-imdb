This show is great. Not only is "Haruhai Suzumiya" a very well written anime show, it also reflects things like Philosophy, Sci-fi and a small religion. It's hilarious at some points and "cute" (for lack of a better term) for others. Actually, this may be the result of my lack of experience with Japanese anime shows, but it's one of the best genres I've seen. First of all I have to give credit to writers. In the TV show, since Star Trek was original, he has not noticed such great fields of imagination. I hope writers will continue to add strange new characters and give more information about the already great characters that have been added. 9/10
