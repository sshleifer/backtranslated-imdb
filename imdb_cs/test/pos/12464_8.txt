This is both a fun and moving version of the classic story, also quite intelligent, not the 'Me Tarzan, You Jane' school. in the jungle of apes. The British couple title (pregnant wife) is stuck in African savages after the ship's shipwreck. After the death of the parents, the child emerges in the jungle of the ape. Twenty years later, this young man (ie Tarzan) rescues an injured Belgian explorer who nurses him back to health. The Belgian finds his rescuer young Greystoke and returns him to his rightful property in Scotland, where he has to adapt to a civilized society. The film is divided into two parts. In the first half we see Tarzan in his jungle environment. I'm not an expert, but I don't know how realism is his portrayal of ape monkey life, but it's certainly fun. For me, the more moving part is the other half, when Tarzan has to fulfill his real family, develop language skills and adapt to the aristocratic British society. He is portrayed as 'noble savage', whether in the wild or in elegant Edwardian lounges. In contrast, the upper crust is depicted so often much barbaric than the jungle that Tarzan left. He expresses a real sense of his confusion and conflict, torn as he is between two very different worlds, his original monkey family and his new human one. Sir Ralph Richardson, one of the old British legends, is brilliant as always in the role of Grandfather Tarzan, the Sixth Earl of Greystoke. The film focuses more on Tarzan's struggle to adapt to civilization and its inner conflict than in its jungle. This unusual look at old classics makes it both a typical dramatic adventure and, above all, a moving personal story. I wasn't surprised to note that his director is the same man, Hugh Hudson, who also directed the Chariots of Fire, another great movie.
