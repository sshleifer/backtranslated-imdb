It can't be much more frightening than Flatliners. This deep, dark film had a whole heart. Light is dark and literally puts you in the mood for a death-defying experience. Keifer is in top shape because he is at 24. He is a great actor and plays a very convincing and shocking role that you will not forget for years to come. And what can you say for the rest of the cast? The whole star-line, Julia is warmer than ever, Will, Oliver, and Kevin light up the stage in this thriller that will keep your grip on the seat. It's a refreshing look to see a real thriller, with a top notch of professional actors. You won't regret seeing this two-hour seat benders. -JL
