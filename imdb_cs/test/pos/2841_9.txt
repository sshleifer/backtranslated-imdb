Flawless writing and brilliant gameplay make this unusually beautiful and witty plot one of America's best movies I've seen this year. The incredible casting and cynical direction of Neil Labute keeps this film too sentimental, while Renee Zellweger and Morgan Freeman's authentic performances give him a soul. Violent, provocative and funny at the same time with a really beautiful end. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney all give the excitement, the tongue in the cheeks. The biggest soap opera spoof from Soap, but better and smarter. 9 of 10.
