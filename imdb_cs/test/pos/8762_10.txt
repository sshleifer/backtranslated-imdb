"Traffik" beautifully designed, tells the story of using narcotics and commerce from many angles. From the policeman's point of view, from the political point of view, from the perspective of the addict, from the smuggler's point of view and from the farmer's point of view. In a carefully crafted story, one gets the impression of everything connected. From the stunning footage of the poppy field in Pakistan, the Karachi city center, the Frankfurt airport and the London airport, to the delapidated buildings where smuggling takes place, there is a huge dimension of narcotic consumption.
