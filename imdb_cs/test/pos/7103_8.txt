Dracula's house was made towards the end of the universal 1940s horror cycle and I saw it several times. Mad Doctor Edelman keeps plants for the serum that heals people. Count Dracula comes to the cure for his vampire, and Lawrence Talbot then comes to see if he can cure him from a full moon werewolf. Frankenstein's monster is then discovered, and Edelman brings him back to life just as the villagers descend to the castle and light it. Talbot, now healed and one of Edelman's assistants, is safe. Like many films of its kind, we have a humpback and storm helper to keep it moving. The cast includes the universal horror lines Lon Chaney Jr (Wolf Man), John Carradine (Frankenstein House) and Glenn Strange as Frankenstein Monster. They also play Onslow Stevens (Them!), Lionel Atwill (Vampire Bat) and Martha O'Driscoll. The Dracula House is for all old horror fans. Great fun. <br /> <br /> 3 stars out of 5
