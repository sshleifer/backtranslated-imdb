This is undoubtedly one of the most entertaining and fun movies I've ever seen. I really enjoyed the characters in the movie. They are amazing bizarre things. It's something I've never seen in any movie. The story is almost continuous from start to finish. There are no boring moments. The film captured me completely. And I thought acting was great. <br /> <br /> So if you want to see a fun movie. You should look for Green Butchers. Great movie. I give him 10/10
