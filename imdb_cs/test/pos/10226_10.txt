I love this movie. I managed to get a copy and save it so I could watch my birthday. This film brings some questions. One is. Who are the monsters of this world? Being different is just that. Different. Real monsters are hiding behind ordinary masks. These are the ones everybody regards as "a nice quiet guy" who "didn't bother anyone". Or they are worse, they are the characters that Croneberg plays. Men who draw joy and power from carving people and creating their own Books of Blood. I love purses, people with gifts and those that can be terrible for people to watch. This film touches and explores what's normal. Who are the "others" and what is fearful of some. While I have given this movie 10 I am still sick of women who either scream or are so set up in their ways that they cannot see what is happening and that there is a vehicle for things that destroyed the Median. My next complaint was why they never made a second movie. I would like to see the continuation of this most interesting story, which captivated me from beginning to end
