The movie was good. The only reason I watched it was Alan Rickman. Who didn't pull the Southern accent, but he did it well. I like all the characters in my opinion not one of them bad, another thing I noticed. I have read all these comments and not one person has a comment on Alan 5's 0'clock shadow. Which made him look even better and he had almost the whole movie. I would give the movie 9 out of 10. Another of my opinions is that the movie would be better if there was no sex. It was still fine. He loved the scene when he says "Aw sh * t" when he is in the car and sees them in the mirror.
