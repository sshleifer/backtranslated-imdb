Family happiness disintegrates when the early wealthy father Ward (Michael Ontkean) becomes poor and can no longer support the family. Then, Faye's mother (Jaclyn Smith) has to take on the role of breadwinner in the family and start working to support the family and, at the same time, regularly has to run a family life. Not always so good, but as good as he can. Family life will hardly get easier when your father learns that son Lionel ("Stargate Atlantis" Joe Flanigan) is gay and also lives with his lover John (Joel Gretsch "The 4400") an old family friend, resulting in that Father explains to Lionel that he is no longer welcome in the family. Lionel is the one who gave his sister Anna (Leslie Horan) the most when she gave birth to her. Anne can't stand that their father and Lionel cut off the cords, so he runs away from home. Because it wasn't enough, son Greg (Brian Krause "Charmed") was in the marines and was sent to war. The storyline in this movie may feel somewhat slim on some occasions, but still has a lot of realism in it, which makes it easy to see. Given that this film illustrates many sensitive relationships and situations, I would believe that this will be best appreciated by a mature audience, even if it does not hurt teenagers to see it and be able to think of something before adulthood.
