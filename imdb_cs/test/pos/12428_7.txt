Driving on the highway to the wedding of his beloved Betty-Ann, Adam (Eric Jungmann) is surprised by his former classmate Harley (Justin Urich) in the back seat of his car. Adam got out of the uncomfortable and annoying Harley for Betty-Ann. Along their trip, Harley makes fun of any rednecks in the bar and later their car is chased by a giant monster truck on the road. After some incidents, they put an elevator to hitchhiker Sarah (Aimee Brooks) and earlier the trio is terrorized by a scary monster driving a monster truck. Despite having one of the most unpleasant characters I have ever seen in a horror movie, Harley's irritating, "Monster Man" is a surprisingly good tragic horror comedy. The story is a collection of clich√©s, starting as "Joy Ride" or "Duel"; then it turns to one of the countless rip-offs of the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre"; there is a surprising twist, resulting in a hook for the following. There are funny scenes, Aimee Brooks is very sexy and this movie really enjoys. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Monster Man"
