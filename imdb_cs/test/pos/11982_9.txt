I watched this movie over the weekend and I have to say I enjoyed it. Two Italo American actors are excellent as usual (Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia). It is clear that the director was influenced by two great films of the past directed by the Italians. Primarily he was influenced by Dino Risi and his film IL SORPASSO. It is the story of two young men who happen to meet and become friends. One is extrovert and the other introverted. They enjoy the whole day together and at the end of the day a shy person learns that there is more life than his usual routine monotony. The same thing happens to Albert De Santi. Unfortunately, IL SORPASSO has a very similar ending and it probably influenced director ON THE RUN because he uses the same technique but with a twist. I was expecting something, but it surprised me that it was the opposite. If you watch both movies, you'll understand. Another film that influenced the director is AFTER THE HOURS of the director of the great Italian American Scorsese. I highly recommend all 3 movies !!
