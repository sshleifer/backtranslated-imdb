I thought this movie was pretty good! OK, so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but I saw a lot more poor movies that have a much higher rating than this! Many movies are being redesigned to a more modern version today and there is nothing wrong with it, keeping the story alive. I don't think this movie was pathetic at all and I'm not just saying it because I'm a big fan of Chad Michael Murray, but because I enjoyed it. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie and my friends and I really enjoyed it and we talked about it all the way home! I would tell other friends to watch this movie. I'm not saying it's the best movie ever hit the box office, but it's much better than some people describe. Everyone has their own opinions, so if you really want to know if it's good or bad, watch it and then decide.
