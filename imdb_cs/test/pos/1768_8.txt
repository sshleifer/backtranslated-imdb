I like good things in life just like anyone else, I suppose, but about five years ago, the opera didn't come to my entertainment options. Oh, I have made several attempts to find out what the fuss is about; I watched several TV productions - especially the Wagner cycle on public television - I hope to understand the fascination of other people in an artistic way. And I knew I might like different parts of operas (I remember being surprised as a guy who actually wanted the pieces "Madame Butterfly" in "My Geisha, and I enjoyed the opera scene in" Moonstruck "and" Pretty Woman "), but unlike the characters in these movies, I just" didn't get ". <br /> <br /> Then in 1995 I saw a live performance of" Rigoletto ", presented by the New York City Opera Company, V The night I "got it." What a wonderful, famous process of color and music and raw emotions! And I mean the emotions with the big E! The key, I think, is that opera music allows performers to act freely and in a way that it seemed stupid if their words were just spoken, everything depends on the music, of course, and when the music is magical, as it is in "Rigoletto", opera can be a wonderful pastime. /> <br /> production of the opera in 1982 and I found that he was driving i'm not seeing live perfo Rmances "Rigoletto" live regularly, this video version is a good replacement. Luciano Pavarotti is perfect in the Duke section; Ingvar Wixell is excellent as his handy jester Rigoletto; and Rigoletto's beloved daughter Gilda plays somewhat plain-featured Edita Gruberova. Sets and costumes are abundant, and location shots on the late river in the film bring an increased sense of drama to the story that could never be closed on stage. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen "Rigoletto," or if you think you don't like an opera or don't understand it, I urge you to find it on a videotape and buy it or rent it. If you don't like it, if this production "Rigoletto" doesn't mean you appreciate the power of an opera form, well, just give it up and go to something else. However, I suspect that if you are a newcomer to the opera as I was, you will be pleasantly surprised. Bill Anderson
