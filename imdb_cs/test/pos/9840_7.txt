"The Mayor Of Hell" feels it's a Dead End Kids movie, but with a much harder edge and very few light spots that preceded Dead Enders' first appearance by four years. James Cagney has a full screen credit opening, though technically, the 'mayor' of the movie title is actually portrayed by Frankie Darro, one of several boys sent to reform school during the opening scenes. Darro's character is Jimmy Smith, a young tough who is related to 'Patsy' Gargan (Cagney), and is elected to a position where the Gargan has a chance to humanize the conditions in a state reformer. Warner Brothers Many of these types of films that try to provide a species conscience at a time that knew too well about the effects of crime and poverty. This film is brave enough, without excuse for ethnic stereotypes, as in the obedient attitude of a black father in court or the way a Jewish boy gets to a pastry shop at a reform school. The rules in the reformator are simple enough - work hard and keep your mouth shut; step out of the line and you answer in person Warden Thompson (Dudley Digges). The role of Cagney in the story seems somewhat ambiguous because, while trying to improve the conditions inside the Reformation Center, the outside is still nominally under control of the criminal rocket. The film's attempt to juggle this dichotomy is, in my opinion, inadequate; Not exactly that kind of role modeling either would look in a movie such as this. Warner Brothers would disinfect some of the elements of this story in a 1938 remake called "Crime School" featuring Humphrey Bogart in the role of Cagney and Billy Halop in Frankie Darro. If you're partial to Dead End Kids, you'll probably like the second movie better because it also offers familiar faces like Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Bobby Jordan and Gabriel Dell. However the ending is somewhat confused in that one as well, with Bogart's guard character involved in the jail cover. Both films offer a romantic interest in the main characters, in 'Mayor', Madge Evans's reformed minded sister who falls into the character of Cagney. Curiously, many of James Cagney's early films are not commercially available, so you'll have to keep your eyes peeled for screening on Turner Classics, or the source of a film from a private collector. Personally, I can't get that kind of stuff and find interesting points of interest in films of all genres from the 1930s and 1940s.
