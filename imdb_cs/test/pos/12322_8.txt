Excellent movie. Don't do it like that anymore! At the beginning of the 20th century, we were listening to a higher middle class family in Dublin. After Christmas dinner they organize their friends and relatives. Their conversation is simply idle, but it's so well written that one is submerged. From the dining table, some fine piano games help you create an intimate atmosphere, as if one of the guests were there. Maybe it's a bit perfect for an amateur player, a strange mistake here and there would add to the magic of this movie. No real story, but real fun and an object lesson for beginners and future filmmakers.
