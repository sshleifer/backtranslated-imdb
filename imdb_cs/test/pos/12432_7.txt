It has to be said that the Monster Man is a huge movie clutter, but somehow it combines several different genres and clich√©s to make one of the most enjoyable modern horror movies I've seen in age! The two biggest styles of film blends are the "Road Trip" and "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" teen comedies in a redneck horror atmosphere. Director Michael Davis is able to keep things moving because the continuous shift in tone means we're never quite sure where the next movie will be. Things start disturbingly, as we introduced ourselves into two characters, both irritating in different ways. Adam is a virgin, while Harley is a fat big mouth "A-hole". They both drive through the desert to attend a high school marriage. After a few strange events, they pick up the tramps and then find themselves chased by a maniac in a monster truck for unknown reasons ... <br /> <br /> The idea that someone is chasing Otherwise, barely original, but the way it is The monster truck used is one of the biggest movie assets. The car itself looks scary because it is so sharp and rusty, and the fact that it bounces on the screen makes it an exciting and developing event. After a while, you get used to the characters and once Aimee Brooks enters the fight, things start to look up. The teen comedy side of the movie really works pretty well as Justin Ulrich is always on hand to make some fun line of dialogue and scene between dorky virgin and hot female hitchhiker are interesting enough. Just when you think the film can't get anything messy, things turn into weird in the last third. Without spoiled things, Monster Man is the kind of ending that could not be seen, and with the twist it is a big surprise. Some people may feel ripped off by a sudden turn at the end - but I actually thought it worked quite well when it fits into the movie in that nothing really fits ... In general, it's no way a "big" movie - But if you're looking for some stupid fun, Monster Man should hit the spot!
