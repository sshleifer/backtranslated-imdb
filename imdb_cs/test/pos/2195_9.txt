The genius who is Stephen Sondheim has never been more prominently displayed, as it was in his 1979 "musical thriller" SWEENEY TODD, a gothic, bloody, grisly, but excellent musical mix of a demented barber who returns to London to avenge the evil a judge who not only permanently denounced him from London but also educates his daughter as his own and plans to marry her to "protect her from all the evils of the world". The barber finds love, sympathy, and help from a lone pie shop owner who has his own program where Todd is interested. This musical rocked Broadway and won nine Tony Awards, including Best Music and Best Actress in Music (Angela Lansbury). The production was shot in full in 1982 when Angela Lansbury renewed her role as Broadway as Mrs. Lovett, the owner of cake shops who find practical use for the heads that Todd makes. George Hearn, who has replaced Len Caria on Broadway, is electrifying in the title role, so much that you have to wonder why he was not originally cast. Lansbury and Hearn are riveting from start to finish, committing 100% of their ghoul characters, who were helped by the first Sondaheim score, probably the closest thing Sondheim wrote to the opera. Lansbury shines on "Worst Cakes in London" and "By the Sea". George Hearn stops the show with "Epiphany" and is also persuasive during "pretty women", the duet he sings with Judge Turpin, the man he swore revenge. Cris Groendahl is loudly impressive as Antony, a young sailer who saves Todd and falls on his daughter Johann. Betsy Joselyn is somewhat above the top as Johanna and she really pushes loudly to the point that during "Green Funch and Linnet Bird" she actually controls her voice off the field in a matter of moments. The rest of the cast is the first speed, especially Edmund Lyndeck as the Turpin referee, who will perform in this production "Johanna", which was cut out of the original production and Ken Jennings as Toby, whose beautiful tenor fills the auditorium "Not While I" I'm around. "But it's the stunning musical score of Stephen Sondheim and the charming Lansbury performance, especially George Hearn, which makes this gothic musical night a theatrical experience that will stay with you long after the curtain. Not for all tastes, but if you're a game and you have a strong heart, SWEENEY TODD ​​is a pleasure for all music theater lovers and the need for fans Stephen Sondheim and Angela Lansbury.
