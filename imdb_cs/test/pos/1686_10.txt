If there are people who don't like this movie, I don't think they are people. This film deploys all the emotions and shows many sides of Judith Light's character. Made in 1997, this is one of the best movies I've seen and really the movie that Judith Light played to make me a huge fan of her. This movie, though sometimes you want to churn out a son for trusting her, is incredibly moving. I shout at the end every time, and it takes a lot of work! The storyline doesn't have much to do, but Judith Light's acting is incredible. She looks beautiful all the time and to the end, you don't want the fate imposed by the courts to make her happen. Overall, the film is worth my highest praise! Thank you for doing this and redefining my opinion on the death penalty. I wait impatiently for this movie to come out on DVD or some other form of media because Lifetime is starting to release some movies to customers. Although I have no high expectations for this because it happened almost 9 years ago, which is still hard to believe, because this film is deeply rooted in my head.
