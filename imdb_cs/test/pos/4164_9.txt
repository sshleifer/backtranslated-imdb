Spirit and Chaos is the artistic biography of the Japanese poet and writer Miyazawa Kenji, who worked in the early 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method ("sketching" poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty), and his efforts to embrace hard reality in the face of his idealistic imagination. The film integrated excerpts of poems Miyazawa into the plot beautifully. His relationships with students were powerful, especially in one scene, where he offers to steal materials from a classroom to a student who has just been caught. Miyazawa is selfless sympathy for farmers in his village, his sister and other unhappy people can serve as lessons for all of us. In addition, Miyazawa's dedication to science was also nicely portrayed. At a time when Western thoughts were still encountering skepticism, especially in provincial cities such as Miyazawa City, it understands its usefulness to help its fellow citizens and is inspired by its elegance. The way the film presented moments of artistic passion and disappointment in the writer was really intense and well interpreted. <br /> <br /> I felt that CGI integrated into the film, while pioneering innovative, clashed with more organic animation. You could argue that it was intentional to represent the conflict in the main character, but I found it rather unusual. I would also like the film to talk about Miyazawa's Buddhist influence, but without it it worked well. Although this movie was very good. I give him 9/10, with one point being subtracted for CGI. Otherwise, animation, conspiracy and dialogue were wonderful and cordial. I haven't seen any other Kawamori Shoji movies, but after seeing this, I'm sure I'll give you a chance.
