I was very curious about Anatomy (aka Anatomy) and if I saw it, I had to buy it because no video stores in my area carried the movie. Since it wasn't a cheap DVD, I took a chance and thought I'd look at other IMDb comments. Many of these comments have not given me enough hope of giving away a lot of dollars for a movie I have never seen or had any trace of. Basically I got the idea that it was a sexy youth oriented romp compared to many cookie cutter teen thrillers. Well, something in my mind told me to ignore these comments and buy it! I did it and I was pleasantly surprised! If it is compared to other movies, I'd say it's a variation of Coma and Extreme Measures. I haven't seen any comparison with movies like Scream, Urban Legends, et al. Yes, the cast is young (that's because they're middle-aged! At least they're not boring high school characters) and yes, some are greedy (basically the character played by Anna Loos and treated quite tastefully in German language version), but Anatomy is well designed, there is a tense mood all over, files are amazing, makeup effects are wow, and Frank Potente is very trustworthy in her role. I found out that I enjoyed it through several holes in the plot! The story of a student discovering a secret society that makes autopsies on still living patients is a rather scary scenario, and what happens to those patients afterwards is smart enough. Sure, could you ask why she didn't get out of the CITY? Okay, but the movie should be in half an hour. This was the first effort of the German part of Columbia Pictures and it's actually quite impressive. There was a bit of care in production and actually offering some real excitement is a success. It's a little mature in mind because it doesn't seek constant opportunities for sexual encounters (breast fest) or juvenile drug jokes. Anne Loos's character, who often makes sex notes and looking for some fun, was in fact a pleasant touch - having a character who was a woman smarter than any of the men at school. She found out that sex was just a distraction for her, and men were missing. IMPORTANT STUFF: Watching this movie in original German with English or French subtitles is the best way to enjoy it. I saw theatrical trailers dubbed in English and was disgusted with the change he made in the film. I've never seen a properly dubbed movie in my life - they never find voices that suit actors or movie characters. Sure, I was trying to watch some of the anatomy dubbed in English and the level of intelligence dropped so it looked more like a comedy. A good example is when a guy was brought out of being cut and screaming to be taken back - when he heard it in German, he sounded frantic, but in English he sounded like a comedian. Frankly, I'm sick of hearing people who say they can't handle reading subtitles or watching "letterboxed" movies. Anatomy comes as stupid with dubbed voices that seem octaves too high for all of the people you see in the movie, and Anne Loos's sexual comments sound like horrible comments right from the Fast Times at Ridgemont High. I wonder if negative comments about Anatomy are from people who watched that dubbed, it just doesn't look like the same movie at all! This is not a cheap horror movie and deserves to be seen as it was created. Interestingly, some of the English subtitles differ in the scenes in the function and the addition of "creation". <br /> <br /> As it turns out, I played and won with anatomy. It is a competent thriller with likeable characters and does not try to go for cheap excitement.
