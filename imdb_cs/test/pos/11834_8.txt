"In Love and War" is a simple feel-good television movie, and should be seen as such. It is the story of World War II A British soldier, Newby, captured his Italian commando and imprisoned in a former orphanage. As the Italians surrender to the Allies, the squad is released and tries to flee. But the Germans arrive and the squad is captured again. Only Newby, wounded, remains at large. The rest of the film tells how it is hidden and protected by guerrillas, and its survival. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler End) <br /> <br /> Based on a real story, "In Love" and "War" is a refreshing film. Half-comedy, half-romance, the story is simple and unambiguous. "Atmosfera" is warm and sunny, and various stereotypes (desperately unorganized or romantic Italians, serious strict Germans and phlegmatic and pragmatic Brits), though unoriginal, are still funny. Nicola Piovani's musical score also adds to the Mediterranean flavor. Although it is far from "tea with mussolini" or "la vita e bella", "in love and war" is a sweet simple film that will make you smile on your face and maybe a little tan.
