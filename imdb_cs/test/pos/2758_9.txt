Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x, not much different from previous games (except Tony Hawk 3). The only thing that appears in Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x is a new selection of levels and improved graphics. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x offers a new career mode and that's 2x career. 2x Career is basically Tony Hawk's 1 career because there are only five challenges. If you missed Tony Hawk 1 and 2, I suggest you buy Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x, but if you played the first two games, you should try it out. Overall, there is really nothing new, but it's still fun to go through the game. Hopefully this review benefits from your needs. Graphics: 7 out of 10 Overall, clean visual effects aren't really one of the main features of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x. The atmosphere has changed a lot from Tony Hawk 1 and 2, and the character models look a little better. When you look back at Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 and 2 on the old PS1, the idea that the old graphics are ugly runs their heads. In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x, the graphics are rendered A LOT better. Character models are no longer filled with jaggys, textures are smoother, but not the widest. Tony Hawk For Skater 2x visualizations don't match Tony Hawk's 3 graphics, but Activision probably didn't want Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x to have extraordinary graphics. Graphics generally deserve an average score of 7 because they haven't given the Xbox full power. The graphics are nice and clean, that's all I have to say. Sound: 8 of 10 Sound effects don't bring much imagination, but skateboards appearing on the ground are great. The main reason I mentioned the sound factor was that you are not obliged to listen to Tony Hawk's below-average soundtrack because the soundtrack feature is available. The sound effects sound much better than the sounds in Tony Hawk 1 and 2, mainly because it's clearer and just that everything sounds great. One of the main reasons I bought this game is my own soundtrack. The grind sound effects still sound the same as the first two games, just a little bit tuned. One of the main problems with the sound factor is that if the song is over, it will NOT go to the next song, the song you just listened to will play again. I do not like the soundtrack in the game, but as I said, you are not obliged to listen to it. Controls: 10 of 10 Controls are the best part of Tony Hawk Pro Skater Pro Skater 2x. Control settings are amazingly comfortable and easy to get used to. On the days of Playstation, people thought the controls were the best, but it looks like she has done better with Xbox controls twice. Surprisingly, it is very easy to use the control lever to perform tricks. Activision did a great job with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x control. They made the Xbox Controller the best for Tony Hawk's games. You won't be disappointed with the style of control, and that's a guarantee. <br /> <br /> Game: 10 out of 10 Excluding the fact that Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x is basically Tony Hawk 1 and 2 together, the game is still incredibly fun. Game factor has changed a bit. This time you get more air than in the first two games and it is much easier to perform tricks. In Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x, each character has three career modes, consisting of Tony Hawk's 1 career, Tony Hawk's 2 career and 2 career. Tony Hawk's 1 career is fairly easy, because in the first game you get NIC for air. Career Tony Hawk 2 delivers the same amount of difficulty as the playstation. The only difficulty that applies to 2x careers is finding out where all the items are, but after you have done that, 2x career is not difficult at all. In the 2x career, there are a total of 3 levels, and the first two levels consist of finding secret tapes, collecting S-K-A-T-E, and doing anything else is required for that particular level. The third level of three is the level of competition where you have to earn a certain amount of points to earn gold. In the first two levels, secret tapes appear in both of them and collect the letters S-K-A-T-E. Overall, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x still keeps old Tony Hawk Pro Skater vibrations. Story: - <br /> <br /> Fun factor: 10 out of 10 Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x is a far, funniest Xbox game today. I played Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 and 2, and then I didn't like it, but for some reason Tony Hawk Pro Skater is 2 really fun. Not much to say, except that Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x is by far the best Xbox game today. One of the problems is that once you have played the game, you will play it a few times, but it will be repeated. <br /> <br /> Playback Value: 10 out of 10 Tony Hawk Skaters For Skater 2x provides a high replay value. There are lots of scams you want to unlock, and lots of video characters. Overall, Tony Hawk Pro Skater has twice a lot of replay value, mainly because it's so fun. Featured Features: You are not required to listen to the crappy soundtrack in the game. Worst feature: The actual soundtrack is a little messy. Final Statement: Many people have complained in the past that they don't like Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x because there's nothing new but they should stop complaining because your lot of games for $ 50.00. <br /> <br /> Graphics: 7 of 10.
