It was one of Columbo's worst episodes I saw, but I'm only in the second season. <br /> <br /> Columbo's typical activities are fun and irritating. His cigar-like ashes, which had caused him trouble, had been seen before, and the piece that always identifies the killer in some way - in this case, cooking, the Tho scene in a cooking television show that is turned away from the main theme. Also, it was not explained why the brother was cutting the mixer wires at the beginning of the exhibition. The reason has never been explained, nor does it serve any purpose. But the part I didn't like most was the bride's death. It has never been explained and it is the main reason I give this episode a low degree.
