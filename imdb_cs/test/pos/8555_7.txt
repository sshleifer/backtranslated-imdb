After 30 years or more, I captured this film on television. Several aspects of the film excelled while viewing it for years after it was made. The little-known C Virgil Georghiu story is remarkable, almost reminiscent of Tolstoy's story of a man confused by a cosmic scheme he cannot understand. Compare this film with more well-known contemporary works, such as Spelberg's "Schindler's List", and you will begin to realize that the Second World War trauma should be perceived against a larger canvas of racism beyond the simplified Nazi concept of Aryan vs Jews. This film touches on Hungarians who do not like Romanians, the Romanians do not like the Russians, and so they touch upon the disputed relations of Jews with their Christian Romanian friends while they are under pressure. As I haven't read the book, it's hard to see how much the director and the screenwriters have changed her. For example, it is interesting to study the Romanian peasant's view of emigrating to the US in order to make money only to return to Romania and invest there. In my opinion, Johann Moritz's character was probably one of Anthony Quinn's most beautiful roles, which he placed next to his work in "La Strada", "Zorba the Greek" and "Barabbas". The finest and most memorable sequence in the movie is the latest with Anthony Quinn and Virna Lisi trying to smile. A father carrying a daughter born from the rape of his wife Russians is a story in itself, but the director is able to show reconciliation with a simple gesture - an act carrying a child without slipping into melodramatic shots. Today, after the death of Princess Diana, we often mention the insensitive paparazzi. The final sequence is the indictment of the paparazzi and insensitive media (director Verneuil also comments on a similar note during the court scene because cameramen are preparing for Moritz). The interaction between the Church and the State was so beautifully summed up in the laconic statement of the orthodox priest "I pray to God to direct those who have the power to use them". Some of the short shots, such as the footage of the secretary secretary who listened to the petition, said so much in such a small footage. The direction was so impressive that the cut had a rear seat. Finally, what struck me most was the splendid rich color texture provided by cameraman Andreas Winding - from great credit sequences to the end. I remembered being a cameraman for another popular French movie called "Rampings of Clay" by Jean-Louis Bertucelli. I haven't seen such use of colors for a long time, except to keep David's shields. There were mistakes: I wish Virny Lisi's character was more materialized. I have never been able to understand the character of Serge Reggiani - the only intellectual in the film. The rail station scene at the end seems to be brought out of the Sergio Leone westerns series. Finally, the film was basically built on a love story that unfortunately takes the back seat. To sum up, this film captivated me in more departments than in one. The story is important today as it was when it was.
