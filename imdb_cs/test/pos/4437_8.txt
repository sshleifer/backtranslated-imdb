My architect is nominated for Best Documentary Feature Film at the Academy of 2004 and follows film director Nathaniel Kahn in an attempt to find out about his father the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974 when Nate was 11 years old, leaving behind an incredible but limited set of work, unpaid debts and three separate families who lived within a few kilometers of each other. My architect follows Kahn's life by chronologically exploring his buildings and dispersing their beauty with the story of a charismatic but selfish and emotionally immature genius. As a son who never publicly recognized Lou during his life, Nate gently placed himself in the story without overriding the main focus. When exploring the magnificent Salk Institute in California, Nate evokes the mythical use of his father's space and light in his buildings, making his viewers a calm and fascinating experience. A shot of Nate roller skates in a smoke-white central Salk meeting point emphasizes the building's harmony with nature. It's breathtaking. My architect also covers the difficulties Louis Kahn had with accepting his proposals. Several fantastic buildings exist only on paper, rejected by more practical architects and developers. Until Louis Kahn went east, his visions were enthusiastically received. In India, where the Indian was built <br /> <br /> the Institute of Management describes him as a guru. In Bhangladesh, where he built the beautiful building of the National Assembly, citizens consider him the father of democracy. <br /> <br /> Watching My Architect is a great way to start or continue learning about the architecture and meaning of the universe. But it is the irony of Lou Kahn's egoism combined with the transcendence of his work that will inspire you. 4 stars.
