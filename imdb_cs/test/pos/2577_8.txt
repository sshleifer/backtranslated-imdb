(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a college girl and nymphomaniac who merges with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to meet her needs. Ronnie must report to her National Guard and leave Rae alone. Rae is not long in itself because he's a city hiker with a strong need to connect with a man. After the party, Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up hitting her half to death and throws her to the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home. Lazarus provides Rae medical care and believes he can also save it from himself. Rae is like a dog in the heat, so Lazarus around her and his cooler lay a 40 pound chain so that she can't go out looking for a man. Lazarus has his own problems because his wife has just left him for another man. Lazarus turns to his blues music to relieve his pain. <br /> <br /> (My Comment) The film has a profound meaning when you get through sex and violence. The film has a different feeling. The story is raw and almost gets you into the movie as if you were there. The 40 pound chain is a good metaphor and symbolic chastity belt. You give no love to anyone, but you hold it for your true love. The chain could also be parallel to the wife who is strapped into the kitchen, but Rae did not cook. Rae wanted to have sex all the time, while her wife might not. I think Craig Brewer (writer and director) made an extraordinary film and Samuel L. Jackson sings a medium blues song. The story is emotionally charged, dealing with the themes of race, religion, music and sex in one. (Paramount Classics, 1:56 runtime, rated R) (8/10)
