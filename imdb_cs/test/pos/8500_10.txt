This type of show should not happen on television. This is the type of edge usually reserved for independent film. It's supposed to do just HBO. The fact is, Denise Leary managed to come up with one of the best TV shows ever, easily joined the ranks of SOPRANOS, OZ, ED etc. Kudos gang at ABC for having NYPD Blue wasn't flirting, and Mr. Leary and his gang to create truly unique viewing experience. My only complaint is that the show is not long enough ... the hour would be better, but I can't wait for the next episode!
