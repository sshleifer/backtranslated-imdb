The real story of the Spanish paraplegic Ramon Sampedra, who has been fighting for decades for the right to be eutenized. This film, along with the winner of the same year's Million Dollar Baby, made their year of disability a desire for death this year. Both advocates for people with disabilities and (unfortunately for disability advocates) conservative pro-life groups protested both films and their Oscar nominations. Nominations also came during the entire Terry Schiavo debacle, just to make it all from a historical perspective. Protests, especially from the disabled, make any sense against the Million Dollar Baby? the film clearly, without ripple, depicted the life of the paraplegic as worthless. The central character of the film, Maggie Fitzgerald, becomes paraplegic, does not seem to receive any advice, no help, and immediately wants to die. The film is, frankly, quite stupid and uncomplexed. Nautical Inside, based on a true story, is certainly much more attentive to the subject. Most likely he got into the same category as the Million Dollar Baby, without his demonstrators, an incredibly common phenomenon. The film gives time to many different sides of the argument. He immediately states that the desire to die is just a hero and the protagonist himself. However, he is guilty of several crimes, and yet I would understand why disabled groups might have a problem. First of all, it is a meeting of the protagonists with the Paraplegic bishop. I am not looking for the way it is displayed. His orbit-driven wheelchair is depicted as absurd and there is an almost comical sequence where his effeminate boys and boys with his toys pull him up the stairs in a chair. Nor can he reach the room where Ramón is located, and one of the boy's toys is forced to talk between them. I had to think, gee, maybe if Ramón lived in a little more wheelchair accessible trolley, he wouldn't have spent his whole life in bed, and maybe he would have found a fulfilling life (who knows how closely the film captures reality). Director Amenábar (The Other) also includes several ridiculous scenes that make this suicide movie more viable, such as the cross-cut sequence where Ramón looks thoughtful and his legal child is born. However, apart from a few nasty moments, the film is very good. It hurts that someone may want to die when they have the ability to bring so much joy and insight into the lives of others. But ultimately our lives belong to us. Shouldn't We Choose? The strongest benefit of the film is its supportive characters and actors who play them. It illustrates how Ramón's struggle and decisions affect people around him with beautiful precision. Particularly family members are great and Ramon's last departure is absolutely heartbreaking and tears me. My favorite performance in the film comes from Lola Dueñas, which I also considered last year at Volver, Almodóvar, or at least certainly the most undervalued.
