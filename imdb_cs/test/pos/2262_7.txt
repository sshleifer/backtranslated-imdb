Everything Is Illuminated A young Jewish American looking for a woman who helped his grandfather escape the Nazi pursuit while embarking on a cross-European tour with some unlikely co-workers. Liev Schreiber makes his directorial debut with playful angst usually associated with his acting ethos. When successful actors choose to sit in the director's chair, we usually get a biographical look at the souls under the acting mask. Usually we get mishmash genres - Check. But what we don't normally get is an insightful original film that is trustworthy, intelligent, and moving. Elijah Wood plays Jonathan, a curious young boy who collects pieces of life as he goes. It's on a mission to find a woman in a photo. A sepia picture bears his grandfather (a miraculous resemblance to him) and a woman. He helps with his journey with the help of wizards who consist of a hip-hop loving break-dancer, Alex (Eugene Hutz), his apathetic and perma-poisoned grandfather (Boris Leskin) and his dog Sammy Davis Junior Jr! What follows is basically comedy. There is an un-patronisingly simple introduction with voice-overs. Alex is especially funny when he raises his younger brother in 1969, proving how popular he is with the cubs and break-dancing, which makes him like Jonathan's opposite. Schreiber begins to disassemble the characters as they progress and the comedy acts as a deliberate veil to what is the story of the three people associated with the Holocaust who truly do not know each other. All three hold the film with tenderness and authenticity, which is something Schreiber would probably not do wrong, and how charming and fantastic the film is, the horrors that can break through, ie Past, are presented in almost tasty tone (random music, cinematography) )), which makes them increasingly worrying. Given that an unlikely group will finally find a city, they are looking to learn about the real atrocities that have occurred and find out who they really are. Elijah wood is as authentic as usual, bringing his usual innocence and strength to the canvas. Formally a resident of good in the Lord of the Rings and a resident of evil in Sin City, he plays Jonathan with praise when he is bombarded with cultural shocks and quest for truth. As a grandfather, Boris Leskin also gives his children anxiety and frustration with great humor and conviction as his own past breaks up. But it's Eugene Hutz as Alex. A director who used this old shop with translation misunderstandings to create and maintain humor that is actually funny and not imaginative. Schreiber added a charming debut that has both heart and soul. Continuous score and beautiful photo create a fairytale haze around a story about identity, truth and family. If there were a complaint, it would be the speed at which the film changes direction; although this could be intentional it does not have to fit well with all. However, this is an excellent effort that brings great comedy and connection between an improbable group, while drinking another aspect of the horrors of World War II in a whole new way. <br /> <br /> -Chi & Ojo
