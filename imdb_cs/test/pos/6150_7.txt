Instead of watching the recycled history of "Pearl Harbor" with anything new than revealing, except for a few real events that were attended by several individuals who were thrown, so filmmakers could say they contributed to the spread of history, along with nothing else than CGI. the explosions filled for the elegant romantic triangle. One should go see the dark blue world. This film takes place in the historic period of World War II, which Czech pilots left their homeland and went to fight for the RAF instead of putting their hands on their hands. the Nazis. It was a part of history that should be told at least once to the outside world. A love triangle takes place among the main characters, but one of them does not disappear comfortably like Pearl Harbor, but through sacrifice for true friendship. The film is a tragedy after the tragedy, not even with the bitter end, with our hero, who did not enjoy the glory of taking his country back, the return of his present lover's love, the return of his reunited lover's love, or even the return of an unconditional lover. love his life long pet. He's totally broken and doesn't feel worse in a Russian labor camp. This type of ending is something Hollywood would probably change if it were their scenario. The film sometimes plays sentimental, but it also shows people's humanity. Overall, a valuable movie.
