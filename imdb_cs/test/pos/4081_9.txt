As a former Merchant Seaman, I was really interested in this movie: I personally participated in the search for leaving Kingston Jamaica, where one person was found. We managed to get him ashore because we were at territorial borders. It was found on another ship where I was on stowway and we couldn't land it anywhere because of passport / national problems. In fact he remained for a year as an almost "honest" crewman and worked for his retain. Africa is notorious for stowway pickups. At the beginning of the movie is a great scene where a large-scale carrier enters the African port: all the sizes of the dwarfs. The crew jumped to a low contact and drunkenness. Normal yet. The drama begins when passengers reach the vast cavernous spaces of the ship. Joss Ackland is brilliant because the captain with a drink problem is chasing his Nemesis Suchet directly on the form as a Companys representative on board. The search for the perpetrators is classic, but we didn't have weapons. I doubt the use of weapons in this film. This ship seemed to have a huge armory. In my experience, weapons at sea are strictly limited by customs legislation. Also, having a dog on board was special. Pertwee is brilliant as an enraged Mate. The horror that follows the discovery of the victims is unbearable: the gloomy metal background of the ships holds on and there is no place to hide the drama. they are gradually sucked into the world of violence, from which there is no escape. The persecution of ships, especially the scene from the motoring space, is "on the edge": the feeling of extreme claustrophobia abounds. The feeling of pressing metal and death is just the barrel of the weapon. The film is brutal: my girlfriend had to give up watching while shooting and beating scenes. While it goes to Suchet in the comfort of his well-equipped cabin gets drunk doesn't know about Mayhem 3 decks below. It's a tense movie, faulty in parts, but the real message is that we can all get into such violence. Slow and sure. Think of the drivers who took Jews to Auschwitz, the officials who drafted this timetable. I always remember someone who visited the Dachau concentration camp at the end of the war and said that one of the S. Guardsmen had put a bird table outside the camp crematorium. This film is like this: ordinary people suddenly find themselves in a world of unstoppable violence!
