This movie is amazing! I can watch it over and over again. Robin Hood is perfectly cast and Marian is beautiful. I personally think Marian is a German man's funniest character, along with Latrine and Sheriff! While space spheres get boring and silly after a while, this always keeps your interest! It was a great movie and you will never be bored. Great casting is in the role, and is perfectly falsely inclined to give great meaning and can be watched over and over again! You will love this movie if you watch it, except when you hate comedy, or you don't think Robin Hood should manipulate it. But this old story is bored and this film gives it a great new taste!
