Amazing film! Great combination of talent! I am a huge fan of David Duchovny and is excellent in this movie! I'd like to see him in more films of this kind. His talents are definitely under-used and have much more to offer besides "Agent Mulder" (although I am also a big fan of the series). He is easily Cary Grant of our generation. If you haven't seen this movie, YOU MUST! A great love story that shows that love never dies ... it's with you forever. Minnie driver is great and how can you go wrong with the cast that includes Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Loggia and Mr. Belushi? This film did not get any kind of appreciation nod but deserved one. Great job Bonnie Hunt! ** By the way ... the soundtrack is great too! **
