"Best in Show" is often a merry mockup that takes us to the world of exhibitions and some dog owners who are preparing for the event. The only thing that separates this movie from real shows is that dogs in "Best in Show" act more reasonably than their owners! Fun stuff from a first-class cast that includes Eugene Levy (who wrote the film), Catherine O'Har, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch and Christopher Guesta (who wrote with Levy and the director)). They're all funny, but Fred Willard steals the film with his explosively funny performance as a show dog showman who says the worst thing. Moreover, dogs are cute too. "Best in Show" is not exactly the laugh I was expecting, but there are laughs and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> *** (of four)
