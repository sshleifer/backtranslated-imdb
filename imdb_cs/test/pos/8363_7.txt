Kid Power Hour featured two segments: Hero High and Shazam. Let's start with Hero High. Hero High was to be the new cartoon of Archies, representing their superhero identities: Pureheart Powerful (Captain Hero), Superteen (Betty) and Evilheart (Reggie). However, Filmation could not get the right to make it a little better and come up with it. Here's the character list: Captain California (Archie), Glorious Gal (Betty), Weatherman (Jughead), Dirty Trixie (Veronica), Rex Ruthless (Reggie), Chief Samson (Mr. Weatherbee) and Miss Grimm (Miss Grundy). The show featured live action sketches, as well as cartoon adventures. Humor was a typical lame filming joke, but at least it had a sense of fun. It was fun for the kids, though not at the previous standards. The second segment was Shazam!, which was very loyal to comics, unlike previous live action. All major villains made appearances, as well as all Marvel family (including Freckles Marvel, in at least one episode). Uncle Dudley had the right voice and loud character, as well as his constant appearance "Shazambago". Burr Middleton, a 70s veteran of television shows like Fish, voiced Big Red Cheese, while Alan Oppenheimer (Rudy Wells in early $ 6 million and Skeletor's voice in He-Man) dominated Dr. Sivana. Marvels always had a sense of whim for them, so little change was needed for their adventures to meet the standards of broadcast and practice (censors). The stories themselves were very imaginative and inventive. Among the villains who appeared were: Sivana, Black Adam, Mr. Atom, Mr. Mind, Aunt Minerva, Ibac and Crocodile Creatures. Mr. Tawky Tawny also debuted on the screen. Hero High to be released from BCI, but Shazam! is still in limbo as well as live-action show. Hopefully the proposed movie will help them shake the DVD. It's worth watching and deserving a DVD treatment.
