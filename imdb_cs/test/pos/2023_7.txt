So you want to be a rock star? Check out this movie. You don't like rock, you say? Or are you really into heavy metal? Then take your favorite album and dream, this movie has nothing to offer. I have seldom seen a film capable of portraying a dream of being as good as this in a rock band. I had long hair in the late 80s and early 90s and played guitar for the past 15 years. Did I like Rock Star? Oh yes. Music is good, not great, actors are good and credible, even Jennifer Aniston plays its part to perfection. Mark Wahlberg is perfect as a wannabe rock singer. So you know what you get. A film about dreams that have come true, stepped on them and finally found out what life really is about. It's a good solid seven out of ten, nothing more, nothing less.
