Now I understand that this film was not meant to be an indictment against all Indians, but it's a wonderful movie because it dares to explore the hypocrisy that some Indians have about their women and sexuality. For some time, I knew that sexism was very common in this society (women are murdered because the married family no longer wants to, or because they have a small dowry and frequent killing of female fruits because they are seen as a curse instead of blessing) ). I also realize that some of this culture will be greatly offended by the film, but it is true that there is some truth to the subject - even though the film was so heavily attacked when it debuted in India ten years ago. As a result of the extreme misogyny in the film, most Western viewers members will be shocked or at least be emotionally drawn into the situation of women in this film. Although I'm a man, I'm not an angry feminist and I'm straightforward, the film has had a strong positive impact on me and it's NOT an aging movie that only Lesbians and "male hater" could enjoy. In fact, I don't think the film promotes hatred for men or homosexuality, but instead gives a credible argument, as in the case of these two ladies it was the only reasonable alternative for their evil spouses. Yes, I use the word "bad" and I mean it because both spouses living in this big household are strongly selfish and have no regard for their spouses' sexuality. In many traditional societies, this is indeed the case and women are doomed to an empty emotional existence. One husband married a living young wife, Situ, from the family's duty. This arranged marriage is unpleasant for them, but at the beginning Sita tries to connect with her annoying husband. However, he sees himself as a victim and could care less about Sita - and he continues to have an affair with a liberal-minded Chinese lady. To make matters worse, he did nothing to hide the matter and did not apologize. In their dead marriage, sex was purely meant to produce children, and there was no way Sita could have any of her sexual or emotional needs met. And unfortunately he might have less to worry about. Another husband was married to a woman who was barren (Radha). Surprisingly, after initially trying to have children, they left another 13 years without any sexual contact! This is because this man has decided to become ascetic (ie, in Hinduism, a man who gives up the pleasure of the world to gain inner enlightenment). That he wanted to do it was fine and good if he wasn't married yet and had duties for his wife. However, when he got married, it was an incredibly selfish act and, like his brother, he assumed that his wife had no sexual feelings or seemed to care for it. The closest one that allowed her to sexually sleep with him was to sleep next to him - when he helped her to learn to "overcome the desires of the body" beside him. It had to bring her frustration. So you have two deprived and normal women living in the same household who are longing for emotional connection as well as outlets for their sexual needs. These needs ultimately bring these sister laws together - first emotionally, but later sexually. The film was brilliant as it made me look and understand how in some cases homosexuality is inevitable and even healthy compared to the life of emotional desolation. Later in the film, when the intensity of their sexual sex The relationship emerges, leading to the unexpected response of Radha's "enlightened" husband - a man who seeks religious insight and peace, yet is so wrapped in himself that real insight and growth is impossible. This is a very challenging and mature movie. Although nudity is very small, the subject is very adult and it is not a film that would show your children. In fact, one very small figure who is masturbating in front of an old paralyzed lady is very disturbing - as I said, this is not a movie to let your children watch. However, for a mature audience, this is an excellent and highly erotic movie that gets you to think. The film features good acting, intricate characters, excellent writing, beautiful moods of music and a slow pace that some might bother, but what I found rewarded. The only serious negative I can not blame for the film itself, but the idiots who released it on videotape. This is because even though the film is in English, the accents are sometimes quite strong and it is not always easy to understand what is being said. BUT, and this is the worst part, there are no closed or open headlines - including them for the Western audience. If you watch this movie, you will see if you can find it on DVD, or hopefully the newer video release will have subtitles - mine certainly not. By the way, director Deepa Mehta (and a popular director) has made several other beautiful films such as EARTH and BOLLYWOOD / Hollywood. An important theme of her films is the conflict between traditional Indian culture and expectations and westernism - with a strong emphasis on female characters. No wonder this West American lady is home in Canada and is divorced - at least a totally unusual woman. For a similar film that explores traditional culture, Western culture meets, try another Canadian jewel EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN.
