- Few can understand Leland's character and make it most likely innate to see both sides of life, and facing this reality is very difficult and can lead some few to bad acts (like Leland's character does) but for such sad and real reasons that His intentions were good, in the sense that the intention to save another from physical or mental (in this case) pain for a long time. and it's really sad how most of the time he makes mistakes in this movie, but one character who makes them through good intentions is killed. The lesson from this movie is for a unique person to see, realize, face and make the right life situation u to see and do right, or to inspire who can make the right to a bad situation. but before ... u have to see both sides of something and rationalize it because of the long peace and tranquility of all human life.
