I've been waiting for this movie for so long and I finally got to yesterday. In short, I'm glad I finally did. Humor is out of the wall cheerful. The story is so incredibly believable that it must be at least some truth to it. If something stood out in this movie, it's definitely a cafe scene. I was every man there. You'll get dumping. You'll find that your ex has fooled you with a guy you're sure is an asshole. Every time you see something for the next few days, you get only horrible thoughts that are placed in all the wrong areas. Screws everyone and everyone knows it. Probably I could observe that a man licked all day and looked at his wallet with his finger and laughed at himself that he was there.
