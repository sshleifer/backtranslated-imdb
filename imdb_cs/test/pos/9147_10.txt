No matter how many times Wile Ethelbert "Famishius Famishius" Coyote tries to get the Runner "Burnius Roadibus", we always know what will happen, although our sympathy always remains with WEC. The highlight in "Hook, Line and Stinker" is the Rube Goldberg-style scheme that WEC hope ultimately completes RR; but of course you know what will happen. So, Wile E. continues to cheerfully engage in fanaticism (defined by George Santayan, who doubles your efforts after you've forgotten your goal), while Road Runner almost never becomes aware of a potential danger - or his lack - in which he might find himself. A real classic. And yes, the middle name of the coyote is Ethelbert. I learned it from "Jeopardy!"
