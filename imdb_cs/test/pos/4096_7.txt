This version of "The Lost Horizon" is not really a bad movie at all. I think the problem is that people like to choose musicals, especially those that were made in the 1970s. I saw the film on his original release in 1973 (I was ten) and I really liked it, especially the music. (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, acting is good and technically it's excellent. Sure, there are one or two somewhat stupid dance numbers, but hey, you can't win everyone. I have this movie on video and I watch it so often ... and I always like it!
