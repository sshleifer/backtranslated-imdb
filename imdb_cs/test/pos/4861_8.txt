First they came for the Communists and I didn't say because I wasn't a communist. Then they came to the Jews and I did not speak because I was not a Jew. Then they came for the Catholics and I didn't say because I was a Protestant. Then they came to me, and by that time nobody left to talk to me. <br /> <br /> Ascribed to rev. Martin Niemoller, 1945 <br /> <br /> When you face intolerance or injustice, the simplest thing is nothing - talk and risk becoming an object of contempt. But when too much will happen? Global anti-Semitic sentiments enabled Hitler's genocidal policies to thrive, and the same benefits of fear and ignorance enabled the anti-communist purges of McCarthyism to destroy thousands of people's lives. Inaction does not mean that one is not at fault. Lawrence Newman is a human chameleon: silent and indescribable, blending seamlessly with his surroundings. Lawrence doesn't want to be involved - when he witnesses an attack on a young woman, he doesn't tell anyone and his business. His world spirals get into chaos when he buys glasses and confuses them. Lawrence's view of the world and his gaze on him is forever changed. <br /> <br /> While the subject of this film is not new, its presentation is definitely unique. It is much easier to understand the irrational nature of prejudice when placed in a particular context - Lawrence is more concerned with the assumptions of being Jewish than with the views of his attackers. He believes that if he remedies this "oversight", everything will be fine without realizing that logic and prejudice will never go hand in hand. <br /> <br /> Whether you're playing on the schemer (the only thing I liked about "Fargo") or the home sheriff from home, the roles of William H. Macy are connected by a common thread - his characters share a fine , a deliberate face that gives them the essence. Macy's nails Lawrence to the smallest detail, and says more with a clueless look or trembling in the voice than a dialogue page. By showing, rather than telling, Lawrence is able to share his fear and confusion with the viewer. The support cast brings the story together. Laura Dern is convincing as Gerty, Lawrence's wife woman with the past. Trailer Park Rude, but other secular wise, she also felt the wrath of prejudice as a result of "error" and unconsciously exacerbates Lawrence's situation. Michael Lee Aday (aka "Meatloaf") is as frightening as Fred, a prototype side-by-side, the same part of ignorance and poison who meet their neighbors for his virulent cause. In the midst of chaos, Finklestein (David Paymer) is the focus of aggression and the voice of reason that raises important questions. Paymer's handed portrait holds Finklestein from becoming a stereotype or someone whose sole purpose is to provoke sympathy, making his one of the most powerful performances in the film. Strict editing and close-cropped cinematography make claustrophobia in a small US town for a clean image with small distractions and a mixture of air - both reassuring and distracting. The deliberate use of harsh two-color lighting to highlight the malevolent aspects of the work and the carefully recorded soundtrack are powerful without being overwhelming. Finally, stage and costume design renews the era that is an essential part of the film's message. <br /> <br /> The "Focus" unconventional approach to addressing prejudices is the reason to recommend this film. Consider a great story, a solid performance, and a movie look as added bonuses.
