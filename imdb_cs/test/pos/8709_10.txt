This is one of my favorite movies, vampire, vampire vampires. But manicure-damaged and eternally drooling half brother Radu has other plans. After killing his father, King Vampire, the Council now sets his gaze on Stefan's new Stefan's deadly friend Michelle and her two beautiful friends and the all-powerful Bloodstone. Well, the scenery is beautiful and it should be as it was shot in place in Transyl-fricken-vania for sake. Actresses are no big shakes and Stefan Heroic Vampire is about as charming as a chilled poker poker, but who cares? The only reason to watch this movie is RADU! It's a physical tribute to Nosferatu and has the best lines in the movie, all spoken in the husky voice of a man who smokes ten packs of cigarettes a day. The cemetery festival scene is one of the best scenes in the film when the Council slowly approaches the camera and reveals how the world looks at its smile. I found that I had encouraged him to collect sacrifices and mock his perfect brother. But maybe I'm just a sicko. Doubtful taste for men aside, I highly recommend this movie to vampire enthusiasts. It's original, it's fun, and Radu is one of the best vampires I've seen in a long time ... much more entertaining than the tough, tragic, whining Undead brats who endlessly tunes horror screens these days. The Council has its sadism and never apologizes. That should be a vampire.
