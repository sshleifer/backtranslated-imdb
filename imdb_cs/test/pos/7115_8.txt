This whimsical, creepy creep starts at a cliff-top castle overlooking the sea, a great environment like a vampire bat flying and creeping towards a sleeping doctor (Onslow Stevens). The bat changes into a person known as Baron Latos, in fact Count Dracula (John Carradine). He seeks the help of Dr. Edelmann to cure him of his vampire. Finally, a good doctor also wants to help his hunchbacked sister-assistant (Jane Adams), Wolf Man (Lon Chaney), and Frankenstein Monster (Glenn Strange). But Dracula's insidiousness pollutes the blood of the doctor and becomes Jekyll / Hyde vampire himself. This is somewhat better than the previous year "House of Frankenstein" is less episodic and more exciting visually. There is a haunted scene where Dracula tries to lure a second nurse (Martha O'Driscoll) into his world, where she initially plays "Moonlight Sonata" on the piano, which soon recedes to scary music. Director Erle Kenton uses expressive shadows and frightening music to build many sequences, including a splendid splendid set often used by the studio in his horror roles. Two artists are remarkable: Stevens, with his amazing voice, is initially sympathetic, then convincingly horrible. Adams, her beautiful face in an alarming contrast to her twisted body, shows great pathos and sympathy. All this ends in a slam-bang climax, typical of the 1940's Universal Horror, a little sudden, with footage borrowed from "The Spirit of Frankenstein" (1942). I hope Universal will release it on DVD soon (it was omitted from their double version).
