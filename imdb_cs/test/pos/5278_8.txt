Rendered in the beautiful colors of the water, Ponyo At the cliff is sure to look at the view, vaguely remember the trailer, the witch I did not find impressive, I was surprised how beautiful and detailed it was. This film washed with my purity with me. On Wednesday is a young boy who comes into contact with the sea creature and his relationship with the film. Miyazaki is a master both in creating memorable paintings and in portraying young people who are in a trusted spirit with their little jokes intact. There are several parts that didn't fit me well. It would be an underestimate to say that the music "reminded" Ride Of The Valkyrians during a certain scene, it's a shame because such a precious film as it can't afford to enjoy freedom and it hurts a really great scene. The antagonist and his back story never interested me, but I think it served more as a background than anything else. Anyway, great movie. A boat trip scenario with all his paintings and sea creatures invented me. Clean and magical. And yes, hand-drawn drawing is more intimate than computer animation.
