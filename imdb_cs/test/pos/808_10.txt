David Suchet, (Poirot), "FoolProof", 03, gave excellent performance as a perfectionist in almost everything he did or said. If he had a cocktail, he always had a napkin that would pour out the excess mouth with incredible perfection! You could just display the expressions on the detective's face and see that he never missed an important item in the suspect's behavior. The beautiful Falls Colors across the English countryside were simply breathtaking. Megan Dodds, "Bait", 2000, performed outstanding performance as a very sexy, wild woman who managed to keep very important secrets from Mr. Poirot. Very nice movie if you like the acting of David Suchet as Mr. Poirot!
