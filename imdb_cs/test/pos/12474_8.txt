When I first saw it, I thought, "Wow, this is the most amazing movie, visually spoken I have ever seen." Since then I have seen some that have covered it, but still rank among the best in this department. I'm just disgusted that the long-awaited DVD was so badly made that the quality of this conversion is barely better than the VHS tape. Jungle scenes are filmed in Cameroon and "fresh" is the best adjective to describe what you see. Except for jungle sounds, "seeing" is definitely almost everything at the beginning because almost no "hearing", no dialogue until Tarzan (Christopher Lambert) becomes a friend of Ian Holm and vice-versa .... so be prepared for it, if you weren't watching this movie. Story-wise, all I say is that it's not Tarzan many of us came to know in Johnny Weismuller movies ..... but that's not a complaint. For those things they desire, and not interested in cinematography, like me, it's enough to overcome this silent period of performance <br /> <br /> In this version of Tarzan, our hero returns to Scotland (its roots), adapts to this the environment (largelyâ€¦ and a little too fast for credibility, frankly) and then return to the jungle without Jane. This is probably more true to Tarzan's books, written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Special effects here were made by Rick Baker, one of the best in the industry. Sharp DVD or not, it is still a stunning movie for display and very interesting for 2 hours and 15 minutes.
