This is a romantic though cheesy movie that is one of my favorite times. This is one of many CLASSICS 80s genres like "Pretty in Pink" or "Some Amazing". Nothing plays a traditional punk guy in love with a traditional valley, preppy girl Julie. It's a pleasing love story that makes you the root for him to eventually win a girl. It is true that most actors suck but ... <br /> <br /> I was in love with Nothing since he saw it in theaters and saw almost every movie in who he is. He's really grown up as an actor, but it's obvious in this early movie of his that he had a lot of potential. <br /> <br /> If you like 80's movies, you'll love this classic. <br /> <br /> Go rent it !!!!!
