Rachel and Chuck Yoman (Valerie Harper, Gerald McRaney) decided that the city was too busy and dangerous for her family, so they wrapped up their reluctant son (Gregory Togel) and daughter (Tammy Lauren) and returned to the lake as Rachel lived like a child. It is said that you cannot return home, but it is an ideal country home with what initially appears to be a Mayberry feeling. Later, it seems that the residence is more like people in Deliverance. Soon, bodies will begin to appear, and everyone will look suspicious except for a few friendly faces. This does not lead the family to enjoy running and swinging in the woods. We found that they must be super unconscious to find secrets and not tell anyone until they can get them. antagonists. Can ignored young Stevie save his parents, or will their persecutor (s) insert a foot into it? This movie is more than most parodies as it was played with the face. They couldn't choose a better actor and Daryl Anderson was extremely scary. Plus added is that they let us know what was going on before the characters found out, instead of pulling a footprint from the hat for reality. Anyway, it is good for a TV movie for a couple laughing.
