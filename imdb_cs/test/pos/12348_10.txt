By the way, as it looks to other comments, it seems that many people did not get a point to film. Not centered around the zombies because they are not really zombies, they are devices regenerated by the magician to scare the girls, his main focus is Meg Tilly, who wants to help him finish the job he died when he does, What you get is a great movie with an amazing ending, it's hard to find on video, but once in a while it appears on HBO or Cinamax, check it out, I gave it 10 and I recommend it.
