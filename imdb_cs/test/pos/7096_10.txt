The reason I think this movie is wonderful is that it has so many layers of emotion. You can say from the script and the wonderful play that history is behind all the feelings that are there. You understand why characters do certain steps and why they don't do others. You can feel compassion and joy and love and grief for them all at once. You see humanity at its best and worst. You can relate to characters because even though you may never have been in their exact situations before you see the qualities and falls in them that you see within you. This film is of some interest to you, but in the end it explains and feels certain peace and understanding not only in you but also in characters. I will say that I have never said so much in my life, nor did I get that much. I urge you to look at this film and take it to heart. That there is only one real thing and that is ... love.
