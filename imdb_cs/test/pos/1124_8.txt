As someone who was in Pan-Hellenic sorority, I wasn't sure what to expect when I tuned into this show. After seeing so much of the dramatization in "made for TV movies" and the foolishness of a reality show, I was wondering if Greek could show a real experience with dorms and Greek life. he was very pleasantly surprised at how the viewer could be content with identifying the well-known characters of the genre, but was also able to add depth to the characters. Greek life is not just about parties and minor conflicts. Although these things happen in Greek life, they also happen in any other social or professional circle during the life of a person. To characterize it as some exclusive experience with those who are in a Greek organization would be fake. Most of the story lines and situations taking place in Greek can take place everywhere, in every circle of friends, in sports teams, in real life. But I watched both episodes and my "little sister", which I am still very close, and I spent both episodes of laughter and a reminder of how they really captured the spirit of our years and experiences. > I liked how the second episode showed how the characters struggle with other aspects of their lives; school, relationships, goals, etc. Cappie tells Rusty that school comes first and goes to your brothers for help, which was a very true life. You can't stay in the organization if you have bad grades. The way Rusty got his job with his professor was far more appealing, but it was fun. Even the dynamics between Casey and Rusty; It happens, you grow up, and whatever your relationship with your sibling (s) is, so you have to adapt. Point: Greek is a great show, great fun value and enough "real life" to be credible and definitely worth the viewers time.
