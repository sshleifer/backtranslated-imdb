An excellent movie for those who just need to turn off and enjoy the beautiful scenery of Scotland. The film takes you on a journey of love amidst spectacular scenery. The casts are "dressed" for the parts they play, so no glamorous costumes or hair in this movie, where they're excellent, bold and down on the ground. Each character is credible and provides a convincing portrayal of the life of the island, belief and culture. time Certain for those who have even the smallest drop of Scottish blood ..... how to pull the strings of the heart and stir the soul. Something that can be shared with the family and watched over and over again .................. a real classic I'm sure will go along with some of those great movies, never not die.
