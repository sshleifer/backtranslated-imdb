(Some Spellers) In the early 1930s, an educational film about the horrors of social illness and the implications related to it: blindness madness the loss of those capabilities to function, as well as infecting other people with it, even the unborn, and ultimately death. "Damaged Lives" are far ahead of time in educating viewers about the dangers of Venereal Deasise. More than 70 years after its release in 1933, many films on this subject, which were made in the 1940s and 1950s, are just as good, if not better. Donald Bradley, Lyman Williams, is the top manager of a large shipping company who has been studying with her girlfriend Joan, Diane Sinclair for some time. both are finally planning to marry and raise a family. On one evening, Donald meets Elsie Cooper, Charlotte Merriam, and together they have one drink too much, and before you know they'll spend together in Elsie's house. When you think that his nightclub with Elsie Donald will marry his long time later, Joan loves and they both plan to have a baby, or they thought so. In the office, Donald made Elsie a panicked call and told him to come to his place for something very important. He rushes over Donald, to his horror, finds that Elsie has a sexual infection she received from her friend Nat, Harry Myers, and that she might have given her to Donald, and he could again infect his wife Joan. She tells Elsie that she's about being infected, and that she should seek medical help that Elsie shoots when Donald is about to leave. How To Get Over The Tragic Death Of Elsie Donald Gets Another Surprise Later When His Doctor Bill Hill, Jason Robards Sr., comes to his office and tells him to come with him to the hospital immediately and talk to the infectious disease. Dr. Vincent Leonard, Murray Kinnell, about her wife Joan, who has just been there. The horrible truth about Donald and his wife Joan hits him like a flash of blue and leaves him without a word, just as Joan did before. Both were infected and the infection was dreaded and unspeakable, an infection called Venereal Disease in the 1930s. He said dr. Leonard that it will take two years of treatment for both Donald and Joan to be completely cured leaves Joan in a state of dangerous suicidal thoughts. Later in Joan, feeling he has nothing to live, he closes all the windows in her and Donald's apartment and turns on the gas stove, a full blast to kill herself and Donald, who was asleep at the time. An honest film about the devastation of Venereal Disease and the damage it causes to those who are infected with this disease, both mentally and mentally, and how it could be cured if immediate medical care is provided instead of hiding it from someone's doctor and keeping it hidden, for fear of shame and embarrassment until it's too late.
