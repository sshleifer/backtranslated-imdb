Blade is a fantastic action / thriller that keeps you going all the time and Wesley Snipes adds what I would say to be his best performance yet. This film has everything you want in action / thriller, has a lot of blood, guts and gore, twisted, disturbed bad shopping, moments of humor, but especially a very good story with a lot of twists. <br /> <br /> Their continual action around the world film with breathtaking bits and effects, Wesley Snipes combat movement is fantastic. This movie is in my opinion a must-see, Wesley Snipes cool, solid look makes this movie and I can't wait for the sequel 'BLADE 2' to be released next year. <br /> <br /> My IMDB Rating - 9 of 10
