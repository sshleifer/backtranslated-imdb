Does anyone know where I could get my hands on this video or movie for it. I've been looking for him for a long time to show my daughter to show her and I can't find him anywhere. Probably because it was just on video and never did DVD or VHS or idk. I saw it right from Disney in 1996 and I think it would be the best video to show. such a good movie that has all kinds of emotions displayed throughout the movie. Also has a lot of actors who started their career with this movie. If someone knows how to get a copy of this movie or has a copy and is willing to sell it for $ 50 or something, call 201-566-0148. Thank you
