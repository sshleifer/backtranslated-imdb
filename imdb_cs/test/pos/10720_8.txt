This is probably the best film depiction of life in a Manhattan advertising agency: pressure on performance; client and agency requirements; parties; creativity; money; cool surface with powerful corporate streams. Dustin Hoffman plunges into parenthood. <br /> <br /> The film is textured and deep. He follows his inner relationship when he tries to understand and live with what is happening; His relationship with Meryl Streep (and her boyfriend who becomes his friend) and his relationship with his son. While Meryl Streep was great, did he record at least on the screen to win an Oscar? Sure he can deliver when he is on, though.
