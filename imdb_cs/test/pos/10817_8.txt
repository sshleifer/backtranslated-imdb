I found this DVD in the library and based on the blazer notes it looked like it might be interesting: a 1940 black comedy, as well as the Germans marching inside. uličky ?? ") Oh, yes, this is a clever, original, exciting and entertaining movie. I don't remember seeing anything like that remarkable is that a writer / director can find humor when we know part of the result (the Germans will be occupying France for four years) The fact that he does it with such charm is part of the delight.What begins as black comedy and fluff even ends with a few serious moments - including a ghost race out of buffer "heavy water" (which was part of a preliminary research for the A-bomb) and a fast history 101 intro to the beginnings of collaborative Vichy government that would drive southern France for much of the German occupation. * But don't be scared of it: the film itself is humorous, charming and romantic and races ahead on a stable clip. <br /> One of the best things about this is the combination of actors we've seen many times (Adjani and Depardieu) and others we've never heard of before. Two stars appear on the way: Virginia Leydoyen and Grégori Derangère, both impressive, but Mr. Derangère is especially so. According to IMDb, he was in ten movies before this? but he also won Cesar as "the most promising actor" for this role, so apparently he was not all well known even in France. Is it a combination of romantic lead and comic actor? and makes it all so easy. Can you be notified of Cary Grant in "Bringing Up Baby" and "Arsenic and Old Lace"? It's hard to make a comedy on a movie because the risks are enormous, so an actor may look incompetent. But Grant pulled it out charmingly, and the guy, too. I should think that we will hear more about him in the future. <br /> <br /> Will this movie definitely not please everyone? There's a little violence, though nothing you see every day on TV. But if you're on something original, you can feel after seeing you have discovered a movie gem. <br /> <br /> * The so-called "spoiler" in this commentary.
