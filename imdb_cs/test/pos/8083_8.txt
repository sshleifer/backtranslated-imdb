"The Vicious Circle" is a very unknown story of British secret. Like many Hitchcock movies, it's about a person who is accused of a crime he has not committed and is doing everything in his power to prove it. This time it's Dr. Latimer (John Mills), who finds the murdered German actress from his floor. As a sincere person, the doctor calls Scotland Yard, who turns out to be a big mistake ... <br /> <br /> There's nothing special about this little movie. Watching a movie, however, is a fun way to pass the time. I enjoyed the development of the land. Gentle actors are a plus.
