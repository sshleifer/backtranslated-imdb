David Tennant and Sarah Parish's brilliant performances met me in tears because many of the scenes were so close to me. My husband suffered from sub-arachnoid bleeding in 1977 and required a major surgery that included lifting his brain and engaging in escape. Like Tricia, I was so naive that I could return to being his former self. After more than 25 years of love and care, he left me without warning to go to live with a woman he barely knew. He then asked and I am now going through a divorce. I hope the program has helped people understand what it's like to cope with brain injury.
