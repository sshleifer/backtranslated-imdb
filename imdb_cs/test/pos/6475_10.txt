A real life story of perhaps the biggest football coach ever known. Knute Rockne led the Stone Age football with innovations such as forward pass and assault formation shifts. But he is probably best known for his motivational boxing speeches. Along the way, he brought glory and glory to a small, little-known Catholic school in Indiana. Pat O'Brien is incomparable in his role as Rockne. A great cast that includes Ronald Reagan, who gives great performance first, Notre Dame's true superstar, George Gipp. <br /> <br /> For football enthusiasts, it's the biggest football movie ever made. Do yourself a favor and rent a black and white version. (Some versions have deleted scenes for some reason) If you have a good version, look for a brief portrait of immortal Jim Thorpe as he holds his head in the locker room and tells Rockne and the team that they only have minutes before the other half begins.
