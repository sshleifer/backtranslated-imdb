I bought this movie just to see it because I really loved it, but when I saw it, I don't like it much. I mean, his performances were good and I think everything, but whenever I showed a totally unnecessary skate scene, I thought, "Okay, we know you're a professional skateboarder, now can we get back to Ryan Dunn?" Dunn, Rake and Brandon really made the movie in my view. I noticed that Jenn Rivell (apparently) and Missy Rothstein were both in Haggard, but who at that time was going to Bam? Anyway, I really enjoyed Haggard and I think it's really like no other movie I've ever seen. It's in its own category.
