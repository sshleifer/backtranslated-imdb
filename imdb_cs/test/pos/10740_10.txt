Although credit was to be given by Dr. Seuess for stealing story-line "Horton Hatches Egg", this was a fine film. She touched both emotion and intellect. Especially due to the incredible performance of Justin Henry's seven-year-old and the scenario that was likeable to each character (and each of them is intolerant), the thought provoking elements stay long after the tears are over. Overall, excellent acting from solid cast, excellent direction and a very strong scenario. Correct touches of humor help to keep a "heavy" object in a tedious or difficult session. Finally, this film is a test of time and seems to be in no way dated, decades after its release.
