I saw it for the first time in 10 or 15 years ... maybe close to 20. In some ways it was better than I remembered ... in others, it was much worse. First of all there is music. It's just awful. There are only 5 songs in the movie, most of them used more than once. The opening song is shouted by a chorus of annoying children, and the disco-title track is performed by Rick Dees. It's not worse than this. Even background music is horrible, most of which repeat the themes of other nausea melodies. We also get some really lame slapstick, mostly in opening credits. On the other hand, Bill Murray is in a brilliant place as usual ... you have to wonder if he hated the whole thing. or if the writers just gave him all the funny lines. Or maybe he's just so great - he turns a weak script into a comic genius. The best part is his surrealistic PA announcement. ("Lobsters ... get out of here ... you're a threat!") <br /> <br /> You also have a lot more character development than you have the right to expect in a movie like this. At least half of the characters seem like real people ... and most of the real people you want to have. Even "Spaz" gets more than any other type of Eddie Deezen he has ever done, and when he gets a girl, it's credible. (She is not absurdly hot, but she does not automatically pair with one of the nerd girls - see "Revenge of the Nerds" for examples of film phenomena.) <br /> <br /> And if the plot seems to be a clich√© ... well , you have to wonder if it wasn't a cliche when they did it. Although it wasn't the first summer camp, you have to go back to at least "The Parent Trap" - it's definitely a movie that made it its own genre. In fact, I was surprised that there was no Talent Show scene ... "Wet Hot American Summer" so falsely falsified the summer camp genre, I just thought everything in it was coming out of Meatballs. (I also expected halfway to see Jon Cryer pull out a cabriolet with a chimpanzee, thanks to the "Show Show Epic Campaign" Monk Academy "<br /> <br /> Anyway, this seems to be a little until the late 1970s and early The 80s - it's no longer a cable clamp and certainly has no iconic follow-up to Caddyshack or Animal House.I was glad I could capture it on Showtime today and in high definition! In the 70s / 80s teen comedy And again, Murray is a genius.
