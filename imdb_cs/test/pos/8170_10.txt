Maybe I'm sentimental. But I found out that this movie is really moving. It was the first film that reduced me to tears. And he did it more than once !! I recommend it to everyone, gay i str8. Religious or not! The supportive co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liner. The nude scenes were also superbly created and all were in good taste. The most shocking was the depiction of the orientation reverse deprogramming introduced by the Mormon Church to the leading figure. It shocked me that it still continues in the world. However, I enjoyed this film immensely. This is definitely the best gay movie from the Torch Trilogy Song. And much better than the other gay movie he offered that year - The Fluffer.
