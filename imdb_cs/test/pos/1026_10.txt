Just as a reminder to anyone who is now reading comments on this excellent BBC mini-series released in 1981, it has not been available on DVD for the last few years. Since then it is available, but initially only in the British format (for which I bought an 'international' DVD player that you have to hack - illegally, I suspect I'll see it), but the series is now available through amazon.com - 3 disks - between $ 19-21, to be seen on DVD in US format, no hacking. Number of reviews: 41, average 5 stars. This mini-series is one of the best on Oppenheimer, or the Manhattan Project, or virtually anything that the BBC produces.
