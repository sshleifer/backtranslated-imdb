Far much steeper and less stage and set bound than previous efforts by Gene Sakse Barefoot in the Park (67) and The Odd Couple (68), Cactus Flower is not a work of art, but compared to most tired farces of the 60s as an Apartment, How to Murder Your Woman, Goodbye Charlie, Guide for Married Man, Divorce, American Style, Any Wednesday, Kiss Me Stupid, Boys Night Out, It's a Masterpiece. Director Saks and writer I.A.L. Diamond has effectively "opened" Abe Burrows Broadway, and the film benefits from filming in New York City and excellent performances by Ingrid Bergman and Goldie Hawn. Bergman is charming, looks great and proves comedy. Hawn has never been better or more attractive in his Oscar role. Matthau's fine, though it's hard to believe his character would love him. And retrospectively, Hawn's attempt at suicide at the beginning of the film is in nature and incredible. However, the film has a plausible farcical set, and once it goes go it creates a laugh. Rick Lenz, Jack Weston, Eva Bruce and Vito Scotti provide good support. The movie is nice and fun, and Hawn and Bergman care about you.
