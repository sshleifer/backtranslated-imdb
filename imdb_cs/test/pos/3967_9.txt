Diora Baird is absolutely hot in this movie. But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch. <br /> <br /> (MINOR SPOILERS) As usual, the main character, B, is a healthy one of the bunch. B has this crazy idea of ​​creating his own college when he is rejected from all the universities he covers. It is known for making false IDs. so accepting a letter is not a problem. Given that B's father is hard @ $$ and the suspect at this university has never heard of, B gets his friend Sherman to design a website for the university. Sherman was admitted to great school and is afraid of being arrested for fraud. He's very fast with witty lines, but his mistake is to be too socially accepted. Glen, Hands, and Rory are three chairs that follow B. Glen got zero on his SATs and has no thought process. He continually designs royal battleships, but is very good at making cocktails that bring him a lot of hot girls in some way. His hands were a big footballer who didn't get the scholarship he relied on and turned to crafts to cover his lack of athletics. Rory was about to go to Yale since the first year and was not accepted. She spent her time meditating. Uncle Ben was my favorite character. Lewis Black plays alone. If you have no reason to see this movie, then check out Lewis Black and Jonah Hill. They are awesome. Monica is a love affair B. As most of these stories go, he is more popular than him and he won't even notice him until the middle of the movie. But unlike many other stories, B actually gets it and keeps it to the end. In fact, Monica is a good character in her own right, but of course she is especially fond of being there for B. There are more supportive students at the made-up school who are fun to watch. Name A.D.D. She is self-explanatory and funny enough to end up in a meditation class. Kiki is a hot ex-stripper who falls to her heels and gets a chance to go to school. Maurice is a former military idiot who got his G.I. Bill and wants to study rock n 'roll at college. The ultimate guy is known only as a Freaky Student who thinks he can throw things out with his mind. Those who have little faith in it, wait until the end of the movie. Of course, the villains are the dean of the enemy university, the president of his university student body, the president's girlfriend and their friends. . <br /> <br /> Every character is nice. I believe this film has a good storyline and is well done, despite what many people say. Even if the overall story is predictable, the characters argue and the movie is great. Check out this movie. I'll give it 9 out of 10.
