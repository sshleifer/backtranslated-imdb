This is a really dark movie. Noir really. The title character is smallpox, brought to New York by Evelyn Keyes unknowingly. He's on one mission when he's coming and harsher after he tells her an innocent sister. But she herself is not intentionally a murderer. That doesn't mean he won't. It does not mean that her presence somewhere between eight million other people has not thrown the city into turmoil. <br /> <br /> Keyes is excellent. The support cast is also very good. A few well-known people are involved - including the director. Don't be discouraged. It's a movie that counts! (And how nice is the image of Columbia. Columbia and the Republic have shown wonderful comedies and noirs, but we hardly see them.)
