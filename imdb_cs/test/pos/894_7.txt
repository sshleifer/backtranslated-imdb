You know you're looking at softcore with a bad attitude when you get bad dubbing. I'm fine with poor lip sync, but the sound mix is ​​really too. Every time someone says something that sounds like, it's like a storyteller. Either way, it is largely a purgatory between the boring French professionalism and the heavenly camp Joe D'Amato, which includes cannibalism and what not. Don't get me wrong, there's a fair dose of exploitation in this, but there's always room for more. Laura Gemser plays, and that's good because he's hot. It's a little strange, as sometimes you see her bone structure, but she still rules over her white counterpart. You can also make cool drinking games about how often her kit. Often. Every reason is good. Every person is good. Every place is good. One scene even includes the entire hockey team they do in Africa. Sometimes the conspiracy gets in the way and the support cast consists of some really horrible looking people, but there's enough Laura Gemser for everyone.
