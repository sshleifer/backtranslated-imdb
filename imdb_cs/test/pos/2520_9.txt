A direct X file that shows that the action is always the same as the intelligence. Rob Bowman's direction is sharp and sharp, the episode looks just as fresh as nearly ten years ago. David and Gillian are making fine performances, and both seem pleased with the lack of luggage - it's a separate X set that enemies can take part in and enjoy. Junior Brown gives the two leaders his money during their scene with them, so convincing that you could believe the crew went to the middle of nowhere and knocked on the first door they came to. Bryan Cranston, as intense and energetic as Patrick Crump, has since admitted in interviews that before anything about the X-Files he knew about this role, which is his incredible performance. Brilliantly stupid episode.
