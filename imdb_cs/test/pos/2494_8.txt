I bought a Chinese box of Fist of North Star for a while that came with all the Fist of North Star, the fist of North Star 2, the New Fist of North Star, and the fist of the North Star movie. While there is an American version and several European versions, they end up in the middle of the way with the fist of the North Star which is about as far as the film goes. The series is about the successor of the ancient martial art art called Hokuto Shin Ken (the fist of the north star) named Kenshiro, or Ken in short. Each generation has only one successor. It takes place in a post apocalyptic future where martial arts is the most powerful weapon. The two most powerful arts are Hokuto Shin Ken and Nanto Divine Ken, as my version says. Nanto is really more styles, but they are all the same because they allow a person to cut someone into pieces. There are six Nanto masters and each has its own star. Hokuto is an art that allows someone to damage / kill or heal someone by hitting a point on their body. Every art has its own constellation. Hokuto - Big Car, Nanto - Gemini. Kenshiro goes to save the world from evil, which is to go after two brothers and three masters Nanto and their armies. Each army captain has his own way of fighting that makes each episode different and the number of bloody soldiers. Also Kenshiro is looking for his girlfriend Yuri, who was stolen by master Nanto Shin. Along the way Kenshiro is joined by his brother Toki after saving him from his brother Rao who calls himself Kenou or Boxing King. He is also joined by two Nanto masters Rei, who is looking for his sister who was taken by Ken's brother Jagi, and Shu. Both and Toki die along the way. Other characters joining Ken are two kids Rin and Batto who don't do much. That's as much as I can say for the story, because it's so long and full of detail. The series is also divided into four parts. <br /> <br /> What makes this show great is fighting. Usually Ken goes against a group of people who think they're being claimed and then killed in one hit. Which is funny and proper, but it does a quick fight. Another big part is comedy / wickedness. Ken hits someone and they don't think anything. Ken says they're dead. Then they die. The other parts are when they hit them and tell them they have a few seconds to live. Then a jump will appear. Or when he tells them they are not aware of their name. Then there is when he makes a quick fire kick or punch and goes wa da da da da da etc. Finally you could find yourself doing with him. One big part was when a bad person thought he knew Hokuto. He went to Ken and hit him. Ken stood there and said he was dead in a few seconds. The bad guy read and then died. Not limited to Ken, everyone else kills as fast. There has never been a character as amazing because Ken and they probably never will. However, there are some problems. One of them is repeated nature. Some flashbacks mainly the one with Yuria are taken to be replayed too, and there are also too many recap episodes especially in part four series. The last episode is a recap of the whole thing. Another problem is the end. The last battle with Rao wasn't so impressive. Ken and Rao fought then spoke, etc., Until Rao came to some knowledge and killed instead of Ken who killed him. However, it is better than the American and European versions, which only halted. <br /> <br /> Who would I recommend? This is for older teens and adults who like action. Since styles cause people to explode or get into pieces, violence is very graphic and there is a lot, but they don't show much blood, because they usually just do a silhouette that still looks like a person, less colorful. This was probably done to prevent censorship. If you don't like the action to rent an American version. But if you like the action, then I say go to import because you can see all the series but they don't have the best English translation because it is the Chinese subtitle. Note: My import came with everything I said at the beginning, some imported versions didn't, but you still have to get the import to see all the series and Fist of North Star 2. version. Another note: In the version I received, there were no new Fist of the North Star subtitles on the last disc; Although, the New Fist of the North Star is not very good to start with. I give the 8/10 show for her great deal of action, good story and amazing Kenshiro. br /> <br /> **** UPDATE **** <br /> <br /> Animation Toei has released an English version with subtitles. You can download episodes as well as Hokuto not Ken 2 from Direct2Drive IGN or watch free at FUNimation.
