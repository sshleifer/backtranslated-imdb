When the Accepted trailer first appeared, many people became excited to see it ... really excited. Who could blame them, it looked like fun. But that's exactly the thing. People went to Accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, Accepted is not the type of movie to be a good movie. It's supposed to be a movie that will please his crowd without too much effort. As has been said, for those of you who have been expecting a great movie, you have to think about what might be from this comedy. Think about it and really enjoy the movie (because you get rid of your idea that the movie will be fantastic.)
