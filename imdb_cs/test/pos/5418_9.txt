The man I choked can leave feedback for 10 minutes. I love it. <br /> <br /> After I didn't see it over the years, I looked at it the next day, and looked at it over and over again. 'Stop shaking your eyes' and 'shake the rock and roll band' and 'stop cutting the table' are crazy classic lines. <br /> <br /> Art is beautifully raw. Dialogue sparse and gorgeous. Just find it and love it. I can't recommend enough. Thank you to art school teacher Mrs. Kogan for showing us over and over again. Thank you NFB for letting it do. Thank you MTS for showing it (at least for free at the moment). <br /> <br /> I want a Big Snit T-shirt. I'd like an animation cell, but at 440.00 pop it won't happen. <br /> <br /> Find this movie and watch it.
