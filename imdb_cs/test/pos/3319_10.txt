If it's not my favorite movie of all time, it's definitely in the top five. I love it. Everything on this is perfect - clothes, set, line - yes, they aren't as normal people talk, but ... Directly in small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office girls change shoes, pick wedgie, watering ivy plants, lunch in the fridge ... Just like what girls are doing today in 2005. I think all the tiny characters are amazing. If someone like Joan Crawford is at the top, it's part of the package. If you choose many things in the movie, it is obvious that it was in the early 1960s when women started "not taking it down", at least not if they didn't. For example, as opposed to the character of Suzy Parker, who acts like her for all the flutes, but then joins Louis Jourdan too much, isn't that what a lot of people oppose? They blend in real-life with scenes like Diane Baker's character, who was in the hospital after the love of her illegitimate child - lying in a hospital with a big old bandage around her head. This is also part of the package, it's a spell - a shiny escape. I like the mix of real stories that are relevant today (a stereotypical career woman who only has married men and hence doesn't have a family when he's older) with those who wish, "ah, if I could just fall down I love with a doctor and he'll love me even if he knows my dirty past. I also got a DVD, widescreen, it's even more beautiful than the whole screen ... Yay!
