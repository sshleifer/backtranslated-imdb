Hey Denver Fans! Animation is a classic cartoon and one of my favorite (and yes, it was also aired in Europe. Including my little Central Europe, Slovenia! = :) Oh, how I miss the 80's cartoons !! Frankly, they were better than today's kids. More inventive, creative, full of fun with good manners, more essence, great story and excellent character voices. Computer animated shows today lack all these qualities. So all of you who agree and want to bring back all the shows so that the children of today's generation can see the entertainment that these cartoons have brought us, please sign up on the sidebar and sign the petition for the 80's repeat. the best cartoons! <br /> <br /> http://www.thepetitionsite.com / 1 / we-want-an-80s-child-cartoon-kids-show-channel Carpe Denver! =) <br /> <br /> Lejla
