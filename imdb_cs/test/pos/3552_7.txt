A remake of the 1916 silent film, based on the 1909 novel by Maurice Leblanc. The detective series will be produced over the years in many games, films and TV series in the UK, the USA and France. This 1932 version played the breaking brothers Barrymore John (as Duke) and Lionel (as Detective Guerchard). They would also play together at the Grand Hotel, Dinner at Eight and a few more in the coming years. Sonia (Karen Morley) appears in Duke's bed during a party in this film before Hayes Code; The first lights go out in the bedroom, then head out to the main hall, then there is a search for a cheater and a missing jewelry, as well as other missing valuables ... long because they still use headlines cards several times. Also watch a new kind of safe that doesn't need a combination. Well thought out graph, no big holes, but no big surprises. It's not bad for a morning movie. Clever end.
