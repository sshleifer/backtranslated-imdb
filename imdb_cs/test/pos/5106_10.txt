I enjoyed the film and the story immensely! I saw the original (1939 I believe) and I both enjoyed it. To truly appreciate this story, they must be familiar with English culture and customs. Professor (Peter O'Toole) was dedicated to his school and "boys" at this school. It was an English "public" school that we in the US call a private school (E.G. Andover). He is a very ascetic man and on the surface gives the impression that he is stiff, stuffy, clumsy and weak until he is effeminate. He is strict in his educational standards because he cares for "his boys", that is, he does not want them to receive cheap or weak education. He meets (through the introduction) "Ballroom Girl" (Petula Clark) and is totally smitten. In England at the time, a reference to "ballroom" bore the connotation of extreme sexual promiscuity and was definitely a "lower class". We found that prof. He is in fact a very hard and courageous man, as well as faithful to people and institutions he loves and / or respects. Clark becomes more than a lover and a woman ... "pursues" his personality and allows him to grow as a man and a person, in favor of his beloved school and his own happiness. The first film was set BEFORE World War II, this time WW II, it is also 1969 (we had a "British invasion" ... Beetles, etc. Clark had hits and was very popular then ... still for me), music is great, color and photo excellent. I think O'Toole played perfectly! They are dedicated people like "Chips" ... all around us, but many don't get credit. Very nice movie and story!
