My local PBS station WHYY Philadelphia recently showed "The Elegant Universe". After three hours of tracking, besides hurting my brain, I learned everything about wormholes, quantum mechanics, and parallel realities and alternative universes. a semi-new branch of physics that makes many science fiction ideas not only possible, but PROBABLE. With "The String Theory" it sounds like wormholes, alternative reality and alternative timelines are possible, and it could only be a matter of time before we get the knowledge they use. new information for someone who is familiar with the topic, I found the show very interesting and informative. It was very understandable for anyone who was just introduced to this topic.
