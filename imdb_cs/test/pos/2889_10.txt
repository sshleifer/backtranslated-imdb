These guys are excellent and everything they publish to the public is first class. The music of this band is amazing and we should all be grateful that we live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and personally. Get this DVD and enjoy it! I was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in Houston, TX and was blown away. I didn't miss the show because of the power of the window and I have to say they're better than ever. Everyone should accept these people and teach others what a true musician is! There will never be such a tight and well-assembled trio in our lives. Let's just hope and pray that they won't retire in the near future!
