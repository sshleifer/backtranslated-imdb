A highly traceable film that was eagerly awaited to see a trailer several times. The whole thing looks great, from the ridiculous endeavors of a spectacular high class to distance themselves from mediocrity, to the bottom of the lower class trying to keep its head above dirt, the film captures the spirit of the 18th century brilliantly. Jonny Lee Miller plays Maclean very well, although his part doesn't exactly stretch it, and Robert Carlyle seems a little pointless on Plunket, Miller's fellow colleague. The real star of the performance was undoubtedly Ken Stott, who plays Mr. Å ance (1740 Police Commander) with the evil Joy that brought him out of the rest of the cast. A great movie and everyone who enjoys the colors and style of Peter Greenaway's movies will love the look of this movie, even though the thinness of the drawing becomes obvious 2 hours ago. <br /> <br /> Well worth a visit.
