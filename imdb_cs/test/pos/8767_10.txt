The subject is banal, even in 1942. It is a war propaganda. The fascists are among us and do their best to sabotage the war effort and prepare their victory and their takeover of power and their creation of an effective totalitarian state. But Hitchcock makes him a real thriller. So he inventes the first sabotage that succeeds, but one of the victims, a friend of him who dies in it, becomes the main suspect and escape for sabotage. This allows him a so-called visit to the country and to discover the complicated organization of the local Nazis, who are well known and supported in a top-notch benevolent society and use small little dissatisfied white to do dirty work. Chasing a real saboteur takes our young false suspect from Los Angeles to New York and the top of the organization. He meets a blind pianist who believes his senses know that the guy is not guilty, his niece, who is the star of an advertising billboard, but also the frenetic and fanatical patriot who thinks he is going to the police. Then a rich rancher and his plotter's nest. Then, on the road some likable and friendly truck driver, and a long circus caravan around and their dwarf, bearded woman, siamese sisters and several other slapstickers of this type. And he discovers a target in Soda City, an electric dam that provides Los Angeles and his war industry with the energy they need. She participates as a gravel in the sabotage organization of the USS Alaska military ship when it is running. Finally, with some ingenuity, creativity, and elbow lubrication, the niece pianist manages to clear the entire lot, most of them arrested, and the first saboteur, certain Fry, falls from the Torch of the Liberty Torch. He won't take care of the old electric spark. But Hitchcock is not in the habit of having a personal look in his own movies, so don't look for him. It's well built and well done, but it's just a propaganda film with a premium style.
