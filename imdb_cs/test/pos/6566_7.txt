I recently saw several Far East movies ... some were excellent (Battle Royale, Infernal Affairs, The Eye) and some weren't that big (Versus, Triple Cross). Then there are those like Uzumaki and Returner which, while defective I still enjoyed. The basic assumption includes the mysterious and frightening effects that the growing obsession of the spiral has on the community. Sounds stupid? Yeah, that's what I thought. First, good things. The direction was top, certainly a little over the top in places, but never less interesting and stylish. Secondly, the story was original and like other writers commented on the very love-esq ... it was interesting. What reminded me of most, however, was soon Cronenberg; movies like Shivers and Videodrome. Negotiations were not great, but not too bad. To be honest, I was bored on several occasions. I felt that stimulation was initially a little slow. My main problem was that it was too stupid and funny to be a real horror, yet not enough to be considered a comedy. * SPOILERS * below. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * Some good scenes (washing machine =) and I liked the last photo / voice. At first I thought it was all too sudden, but about 20 seconds later I realized the meaning and liked the end. Because of the lack of seriousness in the story, combined with high-end scenes such as school news, I didn't really care about the characters. The last scene that might be a little annoying, in fact, I couldn't really care for a girl or her boyfriend. * SPOILERS END * <br /> <br /> Overall, I did a movie like this, but it frustrated me and I think there was real potential in addition to some good scenes. Some more points, the main girl is pretty pretty and cute, and the song that plays at the end is good too. I rated it 7/10. <br /> <br />
