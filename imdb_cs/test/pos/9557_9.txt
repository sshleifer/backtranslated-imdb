"Best in Show" is definitely Christopher Guest's funniest and deepest movie. The characters are superbly rendered, and the pet's connection with the owner adds a new level of comedy to the movie. I was a guest fan from Spinal Tap, but in this movie he really achieved what he decided to do in "mock-umentary", a genre he invented and now perfected.
