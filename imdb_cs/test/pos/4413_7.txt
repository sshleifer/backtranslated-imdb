Snap, pop, pop! The glowing sound of every camera angle change. And it's not about the white flashes and cropped ends of almost every spoken sentence. What was it on the ground to get into the newsroom? Or could it be that this approach was intentional? Certainly not. What purpose could it serve? Despite all the technical flaws, this is an interesting film depicting a day in the life of Joe, a cheater who decided to earn $ 200 for his wife's pregnant girlfriend. Joe Dallesandro is exceptional as a carefree, passive, carefree young man who is willing to let the other person do most of the conversations while listening to a distant look in his eyes. the story is thin and shallow, documenting an uncertain life led by a man who relies on occasional street sex to support his young wife and child. One thing is for sure, Joe has no restraint in getting upset for sex or posing for an artist. Of course, because she has a pretty face and a pretty body. There is a scene in the film that is remarkably effective. There is no sound, no dialogue. Joe is naked naked, crouching on the floor and feeding small crumbs. In these quiet moments, peace and gentleness are beautiful. Another scene of fun is the one in which Joe desperately tries to get a $ 100 loan from a friend from the gym. very consistent approach. Joe tries to attract himself, but hesitates in his conversation when the artist gives him a continuous biography of Greek and Roman art. It is a preliminary opportunity for another occasion when Joe gets rid of his clothes and presents himself as a thrower in a classic style. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, we get the impression that we've met Joe pretty well. After all, he had uncovered more than his soul.
