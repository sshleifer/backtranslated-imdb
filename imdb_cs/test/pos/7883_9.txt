It is a classic film that dramatizes a person who cannot adapt to changes in society and feels more and more alienated, leading to violence. Joe is a worker, and he is dissatisfied and angry, and all he needs is an excuse to run, what the story is about. Joe is calm; with someone else becomes mortal. And what makes Joe even cooler is that he rationalizes his violence so that it is not only bad but necessary. For Joe, he designs his own violent tendencies for those he sees as "the enemy," and therefore he considers himself war and in this film the "generation gap" is portrayed as war. But it's just a Joe's mind war, because the "enemy" in this case is in his mind. No one wants to fight Jo, but Joe feels he has to defend himself. Although this film was released in 1970, the message is as important as it was when society continues to make major changes that lead to a kind of intense alienation that dramatically dramatizes the film.
