I'm mingling for the sequel. I needed something to prevent the spread of tension, anxiety (what if it's not so good?!) And the constant lack of information. I needed something to calm me a little, something that could be spent in time, other than the Matrix. That was just the thing. <br /> <br /> I found it informative (as part of Keanu's neck ...) and some of them were funny. When I said there was only one bathroom and all those guys, I was worried about Carrie-Anne. I found only one problem with it. Since 95% of the people were in fact a man, they simply let their mouth run and there was a tongue in it. It's not as bad as the shocking run of The Shawshank Redemption, but the fact that one scene was Keanu, describes a bad day, hack your ears if you're small. > <br /> <br /> It was fun and was what I needed. That's what all Matrix fans who go nuts have to keep them calm. They mentioned a tiny bit about the sequels, and somebody almost put something aside, but in time it caught (shoot!). It gives you almost no spoilers, but it's great to have if you are a Matrix Head like me. <br /> <br /> There's no spoon.
