When you read about this movie, you want to cringe. I've seen countless times, yet I crouched! So what's the attraction? I think it's romantic for me. I consider it super refreshing to have a special link between this NYC Jimmy-Breslin and the columnist and the lucky ballerina. You feel embarrassed for Paul Sorvin when he boasts of this woman. Just like the guy in the bar who can't cope. It's a little overweight (at least as a suitor for a ballet dancer. I hope it doesn't sound harsh) and maybe too old for her. Nice change of tempo from a Greek god who wanted a super-model. Bill Conti's score got stuck after the years in my head, which is a pretty good sign. However, some of the acting are just terrible. Subplot, who includes a young Puerto Rico boy who is related to Sorvin's character, is just plainly bad. But the opening scene, where Ditchburn warms up to Carole King, pulls you straight into this story. Good luck to find him. Do you think Lifetime would have thrown this or even WE, but I didn't see it in a few years.
