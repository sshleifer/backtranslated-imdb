The actor turned director Liev Schreiber (Sum of All Fears) makes an above average screen version of the novel, Everything Is Illuminated, by Jonathan Safran Foer. This story of journey and self-discovery is accentuated by strong ensemble performances and a sharp direction with a story that enriches and enlightens the soul. Safran, help. Jonathan has a special habit of taking small items and tiny memorabilia of life and sealing them in plastic ziplock bags to expose them to the wall. Safran gives Jonathan an old picture showing young Safran standing next to a beautiful girl who saved his life many years ago. So Jonathan starts on a long journey to find this mysterious woman in Ukraine without knowing if he is still alive. He is helped by the cheeky young guide Alex (Eugene Hutz) and his grandfather (Boris Leskin) to take him to the finish. Initially, the road hits dead ends and false leadership, but as the group approaches the target, the men find themselves in the midst of the ruins of a dark chapter in history with memories of war and past spirits of a non-existent city. There they will find their own destiny and will be changed forever by what they learn. This film feels like someone who knows how to get the most out of his actors. The film is sometimes spoken in Russian and looks like a foreign film. The title itself is a game of self-discovery. This is a thoughtful trek of one man into his past, and his past ironically involves his companions; Jonathan's obsessive journey becomes an emotional way for Alex and his grandfather. It is a story of long-distance bonding and guilt that must be borne for life. By the end of the movie, these characters have all the experienced life changing events that will permanently interweave their lives. This proves that memories can be strong in traumatization and purification of the soul. It's also about someone's legacy and how others have seen an event or person in the past. Alex finally sees his grandfather in a completely different light. Even our perception of these people has changed at the end of the film, a tribute to a story that is well told. The story is deceptively simple. It works as a road trip movie (like The Straight Story) combined with an interesting mysterious story. It really includes many layers of emotions and subplots that range from past to present. The end is a bit unreal with his déjà vu feeling. Elijah Wood (Sin City, Eternal Sunshine of the Immaculate Mind) has since your initial encounter with the Lord a trilogy of rings. Here he does a great job with what is essentially a minimalist role that is not much to show. Eugene Hutz and Boris Leskin are better than Alex and his grandfather. Even my grandfather's dog, Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. (that's okay) he's fun as a wildly loyal companion. Paul Cantelon's replacement music score is a whimsical compliment to the thoughtful nature of the film. Editing is effective because past and present images are interconnected and effortless. The film production of Matthew Libatique (Gothika, Requiem for Dream) is appropriately sharp and lifeless with impressive images of war and its consequences. The coincidences that appear in the last half of the film are good drama, but they are too random. We have never understood the whole story of Alex's grandfather and his motivations. Likewise, Jonathan's empty looks and lack of obvious essence and depth do not give us more than a sketch of an unpredictable man. Sometimes the film feels a little depressing and depressing because more horrific revelations are revealed. But it is a minor critique of what is a good, introspective story with good performances and interesting themes of memories and closure. That Schreiber not only directed but adapted the script to this valuable piece of history is a tribute to his talents and hopeful potential in the future.
