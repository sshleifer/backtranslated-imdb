Coleman is eager to cut a few songs with the smokin 'R&B group outfit (none other than Earth, wind and fire in their amazingly funky prime number), but his firmly commercial greedhead label A-Chord Records running awake, crowd-connected mid-of - Road-Square Jerry (properly unhip by Ed Nelson) wants him to record hit single for horribly insipid Carpenters-like pop pap trio Site, reportedly squeaky clean bunch that includes smarmy pedofil step-dad franklin (absolutely ugly) Bert Parks) bitter , neurotic daughter Velor (soft, powerful bend, energetic brunette Cynthia Bostwick) and hedonistic smacky addicted son Gary (former 50-year-old teen sitcom Jimmy Boyd). Extremely naive and idealistic, Coleman must learn how to pronto how a music business actually works, and play a dirty lowdown game as best he can, or else lose both the Group and its credibility. Accepting acrid, a pervasive, corrosive and unobtrusively distorted scenario from syndicated commentator and rock journalist Robert Lipsyte, director Sig Shore (best known for producing "Superfly"), shows a definitely cynical and unflattering display of various bribes payoffs, broken promises, -stabbings, duplicity, and double-dealings, which are an unpleasant but essential part of a predominantly corrupt rock music industry, with particularly thoughtful art-related themes. trade, struggling to maintain its artistic integrity and the then effort to homogenize rock into a bland, unnecessary, creatively stagnant mainstream respect.

Appearing in handy bits are disc jockey and legendary "Fifth Beatle" Murray K as leering, lecherous DJ Big John Little (Velor bites hand after Big John's thigh paws during a live on-air interview!), New York soul DJ and NBC's host is " Friday Video Night "Frankie Crocker as his own jazzy'n'jivin 'self, R&B singer-songwriter Doris Troy (she wrote a beautiful" Just One Look ") as a church pianist, and tubby, a bald-70's is \ t MacGregor as a priest at a wedding. Allan Metzger's relatively poor sound and sloppy cinematography unintentionally contribute to the overall disheveled, roughly-played, authentic-style documentary. Although technically a little lacking, this film is still generally regarded as one of the largest, most bitterly pessimistic, indecent rocksploit gems of the 1970s.
