Hayao Miyazaki continues with this absolute crowd pleasing Pony to Cliff by the Sea, his latest animated film, which turns to the usual sweets to enchant your socks. I thought the trailer was his song, which was quietly hypnotic, and I didn't have to wait for an invitation to make sure I got a slip of a movie preview to open next week. <br /> <br /> For fans of Studio Ghibli, you'll probably know what you're up to because Miyazaki has another winner in his filmography to win new fans. I am embarrassed to say at least that I have so far only watched my neighbor Totoro (eyes that a pile of Ghibli DVDs) and love it in pieces, but I think it would serve as the ultimate pressure to avoid having to go missing what is likely to be these were animated films that I would like to enjoy. Ponyo (voiced by Nara Yuriou) is a magical goldfish who longs to know what life is beyond the sea, with incessant forays into the bubble on the surface of the water creeping. These ambitions, however, do not lead to her humanoid father Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), who has some hatred of human race for pollution and also briefly touches on the subplot on environmental protection / revenge of Mother Nature. One day accident sees Ponya being washed ashore, and raised by a five-year-old boy Sosuke (Doi Hiroki) who lives on a house on said cliff with his mother Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko), while Dad Koichi (Nagashima Kazushige) is mostly from the sea because he is a sailor . And you can expect a few moments to return to those who like the Little Mermaid or Splash for Kids. To say something more would be to spoil the fun. The artwork here is still simply overwhelming, even though it's in 2D glory, knowing that every cell is carefully crafted. So many things happen in the same frame at the same time that you'll probably play a repeat tour so you can see them all. This surpasses any animated 3D or CG production every day due to its beauty that is based on its simplicity, not only from the art department but also from its story, despite the complaints taken from the classic Hans Christian Andersen. While there are ways to make this movie extremely dark, it has only designed some dark motifs, but has chosen instead for a movie with more positive emotions, suitable for both children and adults. At its core, his about love, it's among the members of the Koichi family, Lisa and Sosuke, and especially between mother and son. It's more about the love between the boy and his new fish, which Ponyo baptized, and I'm telling you that Ponyo herself has enough cuteness to beat everyone like Bolt, WallE and Eve. Characterization is most prominent here and it is hard to fall in love with Ponyo, whatever its form, especially when it is such a playful creature that does not hide its emotions - if it is upset to you, either turn away or you can expect a stream of water penetrates the face! Ponyo on the sea cliff is undoubtedly a clear step into my best films of the year. The next time I go to Tokyo, I'm sure I'm gonna go to the Ghibli Museum to bask under the magical world that Hayao Miyazaki brought us. Highly recommended movie, so don't miss out on the big screen!
