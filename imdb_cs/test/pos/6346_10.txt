I saw Lonesome Dove, Walk Dead Man and Laredo Streets, and now The Return to Lonesome Dove. If you are hungry for more after watching Lonesome Dove, it will fill your belly. Great cast, great story. Definitely the closest to Lonesome Dove. I'll add this movie to my collection. This is the best or at least my favorite performance by Jon Voight. He's a captain. Lou Gossett Jr. playing Isom Pickett is not someone I go with him, it's a bad ass with perspective. William Peterson also does a great job. Rick Schroder is back as Newt with a full performance that reminds me of his NYPD Blue stint. My only problem with this movie (and it's really nests collecting) is that I thought Call wanted to be the "first man to graze in cattle in Montana," and it's clear that Dunnigan was already there. A little inconsistent but easy to overlook when you get lost in a fantastic story. Especially I love the apparent growth of the characters Jasper Fant and July Johnson. I've been watching this movie several times and I'm ready for the next sequel.
