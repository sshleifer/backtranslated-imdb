* THIS COMMENT TO THE PROBLEM HAVE SPOILERS !! SPOILERS BOX INSPECTION WHEN IT DOES NOT SPOIL, ALWAYS ALWAYS SEEK THAT I NEED TO MAKE SPOILER AND YOU CAN! * Wow ... the best game from Super Mario 64. I got this game the first day it came out, and before I got it, I went on some game websites to look at its reviews (yes, they have already reviewed it before it came out) , and I was shocked. I was expecting something like Sunshine because all of Mario's games have been getting worse and worse lately. But this totally beat other games. The score in this game even beat Halo 3! It's just amazing. STORY: Not the best, Mario games are never known for their parcels, and this is not really a big difference. Bowser abducts Peach again, but this time he attacks the Mushroom Kingdom at a festival that takes place once a century and gets a flying saucer and shoots lasers to the ground, then anchors the ground and tears the castle and its foundations into space GRAPHICS: Absolutely beautiful, the best graphics on the Wii so far. The effects of water are also very nice, if you have ever seen water, it looks so real because of the effects they put into it. MUSIC: Just amazing, the music in this game is controlled. Not all of them, but even those that aren't, still sound very nice. <br /> <br /> GAMEPLAY: Very fun, keeps you in the game more and more for me because I usually tend to be very frustrated with games when I die a lot, I guess I'm definitely not the only one, but this game for me she didn't have much. Now it's still a little bit, but not like Mario 64, where I went completely crazy and ended up shutting down the game because it made me angry, this never did. Difficulty: There are two types of difficulty because you can only technically beat a game with only 60 stars, which in my opinion is a little easy, but to beat the game by 100%, you must get 120, as always, and the task is much harder but still very fun. <br /> <br /> LENGTH: Good length, definitely not too short. It took me about 15-16 hours to beat him with only 60 stars, but 120 took me more than 45-50 hours. I didn't play that much now, I played a lot on the first day, then the next few days just a few hours a day, then the next two days I played it all day. For me, however, I think the search for 60 stars was a bit short, so if you want a long game, I suggest that I get all of them. <br /> <br /> PRESENTATION: Now, the movie scenes in this movie are excellent. The way they are, they look just like something I see in theaters. They are hands down the best movie scenes on any Mario game so far. TOTAL: This game is definitely a great game, and I recommend that you don't wait until Christmas to get it as soon as possible. This game is also a good mix of old and new, you will have some sidescroller levels where you only move from side to side or up and down because it turns into gravity, but even music has some old classics in it. So this game seems like a masterpiece. For me, this is my favorite Mario game of all time, but others may disagree. But it's still a great game. I recommend to any player who wants to have fun in the game to get it.
