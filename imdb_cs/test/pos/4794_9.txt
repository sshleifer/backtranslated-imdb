Luis Bunuel was always a filmmaker whose work was unclear to me. My first experience with him was the Discreet Magic of Bourgeosia, often regarded as his greatest work, with which I became so frustrated and bored that I eventually turned off the tape. Likewise, I wasn't interested in Belle de Jour, which is almost certainly his most famous film and also widely regarded as one of many of his masterpieces. I hated it as I did Discreet, but I didn't like it. Third, I saw L'Age d'Or. I finally got somewhere. Fourth, Los Olvidados, also good. Neither L'Age d'Or nor Los Olvidados cast me off. Great movies, but not masterpieces. Nazarin is my fifth Bunuel and I only like it a little more than the two. It's about a priest from Spain in Mexico who refuses to live in the luxury most priests live. He wants to be more than Jesus who leads the most beautiful life. He is also willing to forgive everyone and suffer without protest. I'm pretty sure Bunuel disagrees with the character and sees him as a self-righteous one. However, I only assume that thanks to my director's knowledge, whose best-known quotation is "Thank God, I'm still an atheist," which he apparently said in an interview on this film (I get this information from John Baxter if you are interested in a Bunul book). The interviewer who pulled the words from Bunuel's mouth had to be confused about Nazarin himself. One who was more prone to believe in a religious belief that knows nothing about Bunul could see the priest as a heroic figure. This is especially true if the viewer owns criticism of organized religion. A priest may be somewhat fair, but he seems to be basically a good man. When she hides a violent prostitute in her room to protect her (and probably to save her soul), people begin to know that their relationship is sexual. His superiors took the same and punished him for that. He later suffers even worse punishments from clergymen.
