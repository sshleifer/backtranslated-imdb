Blind Spot images are great. The action will pull you in, even if the movie is a bit long. By the end of the credits all you can think about the movie are positive high-points. The main actors have the most amazing presence on the screen. The story is heartbreaking. The movie score is well underestimated. He moves in his own strong way. It's not your standard melodramatic cuing. Trance-like moments add poetic resonance to engraved narration and amazing visual compositions. I hope you have a chance to see this movie. It delves into some dark territory, but you come out of the tunnel to see nothing but white light.
