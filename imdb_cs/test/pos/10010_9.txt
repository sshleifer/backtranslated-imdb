I first saw this movie on IFC. By the way, which is a great network to see underground movies. I watched this movie and thought it would be a pure drama and a story that doesn't hold water. But while watching it really worth it. The main character is in such a rough shape and you hate seeing him deny help, but no matter what you just can't hate him. His devotion to the Beatles and John Lennon is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels. The film's atmosphere is also great. Sometimes you feel that you can see what they see, feel what they feel in some situations. This movie won't let you want to know more, or don't like the gap in the land. There are no gaps (in my opinion). I've always been a fan of foreign movies, especially now that movies in America are filmed so badly. I really like a foreign environment because I think it will take you on a trip and sometimes you will understand a different culture. This movie did all that stuff to me. Please watch this movie and if you're a new foreign movie, it's a great start.
