I have enjoyed this film since I first saw it in the theater. Some movies have a cast of characters and a script that combine in perfect synergy, and that's one of them. The characters illustrate some truths about how to get the best out of people, work together harmoniously, build a team and achieve goals without preaching morality. The situations are created well and are in line with the assumption of opening the film. Tension develops nicely and humor is clean and consistent. The film can pull me straight into the characters' roots and laugh to the end. This is a good feeling, a good movie just like they come. <br /> <br /> What astonishes me is that a movie that seems so simple can be so fun for a long time. Music is the perfect copy of music in typical, serious navy movies, which helps create humor and warns that size is in the viewer's eyes. Credit scenes are a great "In the Navy" music video that deserves its own special feature in full screen. Scenes and cuts are created well, and casting and playing is right on. <br /> <br /> This film is as classic as ever, without any prejudice. In fact, the lack of preload is what makes it so fun to watch. I love these guys and gal. <br /> <br /> The next day I thought about the movie and wondered if it was available on DVD. Good luck came to us and the DVD was released in May 2004. I headed to the store and kicked out a copy. Then we and my wife enjoyed another magnificent night before the big screen. I rated this movie as 10 because it meets at all levels, much better than many high budget films and Oscar winners. This is fun. Listen to Fox's home video: you have a great movie in your vault and it's a shame to find cheap DVDs with heavily degraded shade colors only 8 years after release. So why not restore colors and introduce the film as it was seen? I'd like to pay a few extra dollars to get the right picture. I'm grateful to have my own copy. Now give us the eye candy that the film deserves, and how to re-create the credit sequence as a special full-screen video feature.
