While one of the first martial arts films played here in the West is generally recognized, its real impact comes back. Lo Lieh is VERY low key all the time and many combat scenes, while often being welcomed as innovative (which were at the time of the initial release of the movie), are tad tame compared to what came (especially after Bruce Lee, who became instant the standard by which everyone else will be judged forever). This does not mean that FIVE FINGERS OF DEATH / KING BOXER is something less than the classic itself because it is. Like many of the leading characters in many martial arts films, the character Lieh plays low over most of the movie for some reason - but when he is crossed out, he effectively cleans the house. You can't ask for more than that.
