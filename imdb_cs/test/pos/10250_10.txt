This film captivated me from the beginning to the end with lots of laughter and real up to the country that makes the whole cast. Glynn Turman (Preach Jackson) is an image star who plays the role of a clever guy who likes poetry and has a very sexy girlfriend. Lawrence Hilton Jacobs (Cochise Morris) was an excellent athlete at Cooley H.S. and even got a scholarship to a famous college. There are scenes in this picture with the Chicago Police Department chasing all these dudes at the Cadillac and visiting the Lincoln Park Zoo with monkey dung throwing around. Music is great and there is a great photo around Chicago. Great movie, enjoy.
