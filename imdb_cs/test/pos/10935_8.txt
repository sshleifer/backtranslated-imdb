An unusual, revisionist west, it's worth watching. Despite the slow start, the film builds? barely any dialogue and no headlines? an ever more intense and intense, almost existential portrait of life in the harsh environment of the Western Desert. The growth of leading figures is worth waiting for, and the strong central cast brings a real sense of despair to fight for possession of all the important horses. How interesting the British director did. I hope she smiles now: I think the contemporaries ignored most of the movie; but time works with its usual alchemy, and hidden gold shines as it must inevitably. One comment has disappeared for me: revisionism is still borne. Sam Waterston as an Indian? - provided he plays his part with real emotions and intensity, but indeed, could one American Indian actor do this work? But his scenes with Caroline Langrish have an intimacy that nicely contrasts with the vast landscape around them. Forget about the big, failed Hollywood versions of the past, the man with the big chin and the swirling music; this is all about the primordial struggle of the protagonists, who, getting rid of all the traps of "ordinary" life, understand what it is worth fighting for. Impressive.
