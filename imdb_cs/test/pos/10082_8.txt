I've seen this movie twice, both on Cinemax. For the first time in his unrated version, which is a soft-core porn at the best and the second time in a clipped montage (cut all sex and most nudity) version that was fun in a typical beach movie way. An unrated version has a huge sex scene with Nikki Fritz, a dude and a bottle of oil that's out of this world (no pun intended). Unfortunately, in the cropped version, the scene is almost completely chopped, just like any other sex scene. Evaluated or not rated is still fun to watch all the siblings of the larger stars (Stallone, Sheen, Travolta, etc .;) who are trying to act. We also have a performance of B-Queen Linnea Quigley and Burt Ward (Robin of the Old Batman Series).
