Madly crafted mini-series. I remember seeing most of it twice when I saw him at the American Playhouse on PBS. At that time he was strongly promoted. I think it might have been one of the very early mini-series on PBS outside the Masterpiece Theater. A total of 6-8 hours. This length was somewhat adjusted to 6 hours. Cut some interesting but slow scenes. <br /> <br /> I very much hope that people who have their current rights will follow and restore the full, unmodified version to DVD. It's not worth creating a VHS version at this time. <br /> <br /> They would fit very well in a mini-series or dramatic history genre.
