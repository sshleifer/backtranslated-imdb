One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, exactly in my vision, and beautiful and very imaginative in its implementation. I can't say much without giving up, and I don't recommend you read about this movie before you see it - just see it. But ah, one has to come up with ten lines of text to have an overview of IMDb. Puzzle. What can I do? Tell you about the movie? No way. I can't do it. I think I enjoyed this movie because I saw it without prejudice. Please do the same. I suppose it can be said: acting is excellent and undervalued, and what I've come to foreign movies is that movies are actually about movies, not about movies. stars.
