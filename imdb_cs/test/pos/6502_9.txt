Wow - most viewers seemed to shake their heads from this documentary on the sheer witch that appears on the screen. The transition from the beginnings of the New York-based black-and-american phenomenon Today's days as a racially diverse subculture (and predominantly on the West Coast) are well profiled. The humble record player has no respect for any traditional musical instrument, but can be more versatile and technically complex. These DJs have the necessary skills for any musical instrument - dexterity, rhythm and timing, among other things - and apply it to new technology with several other variables. DJ Qbert's comment that shooting "music" must sound like on advanced planets and then it works, it's stupid at first, doing more and more sense at first, watching these guys and spitting out a lot of sounds no traditional tool could ever create! Some critics have said that this film focuses too much on certain 'stars' and wastes the opportunity to profile a wider hip-hop culture. One movie at a time!
