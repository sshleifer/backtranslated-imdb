'Nightbreed' is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Overall, I'm not a big fan of horror movies, but there's something more atmospheric about this film and different from any other horror movie I've ever seen. Many of the horrors I saw I enjoyed watching, however, because they are based on horror, I know stories are unreal because they are fictitious, so I can't take them seriously. Night, on the other hand, is a unique horror genre because it has a sense of realism that I've seen in a few other horror movies. This film story of how a man has murdered and ends up living with an undead in an underground cemetery haven with undead monsters is a kind of story that one would get from dreaming Nightmare as its unique and original story. Most of the horror movies I've seen are totally fake, but because Nightbreed was so incredibly sophisticated and brilliantly directed by great acting, especially Craig sheffer (Aaron Boone) with amazing special effects, great lighting and fantastic dialogue. a sense of depth and maturity without a silly false horror parody, no matter how many other horror movies. Nightbreed, as well as horror, has elements of thriller, romance and the action of everything that is raped in one. If you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you watch it because I rate it 10/10.
