I have to say I didn't expect this movie to be so good. The Eastern Cinema usually represents the communist past in 90% of the films. However, this film overcomes Romanian cinema and is worthy of some other advertising. The action is true and not exaggerated, the storyline is simple but complex because it is life in the Romanian suburbs, the sound impressed me, the direction was good and what more can I say ... <br /> <br This "Eastern Crash" has dragged me into a movie that lives in every moment. I even felt the desire for me, the desire for adventure after I saw it. Watch it! You will definitely enjoy it! <br/> 7/10
