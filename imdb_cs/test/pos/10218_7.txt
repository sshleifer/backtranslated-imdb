Clive Barker of Hellraiser of Fame wrote and produced a fantasy horror movie that is fun and exciting. Makeup by Bob Keen and Geoffrey Portass was fantastic. With these mutants who lived underground, it seemed quite imaginative. It was really a pleasure to see the quality of work. It wasn't particularly bad because the worst creature was actually a human serial killer. I just saw Craig Sheffer in Shadow of Doubt the other day and he did a good job in this movie as well. Nothing spectacular, but fair. It was just Bobby's third movie and she was also good. The end was magnificent and the dog got his cakes, just like David Cronenberg. Ha!
