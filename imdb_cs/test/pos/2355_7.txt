I saw this film for the first time in 1953 with my older brother. It was one of the largest 3 demo films released at the time. We saw it at least thirteen times and we were proud of it. Scott makes a typical western shoot em up job while surrounded by Indian darts rather than surround sound. For those polaroid lenses.
