American film is an amazing documentary. Watching the trials and tribulations of a very determined independent filmmaker trying to finish his first film. The raw record and insightful content of this film is an excellent example of how documentaries should be made. I also feel that film can be very inspiring for those of us who want to be the creators themselves.
