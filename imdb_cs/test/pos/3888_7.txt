My original title for this review will be "End of Disappointment, Movie Triumphs". But I thought about this on the way home. It is not a fairy tale that most of these films have, they make it different, and while its end is disappointing at first, it sinks slowly and hits the core in a satisfying tone. The chart follows a man named James Garon (Jeff Garlin, who also wrote and directed) a wrestling actor who lives in Chicago with his mother and deals with both his obesity and the inability to find someone to she loves. Yes, it sounds ominous, but it does experiment with elements that make it somewhat unpredictable, and in fact it wants it to be longer. The end suddenly changed and he said, "That's it!" But as soon as it starts to take it's tax, it's really making a smile. <br /> <br /> It has many tones of esteem throughout, but don't worry, because it's also very funny. Some scenes offer huge laughs, and those who have seen Jeff Garlin's stand-up will recognize the couple (primarily when giving a speech in a career day for their nursery kindergarten class and bombs). It starts with a somewhat serious comment that you don't expect, but what follows is very funny, fun and also quite challenging. It's the kind of movie you're watching and you're always enjoying. And as I said before, while the end may seem absurd at first, once you have time to think, it's a real joy.
