One of the best and most interesting of all conspiratorial thrillers (there were several such films in the 1970s). This one is about a nuclear reactor accident and attempts to cover it. Jack Lemmon is an employee who realizes how dangerous a plant is, and Jane Fonda is a crusader TV reporter who tells the story on board and both players are in the best possible condition. The events in the movie are, of course, scary and not a bit far from attractive (much of what happened here in real life on Three Mile Island), and even though it looks like it is now Something that is a period yet emphasizes how fragile and dangerous the world we have created for ourselves. Expect a number of similar films about the effects of global warming in the near future (and not rubbish like "The Day After Tomorrow").
