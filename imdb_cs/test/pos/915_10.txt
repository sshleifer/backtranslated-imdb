Most of Kieslowski's films seem like riddles to expand mind and soul. The characters are not very believable, they are idealized, they are schematic. However, the way Kieslowski presents his winding paths through life, their complicated interaction with others, the universe, accident or fate, makes me an understanding of faith, makes me (I want to) believe in God. That at some point all this has a meaning, if not for me, then definitely for someone. Trois couleurs and especially "Rouge" are approaching to touch, feel, experience "truth", "meaning" than maybe some other of his films. The only problem that appears on the roads of "riddles" is too similar to his films, and at some point they become somewhat predictable. There's still a lot of joy we have here. It's like a famous brand of wine - you know what to expect and add, sometimes with a newly found bouquet that can come from aging - be it wine or yourself.
