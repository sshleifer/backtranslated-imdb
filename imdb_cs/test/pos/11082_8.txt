True stories do the best stories? There is always something pleasant about the story, whether it's a novel or a movie or anything, just because it's a real story all the more fascinating. This film is based on the true story of two young American men, one government employee and a falcon enthusiast Chris Boyce (Timothy Hutton)? and the other? Andrew Daulton Lee (Sean Penn)? These two begin to sell the government, mostly by the CIA, a secret in 1975 to the Soviet Union. The film will focus on the human aspect of the two men, as well as their growing personal problems (especially Penn's character with ever-deteriorating drug addictions), rather than celebrating their traitors' position in America, which would undoubtedly damage the film's credibility. in USA. Gradually, Boyce becomes more cautious and eventually frustrated and paranoid when their actions go on and go deeper into the treacherous territory. Daulton becomes more dependent and addicted to cocaine and heroin when he becomes more frightened, and more desperately wants to keep control of the situation over which he has no control over what he has trouble with the law. The torture of Boyce and Daulton families because of the way they lead their lives is also well portrayed and contributes well to the idea that espionage against someone's country, even if it is fair, only leads to major problems and destruction of lives? ? including the degradation of friendship and trust between the two main characters. Here is an overview: <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> <br /> --Hutton and Penn each did extensive research into the characters capturing their individual look and feel, so they are depicted with extensive depth and realism. Behavior is excellent. <br /> <br /> - The paranoia atmosphere is developing very well. <br /> <br /> - The story is fascinating and, of course, as one of the real events has an added kick. <br /> <br /> - Holiday Files. - The Soviets working with Boyce and Daulton are very well rendered and are not stereotyped nor do they have a bad conscience just to look bad. No It hurts, it didn't help: <br /> <br /> - Music is fine, nothing perfect. <br /> <br /> - Sound effects are sometimes a bit ugly? with a lot of movies from the seventies to the eighties. Chris Boyce (Timothy Hutton) has a relationship with a woman we barely know. Because of Boyce's cooking problems with American and Soviet governments, her life may be threatened, but it is not as widespread as it should be. A minor problem, though. Ugly: <br /> <br /> - The apparent simplicity needed to sell government secrets is a little worrying. Nothing like a constant state of dishonesty keeping the masses as dangerous as possible. <br /> <br /> Memorable Scene: <br /> <br /> - Showing the first CIA message that was mistakenly sent to the wrong reason is, "Rough Night." This was another movie that suffered a massive delay due to the controversial content of the story. The studios and producers have not seen how the American viewer could accept a film about two American traitors. Fortunately, it is filmed and portrayed with a high grade and quality. Of course, this helps to keep the antihrti heroically portrayed more than a few young men who have committed a gross mistake in their lives. As such, it becomes a very human drama and one very well and very faithfully portrayed.
