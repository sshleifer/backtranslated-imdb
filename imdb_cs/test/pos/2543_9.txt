This is an amazing movie, the soul of Ale. This is the way to Ale's heart. I found it fascinating. The director did a great job. He talks about scenes. Especially on quiet scenes. But the window is great. The scenes that lie in bed are one of the best directed scenes I've seen. <br /> <br /> In addition to directing. It's been quite a while since I looked at the film about the soul. As a philosopher, I can say that this film proves that the age of your soul does not matter. Like Ale's soul. When I live in Turkey, I don't care about the other side of NY. This is a universal scene you can see all over the world. In my opinion, it is more versatile than any other thing. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie. Otherwise you will miss a great thing about the soul. If you have it. Baris.Sentuna
