A beautiful movie about the arrival of an early silent cinema in China. SHADOW MAGIC deftly combines a love story with a dramatic cultural clash between China's ancient traditions and modern Western culture in the form of a film. Amazing first film by Chinese director Ann Hu. If I correctly understood Mrs Hu's remarks at the Sundance Festival in 2000, this film was made as an American film co-financed by the Chinese government and shot in China. SHADOW MAGIC reminds me of films like IL POSTINO and CINEMA PARADISO - not necessarily in motives or conspiracies but has a similar feeling.
