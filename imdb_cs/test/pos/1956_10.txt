I really have no complaints about this film, except for the intrusive scenes with the body. I fell on it when I switched TV one night. Acting was really amazing, I didn't expect it to be better than it seemed! I thought Keanu was (who looks since 1986, which is a very good thing hehe) acting was really great and Crispin played his character perfectly! This movie is a hidden gem! It's a fresh awakening of reality up to the 1980s, compared to other teenage movies made by a brother pack (though I like those moives too). All in all, I give it up!
