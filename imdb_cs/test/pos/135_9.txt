The film is a vibrant feature of the film. Park really knows his stuff when it comes to shooting unforgettable scenes from behind the camera. Each image is filled with vibrant colors that pop out of the screen. Every movie film seems to tell a story in itself. I hope this will be a Blu-ray release of this movie because it will look fantastic. It's quite interesting to see which elements of the vampire mythological park are used for his vision. Sang-hyeon must drink blood to survive and remain flawless, incredibly strong and exposed to sunlight. However, he has no fangs and also has a reflection in the mirror. Although I never saw a movie, I couldn't help but feel like it was a version of Chan-wook Twilight Park. The entire middle part of the film is dedicated to the love of Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo to each other. It really looked like an adult version of Twilight. There's a lot of blood, nudity, sex and even a few obscene things that are fine. Maybe it's a Chan-Wook Park fan, but I honestly feel like I can guarantee it's a better movie for both. The psychological aspect I love about Park's previous films is also in thirst. This is an important factor for me like any movie that makes me think or is unusual in any case, becomes a fan of the fans. Park's movie movies always seem to fit into his movie as a glove. Thirst is no exception. While the soundtrack is somewhat gentle this time, it fits into the overall atmosphere of the film with little effort. The middle of the movie seemed to drag longer than anything else in the movie. It's weird, though the scenes at that time are crucial to the film's storyline and it's hard to imagine that thirst would be the same if one of those scenes were cut out. However, this is my one nitpick film. Chan-wook Park bites the vampire mythology with thirst and puts on its own dark, psychological twist. Park's films seem to always have a specific pattern or contain most of the following: great writing, beautiful cinematography, a solid cast, some kind of psychological intervention that hits your head and an unforgettable end. Thirst releases on all fronts and hopefully gets more attention he deserves during his theatrical DVD run (and finally Blu-ray, hopefully).
