Forget about the recent horrible American remake, which unfortunately disfigured the French original reputation thanks to the director's commitment to both. This is a skillfully drawn romantic 90's with many twists and turns. This works best as a Gallic ode to Hitchcock's rear window because the idea of ​​voyeurism is a constant theme that burns a complicated scenario. The story is incredibly realized, just like Picasso's picture, which offers more perspectives on the same event and requires viewer participation all the time. Settings, music and scary scores are wonderful as well as excellent posts from cast. Watch it more than once.
