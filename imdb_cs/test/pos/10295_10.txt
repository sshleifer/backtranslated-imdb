I watched this movie for the second time in about three years and was as amazing as before ... There are more than a dozen modern stunning French movies from en couer de hiver to three colors trilogy and all are special . This movie is one of them. True pleasure with so many great things that come from Hitchcock to two beautiful ladies in Romani and Monica. While Monica is very beautiful, Romane is a very sexy lady and steals many scenes she inhabits. I'm not sure why people think this film is intricate because scenes are a perfect combination of the past and the present act as a counterpoint to the remarkable journey of characters that just flow, and you barely realize that 116 minutes of beauty and mystery have left an observed and charming. Like most French and European films, this story would never translate across the Atlantic, because no studio could capture the spell without making Hollywood's whitening life impossible for most of the films that have been lost in translation. Americans are making brilliant movies, but not of the kind ... maybe if they let someone like young Polanski work on it, then they might not have made a completely English version ... <br /> <br /> For those who do not watch movies with subtitles that you spend your whole life in unconscious bliss. For those who can read, you would like to do films like this ... <br /> <br /> I would describe it as Neo-Franco-Noir, but only the cheese from the reviewer who called this film elitist . I think I saw him adding four and twenty cakes. He thinks Romane Bohringer is a type of French mayonnaise ... It's the art that Pulp Fiction is arty ... but with more Gallic savoire faire ... <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 is looking at everyone. ... and someone has Romane's phone number ... it's a perfect French salad dressing ...
