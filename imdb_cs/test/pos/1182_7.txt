A competent comedy that brings laughter to Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau fans. I suppose this film was made for those who enjoyed two GRUMP OLD MEN movies because it seemed like a lot of these friends who watched a comic duo in their twilight. The idea is for sure fire: Matthau, a deafening player who has thousands of dollars in debt, calls his unsuspecting friend Lemmon to take a free voyage with him, where they can meet rich old ladies; Catch them, they were signed as Dance Hosts and Matthau can't dance. OUT TO SEA is a funny movie, and not all laughs are to be found courtesy of Lemmon and Matthau. I found Brent Spiner (best known as STAR TREK Data: NEXT GENERATION) to be very funny as a snobbish dance game coordinator. As prissy chief of two aging actors, he manages to deal with them in the laughter department. Although the film doesn't really need it, there's also a love story or two that are also here, including Dyan Cannon (who looks pretty good for her flight).
