I went to see this movie because I always liked Kevin Costner. I felt that Ashton did a great job at Butterfly Effect. Unfortunately, although these two actors were / are capable of good, if not great, game moments, some of them were missing. Some of the scenes were not simply believable and did not have enough support for the story. Although the film claims that the influence of Hurricane Katrina follows, there was very little (none) in the film. Overall, I liked the fact that the film brought some of what's going on to save lives from a water perspective. The special effects were pretty good and more than just a little intimidating. You are not sure that I will ever go back to deep-sea fishing ... <br /> <br /> I expected more emotions in the film than what was presented. Definitely a movie that I could have been seen on a DVD.
