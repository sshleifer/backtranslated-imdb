This is a great family movie that deals with people on the ground who enjoy their local interests mainly dealing with horse racing. Lloyd Bourdelle (Walter Matthau) is a farmer who also raises quarter horses and has a young son named Casey Bourdelle, who loves horses. Lloyd is able to raise an adult horse, who calls "Casey's Shadow" after his son, and this horse breaks all speed records and is a possible winner of a million horse race. Sarah Blue, (Alexis Smith) is interested in this horse and offers to buy a horse for $ 500.00, but this horse gets serious leg injuries and Lloyd gets a serious set-back that disrupts the whole family. Walter Matthau has performed excellent performance and is a great movie that you can view and enjoy.
