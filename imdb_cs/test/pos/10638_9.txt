If you think the piano teacher Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) in Michael Haneke's "LA PIANISTE" is the highest level of personification of doom, perversion and darkness, I have a novelty for you: piano teacher in Elfriede Jellinek's "LA PIANISTE" The film based) is twice "repulsive", "disgusting", "frightened" and even more fascinating - though there cannot be enough words to translate the level of artistic prowess that Isabelle Huppert has achieved here, above all other deadly actresses in activity today. And who else could have played this character with such emotional power, complete with the best piano / dubbing the actor could bring? There are two great antagonists in the novel as in the film. the heroine "Kohut: her own mother (beautiful, wrecked Annie Girardot, in the part originally designed for Jeanne Moreau) and Austria itself. The mother embodies Jellinek's perception of her native Austria as a country that falsely encourages racist / fascist (or at least authoritarian) behavior, sexual and emotional repression, and, say, Ã¼bermensch ideals that cannot be sustained today without the danger of a mental breakdown. "La Pianiste" also deals with a very strong and delicate problem: how dangerous it is to reveal its innermost imagination We tend to think that our own sexual fantasies must be as exciting to others as they are to us, which may prove to be a huge, embarrassing and sometimes tragic mistake. ?) Lesson in the most painful and demanding way. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that El friede Jellinek is one of the most famous and respected authors in Austria and Europe, now has a Nobel Prize!) and that autobiographical passages can be derived in her novel because she was a pianist herself and allegedly had a difficult relationship with her mother. The novel also includes long passages about Kohut's childhood and adolescence, so you will surely realize how she has changed to who she is now. Haneke decided to hide this information in the film and forced us to wonder how such a way should be (not all we know Erik Kohut?). But he very much retains the book's structure in his film: unbearable honesty to the point where the most mysterious, "horrible" feelings emerge painfully - envy, cruelty, violence, jealousy, hatred, misery, sadism, masochism, selfishness, perversion, etc. they are unmistakably human. I thought "La Pianiste" is a deeply moving movie, very distracting and provocative, with a handful of unforgettable scenes, and that's all I want movies for. It also brought me to buy and I am thrilled with the book, discovered a fantastic author I had not read before, and again and again listening to Schubert - so thank you Haneke, Jellinek and Isabelle !!! On the other hand, if you're looking for light entertainment, stay away. My vote: 9 out of 10
