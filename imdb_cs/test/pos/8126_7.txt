This movie was a pleasant surprise because I didn't expect much. I did not know that some actors have since become larger stars in the main pix. While I'm in Matrix, it's not a plus in my book (I hated it), I'm sure it's a career for Hugo. James Purefoy is great at this and Jennifer Ehle is sweet and gorgeous. Sometimes it looked like Carnaby street romp 30 years later, but I enjoyed a smart Janis Joplin outfit mixed with the modern spirit of sexual and gender blur. A real estate broker who has an erotic relationship with his listings is a lot of fun. Iron John's social gatherings are a little old, but I still loved them. It's a social satire sex comedy in the best way and reminds me of a little old "Carry On" movies. The British know how to do sexual comedy and it's an old tradition, unlike the United States, which is too cautious to understand that sex is funny.
