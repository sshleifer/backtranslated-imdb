I can't watch this many times, it's full of real enthusiasm and cleverness Mickey Mouse had in the first thirty years. Currently, Mickey is a smart butt that is a little better than this one. Steamboat Willie always smiles, at least the end where Mickey laughs after hitting a parrot with potatoes. The animation is very nice, and although the Willie liner has no dialogue, the music is sufficient for him. <br /> <br /> IMHO, if this bit doesn't deserve 10/10, then no cartoon is just because it's a true classic, but also because it's so full of joy and it's always fun to watch.
