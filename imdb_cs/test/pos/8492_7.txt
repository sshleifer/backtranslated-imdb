2004 was a year of biopsies with no fewer than four pictures that dealt with real events, real people, with varying degrees of critical praise. Of the four Oscars at the beginning of 2005 (KINSEY, THE AVIATOR, HOTEL RWANDA and RAY), RAY became the big night winner, when Jamie Foxx won the award for his portrayal of R & B genius Ray Charles. And while Leonardo diCaprio came close and Liam Neeson wasn't even nominated, it was deserved. What made Foxx the winner was that the other two played quite dark eccentricities, Ray Charles still made music until his death in 2004, and by that time there was no soul who wouldn't know at least one song that Charles' wrote. This helped Jamie Foxx rise well over the film - himself as a whole weak and often seemed to be out of place as a television biography - and its depiction is detailed as wild. She has a delicate task of embodying a person's nuances, and once Ray's heroin addiction crisis hits his head, Foxx pulls out all the stops and it is hard to imagine that a real Ray is actually going that way. painful suffering. The low point of the movie is how much time he spends a detailed account of Ray's relationship with women. Taylor Hackford, like THE AVIATOR, wants to prove that Ray had this tumultuous life, the product of his own demons and his entry into success at the time of being black and successful, bringing a huge amount of luggage. Of the women, the only one who succeeds, brings real life to Sharen Warren as Ray's mother. It's a tough part because he's alone on the screen with a young actor playing young Ray, but her body and body language smells, especially when she has to give up motherhood so Ray can find her way around the house. Such an intensity of emotion, standing there and watching your blind son walk around the room and have to force him to wake this rude dragon into independence. A wonderful performance that should be recognized. The fantastic counterpoint to RAY is great music. Anyone who knows R & B will enjoy the early recordings of Ray's radio hits as well as his later recordings, which would bring him to the forefront of popular music, and Jamie Foxx practically steals the show when he plays songs like Ray. This in itself will live, even if the film itself is slightly more than a rigid biotic. However, I would like him to use his latest hit Adult Contemporary since 1993, "Sing my Song for You" in closing credits. After all, it's Ray Charles, an artist who had a strong commitment to his art.
