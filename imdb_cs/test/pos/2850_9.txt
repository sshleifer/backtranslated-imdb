I was a mighty impression of Sister Betty. He has a large set of characters, the original plot, and the end I saw coming, but not and pulling for your heart strings. most was Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's interaction. These two are great and warms my heart to see Rock won't make a crappy Big Hollywood fare like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of my life. Freeman is, as always, a man; in fact, there should be no more need to criticize his work. Hell, The Kissing Girls looked at him in it. a nice touch of gratuitous violence in it to satisfy the bloodthirsty man. 9 outa 10 <br /> <br />
