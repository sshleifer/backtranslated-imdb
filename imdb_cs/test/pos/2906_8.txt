One morning I was on my way when I checked the VV and came across this movie. I never remember seeing or hearing it. What is fun and interesting to watch. My meeting was pushed back because I couldn't get out of this movie. There were some interesting things in it that marked the time in history, and some fun things people don't have in today's movie because it's not nice. That was a lot of realism. The play was good for the 1954 movie. The fine and true actions of the characters who followed me on what they would do next. That's why I watched it. I don't know why they don't show it more often. I'd rather watch it than some movies that play more than necessary. For history lovers, people who like period movies and those who are in movie awards groups like this. "Egyptian" has a variety of tastes that deal with the many things it looks at in human nature, and have not changed since it was time. What does it say about us? Those who do not like movies that take time to develop and tell a good story .... they are not in the movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't have time to rent it if it was available, but if I had a chance to see it again, I would probably vote it 10.
