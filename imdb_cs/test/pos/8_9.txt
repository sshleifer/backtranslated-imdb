I am a Petty Officer of 1st Class (E-6) and I am in the USCG for 6 years and I feel that this film is strongly represented by the Coast Guard. There were only a few scenes that were far drawn. The farthest was when PO Fischer (Kutcher) descended into the sinking vessel to pull the captain of the vessel out of the engine room ... that would never have happened. Swimmers are not allowed to go inside any ship, regardless of circumstances. Second, the Command Center (supposedly in Kodiak), it looked more like NASA's command center ... we don't have any equipment that would be hi-tech. Third, the Airstation Captain would not trigger search and rescue cases with 10 people on patrol. In fact, it would be an E-6 or an E-7 as a SAR regulator, and maybe 2 other support workers, such as a SAR helper and Watchstander radio. Otherwise, the movie was dead, I think they should include more other rates in CG and their role in search and rescue instead of aviation rates. Some of the "A" school scenes reminded me of their days and the stupidest things I did and got into trouble in my younger days.
