If you were even slightly interested in war between states, this film is worth watching. It's a great historical story. No flashing sabers, no cartridges, no bloodshed - just the story of a justifiable group of union soldiers who ran into a companion female and her son's farm and allowed them what their captain conscience allowed them. This amount moves up and down as events evolve and influence its sense of humanity in contradiction with its sense of duty to its people and its causes. Finally, he reaches a compromise that would be difficult for each of us to be upstairs. I appreciate the historical treatment of the war in Kentucky, a slave state that tried to remain neutral, but ultimately decided to stay in the Union under mysterious political circumstances that include the detention of some legislators. Roughly half of Kentucky soldiers fought for each side, but there has never been much treatment for what it was that they lived there at these times. This film is of great benefit simply in the "look and feel" of time and place.
