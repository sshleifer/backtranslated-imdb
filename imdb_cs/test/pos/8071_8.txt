Some would argue that Argentine director Esteban Sapir La Antena is an anachronistic futility exercise; that while the silent films that Sapir pays homage to were at the cutting edge of cinematography when they were made, they are now obsolete, leaving La Antena meaningless. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't agree. Warmly. La Antena combines the conventions of silent film with 21st century technology, resulting in postmodern filmmaking. The film is set in a timeless movie "City Without a Voice", so-called because the public was heard by the TV, a dictator / media mogul with painted hair. The city resembles the titular one in Fritz Lang's Key Metropolis (1927), perhaps 100 years before that film. They are all expressionist skyscrapers, TV antennas and animated billboards. Citizens of the city are bewildered by La Vozem (Voice), the only person with a gift of speech. Her face is always hooded (held even when naked), La Voz is forced to sing in the TV network of Mr. TV. However, when Mr. TV devises a plan to steal the written word, La Voz and her headless son join forces with the apostate family in an effort to give people free speech. La Antena is nothing but a pure cinema. Loaded with conventions of silent film, Sapir must rely on images to tell his story. There is a sound, most notably in the almost continuous score of Leo Sujatovich. It evokes the best of silent movie music as well as inventively working alone into the diegesis movie, such as car horn horns, or rhythmic ra-ta-tat-shooting. And the basis of the film is a familiar whirl as if it were on an ancient projector. <br /> <br /> There is also enough dialogue. Instead of using subtitles, Sapir has the words of characters in the word. They're bigger or smaller, filling the screen or humbly hanging in the air, depending on what they say. Think of a more imaginative version of the Night Watch (2004). Fortunately, words don't distract from images. Which is really very happy, because La Antena can boast some of the most creative and original paintings we've seen in a long time, all captured by the sumptuous black and white photo of Cristian Cottet. There are expressionist urban views. Hooded singer and her headless son. There is an abandoned aerial of the city that looks like the corrupt remains of any colossal spider. And there is a sinister dr. Y whose sharp mouth is displayed on a TV screen attached to his face. La Antena was criticized for relying heavily on her paintings while flew into allegorical depth. But again I would disagree. It is true that the sudden appearance of a swastika-like mind control machine, or a hopeless boy seemingly crucified on David's star, does not seem to be in place; But the lack of obvious symbols (two previous examples aside) works in favor of the film. This allows us to think of our own mind: to decide whether to draw political significance, to see La Antena as an allegory of fascism, the danger of capitalist monopolies, and the power and responsibility of the media; or to take the film at face value, as a visually stunning adventure in a world that is both unique and familiar. Sacrificing explicit depth in favor of unique images may seem like a compromise. But really, when a movie looks so good, it's hard to take care of it. There is more imagination and art in every frame of La Antena than Hollywood can shake the derivative stick on. Exploding movies of nearly 100 years old could be futile, but Sapir can show us what's missing in today's movies. Maybe he tells us it's time for another artistic revolution. And maybe he's right.
