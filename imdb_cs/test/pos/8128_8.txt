The director's inspired selection for this latest British film novelty, Rose Troche, which broke out on the scene with a budget-free NY Dykes story, brought a gently yellow look at this story of a London player who chose a slightly inappropriate environment. a male custody company to declare its desire for colleagues seeking male truths. The highlight for me is the scene in which the company tries to return to primitive hunter-gatherers, but eventually orders a subscription. The film as a whole is delightfully acted and Troche, who has never been accepted by some lesbians she portrayed in her previous film, enjoys a larger budget by indulging in some beautifully loving shots contrasting with grainy hyperkinesis. Very nice movie
