I remember being so excited on Saturday night when I was a kid waiting for Dr. Who. I thought it was the best show ever. Then I grew up, Doctor, who was out of the air, and nobody ever heard of what I knew. Then I found out it would be a new series. I was a little nervous about it. Was it in line with the expectations I had since then? Could they ruin it? Will the doctor suck? Will his assistant suck? They would create a more intimate relationship with Dr. and his assistant? YES, NO, NO, NO, NO !!! This show is amazing! I love the new Dr. I love my assistant. I love the show. And now I'm excited about Friday night waiting for a "new" episode. Right now I see the 2005 episodes when I live in the States, so I'm a little behind you. I hope the next Dr. it's as big as this one!
