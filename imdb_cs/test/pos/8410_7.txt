It's common knowledge and has been said: No one can play Scarlett and Rhett as Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. Joanne Whalley Kilmer (no longer Kilmer, who was divorced from her former husband Val Kilmer) plays her own Scarlett and even though it is a sequel and not a re-make (God-forbid !!!), she still can't get to that opportunity (ie her voice sounded ominous several times, her eyes brown [Scarlett's green eyes in both novels, and neither Vivien Leigh had green eyes] nor her voice power was working. Scarlett is South Belle, so she has an incredible talent for flirting (as she did in SCARLETT's novel and GWTW, of course) and being a great flirt like Scarlett's, you'll most likely need a higher tone like Vivien Leigh. <br /> <br /> I assume that Kilmer was comparing a little too much with Leigh, but when someone has such a powerful role as Leigh with Scarlett, you just can't help but criticize all the new potential Scarletts, Timothy Dalton shouldn't have any accent at all, vzh The fact that Margaret Mitchell is Rhett and Gable in fi He had nothing, his acting has never been remarkable (with the exception of his portrayal of evil, the delight of King Phillip of France in LIS WINTER) and gives his Rhett very little (if any) freshness or vitality. Especially Tina Kellagher (born actress with a lot of authenticity in her deliverance) as a tragic victim of Mary Boyle is the standout in the cast. And then, of course, Sean Bean is cold, calculating and not to mention the almost demon-evil Lord Fenton, Mary's nemesis and Scarlett's potential rapist. One thing I couldn't forgive was the fact that Scarlett was raped in this movie (a thing that never happened in the novel; Lord Fenton is cold and ill-known among the Irish in the book, but is nowhere near as heartless). The novel written for the film is the character of Belle Watling that Ann-Margret played most horribly in the role that we all could live without seeing the book as such. a run-away bestseller without any help from Mrs. Watling. <br /> <br /> For the film itself, SCARLETT is very good, but not quite noble from the place when it comes to GONE WITH WINDs. <br /> <br />
