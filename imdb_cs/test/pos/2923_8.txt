Film historians have said many times about old epics that have been in the interest of many directors since the beginning of cinema. The pioneers of such epics, especially the biblical ones, were D. W. Griffith with his "mother of all the epic" INTOLERANCE (1916) and Cecil B DeMille with his talent for gorgeous glasses, costumes and flashy scenes. Who can forget his TEN ANNEXES (1923, 1956) or CROSS (1932)? However, here comes another epic, made in 1950, directed by Michael Curtiz, and based on Mike Waltari's novel, "Egyptian". Famous for his brilliant classic CASABLANCA (1941), Michael Curtiz manages to adapt his film to the audience of the time, bringing the most important ideas and facts from the thick novel and re-creating the lifestyle of the Egyptians who lived one of the most amazing times during the Akhnaton reign. The first and most important fact in this film is the psychological development of the main character, played by Edmund Purdom. Sinuhe, who was brought up in a simple family by his parents, becomes a doctor. He never asked the question "why?" and search for answers. The seductive love he finds in courtesan Nefer (Bella Darvi) leads him to a financial and spiritual disaster. They have to fix the mistakes with hard work at the House of Death and start building their reputation from nowhere. First, they think revenge is the only remedy. In the long run, however, he realizes that "eye for eye" is not the solution. Finally, standing in front of him in special circumstances, he is tempted to be a pharaoh. But there is a moment when he finds the answer to his questions that have touched him throughout his life ... The story of the main character, while based on a book, is so psychologically interesting that every open man should consider this aspect . film. The main character's psychological struggle is intensified by the time he lived, at a time when the power of the sword clashed with the power of thought, the first time it had spread. Curtiz's film also retains one rule that all films of his era have kept: big cast and rich files. There are mostly British actors and actresses who give very nice performances. As can be said about the foundation of the ancient epic, Victor Mature. This time not Demetrius, Hannibal or Samson, but Horemheb - a warrior, a lover, eventually a pharaoh. Jean Simmons appears in the very delicate role of Merit, a woman who has loved Sinuh all her life, but it was too late to realize it. Peter Ustinov, probably best known for his wonderful performance as Nero in QUO VADIS? three years ago he does a great job like Kaptah, a friend of Sinuhe. Two big casts, Gene Tierney and Michael Wilding, also play the film. Tierney is excellent as cold, Baketamon, the Pharaoh's sister, longs for power. Wilding gives amazing performance as "mad" Akhnaton. When I was in the Louvre in Paris and saw Akhnaton's original face carved in stone, he looked just like the actor in the film. Bella Darvi, an actress born in Poland, is quite memorable as the godless courtesan Nefer. And there is another actress who only appears in one scene, but is hard to forget, Judith Evelyn as Taia, the mother of Pharaoh. This voice, these eyes! The sets are beautiful. The director again created the most probable picture of the outdoor temple of Aaton, the god the Egyptians worshiped during the reign of Amenhotep IV. I also loved the Pharaoh's first entry scene. What a glorious picture that lasts forever in someone's memory !!! However, there is also one aspect that I would like to draw attention to all those interested in the film. Egyptian is similar to other epics in many ways, but it also stands out as a unique film. There are very few movies that make such amazing use of various curiosities as in ancient times. There is mention of the iron used first by the Hetites. It is also the only film about ancient Egypt that speaks openly about the great healing powers of the Egyptians. This unforgettably shows the contrasts of lifestyle, especially the moment of death of a slave for whom no one cares, followed by the announcement and subsequently widespread sadness after the death of Pharaoh. Finally, "Egyptian" shows one historical fact: there were other peoples except the Jews (before Christ) where the spirit of God shone in some human hearts. The only difference was that he did not survive as long as the Jews because he had no strong foundation. The scene of Akhnaton's death gives you so many biblical and Christian values ​​that you may think you are looking at a religious film. <br /> <br /> I consider all things, I recommend Michael Curtiz's movie. It is a great production on several levels: fun for epic fans, admiration of amazing performances for cinema fans, spiritual feast for spiritual people. Finally, it is a beautiful story of extraordinary things that occurred thirteen centuries before the birth of Jesus Christ.
