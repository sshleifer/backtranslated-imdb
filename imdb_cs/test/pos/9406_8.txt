This big TV movie told Martha Moxley's murder in Greenwich, Connecticut in 1975 by Ethel Kennedy's nephew. The use of Martha's "spirit" to provide some details was very effective, and it gave a lot of heart to the story. Christopher Meloni seems to have captured Mark Fuhrman very well. Furhman, who is in O.J. The Simpsons trial has certainly defended himself by contributing to making the murderer in court after about 27 years.
