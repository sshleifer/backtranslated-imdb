This little-known comedy from Ruth Gordon's hits is a pleasure. The game-based script is spicy, rich and undated. Ditto to cast, but I have to emphasize the work of leading lady Irene Dunne. Irene is simply excellent - as usual - and she lights up the screen with every frame she is in (and there is a lot in it, thanks to heaven). In addition, director Vidor has given her some unusual details that are fascinating. What a girl! I know of no other Hollywood actress from any era that has its versatility and is so convincing in every movie. Why is so little known is a mystery. I've seen most of her movies and this was a surprise, even for a solid fan ID like me. You see it, everybody!
