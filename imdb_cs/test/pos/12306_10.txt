John Huston has made many remarkable and unforgettable films. Those who were most often and easily remembered were released long before his departure in 1987. That was the year that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game, as evidenced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novel "The Dead ". One long time ago, a very wise man named Doc asked me, "The Dead" doesn't seem to be remarkably livelier and brighter than any other story in Dubliners? "I tend to think it is. The story and film both contain some of Joyce's social comments and critics, but for the most part, paint a warm and loving portrait of Ireland's Joyce himself so often railing against and would soon leave. Huston's manipulation of the protagonist Gabriel Conroy One who is aware of the world of seeing him is nothing but illusion, is just remarkable, and if you want to say that the film lacks conspiracy, this point must be left out. certainly present - there is no focus, the fence is merely a tool for transmitting protagonist revelation, and in addition to the apparent lack of action, the director is leaning in the short story of Joyce a little dialogue Huston's ability to translate what Joyce puts into visuals is perhaps the greatest film triumph. Feelings, thoughts ... Gabriel's uncomfortable feeling during the dance ... all these intangible things jump into life and reach the viewer in Huston's view. To claim that Huston has alleviated his writer's criticism is missing again. While "Dead" can be painted with a cheerful shade, the satisfaction and pretense of the characters is just a commentary on a smaller scale society: we are an aunt's aunt's aunt; embarrassing drunk; tenor with sore throat; wife with sad, rain-soaked secret; even a deluded middle-aged man. But "The Dead" is against its name. It's not a dark story. It's not so bleak. For a moment forget the snow falling on the living and the dead and on your own symbolism in it; to forget the wreckage of life Gabriel wakes up at the end of the film: it is only with the destruction of the illusions that Gabriel has of himself and his world that he can really go forward. Such is the central point of the film. Such is the focal point of our lives.
