I loved this movie, the audience I was part of this beloved movie, and the little 7-year-old boy who was with me loved this movie. We all laughed at puns, visual humor and the good feeling that you left the cinema when you finished. I could easily understand why it was such a huge success at the box office in France. I plan to buy a DVD, so I see it again and laugh at all the pieces I missed when I first laughed.
