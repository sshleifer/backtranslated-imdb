I had the pleasure of seeing this short film at the Miami Film Festival this Saturday and let me say I'm impressed. It was the only movie of the whole program I loved. It is beautifully shot, composed, modified, acted and written. After the screening, I saw the director at the party and asked him what he was doing next. He said he was working on finding funding for the short version. He described some scenes for me. It sounded like the first film to bring industry greats. If you ever get a chance to see this short I recommend that to do it. Hats on the cross.
