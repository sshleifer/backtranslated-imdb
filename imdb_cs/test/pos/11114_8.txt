Although at first glance this film looks like a story about your parent's life in high school (and many people will try to tell you that this movie is outdated) ... and admit it was my first impression .... frankly, 'lessons' learned by heroes / heroes are def. It's not outdated. Who doesn't want to be famous? And who does not want my peers to be recruited? And a homosexual guy - isn't there a whole discussion about gay marriage today, blah, blah? Although released in the 1980s, this film is still dealing with some of the biggest problems in today's world. But this film has a bit of profanity and nudity for my taste. (ie 8/10)
