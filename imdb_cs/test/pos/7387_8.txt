If the end wasn't so fantastically unexpected, I don't think I could rate this film so well. This film has a lot of unpleasant, unpleasant, "marital crumbling" interactions. Such a thing is not my kind of drama, so the pace seemed to pull me. In addition, the main characters are difficult to deal with, so they care a lot about them - the husband (Alan) Rickman is somewhat bitter and disheveled, and the wife (Polly Walker) is reserved and a little promoted. Acting was fine (Norman Reedus was very appealing), but the characters themselves were perhaps a bit of a realistic mistake (for me). The camera had something that seemed a bit old-fashioned to me. But the last 5-15 minutes of this movie is so brilliant that every unpleasant scene, unpleasant conversation and inexplicable character behavior is worth it. I guessed that every typical twist except that it occurred. The end definitely makes this movie worth watching. Intrigues and drama, not so much.
