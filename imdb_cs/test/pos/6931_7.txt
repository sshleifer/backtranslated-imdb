I was at the world premiere of this movie, and I even met Todd's couples around town (once in Olive Garden). Todd is not a bad guy, he's just a small filmmaker with little to no budget and big dreams. <br /> <br /> When it comes to film, it's good if you like zombie movies with very little plot and lots of blood and guts. Can you get to some places in Kansas City and lots of raw meat that could be better? :-) Look at the same 2 dozen people playing different zombies (just changing clothes or hats). You can have a good drinking game with this movie, take a shot whenever you see the same zombie in another shirt.
