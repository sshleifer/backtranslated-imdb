I have to say he let it go. Overall, it is great to see how Aparna Sen has mastered the question of schizophrenia, I am not very well informed about it and got what was depicted in A Beautiful Mind, and here is also its interesting display. But the thing that made me leave myself was artificial dialogues and the use of English. It is true that a new class is formed in India, which originated in India and speaks English and at home, but I am sure it is not as formal as in the film. Moreover, Waheed Rehmaan did not seem to speak well in English. Charu's dialogue in Bihari was seemingly more realistic and digestible. The second thing that is about the abstract flavor she tried to give to the film. I generally like open-ended movies, but there were many free ends. Its like cut pieces are joined to make a film. The film seemed to have no central theme either. Schizophernia certainly was the main line, but the sister-sister, mother-daughter mingled, added a doctor-azmi relationship, no real use of brother, Bose - Bose's wife relationships ..... all were not necessary and the audience released a trace of what she was trying to depict . On the whole, watches for people who like off-beat movies have to avoid those who see movies as a fun tool.
