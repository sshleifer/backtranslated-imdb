Many other viewers say it's not a good movie to watch because they feel it's not "realistic." How this cannot be considered realistic. They believe that it is not easy to incest that it is not common. I can guarantee that you have met more people than you think incest cases have occurred. Many of them do not come out and say it, and mostly they are victims. Also, many people are gay, and they are still in the closest, because no matter how much they want it to be, they know they will be ridiculed and maybe even abandoned. And tell me how many children you went to high school with being pregnant or having an eating disorder? I bet a lot, and although pregnancy is not from incest most of the time, it's still easy to apply to it. Who cannot relate to being an outcast or being bullied? it happens all the time. and many viewers are probably interested in learning like Marcus. Being a Stoner seems to be quite common these days. So there are a lot of things to do. More than others, no matter how popular you may get, sometimes you feel invisible or alone, you won't notice or overlook, such as a suicide victim, how can you not think you can apply to a movie? I found that the film may seem unnecessary to others, but I would like to think of it as important. It's an interesting way to show that suicide is happening and to be aware of it. it comes from people who do not show their unfortunate thoughts, it is very surprising. People who have problems there sometimes commit suicide, but when you hear about a suicide that guesses, it usually goes through most people. The end surprised me, I did not expect it to be a girl who, until the end, was mostly in the scenes, not even introduced. The story, even in its description, says its about 6 adolescent lives when in fact it was 7. My only real disappointment was that it wasn't one of the characters that we learned about it that it just initially looks like the movie was useless to watch if the real victim is just some random chick. until I thought more. It was a perfect sense of being a huge surprise because that is what suicides are. plus, who should choose which of any other student had more reason than the other. Although this film has some bad points, most movies have few, but I would recommend this movie, as long as you can watch the tragic moments of observing suicide and violence and blasphemy that are mentioned in this film.
