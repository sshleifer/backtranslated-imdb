I really enjoyed watching Hell to Pay. I was a Western fan for as long as I remember, and this reminded me of a lot of Westerns since the 1960s (though I was too young to see them in their first run). One thing that bothered me about the film was constant music. Sometimes it disturbed. One thing I noticed and wondered how many other Gunsmoke fans noticed was the name of Buck Taylor's character. It was a play in the name of Dr. Adams from Gunsmoke. Gay Taylor Adams used Buck Gal by Adam Galen. I wonder if it was his choice or Chris McIntyre? Anyway, I would recommend this film to fans from the West. Don't expect anything too "deep". Simple old fun.
