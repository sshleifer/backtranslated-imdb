I really can't see why people don't like this movie. I found it very fun (of course the stars are wonderful Laura Fraser is a bonus!) When I first heard about it, I thought it would be in line with the role of "Weird Science" and that's true However, there is a twist I really didn't see coming. I saw the DVD trailer (which I didn't see before watching the movie), I saw that the "twist" is actually displayed in the trailer! Very strange. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, the comparison of "Weird Science" is less and less, and I think it's better from both movies. Sure, there are some scenes that don't work beautifully, but they are made up of the enthusiasm of the young cast. In short, I suggest it's a good example of Sci-Fi chick flick, and I don't think I've seen many!
