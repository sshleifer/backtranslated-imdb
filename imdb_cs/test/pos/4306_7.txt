This Columbo is unique in that we do not know exactly the exact result until the very end. Our favorite dark horse detective suspects a pair of identical twins killing their rich uncle; Everyone points his finger at his brother. In a mysterious series in which crime is shown at the beginning of the drama, this twist could reasonably be used only once or twice, and that was Colum's time. Other than that wrinkle, this episode fits well with the other series. It has a lighter tone than some, with a very humorous performance by Jeanette Nolan as a challenging and loyal housekeeper who takes immediate resistance to Columbo.
