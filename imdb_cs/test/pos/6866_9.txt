This film will send you chills even if you don't understand German. I first saw it in my German high school class and found it for $ 5 at my local Wal-Mart. I've seen it at least 20 times since it was just a few years ago * and it's great to watch a movie night. Plasticized bodies are mostly real, used by Body Worlds. This was this movie. Dr. German * nicknamed Dr. Death * began plasticizing human bodies for exposure and now Body Worlds is touring right now in Chicago IL. Many people opposed this and so a great German horror was created. I personally love this movie and recommend it to all who like thriller slasher movies.
