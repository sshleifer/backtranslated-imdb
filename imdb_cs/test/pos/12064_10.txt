I'm not from the USA, I'm from Central Europe and I think the show is amazingly good. It can be easily compared to married with .. kids. My title says it's not a show for the conservative public. I think I'm not so liberal, but it can be a slight difference between European conservatism and us. The show is becoming very popular in our area and it is very bad that it contains only two seasons. The last episode opens many uninterrupted and witty moments. Anyway, many people would like it to continue playing. The last thing I'm excited about is some kind of moral upbringing, wrapped up in funny scenes. I think I've seen many comedies that have over two and even more minutes very sad in the tragic scenes that don't fit in comedy. War does not contain anything like that and is intended for laughter. It's like The Simpsons and got married who also have no sad or even infallible moments. I apologize for my terrible knowledge of English, but I still hope you understand what I meant.
