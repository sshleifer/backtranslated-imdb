He wanted to be some sort of social commentary on how our lives got out of control in the 1970s, and this film is more like something Schlesinger threw on the highway after a bad day. Mish mash snippets about nuts crashed along the highway in Florida, and along the highway of life, the cast is mostly unnecessary and probably ended up on the floor of the cutting room. The problem is that what DIDN'T will end up on the cutting room floor should probably have! Now available on DVD, it's pretty fun to see a comedy that would cost $ 100 million to produce if it was produced in 2004. It rolls together and isn't too hard to sit, and strangely, in 2004 we're all still very little <br /> <br /> jumping in our cars and faster and faster, nowhere.
