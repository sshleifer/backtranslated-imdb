As a longtime admirer of the 2001 Moulin Rouge and the more recent filmmaker Jean Renoir, I knew I would inevitably follow his "French cancan" sooner or later. The film tells the fictional story of opening the Moulin Rouge nightclub. Impresario Danglard (Jean Gabin) is trying to turn Montmartre Laundress Nini (Fran√ßoise Arnoul) into a cancanian star without arousing the wrath of his wonderful mistress, Lola Belly Dance (Maria Felix). This is just one of several love triangles in the "French cancan" - true to the stereotype, these French showbiz folk are always in love. Renoir directs his typical subtle humor and attention to supportive characters, and also wrote lyrics to the beautiful war song prominently featured in the film. Gabin perfectly embodies the aging French playboy hero. Arnoul is a cute redhead who holds her own in dance numbers, with the exception of a few trick shots where she is doubly used. "French Cancan" is billed as a musical comedy, and while there are plenty of musical numbers that are on the nightclub, etc., only one character, Casimir, will ever break into a song in the middle of a conversation. The actor who plays him, Philippe Clay, is fun to watch - a really tall, skinny young man who sings, dances, and does distortions. The film ends with a long Cancan sequence. characters learn to triumph over their problems and do art together. Dance is much more brightly lit and coherent than in the "Moulin Rouge"; In fact, if I have one complaint about "French Cancan", it's that the whole thing is a little too much Technicolor. Even if Nini experiences a break or someone sings a melancholic song, the lighting is bright and flat, with no shadows. Yes, the result is a cheerful and cordial musical comedy; It's just that I can't help thinking that things in life have never been so colorful and innocent.
