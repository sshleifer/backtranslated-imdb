Have you ever wondered what it's like to feel FREE? I'm sure every one of us knows the sense of freedom and never seriously considers using it for our benefit. HARI OM shows viewers what freedom means. In this film, freedom is described as a style represented by Isla's discovery of India. Isa discovers his inner true love when he is on the road with Rickshaw with Mr. HARI OM. She looks at life differently and depicts the freedom that every woman limits when she is in a relationship. This movie is definitely "worthy of a watch" and I first saw it in an international film at the Dubai Festival (DIFF) and I left the cinema room with complete satisfaction. <br /> <br /> "Watch it"!
