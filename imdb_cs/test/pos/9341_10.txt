The stars and planets must have been fine the day THRILLER was conceived. Michael Jackson's album took up charts, John Landis still had a lot of goodwill built from his genre pic "American Werewolf in London" (not to mention his classic comedy ANIMAL HOUSE and BLUES BROTHERS) and choreographer Michael Peters was to Create Some of the Most Innovative and Influential Songs music videos of that time. Not sooner or because he has one piece of film illuminated, exploited or underlined by the incredible talent of MJ or more "secular" aspects. his personality is quite like THRILLER, the most successful (if not officially first) video in the world, and the most enjoyable memories. Also the most expensive at the time, but every penny and every bit of talent behind its creation and execution is there on the screen. And how would it not be complete without "rap" from the original song that was provided by the late, big Vincent Price, to make even more of the freezing cache available? The glorious days of one of the world's greatest artists have long since passed, but no one can ever take away male achievements that are probably the most memorable. If you don't think so, remember: Halloween is coming. I'm not going to be a little surprised when, like the rest of Halloweens, before it comes back in a decade, it will be featured on some special Saturday night Feature. As it will be next year, even a year after. .
