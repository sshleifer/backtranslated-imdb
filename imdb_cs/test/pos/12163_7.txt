After being thrown out of their last job and finding a job in the United Kingdom, six Wonder Boys, better known as The Crazy Gang, see a job advertisement in the Red Gulch strike in the Yukon territory. It's from a newspaper clipping and on the back is a story about Chamberlain who says the country should be better prepared for war. By the way, they go to the Yukon and the Frozen Limits. By the way, it's a case of poorly placed Chamberlains. The neckline is forty years old and refers to Joe Chamberlain and the Boer War instead of Neville in the current crisis. But this is typical of how it goes for this crew. I see Stan Laurel making the same mistake. Of course, when they get there, it's a ghost town inhabited only by young Jean Kent and her grandfather Moore Marriott. It starts years and touches the head a little. Marriott has a gold mine that is somewhere in its sleep-it is when it is sleepwalking. The Gang will help him find out that my or Mrs. Kent will not marry a striking hunter, Anthony Hulme, but rather a Bernard Lee salon owner, a fate worse than death. It was my first exposure to Crazy Gang and I see why they were so lauded in the UK and why they never made any impact on the pond. Jokes come quickly and furiously, and then there were a few things the Codex did not allow in the US. Jokes are also topical to the British and many wouldn't get here. The visual gags are universal, the final chase is worthy of everything Marx Brothers did in America. My suggestion is that if you look at The Frozen Limits, upload it if you have a British history experience and run it two or three times to make sure you pick it up. It will be worth it.
