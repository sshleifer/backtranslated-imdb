This film requires a lot of patience. As it focuses on mood and character development, the plot is very simple and many scenes take place on the same set - in Frances Austen's apartment (Sandy Dennis). However, the film is based on a disturbing peak. <br /> <br /> The characters create an atmosphere full of sexual tension and psychological irritation. It is very interesting that Robert Altman directed it, considering the style and structure of his other films. However, the brand name Altman audio style is evident here and there. I think what really makes this movie work is a great performance by Sandy Dennis. She is definitely one of her darker characters, but she plays it so perfectly and convincingly that it's scary. Michael Burns has a good job as a "mute" young man. Regular player Altman Michael Murphy has a small part. The festive, moody set fits very well with the story's content. In short, this film is a powerful study of loneliness, sexual repression and despair. Be patient, soak up the atmosphere and pay attention to the beautifully written script. <br /> <br /> I commend Robert Altman. This is one of his many films that deals with an unconventional, fascinating theme. This film is disturbing, but it is honest and will certainly trigger the viewer's strong emotional response. If you want to see an unusual movie - some might even say bizarre - it's worth it. You may need to buy from the internet.
