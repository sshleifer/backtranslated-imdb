This is certainly a good movie, beautifully photographed and evocative. It should definitely criticize and Mizoguchi, because it is not free of defects and weaknesses. Mizoguchi really took care of the women and wanted to make a statement about the lack of sympathy and the utter cruelty of man, yet he sometimes tries to show this statement by accepting the wrong means. This is certainly the case of "Crucified Lovers", "Princess Yang Kwei Fei" and "Zankiku monogatari". The scenario sets in feudal Japan, which leaves the viewer at the end with a real scream: "boy, sucks feudalism, I'm glad it's over ...". And indeed, some scenarios, such as the weaker Mizoguchi films, would not be possible today. Also, his female characters sometimes become archetypes of unreal self-sacrifice, which also makes the scenario less appealing. To say that "Crucified Lovers" are a good movie, with such small relative weaknesses, though sometimes cool, cynical prose Ueda, the screenwriter helps to allocate this film. I still prefer and recommend Mizoguchi's "realistic" 1936 contemprars: "Osaka Elegy" and "Sisters of the Gion", as well as his late masterpieces, showing more restraint and subtlety: "Ugets", "Sansho Day" and Oharu 'Life.
