Yes, non-Singapore does not see what's on the movie. Some of the links in this movie fly directly above the head of foreign viewers, and most of the time they are Singaporean who would really get it. But I am arguing with you, strangers, look at another crap that has been torn from Singapore and compare it to this movie. It's like comparing diabetes with mule on a small diamond. This movie is the first to really show some of the strange singles - something that is the force that pretends to not exist. And in the film there is also a part where the gangster (ah-beng in our unique colloquial 'ingris') curse in 4 languages, namely Tamil English Malay and Hokkien. The truth is that most of us can and do. The sad thing is that viewers from foreign countries will have easier time to leave their greasy tiny claws on this gem in their country of origin. to him. It's nice to know that one of the best, creative, angular and original movies you've ever created will make it easier for you to get a genuine, uncensored movie. in the half of the world than in your own nation.
