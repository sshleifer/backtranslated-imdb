This is definitely Nolan's most intimate and provocative piece. Not to mention that Memento or Insomnia is bad, but it was certainly more of Hollywood standards ... while the following is more indie flick. The story is very brilliant and very well developed. Overall ... watch this if your fan of Nolan's work, I'm sure you'll be able to appreciate more.
