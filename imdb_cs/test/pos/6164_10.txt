Absolutely one of the best aviation movies of all time on many levels. The hardware junkies will drool over the biggest single mass of Spitfire flying outside the Battle of Britain. No less than eight flying spits are at your fingertips for very accurate ground and air sequences. Those who admire the tradition of flying and get foggy eyes identify themselves with respect for the central characters. freedom to be fast, free and tall in your dark blue world. Be warned: romantics and even dog lovers are treated for a very emotional ride in this movie. The main message is the one shared by many war veterinarians, in that their best hours, the time of their lives, when they felt the liveliest, were in fact during the war when everything else was sad and gray. The story concerns Czech pilots who flee their country when the Nazis attack and enter the Free Czech Squadron RAF. There are several subplots, all of which are worth attention. This is just a plain old excellent movie that even the most ardent anti-romantic hardware will love (keep Kleenex at hand). Beautiful photos, first-class acting, accurate details of RAF life during the Battle of Britain. An easy candidate for a personal collection of DVD aviation enthusiasts.
