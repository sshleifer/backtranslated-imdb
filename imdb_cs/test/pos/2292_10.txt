I agree with the guy, it's so funny, I get it all, but my friends just don't understand. Go to Japan and you'll see another movie after you are there. When I met my father's girlfriend in his house in Kanagawa. I swear I felt just like Jack. Worried but by the end of the day it was all good so I put this movie 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I watched it at least 30 times, taking it with me to watch the plane this year to Japan. One thing that is really good is the ball scene. I feel like I'm back there. This is to determine if you are interested in Japan and Baseball. Too bad they don't do the sequel. Does anyone know where the temple scenes and the argument with hirk were made in the pavement with the roof on it ???? I need to know so I can win an argumrnt with me Japanese ex-wife. thanks
