I grew up in New York and this show came at the age of four. I had a half-day nursery and in the afternoon it was on WPIX Channel 11. I loved music and stories and I remember playing them around the house when I was playing. I just saw part of the episode on YouTube and remembered for a moment how it was when I saw these shows look like a baby. Of course I stopped watching when I got to grade 1 because it was before the school got off (there were no VCRs or DVRs at the time). I grew up without realizing that the show was still in place until I was in grade 11! I also had no idea that there were DVDs and I wish my nieces and nephews were young enough to enjoy the show, but now they're all demographics or I'd buy them all to DVD. sets. This was much better than it turns out today.
