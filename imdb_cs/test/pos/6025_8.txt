The plot begins interestingly, however, until too many people die in too short a time, which will change the aspect of the thriller-secret story to defeat. The only real highlight was Adam Beach and JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who was once again their excellent self. Nice attempt with inappropriate last third, albeit good end.
