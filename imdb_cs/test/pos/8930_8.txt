Eighteen, as written and directed by Richard Bell, may have a few too many stories that could simultaneously say that the 102-minute film will succeed, but there is such a gentle sense of determination on the part of all the actors and crew that the viewer ends. wants to work - and so does it. Yes, aspects might be finessed if producers had more money to spend on the final cut, but as a small independent film from Canada this is a gentle, subtly humorous, very moving story about vulnerability and communication and determination. It works on many levels. In a very choreographic opening, we are a voyeur at a family dinner where something is going on and leads to a father and two sons who start the car and have an accident. in which one of the sons is killed. With an introduction like this mood is set for the surviving 18-year-old Pip son (Paul Anthony - looking too old for credibility as a teenager) to leave his family and live on the streets. He meets Clarke (Clarence Sponagle) a male prostitute who gives Pip food and shelter, Jenny (a very gentle Carly Pope) who rescues him from invading her colleague Derek (Ryan McDonell) and becomes romantically involved with Pip, and Father Chris ( Alan Cumming) in the subtly sympathetic role of the priest. This is Pip's 18th birthday and his father (Serge Houde) traces Pipa down to give him a gift from his late grandfather with instructions that a gift should be opened on Pip's 18th birthday. Pip, though drinking too much and full of anger, stops the tape machine, but keeps the tape and starts listening to the words of his grandfather Jason (voice of Ian McKellen), who tells his own 18th birthday in World War II. in France, where (now very sensitive actor Brendan) Fletcher has experience with a wounded paramedic named Macauley (Mark Hildreth, also excellent) and is reflected in one night wedding with cabaret singer Hannah (Thea Gill of Queer as folk fame and great singer and actress) ). for something she could live on during the war: Jason offers respect to Macauley when he dies, with a beautiful scene of redemption for two men at the end. Pipes Para and Grandfather Jason Interplay Every Time Pip listens to tape and lead Pip to eventually alter his view of life and love. Subplots include Clark's isolated existence as a fraud who is changed by Jeff (David Beazely - in a surprisingly fine film debut) who simply wants to be loved; an unexpected pregnancy between Jenny and Pip; confidently Father Chris instills both Pip and Clark in a good shepherd's manner: and by remembering the car accident where Pip could have saved his brother Daniel (Paul Dzenkiw) from a rude act at his father's hands, just before. the accident, but she could not do so, opened her deep guilt and the resulting wrong anger, which is reflected in his grandfather's recordings. Each of these subplots pulls together at the end, creating a sense of closure for all involved. There are aspects of this movie that make it a big budget production: the Bramwell Tovey musical score is featured by the Vancouver Symphony, Kevin Van Niekerk's cinematography is aptly atmospheric, and the overall quality of this Canadian cast is very good. Although Paul Anthony manages his role well, casting a very young teenager in a key role would make the job story much better, and Richard Bell, with only one other film 'Two Brothers' on his resume, gives a promise to a young talent. Despite these shortcomings, Eighteen is a useful film and deserves attention. Grady Harp
