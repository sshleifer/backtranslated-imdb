Nicely filmed, a little uneven, "Nobody" is good evening entertainment. The story is pretty simple - three yuppies get scrapped with a group of strangers at the bar and it turns out it's a lot more than what they negotiated. The deal is decent and there are a few unexpected twists. Beware of absolutely incredible (like 10 shot revolver, and 25 shot semi-automatic weapon).
