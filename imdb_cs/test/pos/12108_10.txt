Crossing the Bridge: The sound of Istanbul received one of the most astonishing applause from the audience when it ended and very deservedly. I didn't expect too much of a music documentary, but the film proved to be much more. It was also Istanbul's visual documentary with sharp contrasts of old and new, western and eastern, poor and rich, modern and traditional. Black and white photos of old Istanbul by the world-renowned Armenian photographer Ara Guler were exceptional. Of course, the main theme was music and God, what is its diversity! It was similar to the Bueno Vistas social club; the love and respect of interviewer-Alexander Hacke replacing Ray Cooder- for musicians radiated from the screen and engulfing us all. The music was very interesting. Jazz sessions of a group of Roma Roma in a small Western Turkish town set out to mind. I will not be surprised when travel agencies receive requests for group bookings for Kesan after the film is released. But most of all I loved Muzeyeny Senar, who looked stunningly elegant in some kind of burlesque way and while he shouted his "Raki", who boldly said, "My voice and I are 86 years old!" Good work by Faith Akin. I bet there are many other Turkish musicians who feel left out: Go to Volume II, please.
