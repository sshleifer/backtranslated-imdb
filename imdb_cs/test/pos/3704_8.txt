Mom must be one of the inconvenient movies to watch. It features an elderly lady you would like to have as your nanny who becomes the most beautiful mother of the f *** ing monster you ever want to meet in a dark night! This Dinner Nanny eats the entrails of a young lady on opening a movie and it just gets sick as it goes on. It seems that the cross between the dead and the brain dead comes to mind when describing your mom! Necessary for horror fans who have a stomach (if you watched a re-animator or dead brain, it will float your ship) and are willing to shut down your brain for an hour or so ... Let gore pour! ... 8/10
