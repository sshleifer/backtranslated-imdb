OK, so some plot points might be a little obvious, but over all the interesting ideas that work at the close end. Acting is fixed especially by Lachy Hulme, who plays one of the central characters in this set piece. He certainly has a presence on the screen and it is interesting to watch. He has a low budget feeling that works for a kind of thriller / horror genre Four Jacks include. The film doesn't try to take it seriously, which contributes to the overall charm. The character Phil (Dave Serrafin) must be one of the most annoying characters on the screen by Rupert Pupkin / King of Comedy. It's worth adding a DVD to the weekend.
