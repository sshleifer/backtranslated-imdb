I feel hot and cold over Carn√©. It can really be a riddle for me. I think that perhaps his inspiration left a little earlier than it was with other directors of his generation. Certainly, a man who came into adulthood in the 1930s with a popular front seems to be in the fifties in France, with his uncontrollable commercial and strong American influence. He is almost thirty years older than his young stars and shows it. The party scenes go much longer than they should, as if trying to buy time to make the anemic scenario work. Roland Lesaffre's character - playing older brother Pascal Petito - seems to exist only to assure the director that his old thoughts are still healthy. <br /> <br /> This image is too long after two hours. But let me praise Pascale Petit for her gaming performance; it was natural to invite Brigitte Bardot to the superiority of sexpot, but somehow lost her way. Andrea Parisy is also excellent as a girl who gets pregnant and wants Charrier to marry her and make her child legitimate (yes, they still thought it in the fifties). Laurent Terzieff is the only French actor who can convincingly play an anarchist: he is great here to save a cat from death, and then remarks that he cannot build cats. Jacques Charrier just reminds me how average he was as an actor, with this constant smile and those empty eyes.
