Why do I give this 1974 1974 7 points? Because I watched it. And I found it cheerful! Strangers, their strange ship, their strange helmets ... my God, that was the sight. And what these desperate alien women need is semen from the ground. And where are they looking for it? In Upper Bavaria, Germany. And here comes the main entertainment: In Europe (and more in the German-speaking countries), Bavaria is seen as a traditional and backward region. And then the actors are so helpless with extraterrestrial women. Well, there were movies about people failing to deal with women like the American Pie series. But what this film has achieved is a real, witty oddity. You are constantly thinking about how they came up with these ideas. But it was in 1974, and when I look back, it will fill nostalgia for 35 years. You've never seen such a movie. And if you don't mind looking at occasional pubic hair and boobs, watch it once. It's basically a comedy, not a porn movie.
