I saw this movie before, but I didn't remember that it was so fantastic: it has an amusing plot, Madonna mumbles around the city with bombs, etc. That cause a stir. And music is just perfect! And happy ending! Who's the girl, it's a great choice for a romance like me. In my opinion, it could be the best Madonna movie I've ever seen! 10/10
