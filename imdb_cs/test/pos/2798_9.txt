Avoiding Clich√© is one of the main achievements of this film. When you hear the vague outline of the story? Erasmus students of mixed nationality sharing an apartment in Barcelona? you are predicting a collection of euro-stereotypes in a farcical tangle. Pas du tout! In fact, it is a gently judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, who is trying to understand human relationships. There are some superbly observed minor roles (arrogant French neurologist, excruciatingly irreversible brother of an English girl, Xavier's sinister mother) and some fine visual humor, especially in the opening scenes of mocking the bureaucratic complexity of the application procedure. What does Xavier learn about relationships? Nothing positive. Place conventionally happy ending, there is a regrettably concise final about `Identity '?? Xavier became 'all the friends he created. However, this very enjoyable film deserves its great success. I saw it in Luxembourg with a mixed Euro-viewer who was very entertained at the end and even applauded.
