Hunt for Justice is about setting up Slobadon Milosevic for his trial in The Hague. Although it was a bit too clinical in presenting the subject could get very depressed very quickly. The Canadian judge, Louise Arbor, becomes chief prosecutor of war crimes at the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal in Yugoslavia. He fights everyone to extract the evidence they sent Milosevic to court. It's not a bad dock-drama with class A directorial and production work. "Evidence" was a worrying shearing discussion of facts, happy that they didn't go into too much detail and actual tortured images.
