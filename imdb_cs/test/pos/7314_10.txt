The three Stoogs were always one of the many actors I loved. I only love each of the shorts they made. I love all six Stoogs (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All shorts are cheerful and also many other great actors and actresses, many of them in many shorts! In my opinion, the Three Stoogs are one of the greatest actors ever and it's the funniest comedy team ever! One of the most beautiful jerseys of the three men is Men in Black. In this short are Bud Jamison, Jeanie Roberts, Phyllis Crane, Dell Henderson, 'Little Billy' Rhodes, Billy Gilbert and Ruth Hiatt. There are many fun scenes that I think most of the Three Stooges fans will love! In my opinion, it is one of the three different Stooges shorts. I recommend it to everyone!
