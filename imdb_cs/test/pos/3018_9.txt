When I saw this movie for the first time, I was both surprised and a little shocked by the blatant vibration of the story. It's a very artistic drama with incredible special effects, spectacular acting, not to mention the excellent work in the makeup department. Jennifer Lopez reached out of her past roles in this movie and introduced a very sensitive child psychologist working with a team of engineers to enter the mind of comatose patients to cure them. Vincent D'onofrio played incredibly well. His depiction of a sadistic serial killer was perfect for T. His overwhelming emotions, which his performance brings, are overwhelming. Vince Vaughn is not my favorite, but I'm still doing very well. Symbolism and art were interesting and captivating, sometimes surprising and sometimes shocking. All in all, it's a wonderful movie with excellent acting performance and beautiful artwork.
