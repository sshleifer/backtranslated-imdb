I recently posted on the IMDb on this series, where I got a worm mailing address on the commercial BBD arm, where it could be written on appeal. I wrote to this address and talked about Sam Waterson and his popularity. I just received the following answer: <br /> <br /> From: emilyfussell@hotmail.com Subject: Oppenheimer Date: May 14, 2006 1:44:00 PM MDT To: kk2840@earthlink.net <br /> <br Dear Kate, <br /> <br /> I work for BBFC, the British equivalent of MPAA, and we classify DVDs and videos as well as movies in this country. I am currently in the process of issuing the "Oppenheimer" mini-series in 1980. When examining the work on IMDb, I noticed your post and I thought you would like to know that the job is to be issued (that is, the need for a certificate). <br /> <br /> I don't know which company distributes it, but your eyes are peeled! <br /> <br /> Best regards <br /> <br /> Emily +++++++++++++++++ <br /> <br /> Hooray! <br /> <br /> I also want to contact Netflix to buy it. <br /> <br /> Kate Killebrew <br /> kk2840@earthlink.net I recently sent an email to the BBC to see if their amazing Oppenheimer was ever posted on video or DVD. I wasn't able to find him. I got the following answer. If you write it, remember to mention that Sam Waterston is very popular in the US. You can also enter "Oppenheimer (1980)" on amazon.com, and find a check box to apply for a release by the owner (BBC) and be notified when it is released. <br /> <br /> Kate Killebrew kk2840@earthlink.net <br /> <br /> Here's an answer from BBC: <br /> <br /> Dear Kate <br /> <br /> Thank you for your "Oppenheimer" email. <br /> <br /> I wanted to read that you would like a copy of the program you enjoyed. I checked the BBC Shop and the online retailer and couldn't find any record that it was available. We are currently unaware of the plans to release this program on DVD. However, if you would like to make a suggestion, I can suggest that you put it in writing in the commercial BBC arm: <br /> <br /> BBC Worldwide Ltd Woodlands 80 Wood Lane London W12 0TT <br /> <br /> I can thank you again for turning to the BBC. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, <br /> <br /> Elaine Hunter BBC Information ______________________________________ <br /> <br /> - ---- Original Message ----- <br /> <br / I'm trying to find a copy of the amazing BBC production "Oppenheimer", a six-part series made in 1980 with Sam Waterston from Peter Prince's Book / Screenplay, I watched his parts, then on PBS American Playhouse, but nowhere on the video. <br /> <br /> http://www.bbc.co.uk/
