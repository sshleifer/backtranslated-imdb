The man is great. its funny, original and made me laugh so much i'm almost wet my place. the day i went to go see it in the movies i wasn't in the best mood (man trouble) but leaving the movie i had a smile plastered on my face. The story is a little out there with the whole no-one noticing that it looks so much like a girl, but hey, who am I, what to say, what's believable, jokes are great and some of the one in the 2006 hit could go down in history . Amanda B. has done a great job as starring and Channing Tatum looks too good to be true, as her opposite Duke beautiful. So girls go see because of his big laugh and there is a hot guy in him and the boys u go see because you could just learn something about girls! <br /> <br /> All in all, a great, fantastic and fun movie to buy on DVD when it comes out.
