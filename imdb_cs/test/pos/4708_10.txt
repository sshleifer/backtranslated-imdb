My ex wife and I have seen and were fascinated by the trailer for this movie. We waited for it to come out, but when it didn't, it didn't stay in theaters for long. A few years later I bought it on VHS and transferred it to DVD so I can keep it. <br /> <br /> I found it very mobile. These are real events in the real country. BURMA has such a bad reputation for the political oppression he has created to change his name. <br /> <br /> I find women with little makeup to be very sexy. Patricia Arquette is in this movie. Frances McDormand and Spalding Gray are only briefly in it. After returning home she found her young son, and her husband was brutally murdered Laura (Arquette), afraid of blood. Poor feature for doctors. Her sister (McDormand) talks to her to go on holiday to Burma. While there he witnesses a peaceful demonstration and has an alienated passport. In a bold (or silly) move, he asks the tourist guide to show her something from the hiking trail. Her guide is wounded by soldiers and the rest of the film tries to get to safety. Every time I look at it, he reminds me that we in the United States are forgetting the peasant SOCIALISM, in which, at least, food is practically guaranteed, it looks good for the sacristy, well under the military rule.
