In December 1945, the train leaves Stockholm Central Station for Berlin. When it comes, there won't be much left. Not from the train and not from some passengers. It is a black comedy by director Peter Dalle who acted as if she had been playing in the 1940s and also photographed (b / w) as before. during this period. Actors had to have a lot of fun to do it. There aren't many characters as if they weren't in the 1940s, but the story is well told and everyone has timing. Deadly black and deadly witty movie. You see it if you don't think the Swedes are capable of humor.
