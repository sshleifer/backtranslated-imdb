I went to a preliminary screening of this film and thought about going for 120 minutes of trembling lines, a thoughtless conspiracy, and a kind of naughty act that made "The Postman" one of the most serious manifestations of the film's delusion. But I was shocked. Shocked to find a movie starring Costner, who appealed to the soul of the audience. Shocked that Ashton Kutcher could act in such a serious role. Shocked by the fact that the film plays in reality, it captured my own emotions. Not from 'Robin Hood' I saw this Costner: full of depth and complex emotions. It seems that Kutcher has improved the serious acting he played in "Butterfly Effect". These two actors came into this film with a serious, focused attitude that shone through what I thought was one of the best movies I saw this year. No, it's not a movie worthy of an Oscar. It's not an epic, nor a deep social commentary. Rather, it is a story about a simple topic that is illuminated in such a way that the audience reaches a higher level of empathy than would be possible. This is what I think a good film-making is and I am very impressed with this work for one. Bravo!
