While I understand that this show is too strange to please everyone, I won't get where the bad reviews come from, and I'm most surprised by the bad reviews that came from movie fans. I liked it and I'm addicted to it since the first episode I watched. It's a little messed up that Kuzco was brought to school. And it seems to be a high school rather than a college. But I think it's just eighteen, right, so it's not that he's too old to be educated? And did not the king always have the best education available to them? So "Kuzco must go, or not become emperor," it doesn't sound too much to me. And I think his education has been neglected before, so he must be educated now.
