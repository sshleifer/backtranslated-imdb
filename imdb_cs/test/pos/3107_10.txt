Ghost Walks is a clever little mystery with a big twist, elegant dialogue, and the best of all pansy played what Johnny Arthur played with the drone. Mr. Arthur is great in his role as Homer Erskine, who brings great comic relief as Broadway producer producer secretary Herman Wood, played by another great actor Richard Carl. <br /> <br /> They play great. Although acceptable words of that time sissy and creamy clouds are used to describe the character of Homer, it is never meant to be witty or intended as denigration, and are not spoken by the manly men of the movie but by his employer who detonates and re-teaches every other scene and that shows an almost irritated affection for his devoted employee. There is a great scene where Homer tells his boss that he has dedicated the best years of his life. his life to him and was everything, just the mother to him. <br /> <br /> The mysterious angle of the movie is very entertaining, and turning at the end could leave you stitched. <br /> <Br /> For a low-budget picture, this film has excellent settings and great costumes. Direc tor Frank Strayer controls his cast playfully, and this film holds much better than some of his other low budget budgets, but he had a great work scenario and some amazing actors who did it. This film is to be seen for the devotees of the films about poverty, the old secret of the dark house (in fact they were working in the lines "It was a dark and stormy night") and has a bonus for being this early representation of a gay man in a movie where nothing bad happens with them. <br /> <br /> This movie is available for download in the public domain section of the Internet Archive's film archive at archive.org.
