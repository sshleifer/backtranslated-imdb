Although this movie doesn't particularly stand out from the movie crowd, it's still a very nice movie to sit up and look with your feet up! It is possible that one or two of the bugs you catch and the movie are a bit slippery, the film itself is very enjoyable and has an amazing atmosphere. Music contributes much to the mood of the film. Acting is no less impressive (especially a dog he is!) With John Travolta taking over the lead of a fun-annoying-loving Michael. Other characters feel very original and perform very well in the film. <br /> <br /> So after a long day of work, stick "Michael" to ice cream in the evening and enjoy a high quality movie in your movie. own right :)
