This movie is great. 80 is a sleazy slasher film about three children born during an eclipse, so they kill everyone they see. The reason they kill does not make any sense, but just adds to the magic of this movie. And these kids are crazy, especially Curtis. If you saw the movie, you know what I'm talking about. The vicous boy! Although the movie doesn't have much gore, it's fun, and for some reason you're kind of caring for characters. She also has nice nudity. He has some decent playing anyway, a really decent 80's slasher movie, worth a look if you ever have a chance to see. You'll have nightmares about the damn kids, I guarantee you!
