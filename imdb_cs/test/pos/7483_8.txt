Thursday is clearly derived from the "new wave" of films about crimes released since Quentin Tarantino took the storm with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction in the early 1990s, but has enough of his own ideas to make sure he remains an interesting little movie. Thursday uses several characters mostly in one place. It works because every character is unpredictable in his own right to be unforgettable, and when you put together what you have, it's a very fun little thriller. There is very little cloth on the plot, but it doesn't matter because nobody is expecting life expectancy in this type of film. The story follows Casey; a former drug dealer who went straight and now lives with his wife as a successful suburban architect. The couple wants to adopt a baby, but things become uncomfortable when Casey comes to visit her old partner in crime, Nick, who brought a heroine case and a lot of money stolen from the cops. Thursday will be a very interesting day for our former criminal ... <br /> <br /> The first scene is filming nicely and ensures we know what to expect. We see a coffee contract that turns into a murder scene, which the perpetrators immediately cover when they come for refreshment. The scene is soaked with dark humor and humorous dialogues, and it takes place for the rest of the movie. Thursday is a very funny movie, and scenes such as those that see the admission of a visitor turn up in an annoying time to ensure that the movie is hard to dislike. It is true that the film does not bring anything new on the table, kinematically or conspiratorially, but the fact that it is glad to rejoice in its ridicule provides more time for the absurd situation to stand around the central characters. Acting is pretty decent, with the whole character enjoying the plot. Thomas Jane plays the film well in the lead role, while the funny picture by James LeGros, Paulina Porizkova, Michael Jeter, Glenn Plummer and Mickey Rourke have nicely returned it. It is unlikely that this movie will impress an experienced film fan, but if you just want a fun little movie with some fun twists and turns; It will probably be enough on Thursday.
