The film is really good, it doesn't use violence or sex, etc. To sell it like other movies, but instead uses a really decent chart (based on Michael Caine's original) and some great actors to make a fun, action movie. I enjoyed. One thing that made this movie even more enjoyable was that he had several actors I really like as Edward Norton (which I last saw at the 26th hour I also enjoyed), Jason Statham (transporter, who also enjoyed it, and Seth Green, who I think is great, his role as Shawn Fanning's roommate "The Napster" is cheerful and his hacking skills play a big part in the main ruse, which focuses on big traffic jams in LA. Car chases are really decent and high-tech equipment used by thieves is interesting and very impressive. I didn't see the original, so I can't compare it, but I liked it very much and I would recommend this movie to everyone, it's not a movie where you would like this specific genre. After this movie I felt good, had a really good ending and was overall fun to watch. I give it 8/10. Look at it!
