Worth the admission itself for the Rock-off itself! Every D fan will love this movie (though it is tad short) and portraits from John C Reilly, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Meatloaf and Dave Grohl (just recognizable) prove that D rock is tough for everyone. Even the Dio ... Sasquatch / Mushroom Scene will become a classic classic (I no longer want to say and be accused of putting spoilers here). Fans of the original HBO series will see a few nods on D's early on screen appearances in characters like Lee and open mic host. I just wish they would play a few songs from the first album and skipping the "government sucks" from the POD album is also a shame. In addition, this film rocks. Listen to D!
