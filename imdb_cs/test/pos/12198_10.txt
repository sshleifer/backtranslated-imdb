The surface is one of the largest t.v. I saw the show. Acting is great and the story is charming. Every episode could barely wait for me to watch the next one. Especially I thought Carter Jenkins, who played Miles Bennett, did a great job ... he's a very talented actor and I'm looking forward to the next job. I can't believe Surface did only one season ... the public released me again. It's hard to understand that a big show like this would be canceled while the reality show crap continues year after year. Whoever decided to cancel this show really dropped this game.
