All I can say after watching the DVD from the first season is that I can't believe NBC's "green-lighted" this show. It's so different than what's currently in vogue, for Lost. Those who miss X-Files may have a worthy successor. Not as mysterious or intense as lost, I consider it generally more fun. This kind of expanded story is hard to do. I think it might turn into a childish dribble if most of the elements didn't co-ordinate together. But cohere they do and I think the cast is excellent, writing sharp, positioning and props first speed, and special effects very good for the TV budget. Of course, it pushes what is credible, but how it never gets so stupid to insult your intelligence. Bottomline is that it's a great science fiction drama for the whole family. I doubt it's going to be a long-running classic like X-Files, but in the meantime I recommend getting a DVD if you missed it like I did the first time. This autumn my must see shows have just risen by another series! PS: I just heard he got out of the NBC axis ... Here I hope Sci-Fi will pick it up.
