The sports title seemingly better suited to Looney Tunes featurette than grisly giallo, "Don't Torture and Duckling" (1972) is nevertheless a Class A thriller by horror maestro Lucio Fulci. In this, someone was strangling preteen boys in a rural, southern Italian village, and typical of these gialli, there are many suspects. There's Barbara Bouchet (Patrizia) looking more beautiful than you've ever seen her, a rich girl hiding after a drug scandal; Florinda Bolkan (Martiara), local epileptic voodoo woman; her witch practice; Giuseppe, local idiot; a sweet priest; his dour mother; and on and on. The film contains some unusually violent sets, including chain whipping of one of the main characters in the cemetery (one of the most realistically bloody sequences I've ever seen) and a clever scream when the killer is finally exposed. The film explosion of violence compensates for the fact that we cannot talk about it. Still, this giallo fascinates, with its unusual rural background, troubling child murders, strange characters, and the strange score of Riz Ortolani. The film was beautifully photographed in what I suppose is Monte Sant'Angelo, near the Adriatic in southern Italy (at least that the city's police force is thanked in the final credits). And while subtitling would make this great looking DVD work even better (American slang not convinced in this rural Italian setting), Anchor Bay is to be thanked for another well done job. Oh ... the title will make perfect sense!
