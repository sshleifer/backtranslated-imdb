This is probably the funniest thing I've ever seen - from the beginning to the end it was the perfect timing, atmosphere, punch lines, background music, battle sequences and every other possible aspect you can think of. To be honest, I consider this movie to be funny as their sitcom (Rik & Ade) "Bottom" - maybe even more fun. I kept laughing all over the movie and I can only recommend to see this movie ... However, when you watch it without knowing (or liking it), comedy type Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson did it before, maybe you don't think it's funny. all - but I really can't understand those who don't like her - THIS IS HUMAN RESULTS !!! (People get hit with pans, guys running around wearing red rubber underwear, green vomit filling corridors, guys getting kicked in b ****** s and getting candlesticks in their eyes - how can it be funny ???) 10/10
