Easily one of the best Indian movies ever. It is true that it does not say much (I made this conclusion after an incredible 15 minutes of watching). But I can really say that Fire is also one of the really beautiful and brilliant movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Beautiful thanks to her paintings. The best example I can give is the parallelism between two leading women (Radha and Sita) and characters of the same name in Hindu mythology. For example, Sita is the wife of Honored Lord Ram. As legend goes, Ram conquers his wife by making her walk through Fire to prove her `purity '. Sita, in response, cries and leaves him, reuniting with her mother (Earth). This story has all the crazy links to the stories of two Indian women (Nandita Das and Shabana Azmi). The word "fire" suddenly has many meanings - marriage, tradition, religion, motherhood, and probably a few others that I haven't caught. Brilliant thanks to its social overtones. Many who were offended by the premise for this film should in fact be the first to see the fire (eg, the Mom who loved it). Why? Because even if the fire is an attack on tradition, it is also an attack on tradition. In other words, it is his strength, not his weakness. Traditional conservative social morals (whether Indian or Canadian or American or anything) are useless if they enslave you. Gender roles and self-denial can do both. These are the things I took after watching Fire. Deepa Mehta Hats?
