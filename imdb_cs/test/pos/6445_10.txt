I saw this movie as a child and I fell in love with it. He has a sweet, sensitive story. Something that children appreciate. I loved so much as a child I had to find for my daughter. It's definitely a movie I would watch with kids. It reminds me of a lot of stories about the nature of Disney, like Pete's Dragon and Mary Poppins. Both due to live action and cartoon features but on its premise. It's also a good story to show children that if they tell the truth they can be trusted and adults will listen to them. I think all children should see it and enjoy it. It is such a break from the violent films of bad taste, how many children are watching these days. It has all the enchanting qualities many of today's movies don't have.
