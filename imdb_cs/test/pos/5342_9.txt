Wallace & Gromit has been staying for some time, but this was their first foray into the silver screen. Fans of the British TV series, like me, were eager to see them and the movie did quite well in the theaters. Much because the movie is fun and completely original. In the world of CG movies such as SHREK and TOY STORY, this stop-motion film is a pleasant alternative to the trend in children's movies and is totally unlike cartoon movies. In addition, compared to the much older stop-motion movies (eg KING KONG and Ray Harryhausen movies as SINBAD), the quality and movement of the characters are several years better - they look very fluid, natural and more vivid. > <br /> In addition to the quality of the animation, this film also deserves to be at every other level. First, voice actors do a great job. Second, the scenario is very simple, but also very cute and enjoyable - with a few double participants who should probably go over the heads of the kids. Third, they will make it not just a children's movie, but people of all ages because the film is neither saccharin nor focused solely on the younger crowd. In particular, I was charmed by the incredibly cute movie was - and especially cute bunnies. Especially I liked the closing credits - which I was very pleased to be watching the whole movie. The bottom line is that if you are not a real wand in the mud, you will enjoy this film. It's fresh, funny and amazingly smart. I hope to see the sequel - and it says something, because I usually hate the sequel.
