[WARNING: SPOILERS INCLUDED] <br /> <br /> Written by husband and wife Wally Wolodarsky (who also directed) and Maya Forbes, this independent film is one of the better romantic comedies in recent memory. Jay Mohr takes a break from playing the smarmy of weasels to be a nice person who faces the fact that his fiancée wants to sleep other people and he also allows it. Julianne Nicholson, who was so good at "Tully," plays the spunky and vulnerable with great taste. Too bad he won't get the credit he deserves. <br /> <br /> Good support services are also extremely helpful. Lauren Graham, remembering the past "Bad Santa", plays the perfect cynical sister, Bryan Cranston (dad on "Malcolm in the Middle") gets some funny, exciting moments, and Andy Richter plays a brilliant guy who falls to a free Mother - Helen Slater in a trusted, though familiar role as a wise woman. There's some real laughter. Ed's first attempt at nonsensical sex gets some great lines, and there is a ménage trois that raises one of the most truthful reactions of man, as the man's fantasy improves. The film's assumption is not unusual, but I liked that it was Alice (Nicholson) who thought about it, much to Ed (Mohr) confusion. Because of this genre, you know that no matter how good her intentions are, Alice's plan is doomed. We see a couple working through this strange situation. Initially, Alice and Ed are on by thought, but then the human element sets it up. I appreciated Forbes and Wolodersky that it wouldn't turn into cheap sex. Yes, there is sex and nudity, but there are real emotions at work. "Other people" Alice and Ed don't want to become casual sex subjects; they also have feelings. In one case, too many feelings. It is true that some scenes have one joke too much, Richter-Slater subplot is not necessary and Alice does something really unusual. But this is forgiven because Mohr and Nicholson create such immense intimacy and honesty - look at the scenes where Ed scrambles through Alice's drawer or his reaction to her experiment termination announcement - that no matter how much we might be they could enjoy their little game, let's take root for this couple to succeed. Unfortunately, this film has received little, if any, publicity and limited edition. Hollywood studios, whose romantic comedies often turn to unjust, turgid, and surprising, would learn well from this smart and entertaining movie.
