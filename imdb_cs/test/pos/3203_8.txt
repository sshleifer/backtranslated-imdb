Killing Yard is a great movie, though sometimes uneven. Morris Chestnut makes a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and sentenced prisoner, and the presence of Alan Aldo as his advocate is none other than a genius. Emotions and raw reality depicted in the flashback scenes of this film have the ability to directly place viewers at the center of events that are displayed. I wasn't even born when the Attica rebellion took place, but thanks to extensive research, I found that "The Killing Yard" was the story of all his just judges. I would definitely recommend this film for viewing by any educational or activist group as a much needed training tool.
