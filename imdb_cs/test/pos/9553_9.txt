Rented video on a slow Saturday night. At first I thought it was funny. It took a while to get used to American cartoons (here we are more attuned to British slapstick), but very pleasant. Watch it again next night and really warm it up. The characters seemed more human - even nice. A movie that can be seen several times and get more out of it each time. But my wife * hated it. I suppose there are no tastes in humor.
