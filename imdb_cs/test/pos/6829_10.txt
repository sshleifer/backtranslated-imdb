The second episode of the new "Lost" gives you just what its fans missed - a fair amount of riveting. From the first scene you can see brand new features that you didn't expect. It's the best proof that the series that goes through its fourth season is still alive and kicking hard. Although manufacturers are not surprising at this time, returning to flashbacks is more than satisfying because it brings some shocking facts. Flashbacks will introduce a few fresh characters, and the familiar ones will come together in a surprising way. Fresh characters dominate the whole episode and I can't say it's harmful. Their parts of the script and their actors do very well, which gives us an engaging feel - right after the episode, you realize that the show really needed people like that. And here they are. "Confirmed Dead" is full of appealing actions and very written dialogues. I'm sure I'll quote the best scenes from the episode for a long time - they're just so good that they remain in the viewer's mind. The episode is fun, smart and energetic. You like "Lost", you have to watch it. My voice is ten.
