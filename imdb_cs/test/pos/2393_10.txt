I was guest of Eddie Monroe on September 30th and was pleasantly surprised by the story, great acting and talented direction. It was hard to believe that all these talents could be found in an independent film. Executive performance of Varia (Uncle Benny), Sara (Jessica Tsunis) and Morris (Eddie Monroe). The support cast was crowded with colorful and fun characters. This film reminds me of one of those movies you look at in 20 years, and you'll find that many actors have entered the star world. Just like "The Outsiders" where Tom Cruise, Emilio Estavez, Patrick Swazey, Ralph Macchio and others are. Look at Hollywood, there are new stars on the horizon and can be discovered in Little Long Island, an independent film called "Eddie Monroe". Good work!
