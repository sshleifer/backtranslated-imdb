This is not a video of the ugly Night of the demon because there is more than one. In fact, there is only one, but it multiplies. After living in Suzanne (Scream Queen Linnea Quigley), goth gives her a beautiful long kiss to Angel Angel (Amelia Kinkade). Next we see Linnea showing us her quigleys in the bathroom. She shows a lot more as Jay (Lance Fenton) thinks she's in some fun. Soon, everything will literally go to hell when bodies fall one by one and are obsessed. Judy (Cathy Podewell) and Max (Philip Tanzini) are the last two trying to escape. Max doesn't help much, letting Judy make a way out. Make-up was absolutely fantastic and the only thing that made it impossible was the extremely long construction to action. The old man (Harold Ayer), who appears at the beginning, returns to get his desserts. Linnea Quigley may be the queen of screaming, but Cathy Podewell has definitely shown the greatest lungs in this movie.
