Tent as a bullfighter and good is quite a surprise. Usually overshadowed by Oliver Hardy, this silent short allows him to take lead and limelight. One can only conclude that his character "Rhubarb Vaselino" was a parody of many Rudolph Valentino films from this era. Be prepared to laugh stupidly in some dialogue and watch out for special effects. <br /> <br /> I saw this on DVD in Vol 1 & 2 Collection.
