You have to see it to believe it. Shot in Hollywood on a strip in the middle of a slim, whatever goes into the 70s, this cheaply made film must actually actually wrap the inner city. Then I bet it took one week. Actually, it's pretty cheerful. Acting is terrible, direction non-existent, but hair, clothes, rotten for disco music and general out and out of the sleaziness story are overwhelming. Sleazy, his very slim. Highly recommended (if you find one)
