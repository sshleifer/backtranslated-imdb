This is one of the best TV productions of the musical ever. I heard the album Merman Cast, Angela Lansbury's album, which I saw live Tyne Daly, and I saw Rosalind Russell countless times. I think Bette is, if not the best, tied to the best. It captures not only bravura but also the pathos of Mama Rose. I've never been a Natalie Wood fan, so I really enjoyed Cynthia Gibb, which is her best role. Everything from costumes to suits to accompanying shows is amazing. Three strippers, always led by reliable Christine Ebersole, are hard at the top. There was supposed to be TV production Mame a few years back, with Cher, but I think Bette would be the best bet (pun intended) for Aunt Mame.
