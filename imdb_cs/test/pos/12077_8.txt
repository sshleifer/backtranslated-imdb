I still lived with my parents when they broadcast it on Dutch TV. Usually, I was the one who watched the movies saying the others didn't care. But somehow we all sat down and watched this movie. This movie was broadcast on Wednesday night. It's the story of a woman who will soon die. Before she dies, she wants to make sure that her (many) children will have the best possible parents. So we watched it and my dad (the most sensitive of the four of us) started to cry. I watched almost instantly, and my sister and mother also ripped out a long time ago. There we were, totally moved by this simple but heartbreaking story. If you want a good scream, this is the one for you!
