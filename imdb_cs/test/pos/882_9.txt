A thief is a rare breed of film - noir in his story, but nothing about the presentation. Vinay's young man, greatly played a new face raised by Dev Anand at the age of 40+, is stolen from his Dad's police officer and finds work in a jewelry store. Random people will come to him soon and call him Amar. Using only a few crushing moments, the presence of a "doppelganger" is based. Then comes Shalini (Vyjayantimala) and says she is engaged to the doppelganger. She is accompanied by her loving brother (Ashok Kumar) who is so convinced that Vinay is actually Amar he makes him take his shoe off and prove he is not Aamr, a 6 toed one. The super cute daughter jeweler Anju (Tanuja) is completely in love with Vinay. In the midst of this confusion, there is a free-lance thief, and he is stealing. We are slowly learning from Vinay's encounter with the super hot night club singer (Helen!) That the thief is the double of Amar. Many proud women (Anju Mahendru, Faryal) have many heroes. Police forces, including Vinay's father, are completely confused. Vinay slowly sinks to Shalini / Shalu and her brother blesses the union. The event moves to Sikkim, where Amar's next robbery is to appear. The rest is for you to follow - a duplicate, girls, men hanging on Vinay's every word that he thinks their boss Amar, a loving sister sister duo. Vijay Anand concluded this story in a fun way. The film has many moments that you will be wondering until they meet deliciously in the grand finale of the Sikkim Palace dance. <br /> <br /> I wasn't a big fan of Vyjayanthi, but he's quite competent here, even if he chubbiest her. She is able to add to the confusion in the story in a subtle way, but is best when she is sad or dancing. Tanuja is cute as a button and I loved her in this movie. I wanted her to marry the man. Dev was, Dev. If he didn't walk like a man with a congenital shoulder defect (one shoulder always lower than the other), I wonder who found him imitating! But his style, charm and charisma were not complete. In the song Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechar, only Dev could look cool carrying a fishing rod to which a large plastic fish was attached! Ashok Kumar was just amazing - Dada Moni didn't miss the whole movie and turned it into one for historical books. SD Burman spun magic with numbers like Baithe Hain Kya Uske Paas blood red cock imitation dance on the bar above), Aasman Ke Neeche, Rula Ke Gaya Sapna Mera, and my personal favorite seductive number Raat Akeli Hai Bujh Gaye Diye. <br /> <br /> If you want a great story, with more twists than pretzel, he wanted to be guessed, but amused and entertaining - then go buy or rent a Jewel Thief. Better to buy them, then you can go back and see it again with your friends. This is a breeder.
