The subject of this film is potentially depressing: a man of about thirty, without a job, a small education, three children from a failed relationship, living in their parents' house, but with a dream of directing feature films. But for about half an hour you realize that Mark Borchardt has an unprecedented supply of drives and ambitions - it's just that it's all directed to his need to direct movies and nothing else will hurt him. The movie skips across the emotional spectrum, but in the end you leave, feeling happy because you just met some wonderful people. Look at this - you'll want it to be longer.
