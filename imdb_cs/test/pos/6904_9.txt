If you want to see a big little horror comedy with a scary feeling it's one. If you expect blood and courage gore flick it will scare your pants off-then this is not the one for you. <br /> <br /> For the budget that this movie was shot on, music was especially amazing! Although the film was filmed on a budget, music and sound were definitely better than most of the huge budget movies! The story was really well done and the director has to be praised. In this movie, there is an almost perfect blend of comedy and horror! Acting is the highest notch and leaves room to make a sequel that I definitely hold! I have no doubt that this film will become an instant cult classic. In short, this film captures the life story of a boy who enters a career as a grave robbery. This tells the story in the flashback of each of the more fantastic experiences the robbery duo encounters. Zombies and even aliens! Our stars start out as ordinary gravediggers who steal jewelry, but they quickly become the ones trying to kill for a crazy doctor (Angus Scrim) who needs bodies for their medical practice. When a duo finds a way to send a vampire to their cruel employer, the grave thieves find that trafficking in dead corpses is far more advantageous than just stealing ordinary dead bodies. The only problem is that there is another gang called Murphy's house that competes for the same undead corpses - and that is where the gangs of burrowing graves face their heads and heads with terrible consequences. This film is one of the noblest and most interesting horror comedies I've seen over the years and reminds me of Evil Dead. Don't miss this, you'll regret it!
