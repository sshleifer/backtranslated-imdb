Well ... What to say. I think I'll start with confession. I've been screaming 4 times in my life. Once, when my father died, twice because of a high school girlfriend, and at the end of this movie. This film deals with real confrontational questions of 6 school children, which is necessarily destroying them into openness for the whole world. I've never seen a film that deals with the human emotional state as well as this one. everything from incest to incontinence is covered here and I doubt that there are many people who are safe from stabbing at least a few scenes. Begins with suicide. at 14:37. then, without knowing who it was, the story begins to be told from the beginning of the day. watches the lives of 6 school children until 2:37 pm. It is interchangeable and edited with personal interviews by 6 teenagers, allowing you to know everything about their lives. their love, hatred, dreams, desires, secrets, shame, false trust, self-control, corruption and arrogance. the overall result is a kind of "whodunnit" trying to reveal the identity of suicide before it is revealed at the end of the film. without spoiling anything, I have to inform you. you don't feel deceived by the end. contains a very important lesson. <br /> <br /> And now a warning. this movie is definitely NOT for a weak heart. Many people actually left the cinema in the middle of the road when I saw it. Disgusted by some of its contents. Or maybe it's sometimes hard to face cold hard reality. That's what high school is like for many people. I'm sure most would agree.
