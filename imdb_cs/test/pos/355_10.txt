I was a fan of Mario as long as I remember, I love the memories of playing Super Mario World as a child, this game has brought many of those memories and added something new. Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing Mario franchise. There is much very different from this game from any other Mario before it, while still keeping intact the greatest elements of Mario, the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space. The Story Starts a Lot Like any other Mario game, Mario gets a letter from Princess Peach to invite him to a party at her castle in the Kingdom of Mushrooms. Upon arrival at Peach Castle, Mario finds Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr.) attack the castle with their airship. Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and then picks up her castle into space. In the middle of the castle, which is lifted into space, Mario falls and lands on an unknown planet. Mario is found by a talking star named Luma and is taken back to Luma at home, a floating space station, here Mario meets many other Lumas and also meets their leader, a woman named Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has taken the Power Stars and scattered them all over the universe, depending on Mario to help Lum find and save Peach, and so the adventure begins. <br /> <br /> Journey You play the game by flying from a space station to other galaxies, each galaxy consisting of multiple planets that Mario travels between levels through these shooting stars to gain Power Stars. Mario can in many cases walk all the way around planets without losing gravity, some planets are small and others are big, many planets are similar to the classic Mario environment. The best thing about the game are controls, all things like jumping and such is still the same, but wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game. You will shake the distant Mario who will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game, and will also activate the shooting stars. You can also point the remote control to the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits on enemies or objects in the environment. Then there's the graphics, these are by far the best graphics on the Wii, it's so hard to describe how great this game looks like, you can probably almost say that it looks as good as some 360 ​​games. The only mild grasp is that some upside down effects get used to, and the story is too weak. The worst part is that you lose all your lives when you turn off the game, no matter how many of them you had when you last stopped in 4 lives. Still these minor issues aside is an excellent game that is very entertaining and very challenging. This is the type of game we were waiting for the Wii. <br /> <br /> Perfect 10 out of 10!
