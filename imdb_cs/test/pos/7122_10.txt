This film brilliantly captures the atmosphere of the D&D Group. I couldn't help watching, but I noticed how vividly the characters reminded me of myself and my friends to the point that they behave just like us. Including bickering, fighting, inner jokes that drove DM madness. All. It has it all. The jokes that made me cry, the action scenes I even filmed in a low budget, found that it was incredibly amazing. The story is very straightforward and not surprising, but it doesn't matter because the best part of the movie is to see characters who react and communicate with others and NPCs. Seriously, if I play D&D or some similar RPG, I can't emphasize enough, WATCH THIS MOVIE, it beautifully captured the spirit of D&D.
