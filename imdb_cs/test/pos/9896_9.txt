I just saw this film today at the Phoenix Film Festival and I loved it. The synopsis was featured in our program as "an old Shakespearean actor inviting his three children to his suicide party". I wasn't sure I would see it, because when I read about it, I liked the idea of ​​a "suicide party", which sounded very interesting to me, but the "old Shakespeare actor" worried me that the movie would be kind dry and boring. But I decided to try. I'm glad I did it. It was nothing dry and boring in the least that dialogue was great, witty and clever, but not demanding and hard to understand. Peter Falk was amazing in this role, stealing the show. I was also pleasantly surprised by Laura San Giacomo's performance, usually beats me, but I enjoyed watching her in this movie. I think a part of Judge Reinhold could have been done better by another actor, sometimes it seemed a bit cheesy, and it seemed like acting, not as if you were watching. But the movie was so good that I could forgive the embarrassment of an actor. I would recommend this film to anyone and I have already said a few people to see it as soon as it is available to the general public. Who knew suicide could be so cheerful?
