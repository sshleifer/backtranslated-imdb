I'm sorry, but I can't help it, I like watching Iron Eagle. Now don't understand me, I'm not saying it's a great movie. No, I'd rather say it's an endlessly fun movie. There is no shortage for people who have cut this film into pieces because they were not realistic. Of course, Iron Eagle's story was ridiculous. But I believe his target audience was kids, and I certainly remember being cool when I was little. Now I consider it fun as a guilty pleasure, like Road Road. This film is part of the great 80s pantheon, films for children and adults who make their living on film. You need to remember D.A.R.Y.L, Real Genius, E.T., etc. If you ask me, just watching Doug and Knotcher "Ride the Snake" at the start is worth the price of DVD. The whole sequence was so STUPID! But at the same time it was a merry, funny, absolutely eighties, all good. So finally, Iron Eagle is a great 80's of guilt pleasure. Hairstyles, dance, music, dialogue, all funny as hell. I have Iron Eagle on DVD and to me it was worth $ 9.99 at Best Buy. If you love laughter on dating, unrealistic action movies, this is visible. Yeah, and I think his conspiracy was just a little more stupid than the next top gun battle pilot of 1986, Top Gun.
