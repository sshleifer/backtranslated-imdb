I like horror movies, but I think they work better when they hide a dramatic impact (for example, the Devil's Spine, for example, the Exorcist). That's the kind of movie, and it's not just scary and frightening when it has to be, it's also really beautiful. The story of the two sisters will start really slow, so if you see ghosts in the first 20 minutes in a hurry, you will be disappointed. Actually it's not a ghost story? Although there are some. It's something more complicated, and it's like hitting Rings and The Grudge out of the ring without sweat. Story?? It is a much smarter movie than the huge cultural hits because it really takes care of its characters and the direction is flawless. Every detail in this movie won't leave you breathless if you're the kind of person who loves to pay attention to details while watching a movie. Acting is excellent, especially from stepmother and main girl. The two are worth the ticket price themselves. Do yourself a favor and watch this amazing movie.
