Hi! Since I am able to speak Cantonese, I have found it very funny and that I was able to make all the jokes that you may not get because of language barriers. Battle scenes are spectacular and it's a good movie. But I have criticism. First, I find it not as good as the first Project A-GO and DISPLAY THAT ALSO! :-) The reason is, SPOILERS AHEAD-DO NOT READ OUT WHEN THE FILM DOES NOT SHOW !!!!! the man he sent to kill, Sanpao. That's what they're trying to do the whole movie and the showdown is spectacular. But in A II, although he fights Chan, the showdown scene between Jackie and his nemesis is not long enough and most action is against Empress men. They are not nearly as "bad" and have played only a small part in the film in relation to Jackie, although their fighting sequence is spectacular, it is not Jackie who hunts throughout the film, leaving the viewer slightly unfilled. However, this is just my humble opinion, so take that word for word-go and see for yourself! It's a great movie in its own right! Watch out and hope your admiration for Jackie is growing! Sincerely, Iane PS. Do you know the police chief in A II? He's the same guy in First Strike-to know he's still strong!
