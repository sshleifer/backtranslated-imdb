My favorite movie this year. Great characters and plot, direction and editing were smooth, visually beautiful and interesting. The film, which takes place in Barcelona, ​​follows the year in the life of six foreign graduate students and others. Cultures and languages ​​clash, but the hearts and lives blend together. The leading role would never be cast in Hollywood, but it was perfectly carried. The characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate. There were two particularly noteworthy scenes, the peak was really inspired. The film is sentimental and the last ten minutes could be shortened, but it was amazingly fun. I wasn't looking at it almost, but I just saw Audrey Tautou. Her role, even if she was billed second or third, was smaller and was overshadowed by several other characters. I wish more movies like that. It brought the Big Chill or The Breakfast Club to mind. Don't start this movie late if you plan to go to bed 1/2 way through.
