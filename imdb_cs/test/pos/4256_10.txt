If you manage to get to this lost (for many years) gem, I doubt you will be disappointed. PS has a strange blend of social satire and ultra-light blaxploitation - even hints of slapstick, but it's so strange that it wasn't just a while ago, nothing like that since then. I strongly disagree with the people who say the movie is dated, especially with Spike Lee "Bamboozaled" (SP?) A few years back, which was an omission to capture the same message. (Good filmmaking, disjointed scenario.) Robert Downy's director is brilliant, allowing many of his actors to improvise, the film becoming better as it goes, and jokes roam from hits or misses that returning. They are just as forgiven as those who are in the comedy Mel Brooks, to the sheer non-PC 'I can't believe they just said they' fun. <br /> <br /> Favorites, Ads. The film goes from the bold black and white display of an advertising agency to a beautiful (maybe 16mm) color and gets away from it. <br /> <br /> I refuse to suggest any spoilers, but if you have a chance to see the DVD version, be sure to check out Downey (but keep it until the end of the movie.) <br /> <br /> My vote 10/10 - the most underrated film from the late 1960s, the early 1970s. Thank you Prince.
