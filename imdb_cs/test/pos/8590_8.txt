The story of how the (Communist) leader who liberated Congo from Belgian imperialism was removed by Western powers through the hands of Mobutu. The story of struggle and injustice, hope and the search for freedom. The story could be in every African country. A very moving movie with images full of symbolism and beauty. If you only see one foreign film this year, check out this one.
