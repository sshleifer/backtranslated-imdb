Apartmente'L is one of the most interesting movies I've ever seen. I experienced extreme frustration as I watched this movie when I shot to join these two guides. That never happened, which disappointed me. But the end gives an even more cynical character to a generally cynical film. It is not a movie that people can play, but the watch itself will have a profound impact on people. Since then, I have not overwhelmed the film and I do not think I will. The story follows the experiences of a man, Max, who is committed to Muriel. She remembers her old friend Lisa (she considers her love of her life) when she listens to Lisa talking on the phone. So he's trying to find Lisa. Here begins his extremely frustrating search for Lisa. There are many layers of this film. There are undercurrents of jealousy, vouyeurism and so on. There is also another character called Alice who is involved in all the confusion. The film then moves through a series of twists and ends in an end that could be interpreted in many ways. It's fascinating how this movie has only four main characters, but clever writing makes it interesting and unique. What I love is that the film of obsession, jealousy is done with such a light heart. It has a very fast pace, which is probably why it can reach a large audience. The main character, Max, has shades of gray and I felt the end was perfect. I don't think it should be a clean character, because he's looking for his long lost love when he's busy, and he's also flirting with Alice. even worse. Her manipulation and her compulsive lying can really irritate the audience (that's probably the point, I think). The scene where it breaks up before Lucien really shows another aspect of her character. It shows the party that wants to be accepted and is tired of all lies and games and wants to lead a normal life. Finally, he understands that he must get away from everything. The end lends a cynical touch. Because Max's love for Alice seems to be temporary and false. It's like saying that love in general is a temporary emotion and it is better to choose a safe choice (ie Muriel) than to pursue something that is so fleeting (ie Lisa or Alice). In many ways it is not really a romantic movie, but a satire about romance (in a way). The performance deserves high praise. Vincent Cassel as Max gives great performance. She perfectly portrays the confusion of a man who is unsure of his engagement. Its geeky look is another advantage because it fits perfectly into the character. But the real star of the movie is Romane Bohringer as Alice. Her nuanced depiction of a woman who is jealous of Alice and in love with Max. The scene she screams "I am too" really shows her despair and the desire to live a normal life with a man who loves her. Btw I also thought that lesbianism is another interpretation that may be from this movie. Alice's activities can be explained in many ways. And her disproportionate obsession with Lisa can also be explained as a manifestation of lesbian desire. It may be far-appealing to consider encouraging Lisa to forgive her present friend. But I had the feeling that it was a long time lesbian. He also avoids Lisa's questions about a friend. She spends a lot of time with Lisa and is happy during that time. This can lead much to the question of her sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> 9/10 overall. I think they deserve it, but I subtracted one because it was a reassessment factor. I think it's a perfect movie differently.
