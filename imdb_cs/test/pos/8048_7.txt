Epic early film, directed by D.W. Griffith. Mae Marsh, her little sister, and their dogs are orphaned - they must go to live with their uncle. On board their trainer is a young couple, Lillian Gish and Robert Harron, who celebrate the birth of their first child. The coach is coming to Elderbush Gluch. Uncle Marsh tells her she can't keep the dogs and they're out. There are Indians (Native Americans) nearby; and Indians love to eat dog meat (no fun?). These Indians are hungry! Lionel Barrymore is sympathetic to Mrs. Marsh, who wants to help her return to escaped dogs. While saving puppies, the Indian is shot, resulting in a confrontation of "Cowboys vs. Indians". however, reliable Griffith artists begin to replay their hands, and the story is too fanciful. Many Griffith elements are in place - something good and a few bad ones. "The Battle of Elderbush Gluch" predicts the later epic, "Nation of the Nation". ******* Battle of Elderbush Gulch (3/28/14) D.W. Griffith ~ Mae Marsh, Robert Harron, Lillian Gish
