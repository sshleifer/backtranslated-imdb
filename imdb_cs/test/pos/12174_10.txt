The two main characters Erkan and Stefan are Munich's comedy act. I wonder if this is one of these typical grotesque movies, where the story is either not important or simply does not exist. But when I saw this movie, I was very glad that there is a great story and the main characters really fit into it. <br /> <br /> A very entertaining and not ordinary German movie in general.
