I thought the movie was good, but I'd like to read the real story behind the "real story" movies. Does anyone know the names and locations of the real characters on which the film is based? I did a complete search on the internet and I can't find any information about this case. All I get is film information and the fact that it is based on a "true story". I find it difficult to believe that a judge would change his judgment delivered immediately in the courtroom, even after his brother's heartfelt speech (wonderful John Corbett), but overall the story was very gripping. If anyone knows the real "real story", I would appreciate that you share it!
