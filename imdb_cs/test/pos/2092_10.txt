To be perfectly honest, I didn't expect to get into the 9 Souls even after reading the heap on a pile of praise that was reinforced on it, but to say that I was surprised would be a great understatement, I was totally blown away. The basic plot is as easy as it comes, nine prison prisoners ranging from drug offenders to multiple jailbreaks and go looking for a secret hideaway that is believed to be the tenth forgery. an inmate who broke and was dragged away by guards shortly before their escape, but it's the direction director Toshiaki Toyoda takes this simple story that is so great and original, perfectly blending drama, comedy and violence that truly creates one of the kind movies that deserves to be seen. not only fans of Asian cinema, but also cinema in general. Well done, emotional, entertaining, violent and sometimes very unreal, that's a movie that has it all.
