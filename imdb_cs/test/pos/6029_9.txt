This movie is a bit slow at the beginning, about the first 10 minutes. But once it kicks, you can't turn it off. Adam Beach and Rose McGowan play the best parts and are great at their acting. You could never guess who the killer was. I gave this movie 9 because on some parts Adam Beach needs to talk a little so you can hear what it says. 9/10
