This production of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, is by far the best I've seen. Although it may not have the production value of some newer adaptations, it has the most important element: Sir Derek Jacobi as Hamlet. . His manifestations of emotion swing from hatred to grief, love for vengeance, and elsewhere on the map, but without apparent enforcement. In fact, some of the stronger sequences occur when they cheat them, with calm, soft speech, and thoughtful expression. As to whether he interprets Hamlet as mad or healthy ... well, you should decide for yourself; I've changed my mind more than once. At one point he seems to think he is sensible and just playing madness, but he suspects he's actually upset after all ... a revelation to himself, beautifully captured. After Jacobi performed a part of Hamlet on stage more than any other actor in history, Jacobi's affinity with the role is such a small surprise. a film copy of a "play, with little special effects or fantastic camera work, a minimal set and no musical accompaniment." This production relies on the cast's prowess of cast, and Shakespeare's words, to evoke the emotions and interest of his audience. And it works. Other players are also top players, especially "Claudius" Patrick Stewart and "Gertrude" Claire Bloom. Together the cast represents a seamless file. <br /> <br /> The final (but by far the smallest) feature that makes this production is the game itself. Here is presented in full, rarity on film. But strangely enough, I didn't notice at the time. I was too busy getting into the story. I think you too.
