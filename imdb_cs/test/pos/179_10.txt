Goldrush: Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great TV movie for all ages. The film focuses on "Fizzy" (Alyssa Milano), who wants to go on a quest for gold in Alaska. The only person hiring her is Pierce Thomas Madison (Bruce Campbell). What comes next is an adventure he will never forget. This TV movie was just great. Acting is # 1 (especially Bruce Campbell and Alyssa Milano) and I've also learned some information about Goldrush. I recommend this TV movie to everyone without hesitation. It is also based on a true story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
