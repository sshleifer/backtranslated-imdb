Joe (Wes) & Jim (Adam) will re-introduce us to beauty, isolation (psychological and physical) and the utter horror of "most hen murder" in southwest Nava. Characterization, settings, and rendering are constantly being created. though occasionally they let us want "more" ... with some interesting alternative choices like "who did it?" Flashes (such as Peter Fonda... Good to see him) provide clues, but don't go where you think. Comic asides (eg Preacher) are mild and appropriate. Where "Skinwalkers" and "Coyote Waits" begin to pull ... "Thief" occupies the clutch and quads around the next corner, never quite sure what's there. I disagree with Joe Leaphorn's manic commentary on Jim Chee to "slow down" for potholes. Bad ... there are no potholes on the property, just the tracks that follow. For the next episode! Great photo (as always), attractive characters and more to explore!
