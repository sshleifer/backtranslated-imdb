More than 21 movie versions of Ruth Gordon, who described her marriage experience with Garson Kanin after retiring, Irene Dunne with one of her better roles on the big screen. It is also in line with what was then a favorable spirit in America about how we should not ease peace as we did in the First World War and sow the seeds of another global conflict. Ruth Gordon wrote and played, running 221 shows on Broadway in 1944, and was limited to the bungalow Gordon and Harvey Stephens, the male leader, had at the training base. If you look at the Broadway Credits list, he says the production was "staged" by George S. Kaufman, unlike the director. I'm not sure of the difference, but I can imagine that with a joke and as strong as Kaufman, it must have been an interesting time when production began before the night was opened. When Columbia bought Sidney Buchman, he had to make some major reconstruction of the scenarios to move the action behind the bungalow. The film carries very few tracks from its stage. Alexander Knox plays husband and Charles Coburn, employer Dunne and Knox, who are writers. Knox studied not only the editor but also the columnists. His words and thoughts help sell paper, and Coburn is in custody. But Knox feels he has to get into war, a key event of his time, to authoritatively talk about what kind of war world he wants. This was not an unusual topic in these years. Irene Dunne has several good comic moments she had when she appeared opposite Cary Grant. In fact, Garson Kanin ordered both of them in my favorite wife a few years ago. Coburn is his usual crazy old water buffalo boss, who ultimately has a good heart. For over 21 years, it has been an optimistic picture that sadly said it was not exactly what allies and I all think. peace conferences to create a better world. Hopefully the new generation can do it right.
