Ronald Colman plays the prodigal son. While he is not a bad person, he is a little powerful and has not done much work with another life than traveling the world and having a cheerful time. Now that his last venture in Africa has failed, he's on his way home to England. His wealthy upper-class father plans to throw him on his ear, though thanks to Ronald's winning style, he is reluctantly greeted back with open arms. At this point, there are two women in his life. -showgirl Myrna Loy and rich girl Loretta Young (who is already engaged). How it all works and Ronald will wisely act and act as a responsible adult - these are the main themes of this nice little movie. This is not a great movie and will definitely not change your life, but it is definitely very fun and fun. Most of it is because of Ronald Colman's brilliant acting. Damn, in the heyday of his career in the 1930s, he could have played in REEFER MADNESS or some other dreck and still made it amusing and sympathetic due to his charming personality. His seemingly carefree style in this movie is very easy to enjoy and it's easy to see why both Loretta Young and Myrna Loy are in love with the movie! In addition, writing is very funny and makes it a nice romantic comedy.
