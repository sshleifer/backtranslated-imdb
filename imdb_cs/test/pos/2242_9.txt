Okay, so there was a strange hole on the plot that you could drive with zeppelin, but how well did emotional things be treated? It would be so easy to descend into cheesiness, but the writer pulled it out. The image of a former female cyberman who screamed sounds when she saw her reflection after regaining her emotions is the one who will stay with me forever. It is twice now the monsters have shown the soft side and were introduced flotically sympathetically, the previous being the last Dalek from the series one, but Jove it worked. Add to this another ex-female who has been "upgraded" on the eve of her wedding, and Jackie Tyler will recognize her husband after she has become "cybernetic" and have a permanent lump. Hold it!
