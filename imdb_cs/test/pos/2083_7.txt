At the age of 30 to 51, when he died of a brain tumor, Zachary Scott made 70 films. He was introduced in 1944 in Jean Negulesco's 'Mask Dimitrios', where he played Dimitrios. The next year, 1945, he made three movies, of which this is one. He is best remembered cineastes as star Jean Renoir's 'Southerner', one of the 1945 movies, where he had a likeable role. However, he often played scary characters and in this film he is the sociopathic murderer of women for money. So what's going on? He lives in a house with three women, so be careful! Faye Emerson, who also appeared in 'Dimitrios', plays two older daughters in the house. She falls in love with Scott and secretly deals. Then her younger sister, a "cute baby" (effectively playing Mona Freeman who resembles Bonita Granville both in appearance and behavior), returns from boarding school and reveals in an interview with Scott that she inherited a neat sum, so Scott turns his sights instead of with all the jealous jealousies that had penetrated the house, which had to be awakened. Things stretch and then stretch. Meanwhile, the plans for murder continue in Scott's mind. But it turned out to be not the only one with such intentions. He is also sought as a result of his last kill, with which the film opened, so that we know his back story. James Wong Howe gives this story effective noirish cinematography, directed by Frenchman Robert Florey, who moved to Hollywood sometime before. The film is an effective secret to a psychopath-in-the-house that can cause some of the edge wear of some seats for those who are inclined.
