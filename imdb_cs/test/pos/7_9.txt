Our family (and the whole sold-out spectacle) enjoyed "The Guardian". Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher have given compelling performance as a fictitious helicopter to save the swimmer's characters Ben and Jake. After seeing this movie, you can't help but imagine how difficult it has to be to go to the USCG's Rescue Boat School and take part in real rescues one day. Although it is a fictional film, it has given somewhat compelling virtues to team spirit, dedication and bravery exposed by all members of the current US Coast Guard. <br /> <br /> The special effects used to create rescue scenes were incredible. Actually, you felt like you were in a real rescue. I feel that the film could have been made without the "Hollywood" bar scene (if you see the movie, you can agree) because the real Coast Guard movie doesn't justify it. Very fun, very actionable, definitely worth seeing. Thank you, U. S. Coast Guard and REAL helicopter rescuers swimmers, "So Others Can Live". I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
