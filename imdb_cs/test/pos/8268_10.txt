When I knew and loved this book from the age of eleven, I was terrified to see it coming as a film - what if they were doing a terrible mess? In case I don't have to worry. They were all very well occupied and the acting was amazing, very well following the story, with the exception of the strange addition of a prison scene that didn't bring me anything at all. However, it is really the most beautiful love story and I'm so glad I was shooting it so I can watch it again and again. My only gripe is - why didn't they give Kester a green vest "that made him such a personal man"? Such a simple thing when they went to so many problems for everything else. If you have a chance, look, it's great.
