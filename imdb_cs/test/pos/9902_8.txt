"Control" is a very funny and sincere portrayal of a bizarre family that becomes Jewish. Judaism plays no role in the film, but American Jewish culture and behavior is being broadcast ... it's a loving way. I wish the film looked at a religious perspective on topics that it explores because I think it would be interesting. I've never been a Columbo fan, so I wasn't familiar with Peter Falke - it's a lot of fun to watch. It's great to see referees Reinhold, Laura San Giacomo and David Paymer again - why aren't they working more? Everyone is happy. The script is amazing with many unforgettable disposable pads that I will definitely use with my own family. Watch Gavin McLeod (Captain Stubing) as a doorman.
