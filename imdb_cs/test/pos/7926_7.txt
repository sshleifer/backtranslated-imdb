That was Eisenstein's first completed project in more than a decade. The film takes place in the 13th century when the Germans invaded the Russians (I think German Knights). Released in 1938, it is a very loose concurrence with the approaching Russian engagement in World War II and the advance of Germany to Eastern Europe. There are some incredible scenes, the most remarkable battle at the end of the movie, and there is a shock when kids are thrown into a pit of fire, but its not an easy watch. The film pulls and is not as consistently brilliant as "Potemkin" or "Ivan the Terrible". Sometimes Eisenstein is better in clips. His brilliance is present, however, and his "must see" for fans of Eisenstein and film historians. Russian propaganda at its best.
