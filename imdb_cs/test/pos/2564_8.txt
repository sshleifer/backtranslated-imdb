Black Snake Moan is angry. It's overly rich, fantastically organized, weird and cumbersome, unique and visionary. In the following Hustle and Flow, Brewer paints his portrait of the American South almost as a mythological land one would expect to see in Fantasy or Ancient Greece epic. And yet, as his films move above us, they are still rooted; rooted in the deepest and darkest soil is. As in traditional fairy tales, Brewer paints his portrait in Black Snake Moan using extremes and exaggerations. Sharp and rigid character traits when associated with such extreme actions as attaching a half-naked white girl to a radiator in an attempt to redeem her from her sins, exaggerating and emphasizing the metaphor in the same way as extreme visual techniques such as some characters who have color in Pleasantville strengthened the metaphor in that fabulous film. But Brewer won't start his movie with "once upon a time"; in this film and also in Hustle & Flow, Brewer is another fairy tale; dark, gothic fable about sex, prostitution and ultimately redemption. These topics go through the veins of the film like blood and resonate and bloom in their dark, tense environment. But despite these cruel extremes, Brewer treats his characters as humans, and creates extremely well-executed, three-dimensional characterizations in Lazarus and Rae, especially emphasized by their relationships with Lazer's friend at the pharmacy, Angela and mother Rae. Acting is all-round perfect. One feels that Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson were born to play these roles. Their characterization is so intense and so severe; It's a challenge for actors to keep their heads and craft realistic characters. And they will succeed admirably. Especially Samuel L. Jackson disappears into his character, which serves as a polar opposite to most of the characters he has played before. With movies like Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Shaft, and others, he has created for himself the type of "ultimate bad-ass" broadcast. In Black Snake, Moan Jackson plays an old, broken, defeated, and earthy character who is unlike anything he did. And frankly, it's just fantastic. But what is surprising is Justin Timberlake's casting, and more specifically the fact that he meets him as quite acceptable. Of course, he doesn't have much time to show, but just like what Brewer did with Horror in Hustle & Flow, he actually gets Timberlake to act and do what he has to do, and he didn't find him totally unconvincing and irritating. > <br /> But what's so incredibly great about the movie is the atmosphere Brewer creates. Rural southern locations work to create a dark, filthy, filthy, crunchy, rough texture of the film, which fits more than the thematic and metaphorical aspects of the film. And by using all kinds of elements, such as the growing sound of cicadas when Rae gets itchy, or a raging storm that grows and gets stronger when Lazarus plays his blues number "Black Snake Moan" for Rae, Brewer really does create an almost fantasy world , undermined mythology to the rural southern environment. And it works so absolutely fantastic to create a unique Brewer's vision. And we can't talk about Craig Brewer without mentioning music. In Hustle & Flow he used the soundtrack of down-and-dirty, street-wise hip-hop music to emphasize the atmosphere and vision. In this film, music works even better in polishing and fully represents a unique atmosphere. It's a country blues soundtrack, but it's the dirtiest, most beautiful, coolest blues you've ever heard. And that sounds absolutely fantastic. Overall, this film was a simple story of an old, broken, lonely, godly black blues singer who redeemed a young white woman who was sexually abused as a child and now suffers from nymphomania, about too much to write. But this movie is not about conspiracy, not even about the characters as well as they are created in the movie no matter what. No, this movie is about vision? and what a unique vision it is! It's about the atmosphere, mythology, the environment. It's about anger, fear, redemption and, most importantly, blues. And it's all wrapped up in a unique, fun, stylized and perfect ribbon. Brewer has secured a place on the most promising list of directors, and with such solid continuity with the great Hustle & Flow debut, he will be on my radar for future projects. It should also be mentioned that the film has one of the most amazing titles I've ever heard.
