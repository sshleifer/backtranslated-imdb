I'm a college student and I bought this movie in a book store because it sounded really fun. Nothing would prepare me for what FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER MADE would be! It is especially good to see if you are an atheist like me. Because then you can see how stupid these Christian people are. He seems to think that unbelievers like to live in truly disgusting, chaotic houses and do nothing but drink beer and be for neighbors. It's LAUGH RIOT! My friends and I watch it every few weeks so we can talk about our wildest imagination! Let's look at this movie Now! Hopefully Rich Christiano makes these films even more fun!
