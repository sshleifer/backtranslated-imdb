That was one of the few exhibitions we and my wife agreed. I was upset when I heard it was canceled, especially since I didn't realize that the rating was so bad. If I knew it was doing very well with many viewers. Almost all my friends and most of the people I talked to watched the show. Now we're stuck watching crappy shows or DVDs. How bad was the show? does anyone know the real results of the shows? I know when it went to Thursday it was harder for me to catch. Thank you G * d for DVR! Anyway, it was a real surprise when I knew there wouldn't be a "home war" anymore. If you see other networks, PLEASE PLAY SHOW !!!! PLEASE!
