Not for the commotion, but the number of twists, the inventive use of vampire mythology situations, wonderful visual extremes, along with interesting and unpredictable characters, make this movie one of the most amazing horror movies I've ever seen. He descends into the characters with complete insanity, but never seems to be exploitative or frightening without purpose. There are abundant amounts of carnage accompanied by some ugly sucking and squishing sounds, but also subtle moments where to laugh out loud. As he tends to do, Chan-wook Park keeps you out of the center with jumps in time and plot and the situation that you have to fill in for yourself to force your involvement in the story and characters. And there is a lot of literal leap. Keeping a vampire myth in the vein (a wordplay intended), they have superhuman strength and can almost jump a tall building in one bound (to the phrase coin). For the first time, our heroine is carried across the tops of the buildings by a troubled vampire priest, has all the magical romances of Lois Lane and Superman - but this romance is becoming increasingly troubling - but driven by a strange and conflicting "love affair" not just horror. Acting is excellent, especially OK-vin Kim, a gorgeous actress in a female lead role that at 22 shows the range that is remarkable. The character borders on the black widowed noir film. She cares from the innocent to blame the demon for a fake crime with total conviction. This is really smooth and nervous performance. <br /> <br /> If you love real art in horror, or if you are an Oldboy fan - don't wait for a video, you'll see it right away.
