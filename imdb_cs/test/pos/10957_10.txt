It should be noted that this film was not "improvised" (as you probably think about it), over what the title at the end suggests. The film was heavily written and rehearsed - Cassavetes did not have enough money to support the inevitably high cost of an "improvisation" film, even though he wanted to make something like that. "Improvisation" of the film is contained in performances of actors and emotions that draw on the lines. It allows me to say that it is a stunning job I will definitely be back again and again. The deep emotions Cassavetes can make of the smallest gestures and interactions is incredible. I have no idea how he managed to manage such amazing performances from actors, especially under the conditions he worked. This is a truly spectacular landmark movie that I would recommend to anyone interested in discovering Hollywood.
