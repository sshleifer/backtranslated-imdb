Mary Pickford stars Annie Rooney - a cop daughter who lives in a heavy part of the city. She is a rough young lady of indeterminate age (somewhere between 12 and 16 years old) who loves scrap, but deeply has a heart of gold. This is a very typical movie style for Mary Pickford. Like many of her films, a young girl plays, even though she was almost 40 years old when she did LITTLE ANNIE ROONEY. And like many other stories, she was ruthless and courageous. As a result, I had a strong sense of déjà vu. If you haven't seen her other movies, it's not a problem. However, she is basically playing the character a lot like the one in SPARROWS or DADDY LONG LEGS - although these two other movies are much better. Now that doesn't mean it's a bad movie - just that it's definitely not among her best work - mostly because of a rather "schmaltzy" story that is very hard on sentiment but not particularly convincing. Fun, but not necessary viewing if you're not a big fan of silence.
