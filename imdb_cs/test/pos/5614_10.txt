As you can say from a few comments posted here - mine may be the very last thing you see if there is no big DVD-release or TCM is playing again! - This is our "gang" movie with a bunch of different kids. Certainly MGM WAS was a music studio - if the musicians, dancers and singers were not on the contract, they were at the tap. Heifetz was one of the most expensive ..... who does it for little charity work !!! The fee he received at the time was unheard of. Another musical film with Josep Iturbi (Mexican pianist) featured about 100 children playing some simple melody on 100 pianos ...... so there are those skeptics who think little kids are not musical, wrong: I was one. <br /> <br /> As everyone writes, "Frankie Smith" - a good American name - (Gene Reynolds) was a bad but good guy who is taken to the streets by a music school owner. Can you believe that Walter Brennan ("Prof. Lawson") of all those western movies was the man who was driving the school? Joel McCrea ("Peter McCarthy") and Andrea Leeds ("Ann Lawson") were the bigger stars in "They'll Have Music", with a number of well-known extras (many of whom became stars in their own rights). As others have said, almost all children in the orchestra (actually The Meremblum Symphony from Los Angeles) have made great successes in their lives, whether as musicians (for studios) or other businesses. Sadly, many young people's orchestras today are not a sad mistake. Parents with children at school are usually so busy trying to keep their heads above water, and many don't even know what's going on with the kids at school. Music lessons can be expensive and almost everyone would have a football team ..... <br /> <br /> This is the cheapest Jascha Heifetz concert you ever hear is included in this movie. .... in those days, a quarter. His game is great, though he seems to be somewhere else ... without emotion. Under the contract, every Yo-Yo Ma concert is so joyful you want to run now and buy a cello ..... this guy has a good time .... like the kids on the "street" concert when they played Heifetz play in your school. All orchestral numbers played "kids" and that's easy. I love this type of movie - their charts are so simple, they don't take you two days to see if you like it - or understand - the movie. We need some new movies like this - can do nothing but inspire younger kids to play other instruments than guitars ....... Bravo!
