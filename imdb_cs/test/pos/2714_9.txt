I watched this movie at the Singapore Theater yesterday (February 4, 2006) and left with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved ones are going through. Mrs. Aparna Sen must be congratulations not only on the difficult subject, but also on the treatment of the mentally disabled with a deep understanding of their troubles, which is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucination and storms of turbulent storms in their minds. We had Hollywood movies on this subject such as "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" where Jack Nicholson took away honors. Since then, research has helped provide more insight into the problem and clarify some misconceptions about treatment. In "... the cuckoo's nest," for example, shock therapy was depicted as barbaric, but in "15 ..." it was said that it was not as bad as it was done. Another misconception is that childhood abuse is the cause of schizophrenia. Scholars such as Dr. E. Fuller Torrey stressed that studies have shown that schizophrenia in childhood is a brain disease and is believed to have some genetic roots. It is now proven that schizophrenia can be treated as any clinical disease and its procedure can be checked if it is detected in time. Even at relatively advanced stages, effective medication and counseling can be effective. The same understanding that Mrs. Sen says is evident in the way actors play their parts. In line with the gravity of the subject, the discussion is controlled everywhere, along with Mrs. Konkana Sen-Sharma's evocative silence and eyes reflecting the helpless confusion of a disturbed mind that speaks louder than some of the reproaches we are used to in most films that have included mentally handicapped characters. Like me, most of the audience in the theater looked confused at the sharp end. This leaves many questions hanging when it comes to conspiracy. Does Meethi Search End? Why isn't she in No. 15? Were the children really played when Meethi walked past the gates with glittering eyes? Can anyone solve this puzzle?
