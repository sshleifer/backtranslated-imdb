The interaction between Portman and Sarandon was quite interesting and I was really being sold on a mother-daughter relationship. It is a family story that is not based on ornaments and special effects; The story of how it really is. I couldn't help but give up at the end of this movie, but unfortunately it's a bitter story of adolescence and relationship with family and friends. Acting was pretty beautiful and I hope to see both Portman and Sarandon in the famous roles on the road ...
