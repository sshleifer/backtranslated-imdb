This is a movie you have to see. You will laugh, you will cry, and when you end up, you will want more. Well written and persuasive, this film pulls you in and holds tight. The cast was perfect, the figures were efficient and the performances were excellent. "Nanny" is the standard to which all women should adhere: strong, forgiving, protective and never condemning. "Nanny" is the embodiment of what a Christian mother and a woman should be: a true pillar of the community. If I were half a woman nanny, I might think I was doing well. I would have been devastated if "Nanny" had died at some point in the movie, but since I didn't get to the DVD, I would definitely buy it. I can only hope that the story will continue and that Ruben will return to Lackawanny to try to rebuild the town, piece by piece and personally.
