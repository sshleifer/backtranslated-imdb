The best years of our lives perfectly capture the era of my youth and feelings of that time. The cast was just as beautiful. It was perhaps the best role of Dana Andrews in his career and was also to be nominated for an Oscar. There are so many beautiful scenes in this movie that it's almost impossible to list them all. The film is one of the best films. This film is a time capsule of what was in the 1940s. Must see a movie for all the real movie fan. Some critics said the film was getting older. I disagree. The theme of human desires is timeless. And the obstacles faced by veterans returning from war will always be with us. That's just a great movie - one that can be watched over and over again.
