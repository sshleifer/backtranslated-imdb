After seeing 'oh so acclaimed' Fargo and thinking it was nothing more than average, I wandered if it was good to rent another Coen masterpiece. This time I was much less disappointed than I was with Fargo and I have to say that most of what he can do goes to the good jokes and good acting of George Clooney. Well done by Mr. Clooney, earn more and less "Perfect Stormish" movies. You can act and show it here. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
