As the 1970s approached, rumors of the possible return of Sean Connery to the role he made famous in 1962 - James Bond - began to fly in the entertainment industry. Cubby Broccoli was asked locally in Brazil while making 'Moonraker' BBC Barry Norman as he viewed the prospects. Of course, the producer was reluctant to commit himself to the opinion. When 'Moonraker' opened, Bond fans were outraged by what they perceived as cheaper figures and jumping to the star of the War Car much like 'Live & Let Die' did with blaxploitation madness a few years ago. Many have publicly expressed their hope that Connery will return only to show what the real Bond movie should look like. Years of legal battles followed. The original "James Bond Of The Secret Service" script was written by Kevin McClory, Len Deighton and Connery, has never been filmed and remains one of the biggest movie blockbusters. The new script, closer to the Thunderball story, has been ordered. It was written by Lorenzo Semple Junior, best known as the man who gave the camp to Batman. He also wrote 'Parallax View', one of the best decades of plot thrillers. He felt that the script needed a British touch, Connery brought Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, the hit writer of the British sitcoms "The Likely Lads" and "Porridge". The funny title was designed by Connery's wife, Micheline. 'Never Say Never' Opened Just Before Christmas 1983 Into a Critical Praise Shower; normally rational critics were so enthusiastic about Connery's return they ignored all other aspects of the film. Many used it to harshly attack the Roger Moore series, particularly that year's 'Octopussy'. In fact, Octopussy is better in all respects. 'Never' lacks the excitement and spectacle that man associates with Bond, sometimes it looks like it's for TV. film. The story was done earlier and better in 1965's 'Thunderball', hence 'never' always the second best. It was also hampered by not being part of the official series, which means that Monty Norman's "James Bond Theme" and Maurice Binder's gun-barrel logo could not be used. As Bond, Connery is beautiful, effortlessly returns to her most famous role. He played Bond as an older, wiser agent worked. Barbara Carrera landed her best film role as the villainous 'Fatima Blush', a lady whose love of murder is such that she dances after she thinks she kills Bond. Kim Basinger smolers like 'Domino'. Like S.P.E.C.T.R.E. Agent 'Maximillian Largo', Klaus Maria Brandauer gives cool performance. The main disappointment is Max Von Sydow as 'Blofeld'. The posters seemed to be the main character, in fact he only appears in several scenes. With a stronger scenario, he could have been one of Bond's greatest villains. 'Never' promised to be a return to early Eon Bonds, like 'From Russia With Love', but didn't deliver. Gadgets were there, but were used almost apologetically. Bond's rocket motorcycle was a tired trick in the 1960s. The film tried to compete with Eon's bonds for humor. Bond rescuing himself by throwing his own urine sample into the killer's face is a farcical moment as you each find in 'Moonraker'. But nadir comes up with the introduction of Rowan Atkinson as a disgraceful Foreign Ministry official 'Nigel Small-Fawcett'. It gives the performance so terribly terrible that you wonder if he thought he was in a revolution in the lights. The music of Michel Legrand is terrible, the man seems to have never seen Bond in his life. Although the film was a financial success, a year later it is the weakest volume of the 1980s. Connery himself was disappointed with it, and not did act in the film again for some years. 1983 was a good year for 007 maniacs, in addition to Connery and Moore movies, George Lazenby made an adorable portrait on TV 'The Return of a Man from U.N.C.L.E.
