Rosie Perez is in this very engaging affair headed by Mercedes, a young Brooklyn woman who has decided to become a film actress, although she does not like her circumstances, live in East Los Angeles and struggle with a series of infertile auditions for all. Mercedes joined the married and washed actor, Harry Harrelson (Harvey Keitel), who at that time appeared in the Western TV series during the 1970s and rarely since, accepting him as his lover, partly from loneliness, and also from the hope that the film parts will be on the road because of its "contacts", but these are small consequences, because Harry is simply self-deceptive in his attempts to recover what he sees as a past film reputation. To be financially supportive, Mercedes moves as a taxi dancer in a Los Angeles dance hall / bar in downtown Los Angeles while continuing her efforts to succeed in film business. a young immigrant from Mexico, Ernesto (Michael DeLorenzo), falls in love with her, and most of the story recounts his efforts to please the subject of his affections, even though they may mean losing her. This basically a tradition rooted in melodrama is given only a moderate budget, despite the presence of well known players, including Steve Buscemi, Anthony Quinn, and Stanley Tucci, and was held in a can for about a year before its somewhat desultory. distribution and marketing efforts on its behalf, it is more a pity, because its solid production features are firmly complemented by the admirably directed direction of Alexandre Rockwell, the consistent virtue of his work and the exposure in this film from his very opening scene. Montage for credits, featuring Perez at Skid Row's fifth and main street. Rockwell has often shown that he is working very closely with his cast, and that is the case here, as he allows his actors to create his roles, while any ad libbing is nicely modified in the editing process, leading to the director's artistic success. despite some of the main evaluators' negative comments. The film's score is aesthetically pleasing with a large share contributed by Tito Larriva, who also plays as the band's chief for taxi dancers. The honors here must go to the still vital Perez, even though the performance is below steam. A fair test of the quality of any film is given when the viewer watches him twice in a short time. Sitting in this undervalued work will be seen as enthusiasm for many.
