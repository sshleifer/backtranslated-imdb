Although the story is light, the film is so beautiful and visually so calm and poetic that it could almost carry the film. The film consists of four interrelated stories, all about the various aspects of attraction between man and / or woman and how often it is ethereal. It seems that their real desire is always something they can't hold on, it will look like a handful of sand. I thought the most interesting story was the last one where the woman was more unreachable. the more a man desires. Her deep love for God is parallel to her, which is infinitely out of reach, but never closer to her heart. Very good movie. 7/10
