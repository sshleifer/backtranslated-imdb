I was fortunate to be able to show the midnight screening of this film tonight. I have to say, I was expecting a very cheap movie with bad acting and average plot. I was completely wrong. This film was not only incredibly fun, but I just loved it all. Bruce Campbell was as amazing as ever. The biggest surprise was none other than Ted Raimi, you know, Sam's little brother. He played the mad doctor's supporters to the greatest extent. Somewhere between physical comedy and clever dialogue he did nothing but shine. But I really can't ignore the spell that's Bruce Campbell. Although I thought Ted Raimi stole the show, Bruce did what he did best on the big screen. Somewhere between the superficial ugly American business man and the tragic victim, he showed the same energy he always showed to the audience as incredibly attractive. The film itself was often interrupted by the audience applause. Certainly the crowd was excited about every little turn the film had made. I highly recommend to all Bruce Campbell fans. Also, anyone who likes sci-fi movies, do yourself a favor and watch it. You can't wait to release it on DVD. <br /> <br /> Take it the way you want .... <br /> <br />
