It was cruelly close, but the Chinese syndrome received the worst kind of publicity when it came to the theatrical release, an accident at Three Mile Island. I still remember that the whole country's attention was stuck on hourly bulletins coming out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. And you wouldn't know, a Chinese Syndrome scientist describes the worst scenario of making the area as big as Pennsylvania is uninhabitable. Less than ten years later in Chernobyl, Ukraine, in its last days, the Soviet Union has dealt with a crisis that has not been remedied at the right time. Again, the Chinese syndrome has become a relevant film. The film is more about how to deal with security than about being anti-nuclear. Jack Lemmon is a man who has lived with nuclear power all his life as a submarine captain with nuclear power. What troubles him and dares him to create a confrontation that culminates in film is the stupidity and greed of power company managers. But stupidity and greed are commodities that are found every day. The problem with them is that there are places where it can be tolerated less in human society. Lemmon shares star billing with several famous Hollywood descendants, Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas. Jane is a TV news reporter who is constantly assigned to inflated feature stories and just happens to be at a nuclear power plant when an accident occurs. Covering its own station and its later encounter with Lemmon set off on a chain of events depicted in Chinese syndrome. The best Fonda scene I thought was with Peter Donat news station manager. Look at her facial expressions as Donat tears the meaning of the story and encourages her that her very beauty requires her to stick to pieces. Fonda knows he's got something and is sticking to him. Michael Douglas plays his iconoclastic cameraman, a typical part of the day. In his TCM homage to his father Kirk Douglas, Michael said he had decided on roles that show sensitivity. I could still see young Kirk Douglas in this section. What to do with energy for industrial and post-industrial nations, a troubling problem that will threaten our government for a few generations. This film shows what can happen to nuclear energy addiction. Our current problems geopolitically in the world stem partly from dependence on fossil fuels, specifically oil. Everything we use brings some unforeseen events. The real hero of the film is in my opinion Wilford Brimley, a colleague of Lemmon at a nuclear power plant. Finally, Brimley really gets off the board. Look at the Chinese Syndrome to know what I'm talking about.
