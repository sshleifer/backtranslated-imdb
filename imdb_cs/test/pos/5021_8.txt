Wow, I think the overall average rating of this movie on this site is incredibly low. There is really no reason to love this movie. "Michael" is a simple but rather original romantic comedy. The plot includes a group of reporters / experts who will explore the mysterious appearance of the angel (John Travolta) in the Midwest. The angel turns out to be less holy and secular than we would expect, and that's what makes him fun. His interest in women and the Beatles took a new spin on the angel. The romantic side of this movie includes Michael Angel, who is trying to get Andie MacDowell and William Hurt together. Both of them may not have the greatest chemistry on screen, but they certainly have enough to make it work well. Anyone who rated this movie so low (5.4 ??), come on! The film is not that bad. In fact, I found it pretty funny and unforgettable. Sure, it's not the best thing you'll ever see, but it's still good. This is a movie I think was remarkably underestimated. It's fun, romantic and recommended by me. <br /> <br /> *** off ****
