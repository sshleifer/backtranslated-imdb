This is perhaps one of my favorite movies. This tells the story of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age, so her father bought her. He falls in love with a boy called Kai. However, on her birthday Queen Snow (Bridget Fonda) comes a hotel her father owns and kidnaps Kai. Gurda then goes after Kai, and follows him through four seasons in an effort to save him. It has amazing special effects and the story fits very well and is easy to follow. I think it's a great movie for the whole family. I watched it every time it was since it came out, and I never got tired, which is why I gave 10!
