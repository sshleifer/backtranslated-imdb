It's not always certain that mixing comics will make you laugh. The comics must be really like or admire, or be willing to cope with others. GO WEST with Marx Brothers had Buster Keaton write the screenplay as a gag. Groucho didn't think much about Keaton's thoughts and shamed him at the screenplay. And although some of the Keaton gems still appear in the finished film (such as the Weapon that turns into a brush that turns into a gun), the film was one of the weakest Marx Brothers ever made. And a better film, but also hit by the comic ego duel, was WC Fields and Mae West in MY LITTLE CHICKADEE, who threw away the scenario for a single-in-one duel between leaders. But one liner was just as fun, so the movie is still successful. SIX OF A KIND is an example of six film comics that have worked well together. The reason is simple: they are really three comic teams working together: Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland, George Burns and Gracie Allan and W.C. Fields and Alison Skipworth. Ruggles and Boland were paired in about half a dozen comedies during the 1930s, usually with Boland as a rather bossy wife, and Ruggles as a nervous wreck of a husband. The field (usually one act) was paired three times with Skipworth (TILLY AND GUS and IF I MILION were two more times). Skippy has always figured out how to control or face the extraordinary activities of his man - this is the current film that he does on his own with the stolen money they are looking for (he knows that the local sheriff, Fields, is not the only one to trust). As for Burns and Allan, they can effortlessly engage in the fight with Ruggles and Boland on their cross-country skis by car. Ruggles quickly realizes what the mistake was to agree to traveling Gracie - at one point he manages to fall off a cliff and hang from a branch. He is relatively helpless when he insists on 1) photographing on his perch, and 2) correcting his grammar. The presence of George and Gracie humongous dog ("Ran Tang Tang" is the name) does not make travel easier for Charlie and Mary. <br /> <br /> The field has several options. When he insists on shouting at the quartet, he says he allows it - he's a sheriff! He also explains the unlikely story of how he got to his undeserved moniker "Honest John." You have to listen carefully to the story because it is interrupted by his attempts to play the pool several times (once a random fake billiard ball), but it shows that there were items that even Fields had no reason to do. he stole. Oh, on the "Summary Line" I mentioned a forgotten actor named Bradley Page - a man who is responsible for the troubles Charley Ruggles is suspected of. Bradley must have a reason to leave the city to catch up with the careless Ruggles and Boland, so he calls his girlfriend. She tells her to call her job and say she has to leave the city because somebody died. There's a pause when he seems to hear the question a girlfriend has thrown away. "ANYBODY!", Says - clearly angry. Although the size of the humor in the film is carried by a sextet of artists, Mr.Page happened to have the most amusingly unexpected line in the film.
