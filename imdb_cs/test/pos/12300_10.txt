I first saw this film in Austria when it first came out and I was excited. It is a passionate and deeply moving work that all film art experts should experience. What a pity it was never released in DVD format. Perhaps one of these days, which will be corrected, because it would be a pity if one of the best films ever made was forgotten and forever disappeared in a movie vault. Why is it so? 'B' movies like 'American Wedding' and 'Eurotrip' have widescreen and full-screen versions and often special editions with more comments and add-ons, while large art pieces like 'The Dead' are all forgotten?
