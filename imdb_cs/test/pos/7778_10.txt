This movie contains some of the best files I've seen in the movie or on stage. Actors play with each other with skill and liveliness, which by no means can be achieved by adjustment. "Love Jones" is a good story period. But it is also an excellent depiction of an urban, middle income, 20-person African-American set that is not often seen.
