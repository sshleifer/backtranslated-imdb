Today I rarely bother to watch comedy movies or television. They are crazy, vulgar, and most importantly, they are not funny. This one could be considered a refreshing blast from the past. It's worth watching, and I don't think he is dating in any significant way. Classical humor is classic humor and good writing is good writing regardless of the period in which you created it. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see this film again; it came to mind after seeing a somewhat similar "summer school" on television recently. Like this somewhat newer movie, "Meatballs" is funny without being cruel, too sexual or indulging in the bathroom humor. The key, of course, is how adult character makes such a difference in the life of a teenage character - perhaps even a life-saving change - and both grow up in the space of summer.
