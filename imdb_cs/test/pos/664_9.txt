STMD! is one of the funniest and most enjoyable low budget movies I've ever seen. Director Jeff Smith (who also served as co-founder, cinematographer and editor) is sure to show his love for the underrated horrors of the 1980s with this film! Anyone who loves cheesiness, senseless situations, crazy and stereotypical horror characters of the 1980s will certainly love this very honest tribute to the language of the past. <br /> STMD! certainly lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then in some. She has all the "excessive violence" and "gratuitous nudity" that reminds those 80's horror movies we all love. I watched STMD! Since the 1980s, which stereotypical characters wore blood, it has melted into a goofy tone that I just couldn't get!
