Kannathil Muthamittal is definitely a great movie. I have to give it to Mani Ratnam for great directorial work and A.R. Rahman for great songs. Working with the camera is excellent and is similar to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan. I'll be shocked if this movie doesn't win an Oscar for Best Foreign Film or even the Best Camera.
