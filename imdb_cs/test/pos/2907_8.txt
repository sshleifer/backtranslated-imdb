It came before the "Ten Commandments" "Land of the Pharaohs" "Ben Hur" and is overlooked today.As unfair! Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel, it doesn't make it cheaper that Waltari's novel was so huge only miniseries could have done it justice (I hope it will do it one day). Kingdom ”(first part) takes place after Christ's death in the Holy Land). "Egyptian" is the Rise of Monotheism of Near Christianity Long Before Christ: Pharaoh (Science) is some kind of Messiah who sacrifices his life because he knows that the true kingdom is not in the material world: He asks to come back good for evil! And he has disciples who eventually turn into martyrs (the scene where Simmons and other believers of the Sun are killed, visually stunning, look like some pagan ballet). On the other hand, this new religion would end the people's influence, and that is why they seek a strong man (mature) who can lead an army against the Hittites, as well as against their dangerous compatriots. Another religion or non-religion should be said to be Sinouhé (Purdom), who believes in nothing within two hours (a succession of sand grains is absolutely sensational and lifts the film far above the average peplum !!) <br /> <br /> Is it Here's another fascinating side: The film looks like a flamboyant melodrama. Not just for the script (notably Pharoah's sister is (Tierney) final revelation that precedes the "Ten Commandments" two years), but also the splendor of cinematography: speaks of the Baudelairian atmosphere, blue and gold, particularly in scenes that include a prostitute (Darvi) who considers her reflection in the water of her spa, the highest narcissism. All characters appear around the hero, disappear, reappear, but when they reappear, they follow their path, and all the subplots merge with perfect skill. Incidentally, as is often the case with "modern" melodrama, the story is a long flashback, framed by two short sequences showing Sina's old man who recalls. It is a beautiful sword and sandals that have had a strong influence not only in America, but also in Europe, especially in Poland, where Jerzy Kawalerowicz drove a magical "pharaoh" (1966), who owed Curtiz a lot.
