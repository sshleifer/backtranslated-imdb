After stabbing a retarded boy, 15-year-old problematic pessimist Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) is sent to juveniles. His teacher and writer Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle) is approaching and trying to understand him, first with the intention of writing a book and later becoming his friend. Leland slowly reveals his sad vision of the world, which shows that he is a sociopath. "United States Leland" is a depressing and interesting character study. A low riveting scenario reveals pieces of the story as a puzzle; there are excellent lines and dialogues; the performances are great, although Ryan Gosling, 23, did not convince himself as a 15-year-old teenager; But it seems that part is missing to complete the puzzle and make "United States Leland" a memorable movie. The unsatisfactory clarification of "why" for Leland's violent action against Ryan Pollard is neither convincing nor moving, but shows that this character is a totally wasted sociopath with a strange and ill-fated worldview. Next, as Allen Harris gets Pearl's knife, it's ridiculous. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Mundo de Leland" ("The World of Leland")
