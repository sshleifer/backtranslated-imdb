He was very happy to see Hari Om at the Bermuda International Film Festival. It was the opening evening and it was a wonderful movie. She was beautifully shot in India and I want to go there. The main actor .. Vijay was absolutely incredible. He was the highlight of the film. He was obviously also in the movie. It was a total star of the show. Benoit's character broke me up ... she was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was great too. Everyone was great! There were many amazing scenes like the monkeys. And basically I loved the movie. Everyone who was leaving was afraid of it and it was definitely the top of the film festival. It was my favorite from the festival. It really beautifully captured the vibrancy of India and can not believe how beautiful India is. The feeling of walking out of the cinema was really high. It's a wonderful, happy movie. I loved it !!
