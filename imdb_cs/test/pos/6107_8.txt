PINK FLAMINGOS, which boasts the title of the worst movie ever made, is an undisputed classic. Sure, the cameraman is shaky and off-center, the story is confused and slow, and every character in the movie is disgusting and despicable, but PINK FLAMINGOS has a certain playful charm and brilliant satirical joke that no other film is answering. Although this film is really offensive, reading descriptions of what's going on in the movie is much worse than it really is. Only John Waters can succeed in rape, murder, sadism, cannibalism, coprophage, and almost every other form of human debauchery that one knows appears to be very cheerful. This film must be seen to be believed.
