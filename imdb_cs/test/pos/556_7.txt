Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman play Adele and Ann August, a single mother who is the working definition of the word "dreamer" and her festive, pragmatic daughter. Adele, who wants to make a new start in the big city, will move them from Wisconsin to California. Good, if not exceptional, or especially unforgettable, with some serious and sad moments. That pushes some emotional buttons, that's for sure. The best thing he offers is a solid cast, and Sarandon and Portman are pretty good at the lead - though their characters are sometimes one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> May be better, it could be worse. I gave this seven out of ten.
