A new and innovative show with a big cast that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Lake Bell is wonderful .. it's bad that her next show "Miss Match" has been canceled. I'm just glad she came back to "Surface." I can't wait to get back to "Surface." This show is really something unique to watch. With a frightening underwater world similar to Jurassic Park, this show wonders what's next. Nim is adorable, even if he turns into something bigger and more threatening. There are so many generic shows out there that just seem to rehash the same old items. When something like "Surface" comes up, just say "THANK YOU!".
