I'm surprised by the relatively low rating of this movie. It's a comedy screwdriver and a fictional film that, together with anyone except Billy Wilder, has done a great job and even won an Oscar. It is the first film by Ingrid Bergman in the United States since the 1950s. This film proves that she has more talents than her good looks. , love them and leave them Walter Mathaw. Goldie is gratifying for all the senses in this role that with the great cast she built as a slam dunk for this early career award. This movie is not real deep, but is a gem that has stood the test of time very well. Not sure why the diameter is so low that I give it a solid 8.
