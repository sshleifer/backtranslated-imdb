I saw a movie in his original theatrical release in Austin Texas. The old Paramount Theater (I don't know if it still exists) went with the speakers around the walls connected exactly to all six channels. At the age of 15 I was blown away. The concept of surround sound was completely foreign to music and film at the time. <br /> <br /> I remember at least three excellent scenes where the surround sound was huge. (Although please forgive me for the time distorted my memories with inaccuracies.) The first was camera travel through Catfish Row, alive with places and sounds of everyday activity. Each of them was the first to see, for example, a blacksmith, and then when the camera passed through its sound, it would still be heard as it progressed left or right along the side of the theater. The second was a marching band that was first seen in front, then marched around the camera dividing the left and right sides. Not only did the sound of each instrument follow its own directional path, it also turned into a hue as it played towards you, on you, and then on you. And if that wasn't enough, they also contributed to the Doppler effect for each instrument as it went. The third scene was near the end of the film, while Porgy leaves Catfish Row for New York to seek Bess. He and about half the cast members go through the camera as they leave the village with the same sound effects as the marching band. The other half of the cast / chorus sing along with them and also say goodbye to Porgy and their friends. Friends' answers can then be heard from both sides and back. <br /> <br /> Surround sound has been used with amazing effects throughout the movie. I think I remember the rock or something that is thrown out of the pier and hear landing in the water behind. Such strange things were evident to the audience that they had six channels - things that seem to be mundane in theaters without it. I have had a few performances in the theater. You can do it. And several more times I came back before he left the city. I've never seen a movie before. It literally BEGS for DVD release with restored image fidelity and surround sound. I hope someone has kept it somewhere. Please, Gershwin's family, let her be released before she gets lost for the good of other generations.
