Me and my friends met in one house so we could watch it on Friday night before we went to the pub. It was the only program that caused us to miss the opening hours. It's one of the best comedies I've ever watched, if not the best. David Jason was brilliant and was compared to Buster Keaton with his clever stunts, which had been so credibly downloaded. I wish I could watch the show on the DVD. He had an amazing ability to make silly things look believable, and this series shows how much talent he has in many ways. He is the perfect "Trip and Fall" and I remember once watching him watching him do it professionally. Surely he is the one who teaches people this art. He only saw it in other programs he did. Pshaw, this program shows how talented he is. I lost why David Jason vetoed another series because it was one of the best things he ever did, and I was his fan since he did this series. They say he didn't like it because his early career turned out to be unreal. In my opinion, it could have been the right decision when he took it, but now his career has gone so far, I believe it would be a good time to do another series to show him how he looks at his "secret life" . "Full of mistakes they can't see. Rod
