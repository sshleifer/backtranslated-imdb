People who know me say I have a soft spot for animated movies. To be fair, these people are HALF says. and David Fleischer. <br /> <br /> You may think of yourself, "well, if it's so great, why didn't I hear about it?" The just question. This movie was released in the same week as the attacks on Pearl Harbor. Inevitably bad timing caused the film to plunge into relative confusion. However, things look up because they are finally released on DVD under the title "BUGVILLE". It's funny it all went through the movie because it's a mirror of a real conspiracy. Although some people claim that the film is trying to send an ecological message (ugh), I personally think that the main idea of ​​the film is perseverance through adversity and hard times (after all, the country hardly pulled out of depression at the time). Our hero Hoppity desperately wants to help his vulnerable community. Problem: Every time he tries, either through the bad will of others or with simple bad luck, he fails miserably ... and slowly begins to earn contempt for the people he tries to save. While trying to keep a positive outlook, he sometimes breaks down and it's only thanks to the encouragement and support of his friends that he returns to his feet and fights a good fight. Just a healthy reminder that when everything is said and done, no one is really self-sufficient. <br /> <br /> "Okay," you say. "It has a good news (two actually). Does it really make it extremely good?" <br /> <br /> My answer: Partially. It's not just a message that makes this movie special. It's characterization. This is one of those movies in which you can see their personality in their animation. You don't even need spoken lines. A good way to sum it up is "energetic" or "alive." A lot of movies used a point of sale, a "nice cast". Every time I hear that line, I always think of this movie. The Case of the Bad Guys: Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito. Many movies have "cute" villains, but I don't think you'd find them as fun or cute as these guys. Forget that 3 Stooges Cartoon from the 60s. Swat and Smack are closest to the animated version of Moe and Curly (but unfortunately not Larry) you will ever find. Virtually all the funniest moments in some way cause this haunted twin. Yeah, they're rotting no-goodniki, but you're still taking care of them. That's the kind of power you see only from a really talented writer, director, and crew. The film has two short jokes that revolve around racial stereotypes (Native Americans and Chinese). I don't think they should be harmful; But they are there, no matter what. They didn't bother me, but it would be quite unfair to me if I didn't bother anyone who bothered them. So if you share my weakness (and I think you're doing it) Give this.
