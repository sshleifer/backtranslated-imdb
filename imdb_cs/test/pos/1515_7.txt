Well, this is new ... Famous Italian horror director Lucio Fulci shoots a film about the famous Italian director of horror ... Lucio Fulci. After years and years of witnessing horrific horror sequences, it is difficult for Lucia to separate reality from fiction and often hallucinate about committing violent murders. He quickly descends further into the seemingly endless spiral of madness and unverifiable poison. Even a dedicated psychiatrist can't keep the Fulci on the right track ... Now that it's pure fun and fun, Cat in the Brain is definitely one of Fulci's most enjoyable movies. Gore is powerful and at least abundant. The amount of dirty massacres is impossible to describe, especially when you get your hands into a fully unmanaged version (called "Nightmare Concert"). Decapitation all around, casings of victims are spread out on all sides of the screen and chain saws work overtime! The film will also become unintentionally funny (because it is so exaggerated) and a perfect experience with a group of friends when a beer is in the fridge. Of course, from a more professional perspective, this production cannot be called a masterpiece! There is not even a little tension or atmosphere to detect, and the characters are completely empty. To make more space for gore, the characters are just being introduced for 5 seconds and consequently die terrible death. Especially compared to Fulci's highlights - like "The Beyond" or "Don't Torture and Duckling" - this movie looks like a fast-paced snack. The best way to interpret "Cat in the Brain" is as a personal statement by Fulci and a direct attack on censorship. Perhaps after seeing so many of his films? especially the other ones? To be shortened by censorship committees and caught by pseudo-art critics, he wanted to take revenge by bringing a cruel mess that could not be reduced! If you take all the explicit violence and really sick makeup effects, you only have about 10 minutes of footage left! Especially because crazy murders appear later in the film when Fulci hallucinates them again. You will almost hear our director thinking something like, "See how you censor it now!" Even the whole development of the murder investigation takes place in the background. Missing victims of any of their friends or relatives? Are there policemen looking for clues that will lead them to the killer? You don't know, and Lucio doesn't bother you because it would lead to sequences that don't require cutting. And it's pretty damn nice too! The name "Mr. Fulci" or even "Lucio" is mentioned every 3 minutes (34 times throughout the film to be exact) and our director is clearly aware that the focus is on change. Hey, I don't blame him ... After more than 30 years of fun movies; deserved a little more fun. You are God, Mr. Fulc!
