First of all it is an artistic film and a good film. I loved the presentation and the way she was shot. Great. Some scenes were some of the graphic horror sequences I've ever seen. This film frightened me, not because of tension or shock, but because I was terribly afraid I would see something really scary soon. It happened in several places, but mainly at the beginning. The film also dragged and 74 minutes seemed to be long. But if you're in a movie, you have to see it. I haven't seen anything like this to date. 8/10
