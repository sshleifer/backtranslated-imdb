I never expected such an old film to be as impressive as this western 1930 proved to be. The footage of the pioneers heading west in their covered wagons encounter storms and mud, river crossings, Indian attacks, and all kinds of judgment and danger, are overwhelming in their harsh credibility. A lot of the film was shot outside and the film about it has a really epic feeling. Actors must experience many of the same conditions as the original pioneers and the results are stunning. Cars, clothes, every detail looks and feels good. The characters are simple but believable, with a straightforward story that travels like a train car to its destination. John Wayne is slim and youthful in one of his first roles as a Scout car driver, and he does a great job as an idealistic young bordering. He is against the amazingly ugly three villains, including Ian Keith as a slick player, Charles Stevens as a Mexican sidekick and Tyrone Power, Senior, as a foster bear hunter. The very bearded, growling, bigger than life depiction is both comic and threatening. I still imagine him a scarf, an earring with gold hoops and a patch of black eye, a parrot on his shoulder as he growls and growls various threats and insults. His character could easily be transferred to a pirate ship without any hassle. He almost stole the whole picture. Tully Marshall is amazing as a kind old frontman who is Wayne's best friend. Pretty Marguerite Churchill creates a lively heroine whose initial encounter with Wayne is a cheerful blend, resulting in a long-lasting courtship consisting of insults and feigns of indifference on her side, to perseverance on him. The results are pretty funny and one is happy to finally meet at the end. <br /> <br /> The scenery is amazing, cars are moving in real prairies and have to be lowered by ropes from cliffs. Indians, who are clearly the real story, and not the white make-up actors, look like friends and enemies and are treated with dignity. Wayne tells an admiring group of young boys that the Indians are his friends who have taught him everything he knows about surviving in the wild. The Big Trail is an uncomplicated story told by a talented actor and crew. It will probably seem naive to many modern viewers, but there is a quiet dignity about it that never lets it become trivial. There's a lot of deliberate humor, including a pioneer fool hiding loud animal sounds every time a smooth player Ian Keith tries to join a beautiful heroine to marry. His flowery expressions about the plantation he owns are interrupted by very realistic imitations of cat cats and quack ducks, which would make the seducer look around in excitement for invisible creatures. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend both Western fans and old film lovers in general. This is really a classic movie for ages.
