Charles Chaplin's 'Shoulder Arms' 1918 was his longest film to date, though, at just over 45 minutes in length, it wasn't quite a feature film. With World War I only approaching, many popular time entertainers did their part to inspire their indigenous troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And so dear Tramp went to war! The film begins with a hiker in training and the character is cheerfully incapable even in the simplest of military exercises, including marching and smuggling weapons, much to disgust his sergeant. The hiker then finds himself in the trenches, facing a more formidable enemy, though the Germans eventually seem infinitely incompetent than himself. An exciting moment when Tramp declares that he unilaterally captured thirteen German soldiers by "encircling" them in a stitch. <br /> <br /> There are many other great moments in this movie. Chaplin wakes up to find his sleeping barracks underwater and is unable to literally find his own feet, is cheerful, as well as his sophisticated use of the turntable tube to sleep under the surface. Nevertheless, unforgettable scenes in the film undoubtedly include Chaplin's skulking behind enemy lines disguised as a tree. The reaction of the restless German soldiers, unknowingly just a few meters away from the sworn enemy, because they are unilaterally disabled, are very amusing, especially when one soldier struggles with an ax to cut a tree into wood. This is a very enjoyable movie and one of Chaplin's best experiments before 1920. Highly recommended.
