While all the Fleischer / Famous Studios "Superman" cartoons are excellent, "Billion Dollar Limited", the third in the series, is probably the best in the series in terms of overall animation, plot and stimulation. Why it wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for 1942 (incredibly enough, only the first was inexplicable). Here, Lois Lane is assigned to cover the transfer of one billion dollars in gold to the US Mint. Masked gangsters in their super-powered (for 1942) car take off on the train, determined to get the gold. Without giving too far, what follows is an exciting ride for both characters and spectators, with truth, justice and Superman triumphant at the end. Like all Fleischer / Famous Superman cartoons, Clayton "Bud" Collyer and Joan Alexander, who played Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane on the radio, have the honor of voice work and Fleischer's persistent Jack Mercer also a little bit to do as one of the bad guys.
