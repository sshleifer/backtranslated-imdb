This film is an almost forgotten gem of 1979, which, though basically a comedy, was based on one of Britain's biggest attractions. In fact, one of the titles that this film is known about includes "caper", which means that it is a film type indicator in its own. A bunch of cute rouges who are not violent or psychotic types who face the blame to rip out the greatest work of their lives. To be honest, I don't know much about real crime and I can't comment if it accurately depicts the events that unfolded or the characters involved. Richard Jordan plays very well with PINKY Green and is very believable as an easy little American who seems very comfortable. I must add that sometimes American actors struggle with English actors in British film, chemistry is not always there, but for Jordan it is no problem to match his role. It is worth pointing out that Jordan himself was probably one of the most underrated actors of the 1970s and 1980s and never received the credit he deserved. He seemed stuck in supporting roles and B movies, not a fair representation of his acting abilities. He played a corrupt cop in EDDY COYLE's FRIENDS, a sadistic killer in MEAN SEASON. In the Secret of My Success he played some comic character Gordon Gehc and also played a good guy in 1980's EQUALIZER. All this points to the versatility of his mixing skills with David Niven, Kurt Russell, Edward Woodward and Robert Mitcham. <br /> <br /> In this movie he plays effortlessly as a little time cheater. Just a moment for the ladies and immediately stand up and take root. Can't you help Green, ?? ?? you see that he really wanted to go straight, but as soon as he blackmailed it, it seemed too many opportunities to give up and finally enjoy the thoughts of all the money. David Niven is chief and police inspector brilliantly played by Richard Johnson, who typically portrayed a charming but thorough London detective who clearly loves his job. Other support casts do not say too much, but when they looked at them, they were very well known British actors who often found themselves in the hands of either villains or copper (not irony). Elkie Sommers, Oliver Tobias are doing their job, and it's good to see Gloria Graham as a colleague. Some viewers, especially Americans, would seem ridiculous if someone with a Greens record could land on maintenance. on all things bank and come and go when he likes. In addition, the sensation he had pulled from the Crown Court after being convicted was not as attractive as it might seem, in the 1960s and 1970s security was not nearly as tight as it is now. As for the film itself there are some interesting observations. Little times scammers here were too many. There are other films where this also happens, ie BRINKS MAT. It is not just the liquidation or hiding of the prey, but with so many people involved, someone will be careless, it will be wasted, or it will just break once. In addition, the authorities are coming very hard at the local rouges when such a huge robbery is done. It is said that there is no honor among thieves, but Ivan was adamant that PINKY got his blow. You only had an excessive look at his dock view, if it could kill it, it would be a total betrayal! How could he have them all after he took care of him? You have to ask yourself why why, that crooks can be so stupid? Did Green really think he could speak out of his suspicion a second time? Inspector Watford was not at all deceived by his innocent-looking face, as well as the well-built alibi, the entire cabarist went to work. Plus, you wonder why they leave so many tracks? Notepad with safe numbers down, travel brochures for overseas journeys, still leaving binoculars and unusual behavior on the day of the robbery that was out of character. With some decent, but common sense police work Insp Watford was fast green, picking him up and soon singing him like a canary. It's just showing how through well thought-out planning things can fall apart very quickly, there's never a clean getaway for every body, some always get nabbed. Although it is worth pointing out that a lot of money has never been obtained. <br /> <br /> Everyone in all the fun movies, interesting shots from London and England in the late 70s, well-run, big-end. I highly recommend, especially if you like capers. (Note: I recently bought a DVD from it, but the transmission was probably taken from VHS tape and is of poor quality. That's why they don't pay too much for it!)
