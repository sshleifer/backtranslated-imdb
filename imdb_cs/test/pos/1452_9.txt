Otto Preminger is "The Man with the Golden Arm" is a reference to heroin addiction - something that had to be in 1955, fifty years ago (that was in the past censors, a problem with the drug content in the film!). Br /> <br /> The lead role was originally offered to Marlon Brando, then Frank Sinatra caught him before Brando could answer. Sinatra convincingly portrays a card dealer and a former heroin addict who returns home to the city just to fight the temptation demons. Preminger is one of my favorite directors (his "Murder Anatomy" "playing James Stewart's brilliant and revolutionary judicial drama). Preminger has largely helped to change the face of the cinema in the 1950s - "Anatomy of Murder" was extremely controversial when it came out of her conspiracy and content (references to rape, female panties, seduction, etc.) and "The Man with the Golden Arm" deals that is just as unstable. Preminger, however, downloads it without becoming exploitative. This is as an ancestor to "Panic in the Needle Park" (1971) and carries more than a few similarities in terms of general motives to the classic Billy Wilder movie "The Lost Weekend," starring Ray Milland. These three movies are probably the best movies about alcoholism that preceded the 1980s and still remain relevant today.
