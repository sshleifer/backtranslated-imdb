Seeing this show gives me respect for MTV, although I imagine MTV sees this random, irritated material as its main selling point and much less interested in the relevant truths it expresses. I write and play music for a living and this show gets me really emotionally awake. For me, Wondsershowzen serves a totally different function from most TV. Instead of dulling or distracting the senses (which may sometimes be very nice), my spirit awakens truth and wrong. This makes me a very unpleasant but very pleasant way. I don't think most viewers absorb most of the show's content, but if so, viewers will be viewers everywhere.
