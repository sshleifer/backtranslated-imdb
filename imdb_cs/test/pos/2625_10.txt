I was a 20-year-old college student living with people when I first saw it, and I never forgot it. I'm a huge Joan Hackett fan and this movie was perfect for her remarkable talent. I'm so glad that so many other people have such a memory of seeing it. Of course, it's not available on any media! It would be perfect to show up on Lifetime, but because of their age they won't. You don't see anything before the mid-1980s. I can still remember what made me watch when it was the first time: Rex Reed checked it in The New York Daily News and said it was like returning to the big Hollywood movies of the 1940s. , Hackett and Grimes parts would play Stanwyck and Crawford. Think about it! P.S. So sad that Joan Hackett left us so tragically young.
