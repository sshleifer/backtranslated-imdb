I saw this movie for the first time in 1988 when it was on HBO and I loved it !! It was so cheerful that I saw it too many times to count it. I love Stork's brothers and poor, ugly dog ​​Bosco! My favorite quote from the movie is: "It's so ugly that it should be sleeping." I also loved it when the nurse exploded the girls on their backs and their faces held on. I also love John Cusack and Demi Moore in this movie. They were great. This film brings back memories of my college days when I first saw it. I rented the movie countless times and kept watching it. My college roommate and I couldn't get enough. Who couldn't love this crazy movie?! I want to buy a copy on DVD, does anyone know where to get it?
