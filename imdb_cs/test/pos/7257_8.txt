I tend to like historical (period) movies and get new costume ideas for my historical group and my friend recommended it to me. I like Johnny Lee Miller as an actor so I thought it was worth it and I was definitely rewarded !! His depiction as a member of the English noble class was much more accurate than I had seen in the past. The comic aspect that left me hurts, the costumes were not terrible, and I didn't mind much historically. I also noticed that England did not have the right drainage system until much later, but nobody who gets deep into the cliffs of England's past will not notice or care for it. Definitely worth seeing. I highly recommend this movie.
