I've always loved the scratch that's in all those westerns. He was sidekick (Jingles) in Wild Bill Hickock show back in the fifties. In this, he has the perfect means for his amazing commendable character. He is harmless and no one trusts him, but he is just like him. When you have such a guy, there's no challenge because there's no details. Of course, in this episode, a spacecraft is taken by a group of aliens who have no sense of humor and believe in everything they hear. They have no word in their dictionaries. It turns out to be so unbearable that they can't handle it; and then of course there is a secret weapon. Just look at Andy.
