This movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time. The dialogue is sharp, the pace is fast. Not only is it a clever comedy, it's an interesting look at what's going on behind the scenes of television news. There are so many funny lines ... a couple of my favorites: <Br /> <br /> Ernie Merriman: (sarcastically) It must always be nice to believe you know better, you always think you're the smartest man in the room. Jane: (seriously) NO, it's not, it's awful !! Aaron: Must Be Good Looking Jane: How Do You Know? Aaron: Nobody invites a bad-looking idiot to his room! The performance of Holly Hunter, Albert Brooks and William Hurt was absolutely great! A few years later, I remember this film well. Often forgotten is the wonderfully funny Joan Cusack! I love the scene where employees of the editorial team compete to overcome the deadline. There are so many funny scenes that it's hard to choose your favorite. I highly recommend this movie.
