1956 is a man who knew too much is exceptional fun. For those who prefer the 1934 original, I'll say this one is faster and wiser. Although the American version (heavenly!) Was a big budget hit, I think the British version will be thrown out of the water. I think this is one of the top 10 Hitchcock's insignificant performances because he was doing over 50 films and many of them were the greatest of all time. I find so many things I like: 1) James Stewart, American is the most popular American for many years, doing the great job of playing a desperate father. He can make any movie entertaining and work with such a likable character in such a grasping story that he takes me very intensely. Leslie Banks is nothing compared to the original. 2) Doris Day. Yes, Doris Day. Despite all the criticisms towards her, I think she makes a loving wife / mother an extremely sympathetic person. I disagree with negative comments on its nature; just because it is soft and gentle does not mean that it is obedient and helpless. I don't want to spoil anything, but she herself made a fundamental discovery herself after her husband failed. It gives the story a level of warmth that wasn't the first, and for those who care about it being the way. And I loved Que Sera Sera; I think it's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard and earned an Oscar. The film has been upgraded to another level. 3) Sequence of Albert Hall. I don't think it was too long; I suspect that the tense was building up such an amazing crescendo all the time, and Hitchcock's direction in this scene was absolutely brilliant. And the killer was really scary. 4) The end really gave a smile on my face; Even after the aforementioned scene, I found that the rescue scene was exciting and it was great to see the charming family again. The last line in the movie is very funny. I don't think the movie started slow; Hithcock tried to get to know us and, like McKennas, did a great job. I wasn't a big fan of the guy playing Hank, but I had no problem with him. Since Hank was Ben and Joo's child, I also took care of him; it is not like being a brat or anything. <br /> <br /> In this film, I have not found any serious flaws and so many major and minor virtues. The Way To Go Hitch!
