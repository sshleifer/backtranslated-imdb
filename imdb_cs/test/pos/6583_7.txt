It was a movie I was still reading about reviews. and despite being played at the Film Museum and not at the Pathe Theater? I decided to give this movie a try. There were many reasons? in reviews it was compared with Pulp Fiction, it had several parallel stories running in the movie and eventually it already won 17 awards internationally in different categories. I was eager to see this movie and, considering my non-working day in Greenpeace, I decided to be happy to go and see this movie. I think it reflected people's current life in general? drugs, crime, sex, anger, anxiety, fear and guilt. Every emotion has been brilliantly captured in the film. There are several characters and stories interwoven, but several characters will return to the second half? creating a link with the beginning of sequences that moves the story forward. The story is about two friends? one of them is a computer geek and the other is a junkie? son of a gross father. Addict Boy Trades Euro 500 Note? printed by his friend ?? Buy back your music system, and in return get a huge change in cash back to buy more drugs. Trading Euro 500 Banknotes continues with strange events? from the store trader to the car mechanic cum robber? Car Dealers? on a vacuum cleaner dealer? prostitute? a police officer? then her family and children. How does a small thing start? creates a chain reaction that even after 5 years of this first event leads to the last depressing comment? which I will not disclose here. <br /> <br /> The direction is excellent. The evolution of the characters in the film is the first course. A character who clings to your mind even after he leaves the film is a vacuum cleaner. All film departments are nicely processed. I would like to make a few critical remarks here. First, during the sequence of one event leading to another, I felt that coincidences were too fast and forced. But this script writing mistake is love when you see the whole screen. Secondly, the trace of one character leading to another leads in some way back to the first two characters, and again I found out that it was a writer's forced decision. There was no need to have the same characters that reappear when there are different causes leading to different effects in such a big city. But after he said it? it's an excellent movie! It's a dark movie with few sexual scenes. Characters have black, white and gray shades and emotions that change from another situation that is brilliantly captured by the director. <br /> <br /> High Speed ​​Movie! It has all the components that become a cult film. I hope that only such movies should not happen and achieve cult film status and win a lot of awards because of no crime, sex, violence, drugs, etc. Is it possible to make fantastic movies? Bicycle Thieves and Pather Panchali are His Major Examples? The only thing is that they have been back long and the times are changing and I think movies reflect the present time.
