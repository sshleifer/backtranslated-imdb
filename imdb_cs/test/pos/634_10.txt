In today's world of ad and horror adolescence and sensational it is very rare that a person sees a movie and nothing about it. Films like Psycho and Blair Witches, while being great in tension (both with large builds up) are spoiled by the fact that we know everything about the best scenes and at least a plot before we see them. With Mute Witness, a rare delicacy, I came across this movie and watched it, without fear, in the middle of the night. I was frightened by the terrible Russian environment, the subject of "snuff" and the claustrophobic situation of mute and the fact that (fun, always leading to likeable) characters could be fulfilled at any moment. As it is a low budget and a rare movie, we watch it without expectation. It also has Fay Ripley in a rare film role, watching and preparing to be excited, frightened and excited in totally unexpected ways.
