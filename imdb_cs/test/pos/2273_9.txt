I just saw "Everything is lit" at Telluride Film Festival. This is a really remarkable film. Very emotional, sometimes funny and cordial. Bring your handkerchiefs! For those of you who enjoy a movie that brings tears to your eyes, I reminded you of the end of "Babette's Feast" and "The Notebook". The stories were completely different, but they had the same emotional strength to bring tears in my eyes just as this movie did. The summary is, as described by the IMDb, the journey of a young man to Ukraine to follow his roots and find the village where his father grew up. The dialogue is in English and Ukrainian (and also in Russian I believe). This allows some beautifully linguistically-based moments when one character interprets more or less faithfully an English speaker in a group, depending on the circumstances. The scenery is beautiful and the music score is cured with wonderful Eastern European influences. Make sure you stay over credits for the last tune. This is Lieve Schreiber's directorial debut and is well done. I give this movie 9, one of the best movies I've ever seen. I recommend it very.
