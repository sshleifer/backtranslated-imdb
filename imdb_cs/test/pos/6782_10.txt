This game is an action / adventure with a fight. There are quite long periods without a fight, but other times, you have to get rid of different kinds of monsters. Monsters are not like anything you see in real life, and you must be deprived of them to continue your search. The whole game is a quest. You play Adam Randall, whose father contacts him from a distance and asks him to come to rescue him. The game is from the mid-1990s and must be played in DOS. I used Dosbox and I was able to play the game pretty well. The graphics are not as good as some games of that time, mainly because the resolution is not high and some scenes look quite wicked, but others look like dough, but don't be discouraged. The game is very imaginative, long and can jump you when unexpected monsters come out of nowhere. It is not for young children who would not be interested, but more than 13 or 14 players would like this game. Its a horror secret action adventure combat combination. I thought it was a great game. Now she had to find. maybe Ebay. But remember its DOS game and you wouldn't be able to play it on today's faster computers. it would be difficult to play on fast computers if you are not using Dosbox. And it's also very good.
