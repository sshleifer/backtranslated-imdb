I thought Nick Gomez's look at the rough streets of New Jersey, where auto-jackings were at the highest level, was both provocative and fun. This is as good as movies like Boyz n the Hood or Society II or Above. I thought the actors and the screenplays were appropriate, had a bold realistic feel, and was very atmospheric, either intentionally or brutally. I like this movie a lot, the underrated gem I found on TV and glad I caught it. Go see this movie if you get a shot. If they do not have a DVD, they should release it. Well done by Nick Gomez. IMDb 5.9. My rating: 9/10
