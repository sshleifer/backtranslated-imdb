I remember seeing this 1978 comedy on one of the good moments I took when I was looking for a break from my college courses. Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson make some effective Tracy-Hepburn-style-pulling-and-parrying in this duvet weight driven by reliable Howard Zieff (he made "Private Benjamin") about a newly widowed doctor aggressive re-entry into the game dating. It's all quick thanks to the clever script by veteran screenwriter Julius J. Epstein ("Casablanca") along with Alan Mandel, Max Shulman and future director Charles Shyer. Dr. <br /> <br /> Charley Nichols has just returned from Hawaii after the death of his wife. On his return, he realizes that he is an instant catnip for all and all unmarried women in LA. He works in a hospital led by an increasingly senile chief, Amos Willoughby, whom Charley has to calm down to keep his residence. Enter Ann Atkinson, a transplanted Englishman who cares for cheesecakes for living and has some specific views on the medical profession she freely expresses on PBS talk shows. Of course, Charley is on the show board and sparkling, as they say, flying. This leads to standard complications about how seriously Charley is willing to become Ann. At the same time, the hospital has to deal with a potentially unjustified death court from the widow of a wealthy baseball teammate who died in the hospital under Willoughby's careless supervision. It's just refreshing to see such a mature but refreshing love story between the two characters who inhabit actors who add the skills of surgeons who control a scalpel. Matthau is his usual gaudy swing in the seventies and quite a clear look as his gangly arms held in the sidewalk. From his heavy, acclaimed Elizabethan roles, Jackson is sharply sardonic and enchanting, as is the wild Ann, who thinks all doctors should strive for Albert Schweitzer. Art Carney plays Willoughby with a predictable tan, while Richard Benjamin provides friendly support as Charley's colleague, Dr. Solomon. It's all very compact with a few nice blows to greed within the medical profession. There are no bonuses on the 2005 DVD.
