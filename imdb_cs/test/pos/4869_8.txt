This cartoon documents the second encounter between Wile E. Coyote and Roadrunner and is definitely better than their first meeting in Fast and Furry-ous (1949). If aesthetic value is measured, then this caricature would not rank among the top 5 or 6 of 1952. Regardless, it is very funny short. Carnivorous Vulgaris chases Roadrunner (Accelerati Incredibilus) on the road and is completely tired. The brilliant scientific "Latin" names of the characters are very original and were imitated earlier in other un-related cartoons. Coyote collapses and sets off for a wonderful expression - I don't know - freedom. These Jonesesque expressions make this cartoon provide more than its share of laughter in seven minutes. Then he has an idea and wears another sad expression. The jokes slapsticky are cheerful and cover the fact that it's really bad to make such a pain a poor, helpless, GENIUS coyote. Everyone knows, but who cares? An old rocket gag is also present. Coyote clings to a rocket that should give him enough time to catch up with Roadrunner and catch him. Instead, the rocket fires into the air and becomes a fireworks display in the distance: Eat at Joe. This classic gag comes from this cartoon; Though obvious, people still laugh. The highlight is really the chase through the shaft. Both wear helmet-lights, and we see a tunnel, through which the two go, with only the lights visible. Here comedy reaches its peak. Need to see the sequence, maybe the best sequence in the early days of Roadrunner. The final touch is provided by Michael Maltes writing, as Coyote Light goes out and he unknowingly lights up a match in a room full of explosives, the surface is shown where a bunch of cactus leap and spell letters "YIPE!" Such little things make you all laugh at just seven minutes, and once the fun begins. Another good idea is rocket skates, as well as a free drink of water and anvil on a solid rope (a sequence that appears in Space Jam [1996]). Giving the results of those who are gone would be useless. The free drink proves to be a problem for Wile E. at the end of the second sequence: namely, rocket skates. <br /> <br /> This classic cartoon is dotted with subtle animation, except characters. Although they are animated very well, the two characters are very primitive; which could be insufficient. Although it may seem strange at first glance, the humor of subsequent sequences will forget. <br /> <br /> If you like vintage Jones, watch it. If LOVE Roadrunner, you get it on video. Excellent fun (Rating: 8/10).
