That was very funny, even though it broke down a bit. He won't go overboard with honor after Hitchcock - Owen (Danny DeVito) was lucky enough to have a "Strangers on A Train" playing in a local cinema, so the movie says it was an inspiration. <br /> <br /> DeVito is very fun, but also a little sad. He has no friends and all he wants to do is write and have someone like his writing. His teacher, Billy Crystal, is going through some serious writer's block and his wife has stolen his book and made her own success, which has also frustrated him. The best works are Mr. Pinsky's book design ("One Hundred Girls I Like Pork") and all the scenes with Anna Ramsey that is so terrible that Mother Teresa would want to kill her!
