The inspiration for "Naked Gun" casts Leslie Nielsen - who just recently started making a comedy - as an incompetent but heroic Frank Drebin, who always had to solve the absurd case. Like "Airplane!" and movies based on the series, humor relies on Mel Brooks-style point gags and silly comments (namely "yes it is" notes), along with the fact that Nielsen remains very serious over nonsense around him. And of course the last picture in which something moves. It's too bad that the show had only six episodes. At least it gave birth to films. You can't go wrong with Leslie Nielsen in these kinds of roles. I suspect everyone was having fun filming. Really funny. <br /> <br /> * Before "Airplane!", Leslie Nielsen starred in movies like "Forbidden Planet", "Harlow" and "Poseidon Adventure". As late as 1987 he co-starred in "Nuts" alongside Barbra Streisand and Richard Dreyfuss. But since the first movie "Naked Gun" is still a comedy.
