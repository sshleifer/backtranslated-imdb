A big "documentary" about how scientists thought dinosaurs behaved, captured by some of the most remarkable CGI from "Jurassic Park". Done seriously, like a prehistoric episode "Nation Geographic". It will draw your attention from the first picture and never let it go. My favorite part was when Diplodocus fought Allosauros. <br /> <br /> 10 stars. That's what science is about.
