I won't go too deep, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There were no funny scenes (which I remember) but it had moments. The cast is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance. Rene Russo was cool in the movie, no complaints. There were two characters in the story that I liked that they didn't explain anything at all. The first was a friend of Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy) at the gym, played by Ken Campbell. I assumed he was just a friend of Trey, but I wanted to know more about him. Another character I liked was Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro), a colleague / partner playing Nestor Serrano. I think it was just another cop working with Mitch Preston, but I wanted to know if he was his partner or what he wasn't. I think I might think about a movie, I think it's a comedy ... that cares for characters? I think yes. I was really pleased to see that it was directed by Tom Dey, who also directed Shanghai Noon. Ever since I saw the movie, I've been looking forward to his next work. I think he did a pretty good job with this film and I look forward to his next work again. All in all, it was a good movie, but I wouldn't recommend paying a full ticket if you're not a tough fan of Robert De Niro / Eddie Murphy / Rene Russo. It is worth seeing in the theater, but not at the full price, I would recommend seeing it at the matinee award. Also, here's some trivia movie for ya. The one who played the man with the camera, played by Judah Friedlander is the guy in the music video "Everyday" by the band Dave Matthews. He was also an official in "Meet Parents", also starring Robert De Niro. In addition, Derek Zoolander's brother in Zoolander (both Zoolander and Meet the Rodents star Ben Stiller) also starred. Just some useless trivia for you. <br /> <br /> I hope you like the movie. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
