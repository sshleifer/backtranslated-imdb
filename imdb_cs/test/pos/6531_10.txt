I'm probably a little old for this movie, 16, and it's a man, the story is a little bit of a girl, but I really thought it was a great movie. All the girls in this movie are so hot and really great actresses, from Alan, to Adrianna, to Deena, to Kimberly, to the cute girl who plays Alan's little sister Rachel. I'm not a huge pop-star fan with lovesick songs, but I thought Aaron Carter did a really great job in it, and he seems to be really in this movie, and it seemed real. My mom liked all the older farts she grew up with, so it's fine too. I thought I liked a lot of people, and I wonder if I see them again? The sequel would be fine. I rented it, but I could buy it because I have a ton of DVD and I would like to go back to see what I miss. But I couldn't buy it at the blockbuster, so I don't know where to buy it right now, but I'll look into it. Anyway, I'm a 16 year old guy, I've already said it, I know, but I would have noticed it. It's really good for all ages, really. I think even my little half sister who has 6 saw it. This is what is so cool that it is something that sees all ages. I'm sure it was done deliberately, but it really works. Girls can dream of being with Aaron Carter, and guys like me can dream of all the ready-made chicks in this movie. There's something for everyone.
