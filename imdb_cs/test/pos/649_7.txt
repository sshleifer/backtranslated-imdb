In August, '81 there was ground-ish buzzing to movies, great hits like "Urban Cowboy", "Anyone But Loose", "Smokey and Bandit" were all rage. For this reason, I suspect that the producers of this film chose "Honky Tonk Freeway" as a title hoping it would help the movie's cash registers by drawing "Urban Cowboy" in the same crowd. Instead, "Honky Tonk Freeway" bombed theaters and I suspect they do it in part by being burdened with a badly chosen title. This is the same problem that is now burdening the video and it's too bad because it's a pretty good movie and it's time in the comedy style before it. It doesn't matter what anyone who remembers 1981 will enjoy. This movie was bombed. But I think it would be the same, even if it wasn't ugly. It's a movie before his time. You could now look at this movie and see that his father is clearly a father or * uncle, just like today). For his "Honky Tonk Freeway" he was quite full of allusions and a kind of sincerity about life that didn't get popular in comedy until much later. While clearly his child "Airplane", his more mature, and while his certainly no "Knocked Up" it clearly shows in this direction. The characters are "more mature" in the sense that they are low-key and never think that something they are doing is nothing but serious. Jokes are in the selection of what needs to be emphasized and the views of the camera and the way they look at each other and their situations. More than that, "Honky Tonk Freeway" is a real-time capsule. Great look back at tremendously early 1980s. The people in this film are dressed and acting as secular people in 1981. It was clear that this was to reflect the times and be a crafty comic commentary on the everyday life around them. <br /> <br /> I don't know if my review helps you, but it's really good, sometimes kind of excellent, the movie is worth hiring if you want to see how many faces that are known today looked when they were about 30 years younger. Beverly D'Angelo is so young that it's hard to ever do. Likewise, Beau Bridges and Terri Garr. Terry Garr was just about to become a toast to Hollywood because her next film was "Tootsie", which eventually made her a star. Howard Hessmann was probably the biggest "current" star of the day this movie was made. In 1981, Howard Hessmann was the star of the big TV show "WKRP in Cinncinatti". He played his leading character, rascally night DJ. Daniel Stern was just about to break out as a star as the adult storyteller voice of a lead child in the popular "The Wonder Years" sitcom in the 1980s. See Hume Crowyn and Jessica Tandy as an old married couple on the way. Jessica Tandy would finally pick up the Oscar ten years after "Daisy Driving" for him. There is also a great Geraldine party in one of her final film appearances. Although she had a great career, she did not earn her an Oscar in four years after this "Bountiful Trip" in 1985, for which she earned her a lot and died very soon after winning this award. In addition, there are many other faces in this film, actors who are not big stars, but who have done a lot of support work. Many of them are familiar, even if you can't think of their name. This film is a nice little variation. A bunch of people with different problems came from different locations, each one for their own unrelated reasons, who all, in the vaguely Altman-esk way, end up facing Florida and unrecognized them rendevoux in the small town of Ticlaw, Florida, which happens to be he is recovering from the consequences of circumventing the recently built interstate neighborhood, which did not create an exit to Ticlaw, which would effectively take the city out of the map. And that's also what this film is all about, the fascination with the whole idea of ​​an interstate system that has just recently been "finished". The construction lasted one generation, since it was approved by Congress around 1960, for many years when parts were built and then "live" and by 1980 most of the system was finally built and all joined together and the first time for promise what an interstate system would change to what it is. And people were charmed by it. By 1980, everyone was to a large extent a "highway interstate" in the sense that by then everyone had used its parts and knew how it worked and how it was different from other roads in that they had no red lights or stopwatches, on and off the ramp, and that went to places that were previously less accessible. Until 1980, anyone could ride anywhere without having to stop for anything except food and sleep and a bathroom. And that was all new. The end is anti-climatic and it's not satisfying, though its one spectacular moment. What is great is that it is not the destination that makes Honky Tonk Freeway timeless despite the fact that it is such a product of its day. Forget its name; Instead let you take the memory strip.
