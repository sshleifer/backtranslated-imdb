This is whodunnit in the Hitchcock tradition. You are kept in the dark as suspects come and go. Dennis Quaid is supurb like Dexter, a man sentenced to death and Meg Ryan excellent as his child. He doesn't like this little tension, and all pieces fit neatly as they should. You won't regret watching it if you like tension.
