The horror image that eventually got into a parody, but still in it, could scare a few of those who are frailly nervous or easily disgusted when they see what's under their skin. Still, I laughed at her. It was easy to decipher the true killer and his actions didn't help. It just made Potente look even better. Anatomy is not much of a horror picture for the strangers of this genre, but the contained ones should get some unintentional laughter and an interesting highlight in the German horror movie. 6/10
