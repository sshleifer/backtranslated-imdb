It has to be said that this film is definitely one of the better "bargaining" films out there - I would feel a little cheated if I paid £ 15 for it. than my money. The film can't quite decide whether it wants to be "Mad Max" or one of the people of "Clint Eastwood" who doesn't have western spaghetti, and as such is a cliché from both. Even the manic loony that hangs with the bad guys in "Mad Max" is there. <br /> <br /> The guy from "Blade Runner" also manages a good bill, even if he only appears at the beginning and end of the movie. Favorite bit - punching at the top of an oil refinery - if you look carefully, you can see a "post-apocalyptic" rush hour that thundered in the distance. as two protagonists knock down seven bells from one another. <br /> <br /> Get a few lagers, a couple of pizzas and sit back and enjoy what's finally a light but fun drivel.
