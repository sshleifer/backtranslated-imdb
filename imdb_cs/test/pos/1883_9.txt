I saw it last week during a tour of Bruce Campbell's book. I thought it was amazing. Almost everything I would expect from the science fiction film Bruce Campbell. His campy and very funny. Ted Raimi was also cheerful and very goofy. The storyline is crazy, the American business man goes to Bulgaria and is killed. Stacy Keach plays a mad scientist who saves / brings Bruce Campbell back to life by implanting half the brain of a former KGB who has turned. Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge his death and has many internal arguments between himself and the KGB agent. The film has all the great Bruce Campbell slap stick and humor. The movie is somewhat predictable, I knew that once a woman was killed, she would share the brain with the killer. However, I did not go to this movie because I thought it would have an Oscar-winning script, I went to see it because it was Bruce Campbell's science fiction film and I wasn't disappointed. I highly recommend that you visit him on his book tour or wait and watch him on the sci-fi channel next month. Although he said before the film that the Sci-Fi channel cut out a movie from him to make him TV friendly. If you are a Bruce fan, I highly recommend.
