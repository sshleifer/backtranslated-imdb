The Psychopath (1973) A trip to memory. I saw this movie many years ago on old black and white t.v. Mr. Rabbey, a child show host, revenges the brutal abuse that parents cause to their child fans. Mr. Rabbey (who seems to be always on the verge of loss) will eventually burst and decide to go on a hunting trip. Beware of bad parents because Mr. Rabbey is on the hunt! What happens next is priceless. However, trying to find this movie will be a pretty chore. What makes this movie remarkable was the fact that Joe "Maniac" Spinell made a short promo film reel based on this. In his unfinished film, he plays Mr. Robbie, T.V. A clown (who looks like a pudgy from the shape of Edward James Olmos) who has avenged his young child abuse fans by going after his parents. Unfortunately, Mr. Spinell could never find funds to complete the project. The film will be called Maniac II: "Mister Robbie". Rabbey or Robbie similarities are too close for convenience. Quite violent for P.G. film. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
