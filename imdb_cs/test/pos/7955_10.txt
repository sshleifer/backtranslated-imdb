This movie would give typical Hollywood "tearjerkers" to shame. The depicted emotions are very comfortably subdued and underestimated. The story is pretty clich√© with the main role of terminal illness (it's not a spoiler and was well established pretty early in the movie) The method of execution is somewhat unique from most love stories you've ever seen - even a kiss hasn't been exchanged, yet you'll feel a huge stream of love both leaders. Initially, I assumed that this "limitation of emotion" is something similar to the typical "Eastern values", but later decided against it. This film is so underestimated that if you compare it to films like "Cinema" Paradiso, CP would feel overtly manipulative in comparison. So it's definitely not every cup of tea. <br /> <br After watching the movie, I have this strong feeling that Holly-wood loves movies (or beloved movies all around to be exact) that celebrate romance or passion and label it "love." I'm sure we all have our own definition and I wouldn't say that these qualities are mutually exclusive, but I'd dare to say that the movie lets you wonder if there is any added dimension you have with your beloved person. <br /> <br /> It's very much It is obvious that I like this film very much, and because the film is so simple, it is paradoxically one of the "movie" films I have seen recently.
