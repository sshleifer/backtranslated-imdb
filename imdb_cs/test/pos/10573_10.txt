This movie was incredible !!!! I didn't know what was happening on my back, so I needed to let it spread on my DVD. It had many twists and turns, but it kept the story fresh and exciting. Elaine Cassidy was in Brilliant just like Sally Hawkins. The storyline is rich in credible occurrences, as well as new ideas from the present. There's really something in Mrs. Cassidy's eyes that leaves a "mark." This film is a refreshing look at the way we look at "Victorian times" and how we perceive it. Very valuable watch.
