SPOILERS Each major mode uses the media of the country to its own goals. Whether the Nazi bans of some leaflets or the television Chinese alternative to Tianamen Square, governments have been trying to influence people through different media from the beginning of time. However, in 1925, the Russian Communist government celebrated the unsuccessful revolt of 1905 and supported the emergence of this film, the Potempkin Battleship. Big piece of film history, still powerful and beautiful. The crew aboard the Potempkin warship is unhappy. In miserable living conditions and worm-infested food, they are angry with their higher-class suppressors. But now it is enough after the rotten food. The leadership of Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), the crew to turn to their masters and fight for their freedom. <br /> <br /> As for propaganda goes, "Potempkin Battleship" is perfect. The film, a positive light for the first unsuccessful Communist revolt, was a useful Soviet tool. Eighty years after the release of the films, and the USSR disappeared completely off the map. The amazing thing about this movie is that while the country whose message was meant to have disappeared, the film remains a powerful and worthy piece of cinema. The film, written and directed by Sergei Eisenstein, is a surprisingly delightful movie to watch. It is true that this is far from what we would consider "entertainment" today, but the film is a beautiful work of art. Whether it's scenes on board a ship or the often spoken scenes at Odessa, everything about this movie is perfectly done. Music is powerful and dramatic, lighting is flawless, even playing, even if it's a bit exaggerated, it's perfect for this piece. Basically, there is no way to make this film the final product. Praising a country that has not existed for fifteen years makes it difficult for us to know all the moods that film inspires. But it is beautiful as a work of art. Beautiful from start to finish, it's far from easy watches, but it's well worth the effort.
