Ignore comments from everyone else for this movie and watch it on a paid cable (like me) or rent it. You owe it to yourself. This movie is what movies are about (supposed to be). Hard to categorize (and God knows how it was perched as a "high concept"!), But this is one for angels. Check it out. What do you have to lose?
