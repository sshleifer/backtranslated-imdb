Yes, I'm an FF7 fan, but how many people watching this movie won't be? So I reviewed this film from the perspective of an FF7 fan and without regret. (I wouldn't know how to adequately review a movie for someone who didn't play FF7.) <br /> <br /> Visuals - 10/10 I loved Advent children. It's sensory pleasure - complete audio-video overload. The visuals were breathtaking: some performances were made by simply not realizing that it was possible with the animated feature. When the action scenes came, they were a roller coaster for lack of a more precise word. With the dramatic movement of the camera, moving in a wide range, to the seamlessly integrated bullet-time effects at decisive moments, to the absolute level of detail - it's just hard to blame. The animation looks great in budget, style and images are amazing, and the effects have sometimes forgotten that I watched animation rather than live action shots. I could hang out for hours repeating the fantastic quality of visuals, but it just didn't do any justice. <br /> <br /> Sound - 10/10 The sound was great. The voices for all the characters did not disappoint (no one sounded stupid) and the sound effects were bold and sharp. The music - from the game, which (in my opinion) had the best EVER soundtrack, was beautifully transferred to the film. Most of the unforgettable game themes are present in the movie, although they often use different instruments to better fit what's going on. From time to time, some bolder rock and light music of thrash metal music appeared on really intense action scenes, but everything was well suited to the film at the appropriate time. Story - 7/10 story and characters would be the main drawbacks of the film. Both aspects were just not so balanced with the game - but then again the game could spend 40+ hours developing these points - the film is only about 90 minutes long. As far as the story is concerned, the conspiracy was not bad or nothing, but not as ambitious as expected from someone who played the game. In fact, the plot seemed rather weak in comparison. The game was so extravagant with complicated plot twists and story development / development that the film never had a chance to compete in the same league. Instead, the film took a more rational approach - expanding into action and trying to place as many internal jokes and themes into itself instead of attempting to impossibly restore the massive story factor, which was originally such a driving force in the game. The lack of Materia usage also caused me some controversy - the film's story decided to use little (though not ZERO) Materia, and instead plenty of supernatural combat abilities and skills. I would hope that if the sequel were done, it would incorporate much more extravagantly and significantly into the film. There were also many conspiracies in the movie - all that can be forgiven if you think Advent children are random anime, but it seems ridiculous when you realize how it was based on a game that made a tremendously good graph. Characters - 7/10 Characters, while all present in one or the other form, do not necessarily shine on their true potential. There's just not enough time to shoot with everyone. So all their background stories and abilities are not completely presented, and in some cases hardly at all (Red and Cait Sith leave absolutely no lasting impression). Even Cloud, which is the focal point of the film, feels that it does not use enough of its well-known skills from its games. The question of Materia is a strong reason for this. It has been said that it is a pleasure to see how he plunges back into action, even if it is in a role that does not use them fully. However, the new characters caused me most of the disputes - Bad Guy Trio and Denzel Dude - each of them lacked explanation. Anyone who is willing to use his imagination can probably fill in blanks with something reasonable and to do with it, but objectively speaking, this problem is still commented and is a bit disappointing. <br /> <br /> Value - 10/10 Replay the value of this movie is excellent - I personally want to watch it again in a bigger and louder way - bigger screen, louder volume. Enjoyment - 10/10 Whatever the film's faults, they just weren't big enough to prevent my enjoyment of it, and frankly I think it will be the same for most people. I enjoyed Advent Children very much and encouraged FF7 fans to see it.
