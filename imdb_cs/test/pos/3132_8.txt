Travis and Sandy (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr.) are horse traders forced to sell their animals to the Mormon Group and lead them across the border to the settlement. They do not expect to meet the notorious Clegg killers, the injured leader Uncle Shiloh (Charles Kemper). Ward Bond depicts Elder Wiggs, the main voice for the Mormon group, who moves the wagon train to the Lord. Along the way, they also meet "Doctor" Locksley Hall and his "Hoochey Koochey Wagon" and lend them help. during a rough carriageway. The film has a wonderful cast composed of actors with Nara a true star in a movie that is actually a blessing to see if not just to change tempo. Young Johnson and Carey, Jr. drop out well, but this is Bond's film, which is supposed to shine when it has the best lines. Johnson is the one who seems to understand ruffians and brutes as Shiloh, and will surely come in handy when a certain conflict can develop when the Clegg boys ride alongside. He is one of his best and least-valued westerns and seems to be flowing very well.
