Written by brilliant Monkees' television writers Gerald Gardner and Dee Caruso, WHEN THE ROAD TO FRONT was the last of "Jerry Lewis" films until "Hardly Working" almost ten years later. Jerry's comedy is obviously an appetite, and can certainly be his worst enemy at times when he acts as a producer / director - but even in the most hearty films, there are always moments of brilliance. When you can be fun, funny and yes, pretty funny. It's somewhat unlike any of the typical Lewis films. The pace is very positive and there are a lot of great players - some JERRY HOGANS HEROES. The whole thing looks like an unplugged TV pilot and you'll either love it or hate it - but hopefully YOU WILL BE YOU
