Tiffany's sexy killer (Jennifer Tilly) still wants the life of a fianc√© with a former friend, crazy killer Charles 'Chucky' Lee Ray. Taking her hands on the disfigured doll Good Guy, who last played his ghost, and made a patch, performs a satanic ritual that returns the life of his toy. Unfortunately for the poor Tiff, the animated maniac is not interested in marriage, so he gets caught in a cage with a doll for the bride for the company. Eventually, somewhat angry Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) escapes by his restrictions, Tiffany's electrocutes in the bath, and traps her soul in his 'bride' as retribution. Realizing that they are now both in Plastic Pair put aside their differences and decided to head for Hackensack, New Jersey, where they can lay their hands on a magical amulet that can move their spirits into human hosts. Tricking a trailer park a piece of Jesse (Nick Stabile) and his tasty girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl) to bring them to their goal, psycho dolls let go of a murderous rampage, with their unconscious companions copying blame. Although the idea that a baby doll belonged to the spirit of a mass murderer was always rather comical, it wasn't until the fourth film in the children's play that creators fully embraced the absolute madness of the premise and decided to play. things a lot more for laughter than for scary (though for us there is still plenty of OTT splashes for us). The talented Hong Kong director Ronny Yu oversees the management, skilfully translates the humorous language - scripts into a smooth and thoroughly enjoyable movie ride. Likewise, the excellent cast can handle the material of the camp perfectly when Stabile and Heigl make a nice couple, but they smoke hot Tilly who steals the show as Tiffany, the mini-plinth temptress. The impressively expressive effects of Kevin Yagher's doll also have a great impact on making the film so successful. Overall, this film is unlikely to find many fans among "serious" horror enthusiasts, but those who like a special place of thoughtless entertainment popcorn, full of twisted, black humor, crazy death scenes and gorgeous clippings should have an explosion.
