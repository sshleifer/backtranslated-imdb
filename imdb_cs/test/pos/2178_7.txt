This movie was definitely not very sophisticated. No, humor was actually pretty stupid now, when I think about it. But even though I think about it, I laughed - proving a decent comedy doesn't have to be very deep. Fatty Arbuckle is the clear star of this short film, although Buster Keaton appears in the film. It's a butcher in an ancient grocery store. There were a lot of stupid things in the store, and I think I laughed the most in the coffee grinder - you have to see for yourself. In any case, Fatty's girlfriend is forced to go to a girls' school and because she can't get to the side, she puts on a tow and breaks into school. Arbuckle is one ugly woman! So, for silly and sophisticated entertainment, check out this movie. It won't change your life and it's a very mild picture, but it's also fun.
