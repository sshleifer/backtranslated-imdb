The Tourist Trap (1979) is an entertaining horror film from the late 1970s, a film about a lot of young friends who are stuck on an old, deserted lane of a haunted old wax museum. The museum owner appears to be a strange but harmless old man, but things are very ugly when young group members start killing who's responsible for murder, it's an old man Slausen or it's his collection horrible dummies, seems to be alive and hunger for blood !!!! This movie was good, it was a quick movie, the performances were very good from actors / actresses (Tanya Roberts was very sexy) and the movie was never boring, and as I said, he had some very scary scenes so be prepared to hide under the covers! We definitely recommend horror / fan ghosts! This film gives me a very good 7.2 out of 10.
