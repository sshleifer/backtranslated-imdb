I don't know how I would feel if I lived in the US. I would like to look at some preview scenes, ads, I would know Sidney Pollack ordered it, Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas played it. I would watch this movie as soon as possible without reading any bad reviews. Would I be disappointed? <br /> <br /> I've read a lot of testimonials that are said to be wrong with this movie: This is a boring, long film without a passion of emotion and it's not interesting. Harrison is wooden, cold. Sub-doses should be cut out. Too serious, especially for Harrison Ford. I'm interested in this subject and I like Harrison Ford in non-action movies. I also like Sidney Pollack and Kristin Scott Thomas. Then, reading reviews on the IMDB website in other locations in February in Hungarian film magazines, I wondered and wondering what a film was. Anyway, there are movies, directors, stars, what / who want to see through any reviews. I understand people who think this film is boring and cold and has no passion, but I feel different. It is true that I like Sliding Doors, Forbidden Woman (this is a French film, I do not know what its name is in English or in French). The basis of these films is the development of love. <br /> <br /> I think Random Heart is a nice and interesting movie in its own way. It may be true that the Sublots -the Congress elections and police investigations after a spoiled policeman are not well written, are not processed in detail, but add something to the leading woman and man. work. He will be a suspect and almost lose his best friend (then a woman). The film shows two ways to survive the tragedy: the death of our wife / husband and cheating. One is a woman: this is a tragedy, but life continues. He doesn't want to grieve forever. What she wants to know - what her lover - the cop's wife - thinks about her never learns. She is forced to act like that. Elections come and anything about his husband can become a scandal. She wants her daughter not to be disappointed with her father. The man is a cop. He suffers from living in a lie. He wants to know - maybe in this situation all men want to know - when his wife started cheating on him. How long had a lover? She needs female help, but she doesn't want to, but the guy is stubborn and persistent. A woman cannot endure him because she always enters her life and cannot forget. Their relationship is tense at first, then slowly develops a kind of quiet sympathy that prefers an alliance against the outside world, a tragedy. (I said this despite the fact that they liked it in bed) But a cop can't stop by investigating, can't stop closing, and can't allow a woman near him, but he starts "love" and the woman wants their relationship to continue. But he can't. Woman realizes it. The end is a bit sad but logical and at the same time pleasant. It was nice when I saw Peter Coyot again - I like the face of this man - Sidney Pollack. I barely knew Bonnie Hunt, but she was good. I think Harrison Ford did a good job. His ear flap is unusual, but at first I believed that a woman was fond of her company despite her temperament. Too bad he had no joke. But Ford has a good sense of humor. The reviewer noticed (in Hungary): "Ford is charismatic against his haircut and ear drip, and we're waiting for his presence and I want him to smile at us and make an ironic warning. smiles and it's good. I agree with the rest. I really like it in this role. He's a good actor from a bit of a bitter, colder, but somewhere in his soul, a smart cop. But she is really a woman who will become undecided and find support for the police. Two cool, reserved people will find each other. <br /> <br /> Maybe the script isn't good. It is full of ordinary, trivial punishment, but there are some funny sentences from the woman and the movement, especially from the man. It's a good movie, but not for everyone, not for a big audience. I looked at women under 18 and men over 45 enjoyed this film better. About the second, maybe Sidney Pollack made this film for his age group that doesn't go to multiplex. Anyway, I advise people who like energetic conspiracy with action scenes who, like the Ford action movies, are missing this movie.
