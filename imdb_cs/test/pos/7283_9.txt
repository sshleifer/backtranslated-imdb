A good movie, all the elements of good movie there were, story, actors, script and direction. All the while I was on the edge of my headquarters. No problem is the low budget movie, but I liked it more than many big movies. Andres Bagg plays Martin Sanders, who deals with his unfaithful wife. Then voice on the phone and then just worry. Virginia Lustig is beautiful and delivers powerful performance. She is an excellent part of the film. I liked the growing ambiguity at the end, even though we know that the main character can be involved, we have seen everything from his point of view and asked: Who is the killer?
