away with the wind and scarlett's two different movies they were never meant to be compared apparently the original actors in gwtw are all died and deserved their own separate award and praise loved gwtw and never really expected the sequel to be made or ever live \ t gwtw, but to my scarlett shock was just as well written by the director and acted as a scarlett gwtw in his own right deserves as many awards now i can honestly say i dont know which i like better i think the scarlett script was like number 1 perfect 'like continuation. Bravo! producer director and all actors Bravo! AS sequels rarely live their sake name this one equals its predecessor. For those who don't like it missing a point and a big end to a phenomenal beginning
