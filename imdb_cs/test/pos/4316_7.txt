Indeed, Cynthia Watros is in this film as Elizabeth talk to Desmond. While I was just wondering how ended up as a 'rehabilitation patient' (?), Where Hurley is also there trying to reduce her weight (as seen from previous episodes). The last episode is really suspended. The end is not so intelligible. I think the writer expected the audience to come to season 3. <br /> <br /> I hope the next season will give light more unclear / hanging events that have occurred. Just can't wait for season 3.
