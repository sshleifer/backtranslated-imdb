This is the best TV series for children (and adults). John Hurt is a great actor with many excellent performances for many years, but was born to play the narrator. Scripts for almost every episode are excellent pieces of crafts, and the productions run a range of emotions that are alternately funny, sad, happy, exciting and always terribly beautiful. It's hard to choose the best episode from so many great opponents, but "Soldier and Death" with a timeless pathos is unmatched. It's a series that looks with your kids over and over again.
