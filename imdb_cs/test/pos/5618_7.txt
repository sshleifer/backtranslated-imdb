I think Samuel Goldwyn tried to do two things in this movie. The first film is a tribute to Jasch Heifetz, considered the best violin virtuoso of the last century. Second, when they brought the children of Dead End to their screen with the same title film and saw them sign with Warner Brothers, he tried to create a second group of appealing urchins. Although the film was good, it was certainly not desirable for the children of this film to be redirected to another function. The gang leader is Gene Reynolds, who at that time was playing the violin, but is now leading a street gang of undisputed urchins. His stepfather, Arthur Hohl, breaks the violin his late father gave to young Reynolds and threatens to send him to school reform despite his mother's weak protests Marjorie Main. Young Reynolds accidentally runs into a music school run by an old musical maestro himself, Walter Brennan and his daughter Andrea Leeds. They take over, but they have a lot of financial problems with many creditors led by Porter Hall. This film is mostly seen today because it is an opportunity for lovers of classical music to see and hear Jasch Heifetz, which, as you collect, is a solution that is a problem for everyone. Joel McCrea is also in this film, but has a rather colorless role as a friend of Andrea Leeds. Apart from Heifetz, one thing the film does is touch, though carefully on the subject of child abuse and abused spouses. Arthur Hohl is one moderate man and Marjorie Main is a very clearly battered wife. The kids in the cast behave well, Reynolds, Tommy Kelly, Terry Kilburn and a young girl named Jacqueline Nash who grew up and performed as Gale Sherwood, partner of Nelson Eddy. She had a nice soprano as a child. But it's Heifetz you see.
