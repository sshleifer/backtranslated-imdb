Barbara Stanwyck probably didn't think about it, but it's a relief to see her more in becoming a dark hairstyle (unless it was a wig) than the one she had to wear in "Double Indemnity" a year ago. The film, while the premiere of "film noir" and a versatile great movie, gave her a big role, but oh that hair. Here it is more elegant and certainly not femme fatal, but it's definitely 40 years old. She is used to life without men, because most of them are gone in the war, and as a successful Martha Stewart as a commentator, she writes a domesticated column in which she describes her country home as the camera shifts over what it actually is. We meet her boss, Sydney Greenstreet, who has no idea that she lives a lie, and when she sets out on a journey to Christmas at the supposed Connecticut home, she has to come up with her husband (Reginald Gardiner) and the child than we can say "Jingle Bells". Hungarian Chef S.Z. Sakall enters to help and ends up in cutsey pie one on one with Irish Una O'Connor. "It's not a stew, it's an Irish Stew". Sakall simply takes the paprika, pours most of it and says, "Now it's a stew," totally changing what she prepared for lunch. Then, when it comes to flapjacks, he turns and digs. For years, a couple of my friends and I will use this line every time the pancakes appear in the conversation. "I don't. Neither does Greenstreet play one and says, "I've never opened my life in me." O'Connor can get nervous when he slips back into some movies over and over, but here he is beautifully loving and her pairing with Sakall is very charming. It is clear in the Romanesque department that Reginald Gardiner is not a cup of Barbara Stanwyck's tea, especially when he meets a handsome Dennis Morgan who is a little confused about bathing a baby who eats soap, which makes Stanwyck a little scares. He should suspect something, but not. But it does not matter. The film is so enchanting with the snow-filled rural environment, the amount of rocking chairs and the dog running when the sled comes. Living in New York after 25 years in Los Angeles after I grew up in a small town on the west side of New York, I missed that Christmas. While Central Park is beautiful after the first snow and the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center is also an exsquisit, there is something that looks at the snowy field of trees, and the occasional glimpse of deer, rabbits or other wildlife. This is a great holiday movie that can also bring on the Christmas spirit out of season, and makes a great pairing with another Barbara Stanwyck country Christmas movie, "Remember the Night", an underrated gem. Add "Big Me Meet John Doe" to the Big City, and you may have found one of the busiest stars of holiday movies around.
