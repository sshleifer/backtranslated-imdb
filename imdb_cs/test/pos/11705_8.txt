This is the first feature film by Australian comedian Mick Molloy. Mick wrote a film with his brother Richard with the help of John Clark, another comedian and actor. Mick & John also plays a leading role along with several other iconic Australian actors - Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson et al. The basic premise of the film is that slimy Jack Simpson (Mick Molloy) has become a member of the Bowl Club for only the purpose of getting free parking near his work. The club is in terrible financial trouble and calls on Jack to help him. John Clarke plays clubs arch nemesis - he tries to take the club to the end and turn him into a "Poker Machine Slum" by Jack and other club members to try and rescue the club with many witty twists and turns and Jacks redemption. That's a pretty smart little movie. It's over usual Mick Molloys humor. It's pretty well written and well done. Older Aussie actors are brilliant (Bill Hunter, Monica Maughan and Ors). The film stretches rather than on the neck, but adds the magic of the film. There is a low level of rough language.
