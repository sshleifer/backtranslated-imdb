Absolutely one of the top 10 Ever! The absolutely necessary learning experience for all music fans - especially young rock / punk fans today ... understanding the beginnings of some "artistic" movement absolutely requires understanding the roots of music, as well as thinking and music environment times .... not to mention political and social factors, which were at that time And besides all this, this documentary rock-n-roll FUN !! Do not miss !!! it said, can anyone tell me when, if at all, "the decline of Western civilization" ... part 1, (not part 2, metal version) will be available again .. fast on DVD?
