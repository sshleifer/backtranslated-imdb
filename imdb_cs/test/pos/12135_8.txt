So you think you've seen every Mafia movie ever! Here's one that no one has heard about. It's a low-budget, fast-paced B movie - shot in Jersey swamps. For us crowds-movie fans, it had a little everything - sex, violence, curse, and wise guys acting like "gafones". While violence dominated the film, I found myself laughing at some of the famous scenes I saw at The Sopranos and Goodfellas. Check out the 1977 version of "Badabing Girls" at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> All of our favorite gangster stereotypes have appeared here. And as for realism, "fugettaboutit"! Joe Pesci was excellent, depicting the classical figure of the sages, as we have seen him so many times over the years. It was probably his first shot and it was a gem. Pesci fans should run to the video store and watch this movie. You have to look at it carefully because it's different names. My copy was called "Family Enforcer". Here it is known as "Death Collector". But whatever it is, it should be called the Winner.
