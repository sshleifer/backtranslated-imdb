I know little or nothing about astronomy, but still; At first I was a little skeptical about the plot of this movie. It follows three children who were all born during a solar eclipse and thus have no emotions, and thus (naturally) become ruthless serial killers. The story sounds ridiculous at first, but once you realize that the solar eclipse is blocking Saturn and, as you know, Saturn is the planet of emotions, it all falls into place; it makes perfect sense, and then you know that you're just not following another stupid 80-year-old slasher with a pea chart. Thank God for that! Seriously, though, Bloody Birthday is based on a ridiculous assumption, but it's more than what's related to it. Having a lot of kids going around people's defeats may not be the most exquisite masterpiece ever seen in a movie, but when I chose the 13th clone between this and the other boring Friday - I know what I would choose. Also helps the movie out of the hole that some people would think it's a stupid conspiracy dug into is the fact that it's very fun. Many slasher becomes too fast and the audience looks to see just some gore. This film, however, keeps itself going with some great fearsome shows from children (which returns back to haunted children's classics such as the Damned Village), a constant stream of ill humor and small, but impressive for the type of film, tension and tension. One thing I really liked about this movie was a huge variety of weapons. There is nothing worse than a slasher, where a killer uses the same weapon over and over again (coughing Halloween cough), but that's not the case because Bloody Birthday finds room for everything that jumps the ropes to bows and arrows. There was no room for a chain saw, which is a great pity, but I don't think every movie can have a chain saw.
