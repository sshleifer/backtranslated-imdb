I think the dirty dance was a great movie, they tried to make another night in Havana, which was good, but it was nothing like a dirty dance. I would like to see another dirty dance with the same people. without them I think it would be a mess. Many times the movies are then then when they try to add to others they start changing people making movies to go down the hill. I'd like to see that the dirty dance has another to see what happened after they were able to be together. Patrick and Jennifer did it well. This movie was made in 1997 by his time to do another. But this time to start where it ended to keep the same people in it.
