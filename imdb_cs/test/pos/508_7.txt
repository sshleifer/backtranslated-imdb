'Blade' would be an extremely above-average comic book, a vampire-hunter / horror action if it wasn't for two minor mistakes. # 1 I loved to see all but the invincible Blade / Snipes doing its slicing and slicing but the whole "Yes!" Fist / Strike was literally a drop. # 2 Bad, don't make it horrible, CGI ?? even for 1998. This is mainly in the last third, but some have spread. Well, despite these minor offenses, I really enjoyed this movie. All the actors were doing suburban work, and the fact that it now looks like another "Matrix" rip-off is cheerful because it came out a year ago. So maybe 'Matrix' copied 'Blade'. In any case, it's a very film for a more genre-loving audience: Comics Book Geeks, Action Fanatics, and Horror / Vampire Lovers. So we have Blade, half man / half vampire, or "day walker" and his success, Whisler (la "Batman and Alfred"), who fight the undead, who seem to be almost countless people. Who knows? In the rare act of mankind (Blade is more antihero) our sword ninja / vamp saves the newly infected (coincidentally) blood specialist / doctor. Meanwhile, there is a problem among the vampires, as man (you guessed it) has the highest power and needs to get Blade somehow. It's not the most original concept if you read what I just wrote, but still very nice. You will want to see Blade succeed, you will take root in spite of its imperfections and mannerisms. And you'll know what's coming because it's a typical 1-2-3 act from the comics movie introduction. But watch it without trying to go too deep. Like Vampire SPF-1000 "sunscreen"? Really? What about the scalp? Wouldn't it still be? Like the money they burn on weapons? Well, I'm going too deep. Sit back and enjoy the techno full of fun.
