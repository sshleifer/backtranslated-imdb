Is that a bad, crazy, predictable, cheap, lousy soap opera? "The best of all" is just such a guilty pleasure to me, something like "Valley of the Dolls". "Best" has it all. Someone gets pregnant outside of marriage (when is it the last time you heard THAT phrase?), There are things everywhere, drinking, backstabbing, jealousy, and even a tragic but not quite unexpected death. Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (delicious Stephen Boyd) are the centerpiece of the storyline. Their chemistry is immediate and is an adhesive that keeps this film too scattered. Suzy Parker, by the way, a great model, looks like Gregg Adams, an aspiring actress. the role that, according to all the biographies I read about her, apparently wasn't too long. But Parker is doing a surprisingly trustworthy job here, more than holding him for a couple of scenes against Louis Jourdan who plays David Savage. Jourdan probably took this role for money and a special screen loan because he was clearly heading for an aging star / has-been road. Diane Baker is fine as a naive, trusting April Morrison, Martha Hyer as Barbara Lemont has a particularly juicy story, and film legend Joan Crawford chews on her usual portrayal of scenery like Amanda Farrow, other roles like Jourdan's Savage that Crawford probably took a paycheck. There are some apparently dated dialogue and fence devices (this IS 1959) and the predictability of the soap opera genre. But if you like good soap like me, "The Best of Everything" will be more than satisfying you.
