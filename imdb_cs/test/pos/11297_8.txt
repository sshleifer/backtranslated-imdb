One of the great tragedies of life is that Disney is so successful in everything they do. If they weren't, we could have more unique little gems of animation, such as "The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird". The story is that the evil king usurped the throne of a place called Up-And-Down-Land (I could have a name wrong). Everyone hates him. His favorite hobby is shooting birds, and at some point in the past he probably killed Mr. Wonderbird's wife (a bird he played with Peter Ustinov's typical talent) and let him raise four young cubs. Meanwhile, we see that painting is another of the hobbies of evil. In particular, he made three paintings: a self-portrait, a picture of a shepherd (whom he loved) and a picture of a chimney sweep (who is jealous). One night the shepherd and the chimney sweep out of their paintings and run together. The King's self-portrait also descends from his frame and leaves with the real king (Do you think I'm doing this? It's a real conspiracy) and sends the royal police forces to the young lovers. Mr. Wonderbird then helps lovers try to escape the royal forces. The land is amazingly incredible and the Up-and-Down-Land setting is an incredibly imaginable place full of towering buildings. only lifts. It is the same mixture of worlds "Metropolis" and "1984" and Dr. Seusse. <br /> <br /> Watch it for a very unique viewing experience that doesn't match the standard pattern of most animated features.
