STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is in this world but not this world. His mind does not seem to understand things as an average person would do, and his life is a long disaster because he gets into constant disasters and distant, bad situations left to solve himself. he does not seem to mix with anyone and rarely speak. But he never gives up, and despite the simplest tasks that are a constant struggle for him, his own pernicious solution to the problem always pays off. Let's look at the sorry state of modern British humor, with all its focus on sex and general vulgarity, you'd be forgiven for forgetting that a show like Mr. Bean was made at once. There's nothing unsuitable, just good, pure U rated Tommy Cooper humor and the like made in the 1950s. And it is as funny as when I laughed out loud in the first 20 years when I was a young boy in the early 1990s. Although I can look at it a little deeper and see it there must be more to this character than to look at it. There must be a reason he does things the way he does, and he still doesn't seem to succeed. As others have pointed out, it looks like he may have a type of autism. In fact, I am so convinced that I think it was a professional psychologist who would analyze it, I think Mr Bean might be the first famous, fictional character to be diagnosed as Asperger's syndrome. <br /> <br /> If you'd like to see a really hilarious British humor, it's best to become obsessed with sex and vulgarity. Exhibitions like Little Britain work because it's well done, but it's just as vulgar as the rest. It turns out like this show we were more restrained and civilized once, and hopefully we could start putting this type of humor again sometime soon. *****
