I'm not sure where to start. In short, it was an unsatisfactory film. When I taught the novel, I realized that it would be a difficult story to turn into a film. The film has several interesting lines (mainly between Alfred and Aschenbach), but it is not a debate about art that basically forms the novel. For one I was expecting older Aschenbach and younger Tadzio. Tadzio is fourteen in the book, but he is described as pure, ideal, innocent, while in the film he prides himself on sexuality and is a joke. He is an accomplice to Aschenbach, always looking at him, almost provoked. In the book, Aschenbach, who steals the look of the boy. As for Aschenbach, I imagined something closer to a professor who turned to a clown in Blue Angel (based on the story of Brother Heinrich Thomas Mann) than this forty-year-old barely gray hair. I think Dirk Bogarde did a good job, but somebody else should do it, or he should look older at the beginning. I know that the discovery of homosexuality is important to the story, but the film minimizes the talk of art and duality between the Apollonian and Dyonisian inspirations, and focuses instead on Aschenbach's obsession with Tadzia and does not justify it. I liked the fact that Mahler's music was used because he eventually inspired Mann to write his story. I'm not sure Aschenbach turned into a musician. Or the creation of Alfred, whom I don't remember in the book. And one thing that really got to me was the sound and how it didn't match the lips of the actors. I wonder if it was dubbed because I expected it to be in Italian. But then I remembered that every Italian movie I was watching had this problem. It's just bothering me because these directors (Fellini is the second person I think about) are supposed to represent excellence in Italian cinematography, and here their characters laugh without sound, then you hear a sound that doesn't match their faces (I'm thinking about scenes when Aschenbach it almost collapses and starts to laugh.This scene could / should be the strongest, but instead it was annoying).
