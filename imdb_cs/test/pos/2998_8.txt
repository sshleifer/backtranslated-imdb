I don't want to go for it, many "heist" comedies, and maybe I don't care about this if it wasn't for the actor when it was, and when I made it first (just a few years later). It's almost too similar to "The Happening" (although it's probably a much less serious comedy than that) - the mafia character takes his own kidnapping, or rather turns in a completely different direction. Of course, Raquel Welch did not play such a sharp character as Faye Dunaway did in The Happening, but it is not even a sexist film - she practically played a stock character, almost HER in "minor"! But I'm totally biased - one of the first movies I've ever seen with her, and by the time I saw it, you couldn't turn around without seeing her poster (fortunately). I think Robert Wagner was really okay because neither thoroughly sympathetic nor indecent leader of the group, like Edward G. Robinson (naturally) and Vittoria De Sica. And Godfrey Cambridge, an actor who has always been funny.
