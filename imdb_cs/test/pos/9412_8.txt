Interestingly, someone made a comparison of "Fifth Missile" with the Star Trek episode. It should be emphasized that the original Star Trek TV episode, in which the Enterprise crew undergoes cosmic madness, while the orbiting planet Si 2000 is called "Naked Time", not "Naked Time". "Naked Now" refers to the first regular Star Trek next generation episode in which the Enterprise-D meets the science vessel. This episode, though, refers to and is based on the "bare time" of the original series one. Now, to Firth's Missile. While crew responses in Star Trek episodes were based on those that were similar to alcohol intoxication, the crew's status on the Montana deck was caused by a much more serious situation, namely the vapor of the paint emitted by the faulty surface of the bulkhead. There are few places where such a reaction could have more serious consequences than a crew that is responsible for such a serious crew on a ballistic missile submarine, and that is of course what makes the film so thrilling and such a thriller. The story is very believable. At the same time, this film, along with "Crimson Tide", "The Day After", "The Dawn's Early Light", "The Hunt for Red October", "Ice Station Zebra" and many other similar movies, give us a lot of understanding how easy things could go wrong and how easy it could be to start a nuclear holocaust. Fortunately, such an event has not occurred and (God willing) such an event does not occur.
