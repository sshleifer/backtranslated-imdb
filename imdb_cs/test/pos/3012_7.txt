Despite everything that is style and film invention, is it basically another serial killer thriller that follows the same kind of conspiracy favored by such old favorites as Silence of the Lambs? a team of cops follows a trail of (especially ugly) murders, someone else takes them and somehow has to know where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez 'sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to say all. This is where the film gets all new and different as we enter (through the 21st century CGI updates Dr is a kaleidoscopic favorite, fashion time tunnel) a kind of weird world of horrible crazy things happening around the world instead, controlled by D'Onofriom, now the kind of superior ruler of his twisted mental world, inside his comatose body. Sequences inside the mind are well realized and often quite overwhelming, all wires work well, gruesomeness is at its maximum if you like such a thing, but the hype around the whole thing has led to disappointment for me like I expected something completely new and unlike anything what I've ever done, not quite a successful blending of serial killers and special horror effects. Sometimes scary, often nice, fairly attractive stories told with care and attention by talented movie people, but by no means a big leap into the unknown that has been marketed as.
