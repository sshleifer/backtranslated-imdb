There are a lot of people on these 80s movies, but those people may not be over this time. I was just starting college when this movie was released, so I could really appreciate it at the time and my friends and I sometimes joke about certain lines in the movie. Just as I liked Sean Penn's Jeff Spicoli in the "Fast Times," I actually enjoy the character of "Tommy" Chris Penn. Spicoli. Chris Penn should probably make this movie in his video and use it to motivate him to lose some weight. Yes, a subplot with Randy Quaid, a Vietnamese veteran, seems a little out of place, but he plays a convincing job. If someone is out there who hasn't seen this movie, but they liked other similar movies like "Fast Times", etc. I highly recommend.
