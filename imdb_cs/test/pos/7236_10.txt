Another jewel in Troma Studios' film archives is Tromeo and Juliet (1996). Like The Toxic Avenger, Trom's War, Nuke 'em High, Terror Firmer and Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D. this film is an instant classic of Tromo. James Gunn updates Romeo and Juliet who with medieval tragedy and reinvision as a modern street punk drama. If you have read or read the game before anything has changed, except that it has been "tromatized". Lloyd Kaufman adds his own twisted vision to the script and makes it a very enjoyable movie. Actors handle the script very well. I was surprised how well they conducted the dialogue, much better than some Hollywood actors with a big budget and expensive files. I really enjoyed this movie. Lloyd Kaufman will not disappoint because you know what to expect from his films and other Troma productions. I'd rather watch one of his films and enjoy myself than watching a boring, expensive movie with pampered paid actors, lame scripts, lazy directors, and those terrible C.G.I. Special Effects. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. If you like fun movies with cheesy special effects, despite the best acting and inspired direction, then this movie is just for you!
