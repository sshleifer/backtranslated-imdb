Nigel Balchin's labyrinth-like novel "Journey Through Wood" was edited by Julian Fellowes, who also directs this "terribly British" drawing room tension. It is a film whose effect relies on casting depictions of various benign / malignant characters, and this is where Fellowes' directorial choices are excellent. The story has a linear, easy-to-follow line, but the beauty of the film is the metamorphism of each player as the only incident that ignites a minefield of disasters. James Manning (Tom Wilkinson) a successful business obsessed lawyer in London, married to Anna (Emily Watson), who needs more in her life: a childless couple lives in the country in a beautiful estate, with her long-term Cleaner "Maggie (Linda Bassett). They attend social tours and meet, among other things, William Bule (Rupert Everett), a passively lazy rich neighbor. Anne decides to entertain her neighbors and protest the harsh James protest Anne is planning: James takes care not to "take part in business". On a party night there is a hit and run accident in which Maggie's husband is accidentally killed by someone in the Range Rover (she observed). When James returns home, he sees a scratch on William's Range Rover and suspects William to be the perpetrator. Anne discourages James from going with the police with information - what can she do but destroy Bill's life as a sociality and a father and son of an important child? â€œ. From this first "lie" the virus spreads: James confronts Bill, who talks to James from the police, Anne admits it was she who managed Bill Rover and is responsible, James convinces Anna to keep her calm because it would It has destroyed his reputation, Anne admits to having an affair with Bill, and the three agree that they will stick to their great lies for greater good. Anne eventually succumbs to blaming herself for not telling her beloved Maggie that she is responsible, and Maggie, who is guilty of previous theft, whose life was saved by Anna's grace to hire her anyway, is an agent who draws the story to his surprising conclusion. Lies begat lies that spawned lies, et cetera. The main impact of this intrigue is the way in which isolated tragedy affects each of the characters involved. Every change in a dramatic way. Tom Wilkinson gives the best performance of a career full of brilliant performances: he is able to say more with his attitude and facial expressions than with any actor in front of the audience today. Likewise, the gifted Emily Watson adds another progressive role to the next repertoire, as well as the surprisingly charming Rupert Everett, who, while another wealthy British "gentleman", gives us a man who is also a spirit of spirit and yet is needed. And always subtle Linda Bassett has a small role and finishes her, so her character is quietly central to the chaotic network of lies. Tony Pierce-Roberts' camera and Stanislas Syrewitz's musical score uninterestingly come across more atmospheres. It is a file that plays in the best quality, which always means that the director (Julian Fellowes) has a fine shot on the work. The interplay of these fine people makes a very proficient story very well. Grady Harp
