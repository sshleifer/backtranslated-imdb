Even though I understand some of the points related to cinematography (I thought a more effective approach would support a low-fi, a sense of home cinema) I have to say that I thought the script and the work of WHAT ALICE FOUND were excellent! Dean Bell created a real gem that Judith Ivey charms with character-driven pleasure. Her performance of Sandra is a pleasure - she develops alternately as diabolical and romantic. We are immediately interested and discouraged by her actions ... and never give more information than necessary. Her and the supporting cast meet Bell's postmodern fairy tale with widely open weapons. Emily Grace's Alice is filled with doey-eyed magic. It seems to form us like clay before us, morphing into some beautiful, lost animal. By the end, we are contrary to the words as it is, to say goodbye to the mother. Kudosi should also be brought to Jane Lincoln Taylor - whose mother provides the right amount of tragic historic weight - and Justin Parkinson - whose shy first time John, Sam, is one of the sweetest, if not worst, sex scenes in the movie. Bell created a first-class story and put together a wealth of talents.
