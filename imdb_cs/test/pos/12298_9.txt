When Melville's "Pierre, or Ambiguity" hit the bookstore in 1852, his first publication from "Moby Dick" a year earlier, the public response was similar to that found among IMDB reviews "POLA X". The newspaper even published headlines like: "Melville Insane!" which, of course, was not. But when someone compares the typing styles found in "Moby Dick" and "Pierre", he finds a second major shift away from the simple and often declamation style found in the first. Obviously, he mimicked the too-florid style of the now-forgotten Victorian novels that easily overcame his immortal "Moby Dick." But he did not settle for the product his publishers wanted, and that would surely be sold. His version of Victorian romance was perhaps twisted, cynical, but perhaps brilliant in his synthesis. The alternative name: "Ambiguity" is quite appropriate. When Pierre seeks and thinks he will find out the truth, we are becoming more and more uncertain about what and to whom to trust. When he seeks happiness, he becomes more and more miserable. <br /> <br /> "POLA X" is a fascinating adaptation of this novel set in modern or almost modern France. Although in some respects he neglects the imagination and shows us graphically incestuous relationships that Melville could only imply, the ambiguities that make the novel and its message so appealing are perfectly tactical. The questions that arise are those that few films have asked, but the answers are left to the viewer. I recommend reading a novel that is much shorter than "Moby Dick", before seeing this movie. I hope more people find this irritating film.
