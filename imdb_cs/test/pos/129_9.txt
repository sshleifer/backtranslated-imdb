This intelligent, moving and beautiful film is a study of how people react to tradition (reminds me of the novels of William Faulkner). and look for ways to live within these roles rather than throw them away. But as the story unfolds, both women trapped in godless marriages gather. Based on the strength of their friendship and love, they give each other the courage to leave their roles. They found that life in their traditions is no life at all, it is a kind of living death Without passion, without true association with others, without fulfillment. Although they know that the price will pay for their rebellion and freedom, it is much less expensive than the sacrifice required by a comfortable, predictable existence. <br /> <br /> The scenario is amazing, impressive amazing. Close to perfect!
