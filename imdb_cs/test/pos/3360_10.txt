Often when TV series are transferred to a big screen, they lose their appeal. Not in this case! Historical accuracy in costumes, equipment and artistic direction, as well as TV series, is excellent. A good example of comedy and farce, with great scripts and comedy actors in the right parts. Based on a classic TV series that stands alone in the history of British TV comedy.
