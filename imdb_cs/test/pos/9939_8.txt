Finally, I managed to get a copy of Daria Argento's opera and I tell you ... it was time! It was Argento's latest film, which I haven't seen before and I'm a fan of most of his work. I think most of his work is extremely important to the horror genre, but some of his films tend to disappoint (like Phenomena). But the plot of the opera idea always attracted me and it turned out that I was right! I enjoyed every shot in Opera and this film fascinated me for the first minute to the last. Of all the Argento films, Opera went straight to number one and I hope I can encourage as many people as possible to see this. The opera's opera scenario and idea is quite simple. Especially compared to the previous movie Argento Phenomena, which had too many ideas in it, and it ended up a mess. The opera's story is creepy and frosty, but at the same time it is an excellent satirical commentary - almost spoof - to opponents of explicit violence. *** SPOILERS *** A young opera singer (beautiful Cristina Marsillach) is haunted by a terribly sadistic killer. During every massacre she commits, Betty forces her to watch his actions with open eyes. Needles are attached to the eyelids and torn when closed. *** END SPOILERS ***. To this simple - yet effective - idea, Argento adds a lot of horrible elements like ravens, classic piece (and curse) to MacBeth and the entire atmospheric location of the opera and music building. Especially the presence of haunted ravens is an extraordinary value. Ancient masters like Edgar Allen Poe already knew that these black birds had a lot of secrets around them, and Dario Argento knows that too. Violence and gore are very well presented in Opera, and that's what makes it a real Argento picture. His best is, in my opinion, Profondo Rosso second. I certainly hope to recommend this film to many people. Especially for fans of (Italian) horror business, it's an absolute must! Favorite "Rewind" -scene: Argento shows his visual talent the best in the scene where Betty's boyfriend gets in the eye while trying to figure out who's in front of the door.
