When people harp about how "they don't do 'em like them" then they just point out that to this fantastically fun, and curious looking, comedy horror movie by writer-director Glenn McQuaid. It's a graverobbers story (played by Dominic Monaghan and Larry Fessenden) who end up digging more than just quiet, still corpses. After the initial shock, they soon realize that they can actually turn the situation into their favor. And that's what he is trying to do. Remember, things do not seem to work as planned, because poor young Arthur (Monaghan) is actually related to his priest (Ron Perlman) before being taken to the gallows. Looking at the detail of his filmography, McQuaid seems to have taken over the core of his first short film and extended it to this endeavor, which is nothing wrong. Fessenden is returning and doing well, Monaghan is one of those guys who can still love you while he goes about the criminal business of stealing the dead and with other genre favorites like Perlman and Angus Scrimm on the scene. lots of fun for fans of genres. It also benefits from a unique and favorable design and appearance, sometimes changing from EC Comic-style panels to live action (and Creepshow), and it always feels like it. the authentic Hammer Horror is authentic. Maybe everything is just covered with so much dry ice, but that's next to that point. Whatever was done to capture everything on the film, it works. It works well. It may not have any real fears, but this movie has a big vein of black humor and definitely sucks every minute of its runtime in a haunted material that should please all those who have patience for the horror that is about something calmer and feels like it might have been done in Hammer days. See if you like: The Flesh and The Fiends, The Doctor and The Devils, Creepshow.
