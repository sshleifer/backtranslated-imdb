Okay, so that wasn't what I expected. I rented this movie just to see how it will be since I want to see first. But this film had a B-movie all over it. But when I saw it, I realized it was very funny. The First 30 Minutes It was just how a snowman killed people and one man lost common sense. But the first few minutes were something funny about him. When he throws the first of his little minions, I knew it would be very funny. They all act as gremlins in nine eighty four hit gremlins that it made it seem it was spoofing it and made me forget it was B-movie. So if you want to laugh rent this.
