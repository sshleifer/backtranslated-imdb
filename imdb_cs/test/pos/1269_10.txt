Excellent debut film for director Batman Begins, The Next, a film about a man who follows other people to inspire characters in the stories he writes. One man he follows decides to move on, and one turns out to be more than he negotiates. Using the cast of non-actors and his uncle, writing direction producing and otherwise completely performing this work of film entirely on its own with almost no budget and produced independently, this film is much more than you would expect. For everyone who likes Memento and complicated twists, turns, shocks and times with time, this is definitely a movie for you.
