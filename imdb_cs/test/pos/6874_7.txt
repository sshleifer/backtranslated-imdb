A near-wonderful blend of comedy, romance, and medical chaos has a 50-ish swinging single doctor, tired of going to rock concerts with nubile airheads, dating the patient his own age whom he met on his bikes. Julius Epstein's screenplay shows a decent sophistication, even though he doesn't have enough material to fill the last third of the picture, and one can almost feel the film slips. The hospital's subplot, which is being investigated for its clumsy business, is not satisfactorily resolved, and so is very fictional. Yet, Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson are a great team, Richard Benjamin and Art Carney very funny in support. Director Howard Zieff holds up everything that appears, and even if Epstein succeeds in rejecting Neil Simon, Zieff's zips set off happily. The results are dry and sometimes quite sweet. An unsuccessful TV series followed. *** of ****
