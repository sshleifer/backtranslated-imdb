Very happy that this excellent film is getting such high marks from IMDB users. The best years of their lives remain the finest film declarations about veterans returning from the war I have met. The best performance of the often overlooked Frederick March. In fact, the entire cast is lit, including the musical legend Hoagy Carmichael, which treats us all with a delicate version of his classic Lazy River. I would recommend this excellent movie to anyone who loves movies.
