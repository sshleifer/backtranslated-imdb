Neil LaBute has turned dramatically from the first two films In The Company of Men and Your Friends and Neighbors, with this humorous and original thriller / comedy / road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) testifies to the brutal murder of her unfortunate husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre kind of amnesia and flees in the car without knowing that there is a lot of medication in her trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the men who follow her. What Betty is chasing, besides the new beginning (even if she doesn't remember old life) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). The only problem: Dr. David is not real, it's a soap opera on the show "Reason To Love" and he's a really egoist actor named George McCord. To say something about what's going on would be too much, but Sister Betty is definitely original. His hitmani are, as well as hired Pulp Fiction killers, violent, but philosophical, his taking on the soap operas an amazing spoof material, and his acting is the best feature of all. It must be one of the best films in recent years. Renee Zellwegger is ideal for Betty's sister, with a steady flash in her eye that pushes her into her quest. Morgan Freeman brings a constant state of grace to the killer at the end of his career, and Chris Rock is his partner, a man of anger and great impatience. Greg Kinnear is best in his comics as a futile actor / soap opera doctor. There are also great supportive performances from actors such as Emmy-winner Allison Janney (West Wing), Harriet Sansom Harris (Agent Frasier Bebe Glazer), and Kathleen Wilhoite (Chloe on ER). Actually, he's an actor who is the actor of TV actors with the best character. The unique film, which is witty and cool next time, is Betty's mix of great acting, casting and amazing movies. screenplay.
