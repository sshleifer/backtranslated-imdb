A special relationship between a middle-aged woman and a transsexual woman who will soon be married. Charlotte and Venorica, both trapped in their lifeless lives, do not know how to get out of them. Charlotte is the owner of a beauty clinic, broke up with her aggressive former husband, moved to the apartment itself with all the furniture wrapped besides her big bed. Veronica lives with her poor dog on the ground floor, is sensitive and desperately bothered by her mother's visit and a bad relationship with her dad. Her only hope is that the upcoming transsexual operation will turn her into a real woman, and then everything will be fine. All he can do now is wait for a confirmation of approval. Then these two individuals accidentally meet each other and are all involved in the lives of others, among them there are sparks, but nobody is brave enough. to face the truth because they are unwilling to accept this change, as most people do. Finally, the end is quite satisfying and leaves us with some imagination to think about it. <br /> <br /> The director's great work makes me very impressed, manages the development of characters very well, the emotional atmosphere is quite full and intense. I'm also so obsessed with gloomy lights all over the apartment, Delphic, but full of desire. Two main characters play Trine Dyrholm and David Dencik, they are amazing in their roles, very impressive performance and the chemical reaction between them is real and convincing. This Swedish independent film is about meeting and changing, regardless of whether you are gay or heterosexual, male or female, the strangeness of life exists everywhere, whenever you encounter it, you will be hesitant and confused but at least don't worry, follow your heart and choose the right path.
