007's Goldeneye is one of the best N64 versions ever. <br /> <br /> Better than this game? Well ... Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Star Wars: I-Racer Episode and Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time are much better and excellent games. But I still love Goldeneye. This is the best adaptation from the movie, which is second to Star Wars adaptation. The story is perfect. It's like you're in the movie itself. <br /> <br /> The graphics are excellent. The movements are very realistic. Enemy's artificial intelligence is the best part of the game. I loved to play on stage where James and Natalya broke from the Janus base when Goldeneye prepares to burn him. Escape without ringtones was very difficult. Defining cameras and controlling fire are great aspects of the game. It's also the hardest game I've ever played. N64 games are usually very, very easy. Goldeneye is the only exception. I'm still trying to beat 00 Agent a difficult level, but winning an easier level was a big win. I loved when Alec Trevelyan asked, "For James James?" I said, "No, for me!" It just happened when I killed him. Just like in the movie. I like meeting every goal. <br /> <br /> The multiplayer game is even better. At first I killed every holy second. Now I know how to win. I like to force my teammates to play on a Kill License. <br /> <br /> Music and sound are amazing. Super Mario 64 looks like Atari next to this. All I wanted to hear was a song on the theme of Goldeneye that plays at the end of the movie. After Zelda was released, I almost forgot that I still had this game. It is still excellent, although it is already overcome. I hope that more 007 games will be produced. <br /> <br /> Fantastic Work Rareware! Nintendo was very smart to release this game exclusively on N64. The magnificent work of Nintendo!
