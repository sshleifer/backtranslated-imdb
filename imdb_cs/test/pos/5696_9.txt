While many people have found that this movie is too slow and simplified, I am really connected with it. There is no plot as such, but the film is a human survival story about three people who trapped a tree with a man who ate a crocodile lurking somewhere beneath them. Personally, I thought the performances were mostly very good, although the roles were very challenging and I felt the feeling of warmth for the characters. The situation they were in was pretty scary, and I'm really nervous for them. I found the whole movie quite nervous because of the utter helplessness of their situation and the constant threat of their survival. Crocodile effects have been surprisingly well done for such a low budget movie and believe me, I've seen my fair share of cruel croc movies. The creature moved well and had a real threat, and although the audience I was with did not seem too keen on the film as a whole, they still jumped and gasped as the crocodile appeared. <br /> <br /> Script-wise I would like to make a few changes, especially at the end, but it wasn't a big deal. For fans of the slow, fearsome horror that takes place in reality, it will be an engaging film, but unfortunately I think that for many viewers looking for an exciting ride and higher production values ​​from their movie experience, it will simply be missing.
