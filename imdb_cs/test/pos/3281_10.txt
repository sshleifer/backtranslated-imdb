The most popular Trey from the first season of the season 10, as well as one of my favorite favorites, Manbearpig, introduces Al Gore's adventure before embarking on global warming and surely an adventure before the film, Al Gore also tried to realize the world about something that could change Earth , something really dangerous, this time about something that is half human half bear and half pig, Al Gore meant just one thing: realize all the manbearpig and kill it! Al Gore is more than just merry, everyone who sees him is sorry and yes he can be childish, he makes anger attacks because no one trusts him, but he's just a f ****** demented bastard. Basically four children are trapped in a cave because of Al Gore, but he certainly doesn't have that in his mind, there is no room for another theme, he is just Manbearpig regarding Al Gore. The four kids are Cartman, Kenny, Kyle and Stan, essentially Stan liked AL Gore, and four boys just played in Al Gore, who never saw Gore kill them when he tried to kill Manbearpig. they're just kids, damn Manbearpig. ‚ÄùSo in this section we have all the stuff with the rescue team, which is also sorry for Al Gore, and on the other hand we've got a very good Cartman episode, and it's not a surprise for Cartman after finding the treasure inside the cave, surely the whole thing with this treasure is fantastic and great, because you will see sick Cartman in both senses, he is really sick for the boy and he is really sick for us and finally Al Gore killed Manbearpig! I am a cereal! Amazing fun in this episode, highly overlooked
