Much about the US The film can be summed up in its name. He draws parallels between the country's attitudes to war and the kind of Hollywood fake that celebrates things that should not be celebrated. I'm not sure if I agree that the filmmaker has decided on recent events (though, truthfully, I can't always tell where she stands), but I admire the unusual and artistic way to get to the point. Sound tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry, etc. Here they play as a visual role. Most of the time, the visuals of the story are accompanied by these sound elements in good effect. I'm so glad to hear that the radio was incorporated into the pace of the movie. In fact, most of the dialogue takes place on the story rather than on the characters. This does not mean that there are no "characters" (real people), but in addition to "Jim" the protagonist (some sort of "60-year-old with a devious mind"), others come and go very quickly. A few makes a very strong impression, especially a guru-like taxi driver who seems to be the voice of wisdom himself. When he goes into a spontaneous song of prayer while driving Jim into the subway, it is a very powerful moment. On the cover of the DVD there is a quote "Danger is Clear", which is taken from President Bush's speech, which paved the way for our invasion of Iraq. In retrospect, when he heard that the calm speech in the movie brought home, we live in a historically charged moment that will always be remembered.
