A team of tough New York police rangers led by a tough, tough Buddy Manucci (always playing always excellent Roy Scheider) goes after a group of ugly gangsters involved in the kidnap ring after one of them kills them. Director Philip D'Antoni, producer of "Bullet" and "The French Connection", strongly creates a strong, bold, sharply amoral tone with no nonsense, maintains a steady pace throughout the course, and sets off action scenes with considerable ripple vigor. Don Ellis's riveting string score continues to pump sur'n'rattling intensity, while Big Apple's scrappy location and harsh, grainy Urs Furrer cinematography both dramatically increase the overall eccentric realism. In addition, the subtle line distinguishing cops from criminals gets coldly blurred in this picture: the titular team uses cruel, brutal and morally doubtful tactics of strong arms as a means of ending the law for law enforcement and there is certainly no code of honor among criminals. and thieves who inhabit the grim urban underbelly, which is shown live in this film. Nice backing by Tony Lo Bianca as a lousy, torturous snitch by Vito Lucia Undertaker, Richard Lynch as a bad psychotic hoodlum Moon, Bill Hickman as Moon's equally cold-blooded partner Bo, Jerry Leon as a funky flatfoot Mingo and Joe Spinell as a parking garage attendant. An extremely wild and exciting protracted heart-in-your-throat mondo destructo car chase qualifies as a definite highlight. Also, a sliding explosion supplies mixed goods. Real bang-up little winner.
