Although I agree, it was a sitcom, the 1950s, I don't feel like it was "typical". First, Donna Reed was a STRONG woman, unlike regular 50 comedy comedies. She made an attitude for women's prize and equality (remembering an episode where a television announcer says "Just a Housewife") and Donna stands up for all women doing and representing, especially those that don't work out of home? And when women rebelled against something in the series, it wasn't something trivial ... there was always something that showed that women have the right to treat the same respect as men. Remember, Donna Reed was married to a show producer, so she had a much bigger share in making her a stronger character. Children were intelligent, but not premature. They were normal children. And they could ACT. Something else that made the Donna Reed Show stand out not only for the children who look like their parents, but also for the chemistry of all the actors in the real life situation, then came out in the characters. Shelly Fabares and Paul Peterson often wrote and remarked that they treated them as children of Donna Reed and Carl Betz, and that the adults were cruelly protected by child actors and treated accordingly. Donna and Alex also had somewhat sexual chemistry that was not seen at other family shows. And the characters could be wrong and the main ways, and yet accepted for mistakes and mistakes. They weren't super parents who had nothing wrong with their emotional highs and lows. They were normal people who act like normal people. Women's Rights, Drug Abuse, Child Abuse, Fathers, Poverty, Children in Need of Good Healthcare but Can't Afford ... All of this was shown at this show. Pretty pioneering time for the era. Donna Reed didn't stand for eight years without reason. And it might have been if it hadn't been for Tony Owens and Donna Reed's divorce. In summary, I agree with the original poster that seems to be interested in the show, but I think the Donna Reed show offers much more than casual entertainment.
