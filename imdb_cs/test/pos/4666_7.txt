* WARNING: SPOILER !! PLEASE DO NOT READ, IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE FILE TO GO !! * <br /> <br /> I originally planned to see this movie last weekend, but my plans ended up so I couldn't see the time. it. So he and my friend planned to see it after school. Boy, we're glad we did it. The film begins in Italy, with a planned robbery with a group of guys (Charlie Croker [Mark Whalberg], Steve Frezelli [Edward Norton], Lyle, also known as "Napster" [Seth Green, get the nickname later], Handsome Rob [Jason Statham] Left ear [Mos Deaf], and John Bridger [Donald Sutherland]) are planning a robbery to steal 32 gold bricks. This leads to a full opening that is good 10 to 15 minutes, and includes a boat chase that opens the movie up to the right. When Steve Frezelli leaves in his van, turns to the group, steals gold and kills John Bridger, who is largely the leader of the group. A year later, where Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), John's daughter, is one of the best safe biscuits that anyone can ask. Charlie Croker (who was actually indirectly responsible for her father's death, as he called him out from retirement for robbery) says they found Steve (who went into hiding), and wanting to get back on him for what he did \ t t. She at first drops, but later agrees, and teamgets back together, along with getting help from the Wrench (Franky G), a mechanic, performing the perfect robbery, in creating one of the biggest traffic jams in Los Angeles history. This movie is the perfect combination of action with funny pieces thrown throughout. There is an on-running joke about Seth Green's character, Lyle, creating Napster and how Shawn Fanning (who makes a portrait) stole it as he fell asleep, and eventually Lyle will only answer if referred to as "Napster". There's even a funny line of Seth in the movie. "He said in an interview that he called it Napster because he described his hair as if it were a diaper." The beginning and end of the sequence are purely brilliant, and everything fits perfectly. The only negative thing I can think of with film is that Edward Norton's acting was a bit weak. He wasn't a big, tough bad guy. He acted as if he was paid, and I was just doing a bare minimum (which is because he was forced to make this film due to a contractual obligation). But even though the problem is the only film, the movie is still very nice and I definitely recommend seeing it. And while you're not interested in the real movie, look at Seth Green shine in a comic role. He is perfect. Rating: **** out of *****
