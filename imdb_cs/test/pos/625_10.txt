This is definitely one of the most scary and serious films ever made. You stick to the movie from start to finish. While there are some holes in the plot, it's still exciting for the final showdown. In addition to "8 MM" and "Peeping Tom" it's one of the best films about "Snuff Movies", a taboo of our culture theme. If you like SCREAM Trilogy, you'll probably love that one.
