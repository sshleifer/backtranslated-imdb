I didn't realize how much of this episode came from The Enemy below, until I finally saw the film (since then it has become my fave war movie). There were also several elements from Run Silent Run Deep. Nothing wrong with stealing ideas if you're doing something cool with them. And the boy with Roddenberry and the company did something great about this thing. The story begins when the Romulans break the 100-year-old contract and cross the neutral zone, destroying a series of Federation stations along the zone. , reportedly testing their excellent weapon and invisibility screen (and the subsequent shift in power balance between Romulans and federations, in their view) as a prelude to an all-out invasion. Kirk has to decide whether it is worth risking a war to try to stop a Romulan ship, or if, in fact, there is a greater risk of letting the attackers go after they have destroyed 4 military bases. Kirk wisely chooses the other. This is our first look at the Federation's enemy, the Romulans, the war, yet their own venerable races, who are distant relatives of the Volcanoes. However, unlike their peaceful cousins, the Romulans did not give up their emotions and violent and imperialist ways, even as they progressed technologically. None of these things to Mr. Stiles, the ship's navigator and the boss of this episode. on-board antagonist (Romulan commander has his own problems with gung-junior officer). All he cares about is that he hates the Romulans and Spock looks like oneâ€¦ until the end when Spock saves his life (naturally). This contrasts sharply with Captain Kirk and the Romulan Commander, neither of whom has any personal ill will toward others. The two men simply do their duty. In fact, it is mutual respect. This is the first episode of Trek to deal directly with prejudice, and it does so skillfully (as opposed to Season 3 is no-so-subtle "Let's Your Last Battlefield"). Like The Enemy Under, we have a classic chess match between two boat commanders who are actually very similar. You see now that both of these captains are good. If you went to battle, you would like one of these people to be your leader. They are both honest and polite men who are required. Though bound by his home world duty, the Romulan commander still wishes to destroy himself before he can become a home rather than launch another interstellar war. Yet he still does everything in his power to return home, just as Kirk does everything in his power to stop him. This is, in my opinion, one of the best Trek's 5 best. He has it all: plenty of action, tension, great dialogue, gentle gaming (I still keep the Romulan commander, was Mark Lenard's best Trek role), and was able to make his social commentary without being too prophesied. Too bad Roddenberry forgot the last part when he did TNG. Watch this episode, then watch The Enemy below.
