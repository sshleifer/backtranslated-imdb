It is a masterful film movie, with many themes coming back in these warts and in all the studies of poetic bohemian, confident war years that cover the aerial bombing of London and the outer calm of the Welsh coastal retreat. - the boundary between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience against practical fears, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egoism versus heroism and self-sacrifice. A mature, subtle scenario that suggests and occasionally brings a fundamental tension to dramatic focus is well served by perfect performance (as opposed to a strange, unsuitable smile that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps this time in other ways, as other characters often mention) ). But above all, the excellent visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of detail, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie tracks, is a miracle and a joy to see. It's just as beautiful to look like Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the story is more engaging than some of his work. A very rare type of film these days - keeps attention and evokes emotions without leaving artistic integrity and submitting to manipulative, superficial representatives.
