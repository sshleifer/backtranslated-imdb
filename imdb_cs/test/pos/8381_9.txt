Since the evidence of death, I am a bit disappointed with Tarantino. But I insist that it was little because I can appreciate the amount of work involved in creating such a tribute to stuntmen. Inglorious Basterds definitely drove Tarantino to the top in my universe. This film can be summarized (albeit inadequately) with one word: "RAW". There is intense emotion in every scene. Revenge and justice are the main topics. From the beginning of the film, one feels compassion for the Nazi victims and is located in Tarantino's fictional dimension of the historical context of World War II. Characters are unpredictable, fun, frightening, brutal, sexy, and other adjectives that I am sure they escape from my mind and are just as fit and positive. I will not go to the award of each character, but other comments from other users summarize the appreciation of the various performances. The dialogue has evolved from the classic provocative "bad ass" style of Tarantino, as seen in Pulp Fiction and Death Proof. In dialogue, Tarantino may feel that he is making more open links to other films. Indeed, many of the dialogues were close to the cinema in the cinema for viewers, the setting partly taking place in the film premiere; The link to the movie is near every corner. It is nice to see that every presented language (German, French and English) is busy just as naturally. I speak both French and English fluently and I am often disappointed at how English-speaking characters in French films are doing badly and how French-speaking characters in English and American films look bad. Tarantino has wonderfully managed to get her actors to get rid of their actors' natural and charming performances. It helps the audience in the context of historical context. Indeed; soldiers, spies and civilians rarely understood soldiers / spies / civilians from other countries. Clothing is perfect and violence is orgasm / realistic. No strike is held, and the Nazis are often tortured. This makes the film not open to all viewers; Graphic violence can shock the more sensitive demographic situation. <br /> <br /> Volume can be written about this movie. But the film is so good that during the premiere of Northlor Inglorious Basterds at the Fantasia Festival in Montreal, I had to pee but I refused to go to miss one scene. I hope the picture expresses how strongly I feel about this film, and I am a tough audience to please.
