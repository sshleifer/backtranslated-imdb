Excellent thriller of all time. Vijay Anand excels as director and editor. Dev Anand, Vyjayantimala, Tanuja and Ashok Kumar have proven to be of benefit to the film, which has its script in the smallest detail. Cinematography contributes to the mystery, grace and other requirements of the story as it evolves. And on top of all, the music of Sachin Dev Burman is unforgettable. "Yeh dil na hota bechara" by Kishor Kumar, "Raat akeli hai" by Asha Bhosle, "Rula ke gaya sapna mera" by Lata, "Aasman ke niche" by Lata and Rafi and "Hothon pe aisi baat main" by Lata, to reaffirm the unique character of Burman Dada as a composer with his own top notch.
