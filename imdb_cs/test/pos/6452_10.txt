City Streets is incredibly modern technically speaking for a film made in 1931. Also, who could not be fascinated, fascinated by the powerful magnetism of Gary Cooper, who raised audience attention. The plot is very complicated and clear. The scenarios, decor, are exceptional in every detail. All actors are above average. I still guess how the director and his staff, including editing, sound, lighting, photography, could be so great. I couldn't find a mistake, understanding that the road scenes (bumpy ride) with the big screen on the background were the best they could get in 1931. Gis Cooper's charisma.
