Another decent offer from Vince Gilligan's pen. Pre- "Malcolm on Wednesday" Bryan Cranston plays Patrick Crump, the guy who will eventually rip Mulder out of the gun and have high speed in the west. . It has something to do with his heavy ringing of the head (and possibly a fatal burn - his wife just experienced it), and the pressure seems to only ease to the left coast. Only Mulder could relate to this guy's situation, and he actually got in touch with his captor before the whole night ride was completed. Meanwhile, Scully seems to have solved a case with a possible cure for Mr. Crump and meet them in the ocean. See if our dynamic Duo can join the Pacific and somehow correct the big problem of Mr. Crump.
