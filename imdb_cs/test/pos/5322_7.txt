You are interested in the state of a society that produces fathers such as Albert T. Fitzgerald, whom we first meet on a plane as he heads to a place he has long ago left, and where he left a woman and child, is now charged with murdering a mentally disabled boy . The first time we see him, he caught the headline in the newspaper the woman reads in front of him. Rather roughly, she asks her if she could have a newspaper, and the lady offers another section. Well, that's not what he asked what a woman wants to do is give him the front part she reads. Matthew Ryan Hoge has written and directed this disturbing film that reflects in many ways, our society is today. In fact, Mr. Hoge points out what's wrong. The film presents Leland, a young man who cannot even distinguish between fantasy and reality. Obviously, killing a human being, even a sweet and innocent boy who has done nothing to deserve it, will have fatal consequences, not only for himself but also for his own family and the family of the slain boy. In fact, Leland seems to have no idea what made him commit a crime because there is no repentance about him. Obviously, Leland was traumatized by the divorce of his parents. His own father is a reserved man who does not care for him. It's Pearl, a juvenile prison teacher who sees confusion inside a young man and wants to help, but unfortunately he has no chance. The best thing in the movie is Don Cheadle, a great actor who always brings. The cast of the ensemble does a good job under Mr. Hoge. Kevin Spacey has a good chance to play the egotistical father of the accused murderer and makes us hatred of being an arrogant idiot. Although the film is a bit long, it leaves us more questions than it answered.
