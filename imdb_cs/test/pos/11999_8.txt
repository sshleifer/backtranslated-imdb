In the end, it is clear that the murder weapon was put into the car by Mrs. Columbo and it was in the police ballistic lab. But where does the gun under the hood used in the demonstration come from? Don't the murderers erase things under the hood? Did they have a week? Or did the Columbo replicate the camera / gun under the hood used in the demonstration? How did they do it without getting into the car? Maybe that's why the murders were surprised at the end. But how could Columbo replicate his camera / gun device and get it calibrated to the key? Columbo had to get a ballistic weapon and let it put under the car's hood again, and he was very lucky that the rest of the camera equipment was still there and broadcasting. <br /> <br /> 10/10 show up to this glaring mistake at the end.
