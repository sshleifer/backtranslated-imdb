I saw this movie on 3 different occasions. On the first occasion I was excited about this movie. It seemed like a very kind movie to me. I hated this movie as a sentimental garbage on my second viewing. he reaffirmed my belief that it was a good movie. There is a lot of emotional power in this film, especially the emotional confrontation scenes between Mr Kramer and Mrs Kramer. There are scenes in which Meryl Streep appears to be a cruel person despite the fact that she is a beauty in real life. There was even a dispute over the files of this film. According to master cameraman Nestor Almendros there was a slide in which he just escaped as he hurt himself, as the character of Mr. Kramer, to show the intensity of his anger, decides to break the glass hard. .It's also saying how fa Mily must be maintained when it comes to children.
