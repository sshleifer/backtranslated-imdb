You could get into the stuffy bold of this movie, and say how it didn't happen, or how the main character could just go to the office and start using computers, etc., without anyone noticing and really picking the movie into pieces ... Or you could just sit with a bucket of popcorn and enjoy the story and acting. Personally, I prefer the other, I live a real life and watch news with all that is doom and gloom, so they would rather enjoy my movies and see that those cowards are getting their rewards. Don't take it too seriously and enjoy this movie.
