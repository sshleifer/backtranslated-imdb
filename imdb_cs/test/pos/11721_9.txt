Great just great! West Coast got "Dirty" Harry Callahan, the East Coast got Sharky. Burt Reynolds plays Sharky's "Sharky's Machine" and I enjoyed it every minute. Playing a maverick narcotics policeman in Atlanta, GA is exactly what everyone wants. Instead of hanging up, he is sent to the vice president. As in Dirty Harry's films or other films at the police, the captain will always be a jerk. When I was a kid, I was wondering what the movie meant "Sharky's machine". I knew who played Sharky, I was wondering what his machine was. It was his group of cops. After revealing the murder, everything can be found. When it turns out to be a big crowd boss, Sharky doesn't play. When she gets the other prostitute safe, Sharky fights hard and well despite losing her finger to the criminal. And I also like the part where the building gets through the glass window. That was BOMB! Randy Crawford's "Street Life" really put the movie in the right mood, and the movie itself is a really big hit for me, always! Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
