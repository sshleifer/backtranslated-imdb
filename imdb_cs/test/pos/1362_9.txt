I liked it quite a lot, but I have friends who hated it. There is no sex, but it is very little nudity in any of the episodes - which is a good thing. Also, Keitaro has a toilet fixation that is explored in at least half of the episodes. (Toilets are much more advanced in Japan.) Hmm, I'm wondering why I rated it so high ...? I'm sure it's not like I like naked cartoon girls. In some ways, Keitaro Oe (the main character) is analogous to Johnny Bravo except that instead of being annoying, muscular jock, Keitaro is a hyperactive nerd. Or you can imagine it as Japan's response to Leisure Suit Larry. It's easier to take it when you watch it, rather than dub it, but it grows on you if you give it a chance. It's Goldenboy. The formula is the same for every episode. The boy meets the girl, the boy tries to win the girl's heart despite being a dork pervert, the boy somehow succeeds against all chances. Typically, a girl does not realize she likes Keitaro, only after she is beaten to the pulp and / or has pulled some spectacular pieces like engineering a modern operating system in one week or winning a race against a gasoline powered motorcycle using her bike. br /> <br /> Episode 1 contains a rich software tycoon. I think the animation of her breast gave the main dent in the budget because she's the only woman who has this kind of animation. She also dresses completely unprofessional. Most people who rate it negatively have never gotten behind the first episode. Episode # 2 has a rich young daughter who likes to irritate. It's just 16, but it's a legal age in Japan (and in some states in the US, maybe I would add). Her father is also a brutal yakuzza type who has a reputation for killing those interested in his daughter. Girl # 3 is a sweet innocent daughter of a noodle shop owner who is mixed with a bad friend. In addition to Keitaro running interference for the girl and kissing guy, there is almost no ecchi of any kind in this episode - a sharp drop from the previous two. However, Keitaro and the evil friend indeed revel. Episode 4 tried to impress the top coach. Keitaro seems to be "more direct" about her intentions with this particular girl than any other ... and she is direct in return ... <br /> <br /> Girl # 5 is a biker. She is probably the most top-heavy 6 (though not super-buoy like girl # 1) and 'raciest' when it comes to sexuality and vulgarity. This extra episode is easily the most over-the-top in terms of (lack of) realism. Keitaro was supposed to break every bone in his body at least twice during a race against a biker, but I think producers and writers said, "It's just a caricature! We can do anything!" This disappearance of realism makes him a favorite fan. Finally, episode 6 introduces a new girl (who works in animation) and the previous 5 girls help Keitar when trying to cope with the impossible time and source of constraint so that the OAV does not get to the door. As for the ecchi, this is also very tame, but there is a lot of humor. The end has all 5 extremely beautiful girls from the previous team to Keitaro, who slips unnoticed, allegedly with the intention of raping him. Yeah, that -ALMOST- is happening in real life. Someone crossed Ukyo Tachibana (ala Samurai Shodown) with Steve Urkel (ala Family Matters) ... <br /> <br /> All in all, there is no reason for this. Either you hate or love. If you are new to anime, you probably won't want to start with this. At the same time, if you can build characters like Happosai (from Ranma 1/2) or Johnny Bravo ... or you like comedies that are more inclined to stupidity but have very sexual undertones, you should do it.
