Parts of this movie I found somewhat slower, especially the first part; the second part seemed to be much faster, but it is not clear to me why one part was faster than the other. I found it somehow. Behavior was good, writing was good (yet vulgar). There was another good side too: it was easier to understand than the Godfather movies. Did you know who was on his side, etc. All in all, the film wasn't half bad.
