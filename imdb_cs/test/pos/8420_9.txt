He grabbed this movie on DD on flipping channels ... And thank heaven, even though it started. After studying in Pune, this movie touched many happy memories of the city ... unlike why more movies like this one he doesn't ... Every character is so well engraved - grandpa, kid, doctor ... except the social worker who wraps tad, the rest of the film hardly has a mistake ... he deserves an entry for the Oscars, even though he hasn't been nominated ... he definitely leaves lump throat ... who sez u needs a cough to tickle ur lacrimals? And to think that this film needed Sachin Tendulkar to promote it. Despite being in Marathi, there was hardly a moment when I couldn't watch a movie ... the headlines were good .. He had to watch fans of a good movie.
