I really enjoyed this movie. I probably watched it two or more times and still enjoy it. Being an old sailor, I'm still absorbed by the floating Anchors Away release! I also love the "McHales Navy" pirate atmosphere. I could have done it without a female diving officer, but I think I'm just old-fashioned. She kept looking well, lol, espesially after the crew was finished with the laundry. Chef, sonarman and electrician made a film. He loved salty old engineer and his first grade PO too. And Grammer actually did a very laudable job of being an officer misfit. I loved the "driving scene" as they passed the golf course on the way to the harbor, lol. Clean Navy! And I swear I had an XO that was just like the little weasel ... I'm so glad it's on DVD, bloody time. : 0)
