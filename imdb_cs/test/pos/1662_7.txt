You can take a cheater out of a joint, but it seems extremely harder to take a connection out of a cheater. We have seen this kind of character in such a situation before (and since then): in films like BOB LE FLAMBEUR, ELEVATOR TO GALLOWS, TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI, ANDERSON TAPES, etc. Too many times mention. What helps to make this one of the most spectacular is (of course) himself a robbery that plays without words in real time, and the conduct of leadership. Bogart would think twice before overcoming this guy. The ironic ending is perfectly suited to this story (almost requires it). All around, one of the best noir movies.
