I saw this movie a few years ago and immediately bought a soundtrack because it was just great. Bacharach's music is cute and should be recognized by her. The camera is amazing. Critics hated him, but they hated HOME ALONE too. I didn't find it on the video, but I welcome anyone who can find a copy.
