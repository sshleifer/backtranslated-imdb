At the time of writing this letter (January 25, 2006), I am saddened to hear that Chris Penn has passed by in the past hours. Wildlife is different than Footloose, which I remember most about Chris. In the movie, with a slight kindness, I still remember Chris's wrestling character and teammates sitting in their favorite restaurant. a huge plate of fries in front of them, drowned in a whole bottle of ketchup. Anyway, my commentary is related to the title track sung by Bananarama. After these many years, I still remember the legend (Canadian spelling - lol) that Bananarama was called in a very LAST moment to create a song for the film and that he wrote a song on an aircraft tied to a recording studio. Record a song and right after they recorded the song, they went to shoot a low cost video for their title track. I heard that this whole process (from start to finish) lasted 4 hours! If this is true, then they are indeed worthy of being the most successful female band of all time. Anyway, it's just a rumor I've heard during the day and I still remember one generation later. Perhaps everyone who reads it can comment and clarify. Thanks.
