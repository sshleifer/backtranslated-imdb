In 1981 I was pulled by this film, four times I returned to the theater to see it again! Something I never did for another movie. No film evokes feelings of growing up in the sixties as Four Friends. That it approximated my own experience in the 1960s is probably something that many will share. Jodi Thelen is brilliantly beautiful and unforgettable! Why didn't she become the main star to never know. The entire cast is flawless, as is Steve Tisch's screenplay. I always wanted to know how much the story was autobiographical. But unfortunately, Steve is no longer here to answer this question. I have all but worn VHS copy of this great movie! Highly recommended!
