This film is a masterpiece that simply states it. Especially the double exposure of cameraman Julius Jaenzon. It is skillfully made with standards that we are used to today seventy-eight years later. Director Viktor Sjöström also plays the lead character of David Holm. The night of the new years is killed in combat, and the legend says that the first to die in the new year will have to work as a soul collector in the form of a transparent spirit. A new soul collector is appointed every year. The scene in which the alcoholic David Holm rises from his dead body (as the soul leaves his earthly body) in the cemetery (where the fight took place) is the real price for the film eye. Although the current soul collector comes with his horse and carriage, it is a beautiful but also scary scene. David Holm recognizes this soul collector as a friend of his earlier life. Now it's up to him to take over. Like Scrooge in Dickens' story "Christmas Fairy Tale", David shows what his life and deeds have led to the people around him. The film is about the dangers of drug abuse, in this case alcohol. It is based on the Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerlöf. Viktor Sjöström has made several of his books, but that is the one that has the best result, perhaps because this book is the most cinematic of them. <br /> <br />
