A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean scenery (Cephallonia is a very beautiful Greek island) that keeps many of the novel's features. I think Greek scenery adds something special and magical to the movie. One thing I didn't like at all was that the main characters, such as "Mandras" and Pelagio's father, were not Greek actors, but foreigners. I mean, the actors tried to express the Greek way of life, but for me it failed and it was clear. Even their pronunciation when they tried to use Greek words was terrible and that was bad for the storyline. In her role, a typical example of a mother living on the island during the 1940s, Irene Papas was really great and lost her husband and trying to live alone. John Hurt, Pelagia's father, also worked great. He reminded me in many of his reactions to the Greek speaker.
