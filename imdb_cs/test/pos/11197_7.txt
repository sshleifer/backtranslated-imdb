Study one of these well-known physical and / or emotional states: isolation. I think the film also comments on cultural displacement. The film presents the experiences of two Turkish men (cousins). Man has money (and comfort that comes from having a "steady" income); the other does not and goes looking for work. Neither of them is happy. Expect there will be no celebration of life - that is loneliness, warts and all. The film succeeds in offering a powerful, bleak transition across the "low lands" of human condition. Brave film production. Well behaved and well shot in my opinion (outdoor port shots are my favorites). A film that should encourage gratitude to anyone who is not lucky and fulfilled in life by a stranger (not to mention employment); Everyone else will find their companion in this movie. A film with all the heat and the pace of ice crash. Expect a bitter pill, not a "happy pill".
