If you look at the best movies in Mexico, you'll be more than likely to have made the photo by Gabriel Figueroa. He is recognized in the world as one of the best that ever existed. His masterful control of the cameras gave added value to the films he belonged to. If we add the direction of Luis Bunuel to his participation, you'll never find a pair of es in the world. This story, Nazarin, was written by the greatest Spanish writer next to Miguel de Cervantes (Don Quixote de la Mancha). The story itself is excellent: Nazarin, a priest who lives by his own beliefs, is trying to live a very Christian life, but as always there are people who do not. He travels through many places where he preaches his Christianity, but most of the time he finds people who do not accept him. But in addition to the wonderful story, it is always interesting to try to interpret the mysterious message that Bunuel sends us all over the picture in scenes that tremble you.
