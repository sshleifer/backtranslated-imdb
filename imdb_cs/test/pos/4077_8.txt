I was watching the NFL game and during the break I started surfing and found it on one of the HBO channels. I missed the beginning, but when I started watching Deadly Voyage, the clicker was postponed and he didn't even realize it until the credits came back. You will find yourself rooting against the villans and on the edge of your La-Z-Boy throughout this. If you have a chance to watch it. Every once in a while I think the cable company will take down my movie channels, but when you come across the big ones like this, you know why it's worth paying for them. Happy Holidays to everyone from Cape Cod !!!
