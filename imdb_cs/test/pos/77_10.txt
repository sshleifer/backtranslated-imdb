Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with Rock Hudson, an American pilot while on a German mission. <br /> <br /> The songs are beautiful. Both are well paired. Julie demonstrates a more temperamental aspect in this film than a nice girl she usually plays. A half-German, semi-English girl who sings beautiful and entertains soldiers in WW I, Julie sings some cute Mancini songs. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie. Some say it's a "cub," but so what. That's beautiful. Supporting characters are somewhat stereotypical. It may not be up to Rock Performance in Pillow Talk, Magnificent Obsession, or Giant. Blake Edwards made a film in Ireland and authentic WW I-type aircraft were used in the film. The scenery for England and France is absolutely beautiful.
