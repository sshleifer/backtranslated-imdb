A strange but acceptable crowd comedy that has a secret FBI agent (Matthew Modine) flirts with a widow gangster (Michelle Pfeffier) ​​to tie two murders on an elusive crowd (Dean Stockwell). The film shows that it doesn't have to go over the top just to be humorous, and director Jonathan Demme ("The Silence of the Lambs", "Philadelphia") keeps the film as if it were limited. This is good and also avoids predictability.
