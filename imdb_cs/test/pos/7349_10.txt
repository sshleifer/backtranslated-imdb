Viva La Bam was one of those who showed that I didn't have high, if any, expectations than I saw, and I never knew about it until I saw my friend watching it. I thought Jackass was pretty funny, but stunts were just funny and I never got into the show. When I first saw Viva La Bam, it was the opposite, I loved it. It had more of a TV show, like many "Reality Shows" today. I was addicted and wanted to see what new scheme they would prepare for each episode. Until the last episode, I was intrigued by my interest, and although some thoughts seemed to be repeated at times, it was always newer and more fun. Viva La Bam is one of those shows that gets you hooked and I don't see another show that is quite similar.
