In Tweety's S.S. Sylvester shifts from picking trash to being a cruise ship passenger who is carrying a canary bird - and grandmother, his owner. Uh-oh! Again, Tweety and Grandmother provide many obstacles for feline attempts to get a bird. Sylvester also gets sea sickness several times. And secondly, a red-necked cat goes to a place on a boat that has something to cure his illness, replacing her with nitroglycerin. So now Sylvester can fire! I'll stop here and say it's another great cartoon by Friz Freling in the lead role of the popular duo for cats and birds. It is highly recommended to use S.O.S.
