E. Elias Merhige's existential experiment is definitely one hellish work. This is what Alexander de Large was forced to watch in "A Clockwork Orange". But despite the fact that this film is truly unnoticeable, it's a success. <br /> <br /> It's too late to read and see the movie. For me, at the very least, the payback (after 3 separate views with lots of breaks between you) saw a list of characters * after * telling the story. This is the moment when a simple message hit home. But I wonder if Merhige could tell a 5-minute story at about 30, instead of 78. <br /> <br /> However, as we see how the credits are projected on the front of this movie, the cat is already out of the bag and certainly You will only appreciate this film if you appreciate existential filmmaking from the early 20th century. Even then you could vomit. 4/10 (but I commend Merhige for her work, though it is unnoticeable)
