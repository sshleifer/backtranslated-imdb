The movie was fantastic. If your Bams' fan video, jackass or his Viva la Bam show, you can't help but enjoy it. I have a few friends who enjoyed it, and others who thought it wasn't that great. Those who didn't like it were mostly friends, they really didn't realize anything of the raw humor that I thought the movie was so funny. I'm pretty sure the whole movie was shot in the hometown of Bams, which includes many of its regularly visited places. The cast is made up of all his friends and comrades, and also includes a big name for skateboarders. Soundtrack is phenomenal, with HIM music. In my opinion, Haggard has everything. The big story, the characters you will never see anywhere else. Lots of humor great music and cast that was dedicated to the project.
