I have it as a complete set of 9 episodes on 5 DVDs. I didn't know anything about the history of the show. Season 1 series has a pilot episode as episode 1 and then 3 additional episodes for a total of 4. Season 2 lists 5 episodes with the last being behind the good and the evil with the original air date of 7 December 1998. Febrausry 1998. So good and evil looks like season 3 episode 1, except there are no more episodes in season 3. <br /> <br /> Spoilers here. Two main characters of the first 8 episodes, Dr. Iain McCallum (John Hannah) and Dr. Angela Moloney (Zara Turner), missing in this episode to be replaced by Dr. Dan Gallagher and Nathaniel Parker Charley Fielding (Eva Pope). I met Nathaniel Parker from Inspector Lynley Mysteries, which began in 2001. So they planned to have season 3, but only one episode was aired. It seems strange that I try to continue the series named after the main character, McCallum, when the main character is away from the series. So they could have planned to return Dr. Iain McCallum, but when it failed, the series was canceled. I have no inside information about it, but I see that both John Hannah and Nathaniel Parker participated in other projects in 1999. Does anyone have any information about it?
