The rules of engagement are one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. It is well designed, greatly entangled together and provides excellent shots to back up claims that lasts. The best film is that it is not based on sympathy for Dividians, but also on enlightening listeners to blatant government mistakes and lies that surround the whole situation. I remain with disturbing anxiety and extreme anger over the way the government has dealt with, and then covered the tragedy of this scale. Hiding is what left me. It is one thing to make a mistake in the operation and to admit guilt, but another to make the Americans look straight into the eyes and lie to them. I don't think I should be surprised by the history of our beloved country, which has seen JFK's assassination, the Vietnam War, and other important events that smell so bad that you have to keep your nose every time you drive through Washington DC. autopsy on some bodies clearly shows that the FBI is in public. One of the things I am trying to be informed about when I watch such a document is that I usually get a testimony from only one point of view. But again, this is undoubtedly one of the brilliant achievements of the Engagement Rules. He presents his evidence in such a conclusion that even if you were presented with FBI statements, how could you really trust them. I remember clearly, as the media presented Dividants as this crazy group of cult rebels with David Koresh, who, as their leader, reborn Jesus Christ. None of this was really factual, but rather the story was from pieces and pieces of facts. They simply stood up for the rights to carry weapons and practice their religion as American citizens. If you were an ATF and you wanted to look, the compound attacks a building with a unit of men who are armed with rifles and bulletproof weapons to suit the way they do it? If you're an FBI, why not engage in psychological warfare and offer little in real negotiation to help resolve the situation? Why pour liters of harmful gas if you want to save children? Why open large holes in a composite structure when you know the possibility of firing? Why lie about not being able to shoot weapons when it can be clearly seen in the video? If not. If you didn't want to see the situation, it ended as it did. The scene at the end, when the Dividians of David flag exploded into a fire mast and the ATF was briefly picked up, was an emotional climate scene that disgusted my head and my stomach turned uncontrollably. Film director William Gazecki deserves one of my highest congratulations. It takes a lot of courage to make a movie like this, and I'm sure there were many consequences from the government for it too. With people like him, the public can show real truth rather than bullshit that is filtered through media that represent information that can hardly be considered true. When I come back to how I felt about Dividians for the time of David Koresh's media coverage and how I felt after seeing this movie, it's really amazing. It reminds me of the Bible line of a man who was healed by Jesus and asked the elders how it happened "before I was blind, but now I see," he told them. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. You may have to look, but it's really something special.
