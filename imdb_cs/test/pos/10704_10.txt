Unlike the previous poster, I liked cellulose treatment. It looked good and the movie was much more fun. For me, it didn't pervert from the content of the documentary at all. In fact, I felt that the smoothness of the appearance allowed me to lose much more in content. The previous poster was just like the style to Nike commercial; it certainly looks. But for my tastes it worked really well (and I'm far from Nike fans). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is how documentary filming should be done. I can't wait to see more repayments from these promising filmmakers.
