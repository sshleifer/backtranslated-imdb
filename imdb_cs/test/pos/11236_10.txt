The keys to the VIP, the original series of the Canadian comedy network (comedynetwork.ca) scored with this fun but inspiring gameshow. This show is hosted by four witty, good-looking boys who judge others on their "play" (ability to pick up women). Each episode features two boys who go head-to-head in various pick-up games. There are three different sections and the winner scores the night as a VIP in an exclusive nightclub in Toronto. Being a guy, I naturally find this show cheerful. We all know that it is difficult to face women and watch these boys naturally spark the curiosity of men. Guys who compete at this show could even give you a few pointers - if you look out.
