This is the promise of the trailer I saw and I rented Hitch. Exactly, a serious movie viewer does not expect much from this title, but surprisingly, Smith, Mendes, James and Valletta managed to achieve a theatrical performance that could be metaphorically summarized into their rap dance floor routines at the end of the film. : their characters have created an effective combo that can produce more than just a good laugh with this Sunday afternoon DVD, provided your date is not an excellent, French Swedish director, a 60-year-old film fan. PS: Techniques score are all TRUE, especially "cocktail" routine!
