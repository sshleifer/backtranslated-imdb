this is one of the best movies I've ever seen ... sharp scenery ... isolation ... ignorant bigoted people hiding behind their religion ... background for some vocabulary and sophistication ... acting is absolutely natural ... but for me as "foodie" the best is the real selection and preparation of the feast ... We spent time in Paris and know the kitchen well ... whether it is cafe anglais really does not know but I know about similar facilities and babette's menu and choice The wines are authentic ... and of course the end, where, despite the fact that the perfect meal returns to their friendship, it is all that can be there. 10 out of 10 movies should be seen by anyone who has enough brain and desire to understand it
