I saw it in 99 and I remember I love it. I still remember parts of the film in my head, like on a pitched pitch. Unfortunately from 99 - now I never remember the name of this until I was looking through the filmography of my uncle's friend and came across it (played by Clive Kennard). Right after reading the description, I knew what it was. After catching up, I was shocked to find out he didn't just do it on video or DVD, but it still doesn't happen again. This is a huge shame, please ITV at least repeat this great TV movie. Nick Hancock showed in this movie that he could do more than just host a show with his character Mike Tonker. This is a movie that most football fans would like, and even those who are not very excited about the sport would be able to enjoy the comedy value of this. Yes, this is a short review, but there is not much to say except it is an underrated movie that deserves to be repeated or released on video / DVD, so ITV, me and other fans of this movie will please you. ENJOY ONE OF YOU!
