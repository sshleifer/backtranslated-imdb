You need to gain a wealth of experience while watching this movie. It is a seemingly simple story of gifted pupil Yiu Kwoka, who later becomes a teacher of classical Chinese poetry. He is married to two sons, and things at home seem normal. After twenty years of marriage, he still loves his wife and his sons alternately fill him with pride (older) and disappointment (younger). His passion for poetry makes him an amusement for an older student in one of his classes. A student, Choi Lam, draws his photographs during a class, significantly, one of him with a flower coming out of his mouth. He attracts him more with his intelligence than with her sexuality, even though it is also an element. Of course, he is not immune to his attention, even though he is trying to keep the Green Line between teacher and student in place for a while. The reason he doesn't succeed at the end is complicated. First, there is a real depth of communication between him and Choi Lam. It is clear that she really likes him and it is mutual. Second, his marriage has a long-standing problem that is revealed when his and his wife's old friend gets sick. The consequences of involving a wife in this friend, whether past or present, are almost too sad to bear. <br /> <br /> There's nothing trivial about this movie. All characters have a lively inner life and an easily recognizable history. Two leaders, Jacky Cheung and Anita Mui, are excellent as well as Karena Lam as a student of Choi Lam, and Shaun Tam as an older son on Yin. <br /> <br /> Recommended without reservations.
