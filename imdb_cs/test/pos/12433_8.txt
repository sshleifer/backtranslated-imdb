Before I watched this movie from start to finish, I accidentally caught the last half hour. I usually don't have a movie if I haven't seen it from the beginning, but a friend had it and when I started watching it, I couldn't stop. <br /> <br /> I am really surprised by this film didn't get a wide theatrical release. This is a pretty funny movie (often gallows humor), and the monster and monster truck in it are quite menacing. The monster makes Leatherface a nice look and the monster truck is like a cross between a German WWII German artillery vehicle and a giant coffin. A timid twenty-five-year-old virgin guy is on a long journey to stop a woman he loves to marry. His former best friend keeps him constantly and rags. They are threatened on the road by a vintage black hearse and the aforementioned monster truck. They also pick up a hitchhiker, played very sexy Aimee Brooks. I also watched an animated trailer with a director's commentary, and an electronic press kit and found that both are interesting. I bet the commentary on the film with the director and the two male stars is also very nice, but I have so many more movies I've never seen before.
