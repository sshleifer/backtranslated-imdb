I love this movie! I love all the characters and I can watch it again <br /> <br /> and again ... and again and again I listen to the soundtrack. Although I saw it about two years after it was made and I was never as young as Jip and Company, I can <br /> <br /> to understand and love their stories. And if someone thinks this movie is stupid, I disagree and say it's <br /> <br /> full of positive energy and friendship and love ... and full of youth! <br /> <br /> He landed at the weekend ... enjoy it!
