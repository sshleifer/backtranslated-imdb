"Fame" has been one of my favorite movies for years! It is not just a 80s high school movie in New York, it is LEGENDARY - people no longer talk about the high school of performing arts, but about the "school of fame" !! The characters are real, they're not "Hollywood" and their stories are real. The film follows the four years of the school, from the powerful monologue of one student to the audition and ending with a spectacular promotional show. It seems that some believe the Broadway show is better, but it's my opinion that you should definitely see this movie anyway, and then have your own opinion. For anyone who likes to watch a movie and wants to have a "classic", it's definitely one of them. It's an example of one of those movies that were really great, with the actors we loved for 2 hours, and then they never saw them again ... they're classic "Fame students". <br /> <br /> FAME lives forever.
