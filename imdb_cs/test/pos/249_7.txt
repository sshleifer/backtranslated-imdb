Rita Hayworth as Rusty Parker is COVER GIRL du jour - he's one of the dancing girls at Danny McGuire, Danny's most interesting (Gene Kelly) and almost everyone who meets her. Take Vanity magazine, John Coudair (Otto Kruger, for example): enchanted by Rusty's resemblance to grandmother Maribelle (played by Hayworth in memory of memories) he married when he fell in love with her trying to relive her youth. consolidating what he thinks went wrong between himself and Maribelle. He doesn't believe Danny could give Rusty happiness, or everything she should be entitled to - even Danny believes herself. When Rusty shoots to fame like Vanity 'Cover Girl', Danny takes her to the prepared and waiting Noel Wheaton weapons (Lee Bowman). What happens if Danny returns to town with her sidekick Genius (Phil Silvers) in tow, just to see that Rusty married Wheaton? As a COVER GIRL musical, it benefits from beautiful scores and songs by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin, including an Oscar-named 'Long Ago and Far Away' (perhaps one of the most beautiful ballads ever written and beautifully, sweetly sung as duet Hayworth and Kelly), Maribelle number 'certainly thing' (The more 'Poor John' is not done, it's Kern / Gershwin collaboration) and 'Put Me To The Test'. Of course, the dance is excellent because Gene Kelly has more than a hand in choreography. This shows in the simplest dance, for example, his dance with Hayworth to 'give me a test', or the joyfully exuberant 'Make the Way for Tomorrow' number (played by Danny, Rusty and Genius trio) ... which marks the reaction Gene has to a police officer in the SINGIN 'IN RAIN title number. In particular, Kelly scored a technological and artistic coup with "Alter-Ego". Like his successors at ANCHORS AWEIGH and AN AMERICAN IN PARIS (Jerry the Mouse and the 16-minute ballet), this dance is an example of the incredible innovation and creativity Kelly has brought to the modern film musical: she wanted to use the film medium for contemporary dance that could not be presented on stage, and before CGI, Kelly insisted on dancing with one person who could compare him with talent and style - alone. The number is barely five minutes long, but (and Kelly's genius) still does not take his breath, even sixty years. That's why I watched COVER GIRL, and if nothing else, this dance is really worth it. You can say that a great deal of money was scared at COVER GIRL and Rita Hayworth - not that it doesn't deserve it. Witnessing the scene when Rusty hits Broadway - a big screen that presents all the different girls goes to the tremendously large stage confused for Rusty's entrance. Hayworth is indeed one of the most beautiful girls in the film show, and dances with style and grace that is almost worthy of Kelly. (Very few Kelly co-stars have the honor.) In some scenes she is cheerful, for example her drunken scene when John and Wheaton come from Joe. For some reason, however, her performance still lacks a spark of size to help COVER GIRL overcome her general curse of mediocrity. This curse is canceled only when Gene Kelly is on the screen (dancing or not) or when Eve Arden as John is a long-suffering secretary of 'Stonewall' sidles with further cutting comments or clever observations. Since the film belongs to Hayworth, neither Kelly nor Arden can save him as a whole. That doesn't mean the movie is bad - it's not. It's nice, with great songs and cute numbers and lots of pretty girls you can watch. But it's not just a classic. The dance is classic, but watch COVER GIRL and don't regret it.
