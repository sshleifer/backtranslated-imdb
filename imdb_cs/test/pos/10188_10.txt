I'm not a Disney fan at all, but I'm in Orlando at a friend's wedding. So my travel partner and I went to Disney for a few days. I didn't see a good 3-D effect, no. So I usually try to stick to these presentations. The 3-D effect in this was so good. I am an adult man of 38 years and I even wanted to try to reach out and touch. It's good! The word advice. Finally, look at the back of the theater on the wall. Put it this way ... when I first saw it, the effect didn't work. I told my friend ... "It would be nice if ..." My friend said, "That's exactly what it is. It's not for some reason." It's an amazing show. You won't be disappointed !!!
