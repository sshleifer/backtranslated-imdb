I was looking at this show when I was growing up. When I think about it, I remember it quite well. If you ask me, it was a pretty good show. Whenever I think about it, I don't remember the opening sequence and song theme very well. In addition, everyone was ideally occupied. Also writing was very strong. Also the performances were excellent. I hope a network returns it, so I see every episode. Before I wrapped it up, I'd like to say that I will always remember this memory forever, even if I'm not sure I've seen every episode. Finally, if a network ever brings back, I hope you catch it one day before it looks good.
