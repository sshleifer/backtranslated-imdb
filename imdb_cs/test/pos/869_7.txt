Very interesting storyline based on the novel "Waltz in the Dark" by Cornell Woolrich. It is more a drama than a film noir that tries to send a message that love changes your own life, ie your love for any person and the love you have received from him. The rich man really changed his life for love while his partner finally realized that he was the only one who loved her. Belmondo played as usual, while the rather young Michel Bouquet played his eternal role as a detective or police agent. Frankly, Bouquet was not so impressive in this film, but less than it was Catherine Deneuve's performance. She was not so convincingly in her role as a prostitute then lover / wife of Louise Mah√© (Belmondo). For those who like to visit the world, the film offers the opportunity to see part of the island of Ascension and the city of Lyon in France.
