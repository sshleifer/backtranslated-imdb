William Faulkner was one of the American writers who won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Faulkner wrote about life in the South especially during the period of depression. Many of his stories have been adapted to the screen. Short stories like two soldiers are an adorable story of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The older brother, Pete Greer, goes to Memphis, Tennessee to sign up as hundreds of thousands of young men, some who would never return home. His younger brother does not take his departure well. He can get a bus ticket to Memphis without finding his brother. Surprisingly, he becomes a soldier of a different kind because he wants to enroll at the age of 10. Ron Perlman performs a surprise performance as a military leader who manages to take care of the boy. This short film won an Oscar for Best Short Live Film, Deserved. If it was longer, it could compete with a longer film. Everything else, like costumes, art, and the re-creation of the 1941 American era is perfect. The film also shows a cordial war at home because most Americans have survived a major depression. Actors and actresses are not known, but they do their first performances. If Hollywood made better quality movies, I would probably go to the movies more. If Broadway had better programs, I'd go to the theater more.
