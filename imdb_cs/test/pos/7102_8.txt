I liked Dracula's house much more than Frankenstein's house. Carradine is much clearer and his playing isn't as ridiculous and overboard as in the HOF. Actors provide enough performances. Subplots (eg, Monster, Villagers, Villager, Hunchback Nurse, etc.) are well mixed, so none of them will become a strange chip like the HOF. Better run than sewn HOF. Hunchback Sister is as sympathetic as Hunchback in HOF. The doctor is very good. Likewise, Lon Chaney adds an elegant werewolf. It's worth watching twice. Classical universal horror with a typical fortieth year, a long lost taste. Particularly good is the physician's performance before / after his blood was contaminated by Dracula's.
