Neat production that takes the first scene where Max picks a ring in a jewelry store. Much of what follows, reminds us of Shakespeare's "Mid-summer Night's Dream", in which Demetrius and Lysander fall in love with other girls. Here, Max and Lucien, both prone to love at first sight, mix with Lisa and Alice, and Alice complicates things when she calls herself Lisa. In addition to the cheerful mix, Max is willing to engage in incidents that bring memories back two years ago. And since Max has a lot of these dream episodes, we're exposed to one flashback at a time, in my opinion, too many, because I wasn't quite sure if I was present or in the past when I first viewed the movie. they walk a lot through corridors, staircases, doors, elevators, etc. I accept it all in a quick movie, but do we have to have so many people colliding with each other? After four collisions, he will have no effect if you excuse the pun. High marks for artistic design! The apartment itself is really beautiful with a tasteful interior, but I ask myself how a few young women can afford such luxury in Paris. Storing a person who intends to commit suicide from a window jump is always exciting and it is also in this movie when Max almost leaves at the same time. But a kiss or two of them feel better soon. If you can find your way through all the flashbacks, you'll finally find yourself at the airport where Max's devoted sister gives him the most loving kiss. It can be said that she is the one who solves the complications of love like Puck in "Mid-Summer Night Dream".
