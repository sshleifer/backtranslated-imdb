In my 15 years of age, I have seen many class B movies and I must say that it was one of the best. I personally enjoyed the real estate and storyline, but it suffered from amateur play (although Adrienne Barbeau gave a decent performance as Lisa Grant). Joseph Bottoms couldn't keep his part well enough to be considered good. Another performance that really suits the film was Barry Hope (Barney Resnick). It starts with an eager real estate agent who takes an Asian couple over the house just to find out that the showhome is a dead girl in the shower. It proceeds with detective speculation and presents key figures with reasonable grace. I think that for anyone who is giggling over-the-top drama victims of realtors provide during over-the-top gory scenes, it is really a gem ... It's not so great, but it's worth watching if you're bored insanely.
