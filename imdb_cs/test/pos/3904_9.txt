I first saw The Victim (aka Out Of Contention) more than 25 years ago when I was very young. Being an avid Bewitched fan since I was a kid, I enjoyed watching everything Elizabeth Montgomery played. This movie was (and still is) a real experience - whether you're a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles, such as her portrayal as a rape victim in a rape case and as a suspect murderer in the legend of Lizzie Borden. Her performance in Victim as Kate, a frightened woman trapped in an isolated house during a storm, with her killer is great. If you like exciting thrilling thrillers than it's one movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat till the end. Another great performance worth mentioning is Eileen Heckhart, who plays a terrifying and suspicious housekeeper. Unfortunately, like most of Montgomery's movies, The Victim is not available on DVD and I believe that although it was released on VHS a few years ago, it is a rarity these days. I was lucky to record it when it was broadcast on television ten years ago, so I have a nice copy of this very good movie. You must see!
