I was fortunate enough to have seen this film at the festival last year and had half expected to get the release. The fact that she was filmed on a digital video camera certainly made her impossible, but it was never the intention of the filmmaker to make LOOK LIKE FILM in the first place. relation ships. It's not what movies are supposed to be! However, it had quality in the structure of its visual appearance, suggesting that Thomas was on something we should pay attention to. For independent filmmakers and producers who have talent and have no money and ride, there is a lot to learn to watch this film, technically it has everything that goes for it, the use of light, music, and so on. I have ever seen and therefore is worthy of great praise. Game performances are believable to some extent, if not slightly played, I felt there was much more, deeper, especially from the male lead John Paul Clarke. But one thing that really bothered me as a filmmaker is that the film is in black and white that needs to cover up a lot of sins than if it were color? Should we learn more about developing digital technology? Or is it the future of wonderful, affordable film production?
