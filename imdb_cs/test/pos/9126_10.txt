Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Cercle Rouge succeeds the lives of two criminals: Vogel (Gian Maria Volontè), a murderer who gives police officers a slip as he is transferred from one city to another by train; and Corey (Allain Delon), the thief just released from prison. Destiny decides to contact these two men to pull away the magnificent robbery. In the background is Matei (André Bourvil), Detective Vogel escapes, irreconcilable in his pursuit and sometimes ruthless in his methods. Along the film, the viewer meets other, but fascinating characters, the best of whom is Jansen (Yves Montand), a disgruntled former cop and an excellent shooter. Melville has such a unique style that it doesn't. You don't need to watch many of his movies catch. Le Samourai, Un Flic and Le Cercle Rouge are clearly made of the same fabric: symmetrical angles; long shots; silence; coats and hats and cigars; introductory quotations; amazing lies, fatalism; cruel life. Everything great in Melville is here in top form. And his shortcomings troubled me this time: the illogical, confused behavior of his characters and the confusing narrative that hurt his other films are almost invisible here. Since Le Cercle Rouge was preceded by Un Flic, it does not mean that it has improved over time; Maybe I'm getting used to it and reaching thinking where it doesn't bother me anymore. Melville has made unique movies. Just as old, they show more ingenuity, realism and grace than modern techno-thrillers in which cool thieves use computer systems and James Bond-esquire aids to get rid of impossible crimes. Melville's criminals are not cool: they are lonely, socially uncomfortable, and probably realize they are not good for much more than planning for robberies. They are undesirable, living at night, always one step ahead of the police in the game they know will eventually lose. There is nothing romantic about them. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, this type of movie isn't even a complete idiot. Matei is smart, smart, patient and even compassionate. He's not an unlikely villain or cliché, he's just an old man who does his job and does it right. He knows when to use force and when to use the brain. Many movies could learn from him. It's this messy style that makes Melville's movies so happy to look at him and put him on a special pedestal as one of the greatest movie masters.
