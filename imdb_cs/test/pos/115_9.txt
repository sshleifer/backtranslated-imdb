It is a very sensitive depiction of life with uninitiated or limited desires. What does a person do with a desire in culture and society with strict standards? One husband finds a departure with an immigrant - because immigrants do not belong or are not admitted, they do not need to adapt and bar their desires. The second husband seeks comfort in spirituality and tries to vaporize his desire for nothingness. This fails - of course - and breaks down in the last scene for several reasons. Sita still made sure that moment allowed him to know that he was not responsible for her deviant departure to her blocked wish. Her mother could still not find the strength to destroy her myth. Does he see him as a child who is celebrated in his desire to control, but should he give him the opportunity to finally grow up? Both women find courage and coherence thanks to the joint rejection of their husband. But the last act of rejection was Grandma - she could not free herself from her rusty thinking to accept Sita's desire. Decades and more of care have not been enough to break the shackles of her culture. It seems to be the easiest thing for households to let their desires flow - because he is just as damned by his culture - being at the end of the hierarchy. Since there is no respect and expectation, he can also taste sin.
