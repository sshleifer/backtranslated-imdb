I'm not an American, but Meatballs still hit me. Maybe because it's a sweet, sweet movie. Again, I was watched that I couldn't really put my finger in place for a while and I can't remember. Meatballs are just a great movie. It reminds me of the innocent days when nothing really mattered and nothing was possible. <br /> <br /> If you read this, you probably know what I mean. All I can say above from what I have already said is that meatballs must be nostalgic if you are an American. I think you know what I mean, too.
