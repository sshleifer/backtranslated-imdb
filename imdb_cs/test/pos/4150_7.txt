This film promises a lot but brings little. The underlying problem is related to the inclusion of Charlotte Gainsbourg in this film. The immigrants from Sicily did not need a red-haired English in any way - maybe the film needed it, but certainly not new citizens. In my opinion, the decision to include it will destroy the continuity of the film. This is particularly worrying because it seems not only to humiliate the characters in the film, but also the history of immigration itself. Immigrants themselves were heroic characters who were able to work together without having to satisfy what I believe to be a veiled image of a "white man's burden." I wonder if anyone will make an Irish immigrant film that will include a Sicilian woman as the main character. The left elbow index considers seven aspects of film acting, production sets, dialogue, art, film continuity, plot and character development - on a scale of 10 for excellent, 5 for average and 1 for help. Both film continuity and graph rate are low 1. Continuity, as discussed above, is further degraded by the surrealist end. Doesn't the film deserve such a significant historical significance more than just a conclusion that reminds Marco Chagall? The story is pretty simple, until too much time seems to be involved in the old country, too little time on the ship and too much emphasis on the end. Acting and character development is moderate, since all characters are fixed throughout the film, and the inclusion of Anglo-Saxon to speak perfect English almost transforms the film into satire. Where is Groucho when you need him? The production sets, dialogue, and art are very good, each rated 10. Sets of Sicily, ship and Ellis are as good as they can be found. Dialogue is amazing and ethical singing is excellent. I agree with Scorses that listening to the Sicilian dialect is a pleasure. Note that immigrants talk about "America", not "United States" - ideally vs. political reality. There are many good art scenes, dreams of America, gold coins and giant vegetarians among the best. The average left arm index is 5.25, increased to 7.0 when compared to the IMDb scale. One other term seems to be going through the experience of Ellis Island: the suffering of migrating migrants was exhausting; The film is worth seeing, but what one sees seems problematic.
