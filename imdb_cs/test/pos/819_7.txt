Crack House (1989) was one of the few films in the 1980s that fall into this genre. What is supposed to be a drug film is nothing more than some exercise of white exploitation in corruption. There's nothing wrong with that. The video presentation even has an anti-drug report from one of Richard's "turncoat" Roundtree stars, the film follows two young high school lovers. One is a quasi-tough guy and the other his girl. One of them is dealt with by a mutual friend, while the other is given a trip to the straw and later gets a chance to get back to his former friends. Jim Brown seems like a "Mister Big" movie, he's one bad dude who can still punk-out no one and he's a very sadistic guy who likes to slap hoes and beat tar from those trying to resist his word. Luke from General Hospital will also make a visiting stellar place. <br /> <br /> If you like hard edge, then this movie is for you. Unfortunately, Hollywood doesn't do it, and when they do, it's neither exploitative nor fun. <br /> <br /> Recommended for sleaze fans.
