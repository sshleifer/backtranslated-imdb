I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it. Since then I've been looking for a video, but never found it, until 33 years later when I ordered it from Moviehunter. I'm sorry he doesn't keep it. This glamourized version simply can't lift up to the 1937 production level. It just doesn't fit. Michael York is lost here. Sally Kellerman throws off the gentle performance, but Olivia Hussy is just ridiculous and not worth driving through the Himalayas. Best performance is Charles Boyer as Lama's head.
