It's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford's Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledgee and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films without the name of the box office that Ford did not have to adapt to the star personality film, John Wayne, Henry Fonda, or anyone else he worked with. Not surprisingly, Ford considered all of them to be favorites of one kind or another. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. couple of sympathetic cowpokes sign on a Mormon wagon train to the valley on the territory of Arizona. Along the way, they are first connected by a group of stranded players from the pharmacy and then by an outlaw family on the run of Clegg. Their stories combine and what's happening is the basis of the film. If Wagonmaster had been done 10 years earlier on the strength of the two performances introduced by Johnson and Carey, both of them would probably have had significant results. careers like B cowboys picture. In Johnson's case, it would be a life-imitating art. Johnson was a real rodeo cowboy and came to Hollywood with a John Ford horse chain for use in Fort Apache. Ford was hit by his presence and the rest is history. But on the day the B Western began to approach, and Johnson and Carey had a great career as two actors with a subtle character. Ward Bond plays the senior leader of the Morig Wiggs. Although Bond is a recent convert, it has trouble remembering that it doesn't use any four letters. But he is a leader because of his character's strength, not his perfect LDS theology. It turns out to be a wise and compassionate leader. When showing Cleggs, Ford had only four years to reach his My Clementine. They are reincarnations of Clanton's gang and pure evil. In fact, if Walter Brennan, who after my Darling Clementine refused ever working for Ford again was willing I could easily see that he was cast as Shiloh Clegg's head of the family. As Charles Kemper did, this is probably the most appreciated role. Shortly after this movie, Kemper was killed in a car crash. He could work very well with Ford in the future. Ford makes the pacifist mormons here, and I don't remember that pacifism was part of the LDS doctrine. It works here, the whole idea is that these people who have no weapons are innocent when dealing with evil people like Cleggs. It takes some cowboy weapon that could properly dispose of them. I think this post after World War II is trying to say that pacifism is not always the best policy. Another transmission from My Darling Clementine is Alan Mowbray, who plays the same role he has been there as the leader of a show of medicine. Part of this set is Joanne Dru, who makes another turn as a woman of elastic virtue as well as in the Red River. Dru used so many Westerns that she wanted to be out of Gingham and some modern fashion styles. <br /> <br /> Wagonmaster is great fun and I'm willing to build in Utah it's a pretty popular movie.
