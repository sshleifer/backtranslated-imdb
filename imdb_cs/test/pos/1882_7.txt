I haven't seen so many people wrapped outside the theater since Star Wars III. Both shows sold out, and for good reason. The screaming man was the best film he saw with a crowd of geeks. (Hey, I'm a dork too.) Bruce Campbell was present and had the whole crowd in the stitch! The film was the most capable. This can be the funniest movie Bruce has done. Ted Raimi steals the show with his Bulgarian hip hop-itude and zany facial expressions, he's laughing riot! Who knew Ted could rap? I changed my mind, the one who stole the show was actually a robot. There's nothing more fun than a robot ... doing a robot. As for Bruce's performance, "I'll marry the fifth." Thanks Bruce. Thanks for being cool, thanks for the time, thanks for all the fun.
