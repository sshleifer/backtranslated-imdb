Very closely written, acted and filmed. Violent, but not so much. Whoever edited it knew exactly what he wanted to see. There is no wasted scene in this movie. "Usual Suspects" was an excellent set performance; it is a collection of outstanding individual performances. I rarely buy movies, but this is worth owning.
