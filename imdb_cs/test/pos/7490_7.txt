It reminds such films as PULP FICTION or RESERVOIR DOGS, which you can't think Tarantino's films were a source of inspiration for this FOUR. However, it's not bad for cheap B-Series movies. The story of the gangsters is captivating and witty and also has a bit of dark humor and sarcasm that we can find in PULP FICTION. Resources were not very certain, but the film is well made. Behavior is also good. I enjoyed the scene when the girl was sitting on the couch and teasing the doctor ... It was hot and fun at the same time! The soundtrack is nice too. I didn't hear too many songs, but I liked the ones I heard. The score is 7/10.
