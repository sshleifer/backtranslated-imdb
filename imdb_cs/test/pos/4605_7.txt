When I saw Lon Chaney, Jr. and Boris Karloff in the cast, I expected to find a typical "horror" style of "schlock" from the 1950s. The opening scene (cemetery with wolf howling in the background) seemed to confirm this. But when I began to observe it, what I discovered was a clever secret about an Englishman (Richard Green) who was trying to figure out what had happened to his two friends who had disappeared in the Black Forest and, if necessary, take revenge Count's Evil (Stephen McNally) who ruled the territory. Chaney, as voiceless Gargon, had a somewhat limited role (the one who reminded me of Hunchback Notre Dame, in fact), while Karloff had a somewhat more substantial role as Dr. Meissen. In fact, Meissen was one of the more interesting characters in the film, and it was hard to know until the end whether he would be established to be a good guy or a bad guy! The castle ensemble was magnificent, and even the limited view of the Black Forest was real enough. Certainly it didn't hit a low budget, compared to other movies I've ever seen. I thought the only disappointment was Rita Corday's performance as Countess. She seemed to be a bit dry and did not seem to get a great passion for this role. <br /> <br /> When I found out that this film took me all the time and there was enough tension as it all went. Show that it's worth watching. Definitely recommendable, rated 7/10.
