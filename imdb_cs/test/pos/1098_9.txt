This was a random rental in the video store. But I was impressed from the beginning. The wooden camera is the jewel of the second engaging director. The film captures deeply captivating moments and the many times often frustrating and complicated social interactions of young interracial friends would experience South Africa's modern post apartheid. Young actors are pretty good and well-oriented in their approach to basic material and dialogue is natural and interesting. The film is very rich in visuals that provide a framework study of deeper understanding and fulfillment without falling into iconic stereotypes and clich√©s. The musical score for the film adds film to the film without being disturbing. After watching him for the second time, I watched a DVD on Amazon and since then I've been happy.
