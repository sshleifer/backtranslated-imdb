Seriously, where is Al Pacino's Oscar nomination? Is this his career now? Pacino is extraordinary here. It provides a comprehensive, heartbreaking performance like Shylock, a Jewish money lender. The film as a whole was quite great, with beautiful footage from Venice to look at, and the perfect score on the field. other actors are also doing a great job, but the real reason is to see Pacino .. I saw all the nominated Oscars 2004 and I must say that Pacino was stolen. With the game, the lack of a studio campaign, the late release date without more pressure, or most likely, all of the above things .. in my mind, the best performances of the year include Jamie Foxx in Ray, Don Cheadle at Rwanda Hotel and Al Pacino in Venice .
