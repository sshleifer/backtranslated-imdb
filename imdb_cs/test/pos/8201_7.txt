Angela (Sandra Bullock) is a computer expert, but when shy and somewhat unwavering, she does all her work from her apartments. Just as she is going to take a vacation in Mexico, a co-worker sends her a computer drive with disturbing information about him. Angela agrees to meet her classmate, but mysteriously dies in an accident. Angela heads for Mexico, but takes the drive with her. While she's in the sun on the beach, an amazing looking gentleman named Jack (Jeremy Northam) makes foreplay to her. She falls on them and the two end up on a boat to Cozumel. But Jack works for people who have created secret information on the disk and he has it to get it. Even though Angela escapes from the clutches and lands in the US, Jack makes it difficult. She changes Angel's identity on every computer across the country, losing her apartment, bank account, everything. Can Angela, a computer whiz, beat Jack in his own game? This very exciting movie has many advantages. First, Bullock and Northam are two very nice, interesting actors, and their presence adds an immediate passion. The script is very clever and confident in its knowledge of the capabilities of computers and their significance in today's world. Costumes, sets, production and film direction are also wonderful. And despite how it sounds, there's a lot of exciting action when Angela runs on the run to defeat her enemy. If you like thrillers without unnecessary bloodshed or violence, it's a great choice. It delivers high-frequency twists and turns, allowing the viewer to "clean" a very good evening of entertainment.
