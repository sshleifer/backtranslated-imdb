If you're a longtime fan of the doctor and you crouched when you heard they were doing another series, relax - it's more than the high expectations of the original. Stimulation is much faster than the original show, more often it is mounted in 50-minute episodes rather than 90-minute average. Writing is excellent, acting excellent. The hardest - and the best - thing we get used to is the production values ​​of the new series. Compared to the original it is now. (Even if I always have memories of bubble and hand puppet monsters.) If you're not a fan, or if you tried the original and couldn't catch on it, jump now with both feet! Everything you really need to know about the doctor will tell you how they will go. This series was written with minimal references to Doctor's immense story back specifically to encourage new viewers. It is true that I can only see the first new series now, as it is shown on the Sci-Fi channel (in other words, it is probably limited to ribbons due to time constraints), but I look forward to other episodes either on the television station or on the television station. to DVD. (July 4 cannot come soon!)
