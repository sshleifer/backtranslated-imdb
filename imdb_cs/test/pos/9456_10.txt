When I saw the first look, I almost fainted out of excitement. I have long been a fan of the Twelfth Night - it moved me to Shakespeare, so having a modern adaptation is a dream. My expectations were not disappointed. In essence, the story follows the original storyline, which means: complicated! I do not want to try and testify, the plot of summer is likely to cover the foundations. Just imagine a girl pretending to be in a boarding school and thinking about all the possible situations that might arise. I will not even pause to question the credibility of such a conspiracy; reality is NOT a point of film. <br /> <br /> But it is absolutely cheerful. Almost every scene of nail comedy settings. Kudos to Writers, Director and Actors on this Number. Amanda Bynes is the star of this movie and she carries it beautifully. It's super-cute, not a fox and can do flawless comedy. I admire her so much for not coming to a tramp in her films or in public life, like many star stars today. I'm glad at least one decent young actress left in Hollywood. Okay, I'm out of the soap box ... Channing Tatum, yeah it's hot and built like a flippin gorilla, but it really makes me laugh! My favorite scenes in the whole movie are when she tries to talk to Olivia first when she talks about cheese and then about her training regime. additions to characters in forms inane d√©butante mother and monique, classic evil girlfriend. Overall, lots of fun, loooots of laughter, and a very attractive cast. Maybe not par with the original, but it beats from the modern versions of other games, including a lot-offered 10 things I hate about you.
