I wish I never had to go to this hospital (or a hospice if I want to be politically correct) [which ass made this asinin phrase anyway?], For anything other than instructions on how to get out of town. George C. was doing a masterpiece when he played a burned out, over a cynic who concluded that his life was a waste, but he was powerless to change his environment or conditions, even though he had a unique opportunity [which was probably not as golden ]. I got some laughter from this brutally black comedy, but at the same time I was sober and often chilled to the pulp because I'm afraid this atmosphere penetrates most healing homes, even when I write.
