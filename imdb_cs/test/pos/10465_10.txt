This is one of those movies that are getting better with every viewing. I watched it three times and actually signed up for IMDb because I wanted to comment on it. The "about food" movies were made earlier, some of them are really good - such as a Japanese comedy that even Asian movie lovers will have. But this is really in his own league. Its core is a Protestant Christian parable symbolizing the ideal of kindness, but it is far from dogmatic, but it also deals with "good" in each of us, regardless of our religious beliefs or lack. Babet's feast is ubiquitous and sophisticated, but this is the message of the film if there is something stronger, not weaker at all. If you can't attend the extraordinary physical banquet offered by Babette, you're still welcome to this soul holiday. Highly recommended !!
