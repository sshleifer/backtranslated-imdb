Another "end of the world" movie that raises a comparison with the abysmal "Day After Tomorrow". After the same kind of structure as DAT, but with a distinctly Japanese style. How does it work? It depends on your taste of Japanese melodrama. <br /> <br /> I found that small human touches are what makes this film convincing for most of the 2 + hour time. Also frequent cover cards explain some sciences. The effects are probably the best I've seen in Japanese film and are very well compared to something from Hollywood. Many of the catastrophic scenes are really scary, though human bloodshed is usually off screen. And this is one of the disadvantages. While the horror of thousands of on-screen deaths, as in the recent "War of the Worlds might be overwhelming, we can't also get a sense of chaos across the nation that breaks into the ocean. Several scenes touch chaos, but for the most part this story is barely touched, no matter what, this movie works on many levels and is more realistic than DAT, that's up to the end. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is based on one clich√© of conspiracy and another plot that would be in Japan in the 1960s in a film about the danger of "Gorath." After reasonably good science and a mostly realistic disaster, it is a bit disappointing. The sudden stopping of the movie for pop song won't help (if you don't like this song), which meant " Exciting "end a little drag. <br /> <br /> The overall direction is good and the artistic design is excellent. Confinement is also good.
