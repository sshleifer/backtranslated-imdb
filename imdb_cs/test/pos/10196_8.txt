Looks like writer Robocop was a wholesale looting Vindicator. It is a very solid horror / action movie about a person who was set up in an accident to be used in a cruel experiment. Anyone who has seen Robocop knows the story. Watch out for Pam Grier as a biting and damn good killer. This highly effective, violent and bloody horror may not be for anyone who likes it, but this Canadian trip is worth looking for anyone who is fan of the genre. 8/10
