This movie has a great job of making us all the way through the dark tunnel of espionage, from the beginning to the final showdown. The impact of the film is even deeper, knowing that it is based on a true story. Timothy Hutton provides us with quality, understatement and Sean Penn shows why he is one of America's best live actors. As with "Midnight Express," this movie should think twice about what we shouldn't do in a foreign country.
