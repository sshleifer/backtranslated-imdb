In Fassbinder's earlier films his ideas sometimes exceeded his ability to perform them. He was always a great writer, but it took him some time to get to work with the camera and tell the story. The four seasons trader is one of Fassbinder's first films to use color, from bright green pears in a shopping cart to bright red roses at a funeral (Fassbinder's funeral? Who would think). it was still quite minimalist. The occasional intermittent approach seems a bit unpleasant and unnatural, but then Fassbinder emerged from his purely avant-garde phase. It could be because Michael Ballhaus is not behind the camera, but Dietrich Lohmann is slightly worse. Still, it's Fassbinder and you'll get the fix. Broken dreams were so vivid and unshakable that they were alienated from viewers and threw them into depressive stupor. What the doctor ordered. An early classic that shows remarkable progress compared to its first films released only two years ago.
