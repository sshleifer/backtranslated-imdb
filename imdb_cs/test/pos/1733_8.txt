As a child, I've never been in a position to meet Dr. Who, and although I've heard about the series, I never really realized what it was. It was with some hesitation that I sat down to watch the ninth doctor and his contradictions, that it was something like Arthur Dent (of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), but colder. I can't believe what I'm missing, really, why didn't anyone tell me about it before? My entire childhood was rid of the adventures of Doctor Who; I am a huge fan of most science fiction and fantasy adventures. Frankly, I enjoyed it and look forward to the next episode. I must admit that at first I wasn't so sure Billie Piper was the best actress, but I like to say I thought she did it very well, and I added a very realistic touch to the show. Actually, it was one of my favorite aspects of the series; the contrast between the large extraterrestrial conflict scenes contrasted with the angry South London Council Estate life. I am always interested in cases where people's ideas about the world are drastically questioned and how people can take any situation and adjust them in their minds to fit into their mundane lives. I also loved Christopher Ecclestone. I haven't seen many of his films, and I've never seen another actor like Dr Who, but I thought his doctor's depiction was brilliant, extremely sympathetic and yet dark enough to be of interest to you. I have found that many other characters with his history tend to be a little two-dimensional; they have all the right emotions and actions, but they always seem somewhat shallow. The doctor, on the other hand, gained my loyalty to his stratified personality. I agree with some other remarks that a higher budget for special effects, extraterrestrials and what not, could be a little more effective. but then it's not about special effects (even if they help) from what I've read and heard from long-time Dr Who fans; it is the spirit of all things that really count. And I don't think they're doing a bad job with what they have. I really liked all the aliens, but my favorite was Daleks; If I knew anything about the doctor who would watch the show before, it was that there were things that looked like overturned bins on wheels. Before watching, I was quite skeptical about these pepper containers threatening the existence of mankind, but some of them were quite scary! Which I loved, of course. <br /> <br /> Overall a good show. I look forward to the next episode with pleasure. Doctor has a new fan.
