Isabel just got out of jail. She decided not to come back again, but life is difficult for a former convict, especially if they are homeless, like Isabel. When she finds out that she is her friend Rufo, she sees the light of hope, but Rufo is now not only an addict, but also an AIDS patient. This will not cause Isabel to surrender, because if there is a will, it is a journey and she will fight for her future, have a normal life, house and family. A very hard and moving movie, which most of the Spanish cinemas did not notice, the actors are great and the story is very moving, maybe the better handling of secondary characters would make the film better, but it's really good. I highly recommend this to watch, but be aware that this is not a happy Disney movie, it's hard and dramatic.
