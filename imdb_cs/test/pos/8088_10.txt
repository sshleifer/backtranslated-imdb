This movie is the perfect way to explain what a good movie is. It is a film for children and parents and is "timeless". I saw this movie in front of the eleventh ocean and I must admit that the OE actors have a class in advance, but Klatretøsen is much more on the ground and on the move. Why I say Ocean's Eleven is the fact that these two movies have a lot in common and Klatretøsen is good! that can carry comparison with OE. Three young people play their part in the perfect way of not trusting what we are used to in Denmark. Different cases of impossible actions are dealt with by not trusting many young actors (and sometimes even "old boys"). The story? Again it has things in common with Ocean Eleven except stealing money and in Klatretøsen they need to climb up to the strongroom. The part where young people have to look after younger brother Ida gives a subtle element in the film. Try to imagine how to rob a 2-year-old baby with a diaper, on his arm :-) This film can be compared to most "adult" films like MI2 and Ocean's Eleven. Yes, I believe it's good. It is best to see it in the theater because all the children in the room comment on the film and these comments will stay in your hearts forever :-). Sincerely, Klavs.
