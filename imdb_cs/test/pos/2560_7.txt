Better than I expected from a movie sold on the premise of nymphomania and interreligious slavery. Music is great and cinematography is very focused on making Ricci a Betty Paige outboard and working. Samuel L. screams a lot about what he is good at, as well as playing a lot of blues guitar that looks great. Even Justin Timberlake was decent as a mentally disturbed friend. I feel that this material under someone else would be complete with *% #, but instead, only barley managed to carve its own strange little niche while still being an effective drama.
