It is very good at many levels. In fact, since it was a low-budget British india from the first feature film director, which is largely new, it's a great success. I don't know how much it costs. The £ 8,000 number has been handcuffed in publicity, but you never know how reliable such a character is. The thing is that this film seems to cost a few million pounds, and it clearly cost a small fraction of those great special effects, great production design, effective props and costumes, superb photos, good acting and direction, impressive scores, and a stunning sound mix . Even when I said it, much of the script was great. The characters were clearly identified and everyone had something to do. It is a film of ten men who are dressed in roughly the same place and it would be easy for them to be nameless, anonymous emptiness, but that was ten characters - mostly through dialogue and the way they reacted to things. Throughout the act, as the plot unfolded, the script told the story well and showed how it affected the characters. If the whole movie was like a second act, it would be overwhelming. Before the ship fires, twelve people get into each of the escape modules or "e-pods" that break away from the ship. It's no more than automatic metal coffins, and the poor roebucks inside are trapped, cramped, and have no real idea of ​​where they go - but that makes sense. I like e-pods - it's a great idea that is very good and makes more sense than a nice, spacious escape capsule. I also like the way we specifically said they were designed to flee from ship to ship, but they could just make a planet in an emergency - because, let's face it, these guys were bloody, their ship was blown so close to the planet . But that doesn't mean there are still 116 unused e-pods on the cargo ship, and you have to wonder how the prisoner is able to get into the e-pod - but he gets it. (And I just thought: shouldn't the captain descend with his ship instead of being the first one?) E-pods were on a barren planet with nothing but sand and sparse vegetation. - or at least on the sandy, sparsely vegetated part of the planet that may have icy debris and lush jungles elsewhere. No, it's a science fiction movie - it's exactly the same. We have to accept that all e-pods come within a few miles of each other, so that ten survivors are able to come together and fire into the sky flares to locate each other. The captain, a muscular mountain of a man who might have a pretty good career in a quick move, if he gets the right agent, decides to try to contact Captain Behan with whom he intends to meet. But they can't do it from the planet, they need to get into orbit. The engineer says that if they combine powerplants from two e-pods, they may give one of them enough juice to rise to anti-gravitational doodades that are tall enough to fire above the atmosphere. All this can be done on an automatic but will need a 'pilot' to send a signal. The captain bravely volunteers for this, but in a commendably sensible movement the engineer points out that putting the heaviest man into a somewhat dodgily corrected e-pod is ridiculous and that he must be the lightest member of the team. It's a baby. I really liked the way he now points out that his name is David, and the captain is using it with respect and respect. That was a good storytelling and good characterization.
