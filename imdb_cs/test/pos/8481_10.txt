Jamie Foxx is absolutely Ray Charles. His performance is simply a genius. Own the film, as well as Spacek owned "Coal Miner's Daughter" and Quaid owned "Great Balls of Fire". In fact, it's hard to remember that part of Ray Charles is acting and not playing alone. Ray Charles is legendary. He is well established as a musician and music is deep, complex and innovative. The film should give new fans of the young viewer a little bit of his music. Ray Charles's life has provided excellent biographical material for a film that goes beyond just another film about a musician. I confess that I knew very little about his life until I saw the movie. I came out to be amazed by Ray Charles's courage, strength and innovation as a man and a musician.
