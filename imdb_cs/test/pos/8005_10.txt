Many of us regard art as pleasing only when a masterpiece touches something deep within us. This means that a completed creation can only be accepted and valued if we can personally relate to it. It was cold here in Australia 1992, when I saw Batman Returns in cinemas and blew me away. Both "I". I should have belonged to an ideal, a standard, but at the same time I lived another life. Tim Burton was the first filmmaker who said he was okay to make the comic movie dark, and to admit that all of us could become dark. After Tim Burton, Batman's interpretations, many other dark comic heroes and anti-heroes have flooded the cinema. For decades, folk comic folklore has spoken of friendly, sympathetic heroes with sketchy smiles and magical superpowers flying in the sky, spinning mighty cobwebs from their wrists and wearing red shoes and the power of a locomotive. But what happens when you're only ten years old and you see your parents coldly executed before your eyes? Prudce. Somewhere in your psyche, your young psychological makeup will fall apart. The only way that such pain and injury can be handled is to create an alternative persona. Your other self will be stronger, using all the anger of all anger to use any available means to avenge my parents' innocence for criminals, those criminals, criminals. This is the life seen by Bruce Wayne. Both couples. The world he sees is dark, grim and cold. Though he is on the streets, and people hear him on a cruise, they don't go out to get their autograph. It is their Savior, not the personality contest winner. Batman returns about the losers. Batman, still another Christmas, remains "the only lone beast man in the city". Bruce Wayne never gets to the legal arrest of Max Shrek. The penguin never gets out of the pain of being kicked out by the parents of Gotham, and Selina Kyle is lost forever to be mentally fragmented and traumatized. And the hero doesn't get a girl or a cat. This film plunges into the desire of all of us to want to belong so desperately, to have a home, as Bruce Wayne and Oswald Cobblepot have expressed. in all of us, to be questioned, respected, and not ignored by the wishes of Selina Kyle, Oswald, and of course Bruce Wayne. However, sometimes we are all suppressed in one way or another, we are told that we are ideal to treat a particular standard. That is until we finally intervene. At the end of the movie, there is only hope as we see Catwoman rising to the night sky. But come what we all have to wish for good will to all men and women. As far as I am concerned, I cannot say that I will get to the point where I will believe that my duality problem will be reconciled. But that's OK. We all have a dark side. Batman Returns is not just the best of Batman's movies, but it's a truly exceptional, extraordinary piece of story.
