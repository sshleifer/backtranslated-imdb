Perhaps not Miyazaki's best work, but I couldn't help but love her to death. A five year old boy finds what he thinks is a goldfish stuck in a bottle. He saves his life and keeps him in a bucket like a pet, but he is truly a magical being, the daughter of a human wizard and a sea goddess. Ponyo, as the boy calls her, is her father taken back to the sea, who is trying to discourage her from returning to the country and becoming a man, but getting into magic elixirs and doing what she wants to do. The story is simple and cute. But where the film really comes to life, it's a huge work of art. The drawings are more childish than in other Miyazaki works, but in its simplicity is beauty. As with all his films, Miyazaki creates this world of imagination that I was just astonished. When they saw it in the theater, they remembered what it was like when Jo Hisaishi's introductory notes for Princess Mononoke flooded me and gave me a goosebumpy just ten years ago (the score here is just as amazing). I wanted to live in this world and never leave it.
