Of all the actresses in the movie today, Kristin Scott Thomas would be my choice if I had to pick one for a stuck on the desert island. <br /> <br /> I could watch her simply, say, sitting in a chair for a few hours. It's hard for me to be objective when it comes to one of her films. However, I enjoyed this film and its story on its own, more than that which indicates the average ranking among many films. people who have previously commented on this site. But Harrison Ford is not one of the most entertaining actors. But it's one of the handfuls that has reached the level of moving from 7 characters to 8 on film, so who am I to argue? However, Ford is often droll in its acting style and sometimes it seems to be in serious need for antacids and a shot of caffeine - and "Random Hearts" is in this grouping. His obsession with probing the losses that both he and Thomas have endured with respect to their linked husbands is understandable, given his profession as a detective - but not at the level listed here. Although not far, it has crossed the line into an "annoying" category. However, most of the scenes after they were with him and Thomas were interesting and well-played. This movie could have been 9 *, but I would have lowered it a few levels, based on Ford's overall performance, and more because it contained slightly more strange subfield elements than seemed necessary.
