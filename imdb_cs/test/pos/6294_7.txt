Along with In the Army!, This is one of Paula Shore's best films if there is such a thing. While the whole West Coast-meet-Midwest-culture clash is nothing new, this film proves that the story is a little more fun with the wild and unpredictable antiquity of the then fresh Shore. While changing values ​​would probably go in the opposite direction, the whole concept was rather fun. Not only was Shore's interaction with the family happy, but also Carla Gugino and Tiffani-Amber Theissen (always having Amber in her book) in two flashy and early roles. One of the movies I have no problem watching when she's on TV.
