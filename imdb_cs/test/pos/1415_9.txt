Stephen Hawking has one of the greatest minds, or if it is too simplistic to do one of the most exciting and brave things for him, and he also gets trapped in a mutilated body that leaves him in a wheelchair and computer communicate. . Maybe I didn't know enough about how Hawking goes in (I've always known him as 'the guy who talks like a computer who knows a lot about the universe, and so, you know') that he's a British, that he was a normal child, and maybe most remarkably, a disease that might possibly have left him dead at the age of 21 put him in a position to focus on his life. According to Errol Morris, it is equally curious and cool, visually dazzling Portrait in Short History of Time, Hawking was already brilliant, in the headland (when other Oxford students were faced with depressing algebraic equations, he replied more than three times quantities in hourly time), but when faced with challenges, mostly from other theories of other scientists, he bounced with his own. Under some complex scientific interview - and if you have less than B- in astronomy, just like me, you'll have to keep your ears especially involved in explaining the possible infinite time or peculiarity of a black hole - there's a human being who just wants to enjoy his goose on his birthday. Morris is interested in Hawking just for those who can't get enough of his theories about how particles can get in and out of a black hole, or even a creator, or not, depending on on how much we take into account Einstein and time. But it also captures the story of a man and his condition that creates it as something more interesting than if Morris did one or the other. Too much talk about space could cause head injuries and too much about his personal life, and you might wonder what the fuss is about who's been in this bestseller book for more than five years. Almost Despite Its Appearance, Hawking defines what it is like to be a conscious entity in the universe that, as it notes, will not be separated from whether and when the universe will be a cap for another 10 billion years. Through all this, in Brief History of Time, we look at the genius and its humility (not to mention its colleagues and families' ten cents here and there) through undoubtedly the hypothetical and mathematical thinking of the universe process.
