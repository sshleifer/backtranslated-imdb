I saw a move in Paris in May 2006 ... I was debating the impossible between these and the missions ... I am very glad that I chose the OSS 117 not only because it was funny, but also in France he could watch a French film. I had a great time ... I would recommend it. It is important to have some understanding of the French company Today to really enjoy the humor of this movie ... can't wait to release the DVD ... I don't know how some of 'jeu De mots' '' would be translated into English when he is out! P.S. I saw at 'BRICE de Nice', which is a film with Dujardino, about which all the children in France spoke. this movie is a comedy but a sillier before you can imagine ... in comparison to both films, I have to say that Dujardin did a good job at OSS 117.
