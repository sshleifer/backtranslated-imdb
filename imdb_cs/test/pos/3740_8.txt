Discovering something, the journey is so much more fun, much more surreal and so much more emotionally zincing than when you finally reach your destination. Falling in love is perhaps one of the richest feelings in the world. You feel energized, energized and alive. You simply want to be around this person every second of the day, and the sound of their voice will inspire and sometimes wake you up. Love, and all the physical and emotional side effects that come with it, is pure bliss. From here it is anyone, but when you start your journey together, nothing can be compared to it. Diane Lane and Richard Gere play Adrienne Willis and Dr. age. Together with this mystical way, where love and the discovery of emotions on the road will help them to save them, they are going to make this film together. Lane deals with the typical tearing of a former husband who still loves her, but in her eyes, just because the woman he cheated doesn't want him anymore. Like her, as she does not love him, she is part of her part that is considering taking him back. Why are you asking? Because in life and love, sometimes intelligence replaces comfort. Yes, this man cheated on her, but he has children with him, he has made a living with him, and there is still a connection with him. Richard Gere plays a recently divorced husband and estranged father. He just lost a patient when he reacted negatively to anesthetic. He is now sued by her family, and he is guilty ridden, but hardened about the problem. That's what brings him to Rodanthe. Although his lawyer told him not to do so, he felt compelled to visit a female husband in Rodanthe. She'll stay at the inn Adrienne looks after. Soon they will find comfort in their arms and find that they too may have a second chance in life. Now it sounds like a simple movie idea, and even though it might be something you would do. I've seen or read before, Gere and Lane just own the movie. Diane Lane lights up the screen with a smile. Her eyes glittered in the dark and the life she brings to the character is worth a look. Gere's character is a little different. It's tougher and bitter. Adrienne's pain and her passion make him escape from his shell. Silence is accused of his tense relationship with his son and blames himself for the death of the patient. Outside, he tells everyone who listens that it's not his fault and that she was 1 out of 50,000 victims. But deep in it, it's taking her away. They find each other at a time when they both need to listen to someone. Gere and Lane were in the movie together before, but this is the first time lovers have played. They were married in Unfaithful but here they play lovers to find themselves when people in their lives left them. They have sparkle and real chemistry. I'd like to see more movies with them. In fact, I'd like to see more movies with Diane Lane, but that's another story. The nights at Rodanthe are a very passionate and romantic movie about two lost souls who are saving each other. They both become better people, both become stronger people. I liked it immensely and would recommend it to everyone, not just couples. It is a film about redemption, absolution and other chances. <br /> <br /> He will also ask you to bring some hankies. <br /> <br /> 8/10
