Clint Eastwood plays a wounded Union soldier who was found by a Confederate boarding school girl, and instead of turning to Confederate soldiers, she is taken back to health. Women-folk seem to have side motifs at this point. Director Geraldine Paige apologizes for not making him into the Confederacy, nor will she pass him as her cousin. Of course, when one gets to feel better, he becomes a man who is basically a lady, and to a large extent on wheels, but when he is arrested, he really gets into jail, in fact it is so bad that he he cuts off his leg, but for his own good. Of course not from retribution. Things get a little further when some women don't get what they want. I haven't seen it for years and still has a certain horror about it, which is still quite strange today's standards. It's not typical of Eastwood at all. If you haven't seen it, it's worth seeing. 8 out of 10.
