I saw this movie on the big screen as a child and loved it - hot and everything. I recently found a copy on the video and checked it again. Badly done, sure ... schlock fun, definitely. He still packs a fun blow. It's much more fun than the boring Disney version ("Alive"). All that "Alive" was better was special effects. If you are a lover of B-movies, I highly recommend "Surviving", not to mention all the other films by Rene Cardon Jnr ... and the Mexican matches his father made (Rene Cardona Snr). "Surviving" is long overdue for the DVD Special Edition treatment. Are you listening, all kind people, at Anchor Bay ...?
