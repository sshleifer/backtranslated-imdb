A particularly enjoyable movie for those of us who saw it when young, because after all it was intended for young people to watch - when they looked at it again as adults, it is better to have glasses with tinted roses. Jungle Jim films and later TV reputable Johnny Weismuller went on to do for Columbia (in the last 3 movies he had to use his own name though as they lost the rights) after getting a bag from Tarzan playing for Sol Lesser. Johnny Sheffield also gave up playing Boy to become a Jungle Bomb Boy in a series of 12 movies. Jim and the party go on a dangerous safari chasing the hidden Zimbal Temple occupied by the obscure devil tribe Doctors who seem to have the poison secret that could also be a polio remedy. Edgar Rice Burroughs probably approved. After 16 years of talking monosyllabic, Weismuller seemed uncomfortably connected with sentences, not that it mattered. On a quick march, we encounter a lot of interesting but generally playful jungle residents, preventing the sinister crocodile from eating a leading lady with a foot caught under a twig and a surrealistic elephant (used to shoot in the frame's frame). The Captain Dog and Caw-Caw Crow had many adventures, none of which came from the base in case you concentrated! The biggest problem with film is farcical climax, which can be exciting, but unfortunately it also reminds you of the end of the serial part? and the original superb series was made 12 years ago. Although I would not personally want this to happen for a few more hours! The only thing that was difficult was Weismuller; in many ways a fun childhood film from the old days - not recommended for serious adults, so I love it.
