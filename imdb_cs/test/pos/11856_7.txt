Sophisticated sexual comedies are always difficult to pull out. Check out the Blake Edwards movies, which is probably the master of this genre, and you'll find that they're so missing as hits. If a movie of this kind never works, it can never go back to the tried and true humor of teenage sexual comedy [ie. "American Pie"] or warm up the audience by the sentiment of romantic comedy [ie. Julia Roberts' entire career. It can only keep the pressure on the end, and hope that the audience can appreciate the almost desired irony of its solution. Written by Wally Wolodarsky and Maya Forbes, "Other People's Vision", with a committed pair of Ed & Alice [Jay Mohr & Julianne Nicholson], just seconds from the back of the car. As the frame freezes, we unexpectedly hear the thoughts and fears of both characters. From there, we welcome that the story to be developed will have a gender perspective. Two-month shyness of their promises, Ed & Alice already look and behave like an old couple. In the early bathroom scene, their actions show us how comfortable they are together and how long they are together. So when a line to propel a forward is spoken - expected of the least likely two - it is as if the relationship itself is causing change, even if it means its own destruction. Once all the basic rules have been set [Ed can't sleep with his mother, or to take care of it, Salma Hayek], both heads go into their own directions in the hope of finding some meaningless sex that will strengthen their relationship. At first, everything seems to be going as planned, because their daily exams only help to set a passion between them. But predictably, as deeper emotions of regret and jealousy begin to emerge, they soon find themselves separated and on the verge of disintegration. All these decisions lead to a decision that you may or may not like - depending on your own degree of cynicism. <br /> <br /> For such a comedy, you need a strong cast with supportive characters as strong as leads. And director Wolodarsky will not disappoint. Here he cast two of my favorite actresses as Sisters - Julianne Nicholson & Lauren Graham - and allows them to play on their strengths. Nicholson, who always reminded me of young Shirley MacLaine, brings Alice's air of naivety and vulnerability, even though her actions seem smaller. And as far as Graham is concerned, the actress who has proven to be able to overcome the entire Howard Hawks will steal every scene in which she is playing with "no BS". As for the boys, Jay Mohr is serviceable here, just like Josh Charles. "Malcolm in the middle" of Byron Cranston must be applauded for taking the British accent and letting it all hang out. But the real pleasure is Andy Richter and his sub-plot involving the single mother Helena Slater. While his scenes seem almost to be another film, they are by far the funniest and his dead are stealing the show. For independent production, "seeing other people" has a personal and introspective feeling - something that would be apparent if a large Hollywood movie of this kind was missing. Not to mention that this film also has really funny moments - unlike most Hollywood comedies in general. <br /> <br /> 5 stars stars: 3 1/2 stars
