I put on the DVD the expected perversion of the camps from the creators of the Society and Re-Animator, and I was quite surprised that I was involved in an authentically thrilling story. Acting was top (nice to see Vosloo in the role of protagonist after a long chain of villains), a story involving and a couple of twists quite surprising. I thought I was going to move forward quickly to get to the bearable scenes, but I watched it instead, just to be at the end. Maybe I'm too lenient, but like I've said I didn't expect much more than extraterrestrial sex. Of course, if you're looking for some hot extraterrestrial sex, you'll be released. It was mostly nonsense with a test table that was quickly abbreviated, with a wink-and-you-miss-it look at an interesting 'impregnator' alien.
