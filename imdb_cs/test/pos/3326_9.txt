I can't help but notice the negative reviews of this movie gotten. To be honest, I saw a preview of this film and the resolution made me interested. Yes, I rented it after reading the comments of others. They are right in that some of the actors leave much to be desired. They are also right that one of the best performances of this movie was Dr. Graves. Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant, a wheelchair boy. I identify with the character he played, maybe because I'm in a wheelchair. This movie is definitely worth a look.
