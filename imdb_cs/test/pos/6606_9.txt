A dozen bored surfers, mostly kids in Venice, California, not only rediscover skateboarding, but also make a once-forgotten suburban shot from the 1950s into an action sports revolution. Narrarated by Sean Penn, Dogtown recounts life in the more rundown "Locals Only" beach communities circa 1974, which consisted of mostly surfing in early morning tides and loitering. The Zephyr team (or Z-boys, as they call it) spend one summer struggling with boredom by building their own boards with the help of local surf shop owners. After joining the emerging skateboarding competitions in SoCal, they transfer it to their own scene; the one that evokes a generation of skateboarders consisting of greats like Tony Hawk, Shaun White, and the creators of the X-Games. Dogtown gives the skateboarding a chronological look and an up-from-the-bootstraps history you've never known to have. <br /> <br /> by Andy Frye at MySportsComplex.blogspot.com
