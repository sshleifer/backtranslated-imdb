I loved this movie, I saw it when I was about 8 years old and almost seven years later, I saw it again tonight. I thought it had an interesting idea, just what upset me was the end I felt like a cop. "It's hard to find this movie here and I was lucky to see it on BRAVO. I also expected to see more Drew Barrymore here!
