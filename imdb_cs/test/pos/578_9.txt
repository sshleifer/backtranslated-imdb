Before starting my review, I read every review of the movie "The Muppet Movie" and I can't believe anyone could give a negative review of a movie like this. (Fortunately, there was only one.) I mean, I can understand how someone doesn't like 'Star Wars' because of the entire Sci-Fi genre, but not as a movie in which they play some of the lovable puppets in human history. is almost sad. Well, now I'm going to get out of the soap and check this movie. 'Muppet Movie' came out when I was seven. All my friends wanted to see it as their birthday movie, so I think I saw it four times in the first month of the theaters. As a child, many things have attracted me to this and all others. Muppet movies and TV shows. The singing was probably main. Most of the songs in The Muppet Movie are classics. From "Rainbow Connection" to "I'm Go Go Go Someday", they're fun and provocative. As an adult, I see Muppet in almost all other forms. light. Yes, the things that excited me about being a child are still there, but they are small jokes and those that are just cheerful. I think that when you think about it, Jim Henson is sick. Kermit is a frog and it is in love with a sweet pig who wears purple gloves and can cut you karate into two pieces. Fozzie is a stand-up comedian bear. Gonzo is 'anything' that is infatuated with chickens. Then you have two old boys who have a tie, a piano dog, a rock band with a maniac drummer, a Swedish chef you don't understand, and a number of other characters that are just plain eccentric. For these reasons, and even more so, Henson amused millions of children and adults, allowing us to watch something special and remember. 'Muppet Movie' will always stay in my heart for many reasons, but I think the biggest of them is because it's a movie, unlike many recent movies for kids that I feel comfortable with, kids watch. Plus, I don't get bored of my mind with jokes that are stupid at the level of my kids. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie that's sure to remember forever.
