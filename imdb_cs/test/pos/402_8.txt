Better than the average World War II "Who-dun-it" era with Warner Baxter as a former gangster who suffered from amnesia and was reborn as a psychiatrist, now known as Robert Ordway, who helps both police and criminals who want to go straight. Crime Doctor's Courage is the fourth in a row of ten and includes a victim who might have some mental problems. The reference to "courage" is not particularly clear. This entry revolves around the death of Gordon Carson's hunter, whose two previous wives are in mysterious circumstances and who are dying in a locked room under conditions, commemorating suicide, but murdering dr. Hillary Brooke plays the role of widow Kathleen Carson, who deals with Anthony Carus - a mysterious Spanish dancer whose act is his sister who disappears on stage. As a novelist secretary, Jerome Cowan is a good support actor as Lloyd Corrigan as a crime enthusiast. Haunted houses with creaking doors, wardrobes in the basement and suspects who are never seen in daylight add to the air. The dance sequence file is very complicated and ballet music very good. It stands out for direction, production design and photography. Outdoor shots and costumes suggest more well-being than a regular "B" detector thriller. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
