The whole town of Blackstone is afraid because they lynched Bret Dixon's brother - and he returns to revenge! At least he thinks so. Great Johnny Hallyday and very interesting, early Mario Adorf star in this Italo-Western, of course shot in the Alps. Bret Dixon Returns to Blackston to find out why his brother was lynched. He is a loner and an excel parceler, each afraid of him - Mexican bandits (fighting the Gringos who took their land!), As well as "decent" citizens who lynched Brother Bret. They were lynching him because they thought they had stolen money from Dallas instead of stealing money. But it is only half the truth as we have found during this psychologically interesting Western. But beware, it's a bit of a depressing movie because everyone turns out to be guilty and certainly everyone's bad for bones ... <br /> <br /> Still, I really enjoyed it and gave it I am 8/10. Strange that only less than 5 people voted for this film since January 12, 2002.
