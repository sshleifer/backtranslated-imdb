From the introductory scenes of FIERCE PEOPLE (a combination of tribal habits, as photographed by an anthropologist the father of the young storyteller Finn Earl, who demonstrates why this South American Ishkanani tribe is so fierce) the film's direction is hazy: we watch a dark comedy about comparing life on the streets of New York with uncivilized peoples , or is it the message of the film's more serious intent? But as the story unfolds this subtle line between fun and philosophical impact, it becomes increasingly clear. Griffin Dunne's Dirk Wittenborn's adaptation of his novel may be a little careless at a time when it is glowing from the rational plot development, but ultimately there is a strong enough final impact on the hole patch he created. Our storyteller Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) lives in New York with his coke-dependent masseuse / sexually obsessed mother Liz (Diane Lane) and waits for the summer to join his anthropological a father on a trip to South America a father he only knows from letters and videos when a bust suddenly changes his life: one of the wealthy clients Liz Ogden Osborne (Donald Sutherland) saves the family down and moves them to their ten acres. and power. In exchange for Osborne being a private masseuse, Liz and Finn can live in a mansion with a 'dirty rich' Osbornes - daughter of Mrs. Langley (Elizabeth Perkins) and grandchildren of Bryce (Chris Evans) and Maya (Kristen Stewart). Osborne and his doctor lead Liz on the road to drying up and Finn's bond with Osborne and his grandchildren, and despite the differences in the poor versus the rich, they live life situations - for a while. Incidents are changing, and Finn is attacked and raped by a masked attacker, a turning point for the film, and Finn's look at Osborne's family. Osborne reveals her past to Finn and together they can uncover the truth about the worrying Finn incident - as well as the wild disease rich class. <br /> <br /> The movie uses many tribal clips during the film, drawing some disturbing parallels for some of the more challenging scenes. For this viewer who works well, but when the director decides to place tribal people in full shelves in the context of Osborne's estate, the concept feels distinct as if viewers had to be forced to "get it". The various subplots between Jilly (Paz de la Huerta) and Finn, and the introduction of an obese, retarded Whitney chalk artist (Branden Williams) push the credibility of the rich and "lower class" borders, but Sutherland, Lane and Yelchin are strong enough to forgive us forgiveness film. It's not a great movie, but one with many worthy ideas splashed on a project screen that often feels lost in its directional fight. Grady Harp
