I'm just getting a chance to dig Austen past movies, and I took it because Persuasion is, was and will always be, my favorite work of Jane Austen, and Anne Elliot my favorite heroine of Austen. So it was with great expectation that I put the disc in my player. I wasn't even disappointed. I knew there would be some draws, so I would bring them in and try to be too fat. Anne Elliot is the most introvert Austen characters; is the least talking and the least funny. There are passages in the book where Anne says nothing - only her feelings are described. It works well in the press, but how do you successfully transfer it to the big screen? The shortening of thoughtful voice matters (which would seem tiring over the course of four hours) has left you with a long series of shots where the heroine says little or nothing and has to communicate with her facial expression. It can leave the feeling that the movie is slow and lacking purpose. If you need a more apparent Austen style, then this movie is definitely not for you; but if it is muted, your style is more and you tend to pick up on unspoken "vibration", this will meet all expectations. can communicate a lot. She looked like I always imagined Anne Elliot would look like: no knockout - Anne wasn't supposed to be an elegant, elegant family - even in her first youth - which is also occasionally highlighted by lighting and makeup. What you see is someone who is very similar to Austen: someone whose appearance you can go through once; but hear how he speaks, and he looks more closely, the more you know her, the better you know her. This is Anne Elliot, whom Anne Firbank has brought to life. Captain Wentworth's picture will be inspired by Bryan Marshall. Bitterness is apparently not obvious (except for the concert scene); And, yes, I found it hard to believe that Louis Musgrove's injury was interesting, as it turned out. But this is another point of Austen's book: he did not consider it interesting, found it interesting, and eventually failed (a sigh of relief). So it also fits into the original Austen story. I particularly liked the depiction of Lady Russell, which I thought was not depicted as TRULY bad in the book; this also comes out in this adaptation. So this is one movie that closely followed the book; I could write a lot more about how faithfully everything was reproduced, but here I would come. Charles Musgrove remained one of the most interesting characters (good fun), Mary most enjoyable (I was dying to let her lose weight - but I had the feeling I was reading the book), the captains and the admiral I thought was charming. <br /> <br /> I thought the cinema was a slight stiff one. There was little or virtually no escape from one screen to another - perhaps this is because it is a television movie. One scene - PDO! - Next scene, actors coming from right, go left and - CHOP! - Another scene where the same thing happens. That was the only part of the movie I felt a little cheated about. I suppose Low Budget has to show up somewhere. And as I said before, if you like a certain speed you should go with Jane Austen, don't bother with this, it's too slow. I really liked it because it brought a lot of detail (the sets were richly elegant!) An excellent adaptation of my favorite novel Austen. I warmly recommend!
