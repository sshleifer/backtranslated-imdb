Directed by Jacques Tourneur (Cat People, From the Past, Demon Night) and written by Phillip Dunn (How Green Was My Valley) Anne of the Indies is a pretty interesting adventure pirate movie. His main character, Captain Anne Providence, is based on the real pirate woman Anne Boney, who actually lived and sailed across the Atlantic 18th century. The film begins with a naval battle where Anne (Jean Peters) pirate ship is attacking a merchant ship that was on its way to Europe from South America. As a result, the treasure of great value is captured along with the handsome French officer Pierre La Rochelle (Louis Jourdan) who is captured. Anne ends up in love with him and her feelings are obviously reciprocated, but it is only until she frees him when she finds out she has a beautiful young woman, Molly (Debra Paget), whom she has fallen in love with. Anne begins to plan revenge on both of them, but in an unexpected turn of destiny she ends up being a great victim to save them instead. Pirate Movie Cliche "Black Beard" also makes his appearance here, this time played by Thomas Gomez. Although Anne indies probably seems to be nothing more than a repetition of the pirate film Clich√© has her classic moments in beautiful visual and naval battle sequences shot at Technicolor, as well as in some aspects of the story and especially in personal events directed by Jacques Tourneur. 7/10
