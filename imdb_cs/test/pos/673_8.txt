Especially I enjoyed Delly's review of this movie and I agree that Howard is not the only "damaged" character. Howard is rather mercilessly "set up" by the script, but there is no evidence that his previous employer is actually dead or, if he is, murdered. Howard doesn't know, nor do we. In horror and confusion, seeing a woman lying there, she screwed. But he will never hurt Helen Gordon, no matter how furious he is. Indeed, she reacts with horror to Helen's faint charm, and that she keeps scissors ... then she continues to clean up and greets recovered Helen with almost pathetic "I'm tired now. I will go home ". Frankly, I don't think he's a psychopath. Sick puppy, certainly, but not a psychopath. The problem with Howard is that he has no real male identity. He wanted to serve his country, but his mental state would deny him a place in the army. It is rarely rooted and isolated: no woman, no girl, no home (again, at least as far as we know). And she does female work - "the floor is my specialty". Helen's niece ruthlessly detaches this pride in its thoroughness by shouting causally that she will want a man with real work. Also, although he finds himself strongly attracted to Helen, he is unable or unwilling to do more than scare her by making a strong sexual passage. He is remarkably helpless - he can't fight, he can't work, he can't make love. Helen is justifiably frightened, though. He tries to contact him, but when he finds himself not responding normally (ie, outside the comfort zone provided by her memories of Ned's husband), he inadvertently pushes all Howard's buttons by lying in his attempt to escape. Both characters, trapped in the house, trapped in fear, neurosis, anger and memory, deserve sympathy. I know the sudden end disappointed by some reviewers, but I felt it was good because it offered a kind of release to the characters. I think Helena is free from the past. When Howard tries his husband's military coat, Helen's disgusted reaction is highlighted. She undoubtedly feels that the "sanctity" of Ned's property has been violated, but hopefully her need to keep everything "intact" has been lost in the reality of her own struggle with danger. Maybe he can move on. Howard is also freed - from an endless cycle of anger, injury and violence. Whether it's a treatment or a prison, it's debatable, but I hope it's earlier. Great performances of Ryan and Lupine. I prefer "On Dangerous Ground," but that's pretty good.
