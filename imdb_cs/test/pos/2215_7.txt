"Acceptance" is a fine drama, even if it's ending. Lauren Ambrose plays Evie, who is trying to avoid college. In order for her overworked mother not to notice, she creates poems that everyone thinks her mentally disabled sister wrote. All acting is first and foremost Lauren Ambrose and Amy Madigan. They both did a great job. The peak is also very strong. There are only two bad parts. The first is Stewart Worthy's character, played by Christopher Lloyd. Part of it is underdeveloped. Another weakness is the end. It goes around in circles that I didn't expect with a 84 min run. In addition, the film is definitely worth watching.
