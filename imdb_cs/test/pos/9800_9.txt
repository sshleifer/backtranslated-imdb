I first saw this film as a younger child. My sister told me about it and I thought it would be more of a children's movie. However, it will also remain an incredible film. It is true that the theme behind the film is ruff, but also true, this film never ceases to touch your heart. I was only 6 when I first saw it, and only yesterday, 7 years later, I saw it again. For the first time in a long time. Even after I knew how it ended, I knew I saw it a billion, I cried a billion times like a tiny little child. When I saw it a few years ago, I finally got the idea and seriousness of the movie. So I stopped for a while. But yesterday I didn't change the channel, I watched it. By the end, I was astonished how much it made me laugh, cried, thought, and above all believed in mericals. I did not believe for a long time and this movie got me out of the shell and opened my heart. This film has no impact. I was also so impressed by the actors. Especially Bobby. So if you want to see this movie for the first time, I recommend seeing it myself. With Tissue. And be ready to discover your young, sweet, innocent party and the party that still has hope. This movie touched my soul when I was only 6 years old, and even at this time when I was trying to figure out who I was, the movie helped me realize what I didn't and still want to be in life.
