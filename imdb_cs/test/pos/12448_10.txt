Slipknot is a hardcore rock band from Des Moines, Iowa. Nine band members who all wear customized boilersuits, and customized, home masks (eg # 6 is a clown mask, # 0 various gas masks, # 8 is a torn + torn dummie crashtest mask with dreadlocks). It seems that the music itself goes through the finals between reason and otherwise, yet it is done so brilliantly and mentally. <br /> <br /> "Welcome to our neighborhood" is rather a common name, but the footage itself is something else. Interviews with the band, soundbites from their latest, selftitled albums, 2 live shows, and one forbidden-by-MTV music video (a brilliant tribute to the classic Kubrick movie "The Shining"), a movie clock in not even half an hour, but definitely worth it. It is ideal for introducing any meta / hardcore fan to Slipknot.
