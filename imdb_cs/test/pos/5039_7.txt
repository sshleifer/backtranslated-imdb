Angels are a bit of an American obsession, but they are often rather boring. They are the messengers of God and also the angels of the arch are great warriors (Lucifer is the heaviest and most beautiful until he is fired from the sky). What happens if you don't believe in anything, let alone angels, and they are sent to explore the angelic story just to deal with the wings and less than the angelic attitude. . Michael is a rude, unpleasant, effeminate messenger of heaven who will fulfill your desire and make you care for the world you touch. Funny, but not so much, touching, but not too sentimental, intelligent without being clever ... it's just a good simple, little comedy. Watch the lazy Sunday afternoon.
