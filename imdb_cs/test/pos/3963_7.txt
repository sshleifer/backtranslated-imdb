This movie has something that most of the other films of its genre are not: intelligence and good news. Adopted, is a story kid named Bartleby (Justin Long) who gets rejected by every college covered. His parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. So, Bartleby and several other students who face similar problems will start a fake school to stop in front of their parents as college students. Not everything goes into the plan and the movie is about being winged. But behind this conspiracy, which sounds ridiculous, are good news, morality, and a new perspective on the American education system. The South Harmon Institute of Technology, a college, accepts those who have not gone anywhere else. The message is that you don't need "money, tradition, or fantasy books - you just need a desire for a better one." they are a totally unorthodox school, but what the film teaches is that what is still OK- and others (whether it's a person or a school) is not necessarily bad, and that everyone, no matter what, should have a chance for a better self - despite being "strange". his message of uncomplication and also the traces of anti-publication. But not only the news is great - it's fun! haha I laughed very much. Humor can be gentle, but it can also be obvious and it's a great mix. Brotherhood beware.
