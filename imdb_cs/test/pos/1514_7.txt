The cat of Lucia Fulci in the brain is an inventive and somewhat egoistic story of a director who is decent in madness. The director himself is Fulci, who plays in the film. Fulci became famous horror fans everywhere as "godfather gore" and for good reason, because he has provided us with some of the worst and most horrifying movies ever to delight in the silver screen; from eyeball violence in films like 'Zombi 2' to a man who was hacked to death with chains in 'The Beyond' until a full gore fest called 'The New York Ripper'; if you want gore (and let's face it, who doesn't), Fulci is your man. However, all this for gorehounds like you and I chose my tax on Fulci's mental state, and he quickly immerses in the madness caused by what he films. Fulci's problems did not end even in his mental state, because his psychiatrist, who was about to see his problem, took himself to murder himself as a hobby, and used Fulci's movies as murder plans! I have to say that playing in this movie is absolutely cruel. There's one scene that includes a hooker, and it's just appropriate to laugh at her, both for acting and for stupidity. Fulci takes the lead role of the film (of course). He is not an actor and shows but his performance is the best in the film. It's even safe to say that a whole, acting is bad for an Italian horror movie. Of course, no one gets into the Italian horror, waiting for good performances, so it's somewhat forgiven, but I think Fulci could hire some better. Bad dubbing won't help either. However, something that helps is the fact that terrible action is balanced by a lot of gore, and it is extreme to say the least! People cut off their heads, the woman is killed in the shower (and unlike Psycho, we really see it here), people are hacked, fed pigs, and there's a lot of the most beautiful weapons in the cinema - on the display stage that pleased me. The amount of gore is massively over the top a lot of time that gives the film something 'spoof' feel, but Cat in the brain is of course the language in the cheek film as well. <br /> <br /> It would be difficult to make a film about yourself and not to think that it is a bit big head, and Fulci really has a little big head in this movie. His name is often mentioned and he is on screen almost all the time; it's not much unlike 'New Nightmare' in ego bets, but it's obvious that it had a good time, and I was having fun, so we can forgive him for little egoism. The end of the film leaves it - I saw that they were coming a mile away, but then I didn't really think the movie would make that trip, but I was wrong; it unfortunately. The end left me cool and the movie is better when you turn it off just before the last two minutes. Despite being an end and terrible acting, Cat in the Brain is a lot of fun and will delight Fulci's endless enthusiast and is therefore recommended.
