This episode of Buffy was one of my personal favorites. Also number three personal favorites Joss. The episode was a very small dialogue, and despite the good people at Emmy decided to deserve a nomination. Unfortunately, it didn't win. When Hush first premiered it received about 6 million viewers, which was the highest ranked episode of season four. That should tell you something. Although very little was spoken, they managed to get the intrigues to tune in. Nothing is more creepy than a bunch of silver jagged men who leave you with a scalpel when they smile. I think that despite the lack of dialogue, the actors have done a fantastic work on the episode.
