Danton was a hero and one of the founders of the French Revolution of 1789. This film is five years later and the revolution turned into something ugly. While at the beginning the revolution promised freedom, at this point the small committee that manages the country is extremely repressive and is a dictatorship. Danton and his friends were angry at how they failed to do better in the country in 1794 than before getting rid of their king, so they began to criticize the government. The film begins as a printer that makes critical brochures about the government, is defeated and its business is destroyed. So much for "freedom, equality and brotherhood"! As a result of their silence, Danton et al began publicly criticizing the government. In the end, Robespierre (the leader of the committee) and his friends trump charges, have a trial and get rid of dissent. Some have mentioned that Polish director Wajda also intended it as a critique of his own nation, which at that time was also Soviet and very repressive. This makes sense when you see the film unfolding - especially when the government destroys all "in the name of people" disagreements. Acting is fine, the story is convincing and I have no criticism. film. However, I really wish that the end was processed differently. Especially since other than history lovers and French people, they most likely have no idea that this execution has helped end the government. After this cleansing of Danton in April 1794, Robespierre was executed in July 1794 because the country had just enough - plus, the French survivors knew that they would face the guillotine sooner or later if the sick system remained in place. An epilogue would be nice - for example, to show the soldiers coming to Robespierre. He responded by trying to kill first, but he only succeeded in blowing part of his face - still alive, he was guillotined shortly thereafter. That would be a small epilogue and could be done in about five minutes. However, not showing a connection between Danton's death and the fall of the government is a special thing to skip.
