I'm not sure how the IMDb "weighted average" came up with such a low rating of this movie. It is, in my opinion, the gem of the film overlooked by all the other accounts. Rip Torn is fantastic as the stubborn Noel Lord and Tantoo Cardinal superlative as his roommate. Torn and Cardinal are both underrated actors who finally get to work on their craft. <br /> <br /> Their relationship is not always pleasant, but it's really real. This is not a "humerous and touching love story" is charged as on a DVD jacket. In the end, it's a tragedy. The Lord simply goes too high and ignores all counsel to take the money offered by the energy company to move. <br /> <br /> Music is fantastic as well as the times.
