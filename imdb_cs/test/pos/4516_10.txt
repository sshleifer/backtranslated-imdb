I know that if we included everything in the book, the film would have to be a few hours long, so I think they were trying to include things that were key and key to the story. I thought the cast was great, the children who played Amir and Hassan were very good actors. And the one who played Amir as an adult was great! Especially moving was the scene between him and Baba. I thought the places they used were interesting ... scenes in Afghanistan were filmed in China and one scene in Fremont, CA (graduation) was filmed on Treasure Island in San Francisco. I worked one day as an extra on "Kite Runner" and that was the day they shot the graduation. In the morning we reported to Treasure Island, checked the wardrobe to make sure it looked like the late 1980s. They shot the scene again and again until they were satisfied with it. It was great to see the actors up close and also to see the author of the book, which was handy as a story consultant. I thought this book was excellent and I recommend both book and film to everyone. This is a moving story about friendship, love, guilt and possible redemption. "There's a way to be good again."
