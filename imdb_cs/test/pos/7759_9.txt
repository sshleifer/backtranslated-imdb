Good animation, nice character design and a hilarious story make Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu nice to watch. <br /> <br /> After my first tracking, I thought this anime was pretty good, but it was much better for a second watch. It's because it's done in chronological order, and once you look at it in the right order, you'll notice the connections you've never seen before. (OR it may be that you see a second meaning for some events you haven't noticed before) You might want to read the original novels (not manga) from Tanigawa Nagaru before / after seeing this. Anime is very good at visualizing every detail in the stories it shows. However, there are some short stories from the book that are not animated but are referred to by them (bamboo w / wishes attached shown in episode 14) Overall, this anime is really very good once after a brief parcel analysis (reading the book is also improving on it). It's a nice break from shounen-jump anime that seems to be taking over.
