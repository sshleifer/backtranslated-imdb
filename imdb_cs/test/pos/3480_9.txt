Who could think that an unclassified actor could act as realistically and immensely as a disabled person in a film? Probably someone. No one, indeed no one, but has never been able to compare his expectations with the amazingly emotional and powerful performance that both actors of the film gave. Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in a house for disabled people. He has a cerebral Paulsy, and as he has shown us at the beginning, he has tremendous communication problems. So it's really a lifeline when Rory (James McAvoy), who is able to speak normally, understands him. Thus begins a friendship that relies mainly on (ironically enough) communication. <br /> <br /> In a merry scene they manage to move from home to their own. After Rory was refused, the good-natured Michael made a request to move to his own home. Rory, who already had a bad name with "referees", was supposed to be his interpreter. But soon there will be problems. They start looking carefreely at the girl they met in the pub and wanted her to be their assistant to do the little things that mattered. Initially reluctant; they do not know these men, but they seem to be harmless; so he comes across another friendship, but not necessarily a good one ... <br /> <br /> Besides being annoying, this movie really relies on actors. But that's not a bad thing. For the unclassified actor, you see Rory, even though he can communicate properly, frustrated in the way he is completely dependent on other people, and has no life of his own. But the real star for me is Steven Robertson. He behaves with such emotions, a desire to fit in and sadness / happiness that truly sees him throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Great. <br /> <br /> Total: 5 out of 5
