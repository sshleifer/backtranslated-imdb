The assumption is rather original and well thought out, but unfortunately, a siding good story is a very low budget that doesn't even allow decent special effects. Jeff Fahey makes the best of the poor cast, as always beautiful Linda Hoffman does. They should do more movies together. The film, although not worth much praise, guarantees at least one view.
