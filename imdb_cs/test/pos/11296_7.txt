I just picked it up in a decent, if not excellent, DVD version for one dollar at Wal Mart. <br /> <br /> Start and buy. I'm pretty sure this version is a short, incomplete version released against the animator's wishes in the late 1950s, but it's still incredible. This film was published in small pieces as a series for local TV stations in the early 1960s for children to show that almost every station ran on weekdays these days - "Mr. Bill and Bozo", "Monty's Gang" (Channel 4, Greenville SC) and "Captain Grady" (Channel 13, Asheville NC - Where I Saw). He made such an impression on twelve or so old that I immediately recognized it when I saw him tonight at Wal Mart and grabbed him. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. You should get it.
