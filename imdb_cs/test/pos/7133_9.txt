I'm a newbie to play, but if I was around this movie, I'd start much earlier. Last year I caught him at Gen Con (a trip just like a favor to my husband) and LOVED it! Even for other players than I was at the time, it's funny and available - so much that I finally stepped back and started to sit in my husband's playgroup. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give away all the details, but if you're a player you have to see this movie - and if you're not, you'll have a great time on top of yourself. There are certainly "in" jokes, but the vast majority of the movie is accessible to everyone. <br /> <br /> My only complaints: I wish it was longer and I wish they were available on DVD. Soon I hope?
