Crossfire is one of those 1940s movies that cries on a remake if, for a reason other than time, it needs to be done as originally written. The story on which the film is based is about killing a gay man. But anti-Semitism was certainly a hot topic in the days after World War II with the fresh Holocaust in everyone's mind. In the Lee Server biography of Robert Mitchum, Edward Dmytryk, the interview was conducted and said the film could never be made about gay hate crimes when the code was firmly established. It could have been because the figure of Robert Ryan is such an equal chance of hating everything that deviates from his social norms. Mitchum was told in precarious terms that he was strictly on the move in the movie. Robert Young was cast as Washington, DC by the police killing captain, which seizes the case and while Mitchum was second charged, he knew from the beginning the movie would belong to Ryan. But he was the new star of RKO, thanks to his performances at The Story Of GI Joe and Till The End Of Time, so he was there for cashier insurance. Mitchum's part was like a sergeant and friend of the original suspect in the case, George Cooper. Crossfire is not a whodunit, even if we don't see the crime, it is clear that Montgomery is the one who kills Sam Levene, the quintessential Jewish seller. It is clear to Young and Mitchum that Ryan is the guilty party almost as quickly as the audience does. This only becomes a matter of obtaining evidence. Ryan earned one of several Academy Award nominations for the film, his best performance. Although he lost to Edmund Gwenn, the film was a breakthrough role for Ryan. Similarly, Gloria Grahame was nominated for a short part as a girl party for Best Supporting Actress, but lost to Celeste Holm for the Gentleman's Agreement. In fact, Crossfire opposed the Gentleman's agreement and lost to Best Shot and Best Director for Dmytryka Elia Kazan. It is already the fifth best screenplay nomination and Crossfire came again shortly with the winner, who is Miracle on 34th Street. Gloria Grahame also had her own problems on a scene that spilled out of her personal life. She had a big problem with her, then Stanley Clements's husband, who was a rude husband. He hung around the file, causing Ed Dmytryk a lot of trouble. Fortunately, Grahame's part was small. In fact, the whole film was shot in a typical RKO economic style in 20 days. Robert Young has a particularly fine scene with William Phipps, a young guy from Tennessee in Mitchum, and Ryan's outfit, which Ryan is constantly wasting. The young man is very eloquent in talking about the corrosive nature of hatred and how it has affected his family as Irish Catholics who came in potato famine. It was one of Robert Young's best moments on screen in his long career. Like Crossfire, it's time to be reworked as a story of hate crimes against homosexuals. Especially with the actual killing of Barry Winchell from the last decade and the debate on homosexuals in the military. It's a movie that came and almost disappeared.
