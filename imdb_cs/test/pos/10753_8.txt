This movie surprised me. For years, I have avoided many of Harold Lloyd's sounds (as well as Keaton's) because they have a well-deserved reputation for being miserable compared to silent films because the basic formula has been lost. However, when I saw this movie, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I really liked it ... once I accepted it, it wasn't the movie "Harold Lloyd" (although he was playing it). This is because although it is not the style of its earlier films, it is very original and Lloyd is not bad because it plays a totally different type of character. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, the old film formula is almost absent. Lloyd doesn't do the old-fashioned stunt work, romance is quite unlike his early novels, and the plot is just weird! Instead of his usual roles, he is the son of a Chinese missionary who returns to America for the first time because he was a little boy. Although he looks like an American (with the exception of his white suit and reconnaissance helmet), he thinks and behaves like someone who is Chinese. In many ways, he is very naive to America and is innocent among wolves. Soon after, he meets a man who turns out to be a local party boss. This boss ALWAYS produces a lost Mayor candidate - because he was bought and paid by a corrupt mayor to create a candidate token that has no chance of winning. Well, the old geezer, who has traditionally gone to the office, just died and he decides to run naive Lloyd - he has no prayer for victory! Well, unthinkable happens and Lloyd wins !!! This and Lloyd's decision to clean up the city greatly disrupts the old political machine and does not stop at nothing to destroy the honest Lloyd. Just as Lloyd seems to be heading to jail for a tremendous corruption charge, he will create a system that is 100% impossible and very illegal to get a signed confession from fraudsters. Despite this, it's an incredibly funny and great ending. So my advice is to end, just suspend infidelity and enjoy. Important Note: This movie is definitely NOT politically correct. The word "Chink" is used repeatedly. I found it offensive, but due to the times I ignored it just like you did. However, if you are someone you cannot and are angry with, I suggest that you never watch movies - because you will have to be offended again and again.
