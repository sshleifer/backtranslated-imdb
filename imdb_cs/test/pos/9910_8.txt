Hey, it's just a TV. Sure, it's STAR TREK, the most popular bla bla, and that's great, but it's all relative. What it boils down is a guy in elf ears grooving with a pizza-colored swag carpet swatch. There is a kind of THIRD MAN noirishness to hunt tunnels, and it's creepier than many episodes of what's after one of the best TV shows. The tension is tense. Threat is really dangerous. As a small child, I think I was screaming when Spock told me that this nasty creature was as sad, frightened and frightened as the people who ate. That was one of my first lessons in empathy, a lesson reinforced by the EMPATH episode, which was even more melancholic if it was less exciting. What troubled me when I was five was that the thing that looks like meat and tomato barf, somehow actually consists more or less rock. Such a choice could now seem like a visionary, the idea of ​​a hippie designer about one-universal glass, but it could just be the smell of the drug era.
