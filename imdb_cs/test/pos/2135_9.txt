Many of us who are dedicated to the "art" of the film will ignore or forget that films are also business activities. Most of the time, they're too expensive to produce anything else. In light of this, it is often a miracle for me that they really do really big. Once in a while, filmmakers will go so far beyond the budget when making a film that entrepreneurs responsible for financing a business will be heavily injured and will, of course, be very angry. I would like to know exactly how it happened that it often led to great studies and some major critics "shot" the image when it is finally released. Terrible expectations are generated and often what people expect to see clouds, their perception of what they are viewing. You can see this phenomenon when working in an imperfect but spectacular '62 re-make 0f 'Mutiny to Bounty', and you can definitely see it in response to "Heaven's Gate". Cimino took too long and the United Artists cost too much money to produce this image. The company was fatally wounded by its excesses, and no doubt they were powerful people outside to see its reputation destroyed forever, when this strange, mammoth epic was finally released. There are always many movie visitors who don't like long, serious pictures. The narrative in this film is not achieved with a big economy or a fast pace. Like Stanley Kubrick, Cimino has often decided not to mention the particular statement he makes with the scene. Instead, it draws it so that the viewer feels that he is living at the moment, providing time for his own imagination to be deeply involved in what is being presented. Many people do not respond favorably to this approach. They want the story to move quickly and clearly, and easily become impatient and confused by this film. These factors undoubtedly contributed to the failure of the "Gate of Heaven" boxing. Nature, a film editor, I'm deeply frustrated with two problems with this movie. Here and there the scene is clearly too long and could be easily trimmed without compromising its effectiveness. Then we get to the massive, drawn battle scenes at the end of the picture. Where applicable, the clarity of the narrative is actually impaired. If you enjoyed the movie to the point where it happens, it is likely that your understanding of what is going to happen will be unclear and that is really frustration. When I didn't see all the rough shots, I couldn't tell whether there would be a need for real re-shoots, or whether some of the critical elements of the fences could be made clearer by carefully adjusting some moments. Given the time and money that went into this image, more attention and thought should have been given to this problem. There are other problems, sometimes poor behavior, a dialogue that is not true. , but these are really minor concerns. The reason I am so concerned about the above issues is that, like so many of these days, I feel that it is so amazing in all the "heavenly gates" that I watch and so beautifully deal with the main historical, political and sociological Questions that are just short for a masterpiece. Despite his shortcomings, he is so dramatic and visually strong that he stands above his head and shoulders above most other Hollywood movies I've ever seen. I'd like to mix up a lot of sound again. I would like to re-direct and re-edit the scene where Ella is killed, but the size of this image is such that these considerations really become trivial compared to the value of total production. I should add that it should always be seen on a giant wide screen to achieve the famous effect that it can deliver.
