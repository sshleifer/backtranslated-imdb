I LOVE Dr WHo Tolik! I believe David Tennant is the best dr. The show he has ever had and Billie Piper is the best companion! I liked how dr. And Rose had such a connection and a great relationship, and the doctor came several times to express his love for the rose! Unfortunately, it ended after two seasons. I will miss watching the rose pile and I think the show will not be the same without Rose! But David is still there to make me laugh and like to watch me play this fantastic role! I rate this show 110% it's FANTASTIC! The graphics and monsters in this show are amazing and every story is different but somewhat connected and I really learned something about love, the world and relationships from this show. Therefore, it must be one of the most amazing performances of all time!
