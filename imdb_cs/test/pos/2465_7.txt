Actually, Emilio Estevez directed a good film - who would think? I sat in two previous films directed by director Estevez - "Wisdom" (then with girlfriend Demi Moore) and "Men at Work" (with brother Charlie Sheen). They are lousy movies - badly acted, director, stupid and offensive. Estevez is a good actor but miserable as a director. I turned it on in pure curiosity - it has a great cast and I had nothing to do. Damn, if he didn't pick me up. It concerns Esteveza, who returns home from Vietnam and is constantly scarred by what happened there. His parents (Kathy Bates, Martin Sheen) and sister (Kimberly Williams) are trying to get to him, but they can't. Something in Vietnam hit him deeply ... and he is about to explode ... <br /> <br /> A little elongated but still very good. A lot of material is familar, but the cast is so good it seems new. Estevez is good, Sheen is amazing (and Estevez's real father), Williams touches and Bates is just extraordinary - trying to keep the family together. All this leads to a powerful ending that really surprised me. <br /> <br /> Good to catch. <br /> <br />
