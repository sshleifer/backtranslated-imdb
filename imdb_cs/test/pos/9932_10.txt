Being a fan of Dario Argento and the phantom of Opera fans, I was dying to see his first idea of ​​the story before it was so bad that it was "the ghost of Daria Argent's opera". The film is simply amazing, even a storyline that is one of Argento's best arguments on a coherent story. The way he turns a classic romantic story into a creepy slasher is just amazing. The film has a very scary feeling that helps keep you on the edge of your seat. Colors have never been better in Argento since she managed to drop her jaw. The murders are clever and bloody, all done in Argento style. The thing with the eyes in this movie is just disturbing, and has done something much better than Fulci's splashes. Acting is so-so, but once you have seen the film multiple times, you understand the motivation of the characters better and get used to it. My two biggest complaints about this is the use of rock music. I think it was a clever idea to mix beautiful opera fragments with heavy metal, but it's not very good here. The end is very disappointing, which is the worst thing about the movie, it seems that echo Argento's previous "phenomena" but did terribly, it just didn't have to end up this way. The same happened in the director's cut "The Exorcist". I wished they kept the end. But it's still a fantastic movie and you really have to see it if it's just for the unforgettable Darie Nicolodi murder sequence.
