I am amazed that, of all the reviews I looked at, no one seemed to notice one of the highlights of this movie, or at least how I saw it. It looks like one big gay fantasy, camp outfit, the famous naked Ferdinand, the unambiguous sexual tension between Ariel and Prosper, and the final climax of a group of men in tight navy suits dancing breathtaking. This whole approach, once you get used to it, gives you all kinds of fantastic scenes and pictures. The sight of innocent Arila, who is attracted to the disgusting naked Sycorax to perform "her earthy and abhorr'd commands", is one of the darkest scenes in Shakespeare's film. However, until the end of the movie I was tired of the style and the last hornpipe dance was just too much to make. Overall, this is an interesting interpretation of the game.
