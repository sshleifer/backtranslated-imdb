The first music video I've ever seen, Thriller, Mom told me she took me home from the hospital and when we arrived, my sister had MTV on TV and Thriller played, Mom said I smiled. I know I'm stupid, but since I loved Michael Jackson, the music video Thriller inspired me to dance. I even did it for the audience three times! Words can't describe the power of this song that makes you sing and dance, but of course Michael had to pick up the MTV bar at the time by signing the American werewolf in London director John Landis and driving the one, Thriller. Michael and his date, Ola Ray, expire gas in a dark, wooded area. They leave for the forest and Michael asks her if she wants to go firm. She accepts and gives her a ring. But she warns her that she's not like other guys, not really, not like other guys. Will the full moon appear, and will Michael begin to cramp in agony? transform into a scary werewolf! His date screams and runs, but the werewolf catches, knocks her down and starts to claw her. The scene cuts into a movie theater where Michael and his date truly watch this scene in Thriller. Michael smiles, but his date is afraid and tells him he is leaving. Michael catches her and says it's just a movie, but she doesn't like her jokes and she starts to leave. Michael and his date then go down the foggy street and tease her with the opening verse of Thriller. They pass through a cemetery where the corpses suddenly come out of the graves when Vincent Price performs his rap. Michael and his date then find themselves surrounded by zombies and suddenly Michael becomes a zombie himself. Michael and the Undead perform together with a sophisticated song and dance number, followed by the Thriller Choir. Thriller is probably the best music video of all time, the funny thing is that people who want to argue that they are with other Michael Jackson videos, but what makes Thriller so special is dance, story, effects, it At that time, the most expensive music video was that day. Of course, Michael picked up the bar again with his famous music video Scream and then again with Ghosts. But tell me what you want, Michael was the star of the eighties, there was no celebrity like him, loved life, lived, breathed and embraced him. Thriller is proof that he was willing to work to make the best of it and that is what we got with the legend that is Thriller. <br /> <br /> 10/10
