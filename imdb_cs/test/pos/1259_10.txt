This is an absolutely amazing movie! If you haven't seen it before, you'd be damn good. Sure, the plot is slow to develop, special effects are ridiculous, acting is ridiculous and the action is poorly choreographic, but as DDP would say; That's not a bad thing ... that's a good thing! Everything about this movie is fun, especially when you get a dubbed version that has even worse actors. It's a myriad of laughs until you get to the end, longing for a sequel where the mummy fights women matches. So I give it ten stars. If you are not one of those "discriminating" and "smart" people with good taste, who like only "high quality" movies of the highest quality, I recommend this absolutely monkeydellic movie!
