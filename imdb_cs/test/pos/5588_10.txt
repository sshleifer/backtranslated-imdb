It may not be considered a review of any movie, but just a commentary on the movie I saw when I was a young man. I remember returning home from an evening of wonder at what I saw. I tried to reformulate part of my story with my parents, but without understanding they listened to what's on two kids stranded on an island who fall in love and grow together and have a son, so weird. As you have to guess now, I am thinking of the Blue Lagoon (1949), which kept me in a charming and confused time (almost 50 years) and now I am surprised that it is full of anxiety and disgust, who or what prevented the film from being available in a tape or DVD or anything else. I spent my whole life chasing the opportunity to do it once, and nobody knows anything about it. What kind of waste! I'm sorry if my English is neither technical nor scientific, but my mother tongue is Spanish. I'm trying to understand. Thank you, my name is Juan and I write from Uruguay in S.America.
