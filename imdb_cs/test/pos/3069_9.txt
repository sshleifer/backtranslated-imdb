This is probably one of my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I wasn't a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was a lot different! It made fun of Robin Hood and it was HILARIOUS! I was very pleased with how well it was together and how well it was! Except Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire and Houseguesta, it was the funniest move I've ever seen! I especially love the song; "We're men in stockings!" If you have a good sense of humor, you'll love this movie!
