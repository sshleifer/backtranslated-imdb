In the beginning, with meticulous, remote placement and sweeping metal sound, I was thinking of the opening scene in "Once upon a time in the West". When he gets to town, then he starts to feel like "Kitchen Stories" or "Drifting Clouds", even maybe "Grimm". Then it turns out it's more like "Joe Versus the Volcano" in the theme (not in style). And the film comes from the beginning to the end of the same, unobtrusive style. Watch yourself, take in the steel, blue-gray tone suite, dress, wall color, furniture, sheets, mirrors, cars, music, background sounds and even people's expressions. Then it comes to an end, there is one shot of a completely different tone - warm orange yellow with soft music and ocean splashing, kids and laughter. But observation is too long for me. I prefer to see an alternative side or what happens to a character after the shot. Still beautiful.
