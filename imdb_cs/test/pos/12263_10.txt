I say sadly that if you see this movie, you realize how low our media is - all the warning signs are in this movie. It's a great movie, I think the last great James Brooks movie, but others disagree. He has rich characters (who are also believable), great acting, great writing, and although the music is a bit cheesy, I liked it. William Hurt has never been better. Holly Hunter is overwhelming. And Albert Brooks is leaving with every scene he is in - this triangle of people is beautifully drawn and convincing, and the whole film has grown beyond its vital and important topic of News, and how it is slowly compromised in our nation. Watch it with NETWORK for a really fun and frightening evening.
