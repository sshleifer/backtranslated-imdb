Based on the manga (comic book) of famous artist Masamune Shirow, this animated scene was a slight disappointment for me. should be overwhelming. The movie is an adequate IMO, but it seems to be flat and uninspired if you know what I mean. A missed opportunity, if you think Shirow, "Ghost In The Shell", is considered to be a classic in many ways. It has set new standards for Japanese animation and, among other things, a great series called "GiTS: Stand Alone Complex". <br /> <br /> I consider it a rental if you are not a Shirow fan and want it all. Check out the original manga which is highly recommended.
