There is no way to compare this film to any other film, because nobody has ever done anything like that and no one will ever be. And it really should be seen in the theater to be fully appreciated. At least it deserves a great sound system. I saw this film on the day of its opening in 1968, my high school year. I went because I love science fiction and wanted to see a "space" movie. Remember, this movie was created before the first moon landing. There we sat and waited for it to begin. But, SURPRISE! There was no cartoon, no upcoming attractions. The Theater Owner at the Cooper Theater for some reason decided to play the "Star-Spangled Banner" with the lights still up so we all stood, never did it in the movie before or since then sat down again as it ended. The theater then disappeared, and the strange foreplay barely visible with the blank screen. The foreplay is over and my seat has begun to vibrate when the blue screen with the MGM lion appears along with the first depth. The bass tones, and then my senses were overwhelmed, to hear "Also Sprach Zarathustra" for the first time in my life. The ride has just begun. <br /> <br /> (I highly recommend that you look at this hole, this movie, in the DARK room with a subwoofer that appeared as high as possible to get what I felt in this theater .) Of course, it took a long time to get into space and the movie that followed was just a science fiction movie. INTERMISSION came (a good thing, highly undervalued and unused these days) and we all looked at each other in amazement, caught our breath, and then the ride returned, wilder than before. I saw next year it was still 7 times, always in real theater, just like all theaters in front of multiplexes. Maybe I was "tall" once, but I didn't go over and over again because I "tripped". I went because I knew I saw a work of art. It was SO DAMN BEAUTIFUL; a sound that you could feel in your bones followed by a frightening silence; monuments unimaginable and unimaginable; affection for the HAL turned to horror. And of course, WTF Kubrick was really trying to get to me? Years and years and many other insights later, I understand it just as well, I think I ever wanted. Read someone else's comments if you are looking for someone to explain or look for you on the web, you will find an "explanation" here, this is not my goal of writing these comments. <br /> <br /> What I hope is encouraging you to look at it patiently, enjoy the beauty you would like to watch at sunset while listening to the most beautiful music you know (eg Gayne Ballet Suite or Blue) Danube); enjoy it as if you enjoyed great food, drinking it like fine wine; Look and listen to the tracks and hidden symbols that are there. And then draw your own conclusions. Stanley Kubrick wanted you to share some of the things he considered beautiful with you, and he wanted you to think about where you were. man came and where you went from. If it's too much work for your brain, and you can't see and hear and think about the beauty and mystery of Kubrick's film, then excuse my dullness, but your life is just as meaningful as the tapir or monolith monkey life . If you want a thoughtless escape, it's not for you. But if you like sunsets, thunderstorms, harmony in music, mystery and sensuality and you can have an open mind, this film will give you something. life.
