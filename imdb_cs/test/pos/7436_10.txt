It's not really hard to understand this movie! I watched it without expectations and no knowledge of the game story. I was totally blown away! Initially, I wondered how most characters have some super-power, but is called "Final FANTASY ...". I was also thinking about Cloud's past, but it was easy enough to look up. In any case, these questions did not spoil the enjoyment of the film. Exactly opposite; shows that I've been thinking about this story long after I saw the movie. It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Music supports the film entirely. The characters are incredible. <br /> <br /> I want more!
