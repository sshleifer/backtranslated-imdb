I was disappointed with the recent (2000) American remake of this English mini series. Although it was very close to the plot line, it seemed to leave the heart and soul of the original. Not to mention the shallow preaching of heavily controlled "news" ... So my advice is to skip a modern remake and stick to the original. It's much longer, but breathtaking and perfectly done. Interesting, complex and textured, without preaching self-justice ... and it's beautifully shot, as well. I find it uncomfortable that these heartless overseas films have so many Hollywood fanfares for Oscars. (Although I liked Benicio Del Torro to deserve praise ...)
