I got it and it's a great movie !! I loved it! Although Jane Brightons' voice at the beginning is so uncomfortable, because her braces didn't open her terrifying mouth ... but you have to watch it cause his great movie !! The stuff that says here are so funny and very cute! and I'm sure Aaron would probably say that some things in real life cause me to know that it looks so! ha ha there is a part in the movie that's really funny ... its wen jane's little sister meets him ... but i cant say what will happen because the sick just u u u see for her own !! I went to Aaron n concert and it was so fun !! n smelled so well ha ha ... i still can't believe i have to meet him !!! I have photos if someone wants to see them! Steph
