I think it was a trip in 1987 when we had our exams and my friend and I saw in the newspaper that one of the theaters was playing 'teen deviyan'. We decided to just go for the hell without hope of something big. But we were in a pleasant surprise. The film was made in 1965, but according to today's standards, the land was completely modern and ahead of us. The music was amazing and Dev Anand as a city that boasted, looked and behaved best. I still remember the excited feeling when we left the theater after the movie. Who remembered this story of one man falling into three different girls at once? No he is three timing or crazy, but he really likes all three for different reasons. One is homely, one is an actress and the third is a "high society" that can also help Devo in his career as a poet. The question is which one is for him. What makes matters worse is that all three of them love it too. When things reach a dead end, the hypnotist takes him to and dreams of his future with each of them in his hypnotized state and reaches the right decision. <br /> <br /> This dream, which is the only color part in an otherwise black and white film, is at the heart of the film, but surprisingly it is released from most of the versions available today. If you want to watch this movie, make sure that this section is intact. If you watch this movie without this part and get confused, don't worry because you just watched the unfinished movie.
