As a Czech I am very pleased to read these comments here. I'm absolutely sure this movie is great. And maybe you don't know that the story was written specifically for Mr. Brodsky. The person you see is his and his typical attitude - living and defying death. He was one of the greatest actors and we are lucky to have made so many beautiful movies during his life. You're lucky to have seen at least one of them. Enjoy.
