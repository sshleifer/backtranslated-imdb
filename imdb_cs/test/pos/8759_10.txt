I can only agree with many observers that Traffik is one of the most memorable dramas ever made for television. I saw Traffik when it was on TV, and I watched it again. I was especially interested in the haunting original music of Tim Souster, especially live tribes of the chamber symphony of Dmitri Shostakovich in C minor (music over credits and parts of the film). The music intensifies the despair of the characters watching their sad fate. Music is powerfully emotional. This arrangement combines two movements from the symphony, but I recommend listening to the symphony as such.
