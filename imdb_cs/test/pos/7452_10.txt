I don't have much to say, it's a great end to the story. Most people said there wasn't enough plot and its mere eye candy. But to think about everything explained in FFVII you can't add another plot to such a big story that it would ruin it. They did the best they could do, and I think it should be considered the final. <br /> <br /> Graphics - 10/10, Absolutely Amazing <br /> <br /> Story 8.5 / 10 - Don't think they can expand much more. And the things they put there were smart enough to think. <br /> <br /> Characters 9/10 - But most of them have already been explained during the game, but she still hasn't been able to walk in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Sound - 10/10 because I'm a metal fan I loved combat music .. and the piano just hits right there .. It's a big ST and I wasn't disappointed. > <br /> Replay 10/10 - Always Nice. <br /> <br /> Overall - 9/10 (FF Fan View 10/10) <br /> <br /> I personally think this is what was needed, the struggle to end it. On the place. The action was necessary just as people complained. I loved every second of this movie. It was a pleasure to visit the world of FFVII for the last time. Just remember that most of the movies that have been created by the director are directed by the film's directors. a team of game directors .. Don't think I saw a better movie game .. <br /> <br /> Thank you Square, I think you did it right!
