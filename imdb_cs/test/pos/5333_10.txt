Following the huge success of Nick Park and the Aardman team with the short animations Wallace and Gromit now we have the first (hopefully many of them) with plastic characters that so much love. The DVD movie proved to be the toughest and best of many of my two kids' Christmas gifts. The storyline is straightforward enough, but the beauty of the W&G movies is the background of the gags for me. There are plenty of leading gags and grotesques for kids and adults who love it, but the background is murderer for me. All in an elegant addition to the already classy filmography for Nick Parke et al, and I would recommend fans and new viewers to see this movie .... often.
