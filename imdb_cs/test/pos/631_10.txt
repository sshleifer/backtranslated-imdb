One of my favorite movies. Nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time. If I could go back in time and erase my memory or suffer from a momentary amnesia, I could enjoy this movie just like I did. It's still nice, second and third times, but I found myself more humorous because shocks and excitement were not unexpected. If you want to see a movie that you really won't be able to predict the end then I highly recommend this movie. Its frosty, shocking, full of tension and there's a lot of humor to help you. If you watch this movie and don't love it, I really doubt your common sense!
