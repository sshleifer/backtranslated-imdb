Two years after 'Airplane!' they took off, Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker cast one of their stars - Leslie Nielsen - in this cheerful TV series, the famous takeoff of old American detective shows like 'Dragnet'. Nielsen played Frank Drebin, an American response to "Inspector Clouseau". She had the same style of humor as "Airplane!"; clever visual gags in the background, unnoticed by absurdity, and repetitive characters such as Johnny, a boy who seems to know everything about everything. â€”Guest stars (including William Shatner!) Were killed in opening credits. The "police unit" was the first American sitcom, because "Batman" lacked laughter. Many of them lamented that only six episodes were made, but I think it was probably right. The concept could never hold the entire 24-episode run. Five years later, 'Police Squad' made a successful big screen conversion when the first of the "Naked Gun" trilogy was released. Jim, Jerry, David and Leslie had the last laugh.
