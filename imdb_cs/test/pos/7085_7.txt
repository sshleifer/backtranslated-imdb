"One True Thing" puts Zellweger in the midst of a family crisis as an adult journalist returning home to take care of his dying mother (Streep). The film studies an adult child who copes with an adult's view of parents as she slowly reveals that she is less than the ideal she grew up to know as a child. Excellent study of character and production search with little mistake, "OTT" offers three fine performances of trio of top actors and some plastic reflections on life and death.
