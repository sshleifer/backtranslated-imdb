... but I laughed. Much. <br /> <br /> I saw 'Astérix et les Vikings' at a public screening during the World Cup. The sound was lousy, it was too bright to see the screen properly - but I was still enjoying it immensely. The names of some of the characters rolled on the floor: Smsix, Abba, Vike ... Not very funny, but in the good tradition of Astérix. Some very good jokes, but also some that didn't all seem to get. The only thing I didn't like was the voices of Astérix and Obélix, at least in the German version. Voice actors are well known here, which was the only reason they were really trapped. He is not a character at all. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good way to spend some time (and if it's free, just like in my case, the better) and have a few laughs. 8 out of 10.
