Some people are born with mourning souls, and their song sings individually when they meet another soul who is tortured and / or bitterly beautiful as their own and unusual charm. ARE ONE is a brutally honest look at the two martyred souls that blend together for a moment of understanding and unity, only to break the differences in unity between the pains. Death is explored metaphorically and literally. It is what happens when the soul is dead or similarly alive, too awake to reality. It's the life of NO you imagine behind the eyes of passers-by. This film explores painful pain in all of us, frowning under the cheerful facade, the pain beneath it. Ugly instinctive animal ideas and deeds become honest and real things, and then Bechard sprinkles a mixture of unexpected innocence and beauty into the mix, knowing that we all remain in us. Bechard, a writer, is an expert observer of the human condition, and whereas his attitude is, without judgment, a life in the light that often protects our eyes from, but longs to see and understand. As a director, he focuses on the nuances of the actor's spirit, which shines through the character they play, the actors' personal familiarity with the emotions generated by each situation. This is the most precisely written and controlled rendering of the male and female figures I have encountered so far, although the encounter of two characters is probably not a "normal" encounter. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack encapsulates the lyrics in each song, leaving the characters spilled as far as possible and strong enough. The true voice of each character sung by the beauty, pain, talent and emotional intelligence of emerging independent artists ready to explode in the alternative music market. The perfect soundtrack for those of us with problems - those of us who admit we have problems and those of us who are hiding it. <br /> <br /> I'm always fond of exploring the darker side of life with Mr. Bechard's fascinating both creative and realistic look at life and the characters that spins in it.
