The film doesn't come that often. I was surprised that it took 9 years to see it. Politicians and civilian hawks should see this before they decide how people are destroyed, I watched the day after I watched the television version of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Even with this fresh mind, I felt compassion for the German soldier. I felt compassion for all parties that this tragedy could happen. It will take a while for it to thaw. I'm surprised they didn't make a movie based on "The Forgotten Solder" that Sajer bought. This film shares a cold book. They'll both scare me for the rest of my life.
