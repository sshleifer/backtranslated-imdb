This film is remarkable in how remarkable it is. This is the real story of one woman and one man and their search for happiness in the dull home life and "house man". It could be a couple, any family, in every town ... but that's what makes the story so moving. It somehow touches each of us and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. I laughed, shouted, I couldn't stop thinking about it ... and what more could you want from a movie, really? Especially the document. It is an excellent film and one that I highly recommend to all who like documentary films, stories about families like yours, stories about love, life, parenting, loss, expectations, soul searching, desire, wandering through life and finding ways or not.
