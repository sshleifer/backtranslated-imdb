This film was the second film I saw in the cinema as a child. I was frightened of life. So much that I asked my father if we could leave in half. Nowadays, the only ones leaving halfway are those who have a good taste in the film. But I still remember this erroneous masterpiece of horror. Doug McClure and Peter Cushing in the same movie! Great! Monsters made of polypropylene substitutes. Scary things. The rubber monster is even more frightening than the real monster when you think about it. <br /> <br /> The surprising thing about this movie is how good the score is. Really exciting things. There is also a lot of prehistoric titles on the show.
