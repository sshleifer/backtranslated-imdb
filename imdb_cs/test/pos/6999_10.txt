"Pitch Black" was a shock to me when I first saw it in 2000. In previous years, I was repeatedly disappointed by all the lame sci-fi movies (Ex: STARSHIP TROOPERS) and I thought this movie wouldn't be different. But to make it clear: This film scared me ... in a good way. I wasn't aware that I was still afraid of the darkness until I saw this film; I had to bury my fear in the back of my subconscious when I was a kid, and rightly deserve to stay there. Alien creatures sent frost over the spine; the individuals who designed them have a twisted but brilliant and creative imagination to come up with something so impressive and grotesque. I loved how writers gave every major character history and showed their flaws and strengths without much confusion. Riddick's (Vin Diesel) gift to escape from any impossible situation and throw a jaw into hell. At first, you consider him a cold intelligent villain, but in some brief moments you can see something humane behind his animal side. But once you find out, he'll do something insidious. I'm sure he's guessing you to the very end. I did not know whether to despise or admire him ... it is certainly love / hateful character. Johns (Cole Hauser) was a perfect example of a character who builds a good front, but because of the need for greed he shows his true intentions and what he is willing to survive. John's talent to know what buttons to push and the right words to say makes him as sinister as Riddick. Fry (Radha Mitchell) is a character who, Johns said so nicely, looked at his own ass before considering the consequences. But what she likes is that she quickly realizes the mistakes of her travels and desperately tries to repent, even if she threatens her life when others destroy all human values ​​and go to the dark hills. Jack (Rhiana Griffith) just wanted to be a hero and was the first of the band to look for the hero in Riddick; through the child's eye it is good to see thick clouds of evil. I thought it was invaluable when Jack shaved his head on Riddick; You know what they say: Imitation is the best form of flattery. Imam (Keith David), like Jack, has the ability to see good in every evil. He uses philosophy to carry him through the suffering he encounters, and when time permits, rationally mourns his losses and then soldiers. In a way, he served as a surviving morale for the survivors, though most of the characters behaved as if they weren't listening. The cast of this film was positively perfect. Each actor shone brightly in his role and their talents blended greatly on the screen. This film may have a small budget, but the director's leadership and movie performances have done the job and have allowed the audience to use their imagination instead of letting some outrageous expensive special effects do all the work for them. This movie is the ultimate Sci-Fi classic. Watch it and judge (with open mind) for yourself. It will be well worth it.
