Some people don't like Led Zeppelin, but fortunately the number of people who are against the number of people who don't have WAY unbalanced. I'm a proud converter of 2 or 3 Led Zeppelin fans and the only reason I could do this is thanks to this DVD. First, how can anyone listen to "Stairway to Heaven" or "Immigration Song" without falling in love with Zeppelin, is behind me, but playing guitar and not as Page ... That's as a Christian and not like Jesus. My friend was like "Led Zeppelin sucks!" and I was like, "Oh yeah, watch out!" After about two minutes of watching the site, he chose the "White Summer / Black Mountain Side", which was stuck on the screen and never said the wrong thing about Zeppelin. <br /> <br /> In case you haven't watched the running metaphor I'm calling this DVD Bible Bible Zeppelin. Held high by followers and used as a converter for unwashed pagans. The course there are some things missing like "over the hills and far away," a good version of "Immigrant Song" and I really didn't need 2 versions of "Whole Lotta Love", but what the hell I take is em. Because besides "The Song Remains the Same" there is nothing else than to compare I gave him 10 and even if it was more than I would compare, I would still give him 10.
