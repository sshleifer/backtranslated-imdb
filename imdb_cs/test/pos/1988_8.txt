Director David Cronenberg, after his earlier film "Videodrome", which is certainly pointing to the similarity to this film, releases into the world of virtual reality, in which truth and fiction mix. It is a virtual reality that is converted to another level. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is a very original film that is well directed and performed, but especially well written. The film is fascinated by a well-thought-out concept that director David Cronenberg performs very well. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is a movie that will always fool you. Another thought is waiting around the corner when you thought you'd figured it out. Things are never the way you think they are, especially when the line between truth and fiction is explored. You just never know what reality is and what the game world is like until the end. This makes the characters and events all very unpredictable and also provides a big ending movie that lets you think even more. The film has the perfect kind of game-telling stories, mostly with its character appearances and mysterious events. They must first complete a certain step or task before they can continue the world and find out what their purpose is in the game. The film knows how to create the perfect balance between realism and surrealism without going over-top with one of them. Storytelling keeps the movie as simple as possible, although of course it's not always so easy to watch because of its events, dialogues and unusual environments. The movie is not just weird. I was actually surprised to find that "Videodrom" had a higher rating, thought it was a much more inaccessible and "strange" movie. The movie is also still fun and has a fast pace. It never allows the film to get stuck in its more philosophical moments and deeper meanings. It also makes this film perfectly traceable to people who do not normally follow this kind of movies. <br /> <br /> The movie is good looking, with subtle effective special effects a great visual look that also provides the movie with a certain desired "gaming" feel. The film is well cast, with Jude right in a role you don't see too often, like a shy, insecure person. This shows once more how a universal law as an actor is and that it is much more than just another pretty Hollywood face. Jennifer Jason Leigh was also a great female lead. She has never played much in big productions, but she shows with this film why she has always been considered a great movie star. The film also includes some other well-known actors, in much smaller roles such as Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe. <br /> <br /> A highly original movie that's worth watching, especially if you've seen "Videodrome" before. <br /> <br /> 8/10
