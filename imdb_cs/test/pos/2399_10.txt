Fred Carpenter screened Eddie Monroe at Boston College and has a keen response. Taught, well done by Indians, impressive for this great budget look and feel. This movie has it all: a tight script that catches you and won't let you go to the end. This viewer didn't see it! Excellent performances all around. Craig Morris and Jessica Tsunis were particularly well placed in the lead, which resulted in strong performances. And the way Frank Bongiorn and Alex Corrad for creating two detectives as engaging and interesting films. I enjoyed this movie. This has confirmed my belief that some of the best work in the film will come from the independent, and Fred Carpenter seems to be one of the best.
