Throwing Momma didn't fit at all, it's as fun as when she was released. A truly eccentric comedy that doesn't try too hard to enjoy it and is all the more full of unforgettable laughter loud lines. Even small characters are well written and beautifully played, as well as friend of best friend Billy Crystal and a beautiful portrait of Rob Reiner as Crystal Agent. A little crazy and a lot of funny.
