To answer the question of the previous reviewer who asked the name of an American official named "Lumumba", the character's name is "Mr. Carlucci." Frank Carlucci is reportedly the second secretary at the US Embassy in Congo. Subsequently, he was appointed US Ambassador to Portugal, Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Secretary of Defense, and is now Chairman of the Carlyle Group. No wonder Carlucci's biographical sketch on his website, www.carlylegroup.com, cannot appreciate his service in Congo, Belgium. If his name was intentionally censored from the HBO version of "Lumumba" it could have been to avoid the possibility of HBO being sued in US courts. However, Carlucci's name is clearly stated in the theatrical version of "Lumumba", which I recently saw. In this case, I expect him to deny any involvement in Lumumba's murder. Others commented on the equality with which Lumumba treats stakeholders: Lumumba supporters, other Congolese, even Belgians. From a BBC document entitled "Who Killed Lumumba?", Based on the book "Murder of Lumumba" by Belgian historian Ludo de Witte, it seems to be a somewhat more ominous look. In detail, these films show that the fate of Lumumba and the history of Congo is not just a matter of black and white. Only the murderers of Lumumba believe it.
