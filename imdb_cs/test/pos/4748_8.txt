I recently got a SEVEN-UPS video and I have to say it was a very nice movie. Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco are great as a cop and cheater, and young Richard Lynch is great as a psycho henman moon. Late Bill Hickman is pretty good as his companion Bo and is preparing a great car chase sequence that will keep you on the edge of his seats. The other three members of the Seven-Ups team are pretty bland, but that's to be expected. <br /> <br /> I'm glad many people on this site support this movie. I think it should be a movie that should be released on DVD and not forgotten. I'm sure I enjoyed it every minute. The last scene between the two leaders is excellent because a bad person has to face the consequences of his actions. SEVEN-UPS will not disappoint.
