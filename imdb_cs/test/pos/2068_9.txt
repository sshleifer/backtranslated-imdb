Amazing, amazing, amazing. What more can we say? Jacobi is the best Hamlet who ever tunes the stage and captures every inch of the character. Every nuance and element of Hamlet is shown and displayed well. Some people have complained about his age, but honestly you can't tell when you're watching a movie. If anything, it looks drastically younger than 40 years. I just wish that more worthy Ophelia was found. Her performances are clear, but the part just doesn't look like. The only real exceptional performance comes from Jacobi and Stewart, who is a great Claudius. The rest of the cast is good, but Jacobi is what really increases this teleplay.
