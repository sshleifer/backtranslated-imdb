An interesting film based on three novels by Jules Verne. Due to special effects and today's computer animation, this film is a historical indicator of film ingenuity and imagination. Karel Zeman introduced the lithographic images of Jules Verne's original texts. This is to be seen for classic science fiction and history buffs. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 9 out of 10. Enjoy !!
