As an experienced fan of Italian thrillers and directors Dario Argento, Mario Bava, Sergio Martino and Aldo Lado, I thought of Lucio Fulci as an overrated hack. I saw that The Beyond, which I think is overestimated, I found that The New York Ripper was just scary and I didn't like the House at the Cemetery. These three films led me to the conclusion that Fulci is the least interesting of these Italian filmmakers. But my stubbornness prevailed and I had to look at more of his films. The City of the Living Dead was a movie that I found very interesting, but don't torture a duckling is almost a masterpiece. they are murdered. The authorities are clueless about who is behind these crimes, especially after their main suspect has been released. An eager young reporter, along with a fairly slender girl (who seduces young boys), investigates and eventually gets to the end. Brilliant atmosphere combined with good story and good cast with 70 Italian thrillers) to Torture Duckling and crackling good thriller. The land is well designed, not easily detectable and the conclusion is very satisfying. Fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere of repression and guilt in a very relentless and unconscious community and creates a few very powerful visuals, especially in a scene where a local townsperson is defeated. Fulci's social commentary on religion and innocence is quite nervous and every aspect is well worked out. When thinking about his zombie flicks and his ultra violent giallo New York Ripper is amazing how well he balances his criticism with explicit violence and makes an even stronger point. So far I have seen no Fulci film made as professional as this one. Although not a traditional giallo movie, Duckling has many genre trademarks. Fulci displays complete control over the format, just once overboard with unconvincing gore-moment, but overall it seems to be even better at creating mysteries than full episodes. Extreme scenes are much stronger here and they really pack a blow. So far, I have failed to torture the Fulci Duckling with the best film. Edgy social commentary coupled with explicit scenes of violence and crackling good secret to the shoe.
