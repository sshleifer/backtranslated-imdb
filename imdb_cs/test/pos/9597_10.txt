This is a true gem of the television movie. Based on a totally false story, it follows the course of the downward and football football club, which takes place in the English FA Cup, followed by mayhem and players of all seventies sports. The end is unexpected, the performances are great and Nick Hancock shows that he can do something other than hosting sports programs. My only regret is that I didn't suppress it.
