Normally I'm not out of the way to watch a romantic comedy, and maybe I'll be back in the future. The story was simple and no secret after publication. You don't have to be Einstein to guess what happens after the first 15 minutes. What you can do is relax and let you cast into the world where "chemistry" abounds and good guys win and you can just laugh and have fun. I love this movie .... and DVD to order!
