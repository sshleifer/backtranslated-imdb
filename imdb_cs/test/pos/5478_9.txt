This is a Hollywood movie. The entrants' credentials are not revolutionary. This movie won't change the world. However, it is well done, well rendered and well functioning, which counts for a lot. It's the story of cats and mice about a dissatisfied former CIA murderer who feels betrayed by the persecution of a secret service agent who protected John F. Kennedy when Kennedy was killed in Dallas. Of course, the agent was concerned about this failure in the coming years of his career and when the film was picked up in 1992 - or certainly in contemporary America, this business murderer Mitch Leary (John Malkovich in the tour-de-force of the fearsome) in which he gives transformation performance was consumed with frustration and anger and deciding that he will assassinate the President. He imagines he has a thing to do with the secret service agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood in his cool, calm, good-natured grouchy best), which he thinks he should have resented because it is the Warren Commission, accusing Horrigan-unfairly, Leary believes for the assassination of President Kennedy. Tension is rattled over some phone calls from Leary to Horrigan-Leary wanting to keep Horrigan close but not betray his locations and plans. Rene Russo is outstanding as Lily Raines's fellow agent with whom Horrigan is developing an adult relationship. It's nice to see the relationship between two equally competent peers (though Russo is younger than Eastwood at the time of filming). Russo is a calm, capable agent who is able to go to the top with Horrigan's quick joke in a friendly joke. It's a nice part for Russo, which allows her to play the role of a capable professional and not just the older romantic interest of an older man. Theatrical performances, competent management of Wolfgang Peterson, thoughtful use of music in the development of conspiracy and excellent cinematography make it a film that I can watch again and again.
