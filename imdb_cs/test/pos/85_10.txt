It was an excellent movie. I deal with a child that I have, which has an FAE, and the observation of this film was more than a word that can explain. I also bought the book and it was great. I would like to have a copy for my own use, so I can have my son's teacher also observe. . Thank you, Myra I recommend this film to anyone who deals with children / adults with special abilities. This movie should be redisplayed on TV. A team of doctors who watched their son would also like to have a copy. His special teacher also asked me to try to find a copy she could have or borrow. <br /> <br /> Thank you
