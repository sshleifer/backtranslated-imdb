Sequins are a whimsical lot with most nowhere near the original figure. Sometimes you find a sequel that is considered better than the original, some critics (such as John Charles) said the A2 project is better than the original, somewhat disagree, but this film is still a valuable continuation and fits well with the performance of the brilliant Hong Kong action film in 80 years and Jackie's own creation. I wonder how with such a wonderful release of great movies that his later movies were not so good. He directed only two films in the 1990s, but he has had many influences in many films where he is not officially a director. In 1987 Jackie had a brain surgery after surgery. a catastrophic fall in the shooting of Armor of God. This encouraged him to work on his next film close to home. It didn't offer him to stop risking his life and his stunt team for our fun. What resulted in a home strike that obscured the original box ($ 31 million dollars compared to $ 19 million for the original). Jackie Chan is again extraordinaire police officer Dragon Ma and he is ordered to work with "Three Wan" superintendent Chun (Lam Wai, Royal Warriors), who is the only Chinese police officer to be allowed to have a gun even though he is considered a staging arrest to look better and ignore the trio's crimes. the name of Tiger Au (Michael Chan Wai-Man, Dragon Lord). Chun seems to have too much power to be shot down directly, but is freed from Sai Wan County (now "Two Wan"), which Dragon Ma will take over. This inefficient and corrupt office soon gets a man and there's a great scene where three officers who don't know who they're dealing with are trying to attack Ma to teach him how to complain to the police. Soon the district ship is in and Tiger Au will take care of him. Battle choreography and stunts with Tiger and his men are pretty amazing. My favorite piece was a beautifully brutal fall from the second floor to a large vase, and the vase doesn't seem soft. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, a few sub-tasks are taking place. There are pirates who survived from the first film who seek revenge and food. Then there are revolutionaries including Maggie (Maggie Cheung, In The Mood For Love) and (Rosamund Kwan, Casino Raiders) trying to get funds for Dr. Sun Yat-sen to topple the Qing government and government officials trying to find these rebels. Throw a mixture of spoiled Hong Kong and British policemen, as well as legitimate, and you have stew that is a bit too much ingredients, but still seems to be united. This works well when the Marx Brothers scene is affected (Marx Brothers made this type of scene several times with The Cocoanuts (1929) first) at Maggie's place where everyone is looking for someone to hide from someone else. For many weeks, the scene itself was spent on the scene, and the effort certainly shows. <br /> <br /> There are several bugs with the movie. Is there a certain didactic nature that crawls in a movie that seems a little out of place? in particular, one small speech towards the end that Jackie gives to land revolutionary revolutionaries and the extremely easy conversion of pirates who survived from the first film. Again, female characters are underused and underestimated, especially Maggie Cheung. I was not so satisfied with the continuation of the plot as with the first film. Individual scenes dominate my sense of film instead of thinking about this film as a coherent whole. I don't question the film for not having Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao first (I heard the main reason why it was that these two were shooting Eastern Condors, but I wonder if Jackie could wait a little while they were doing them in this They would work together the last time in the following year in Dragons forever), but they are dropped. <br /> <br /> I found it to be a nice and well-done film and is rightly considered one of the better comedy action films of the 1980s. This movie is also quite good in a few unexpected places. The artistic direction is excellent (Eddie Ma Poon-chiu), the costumes are excellent, cinematography is good and the film looks absolutely authentic. But stunts, comedies and actions are what I remember about the movie. There is a chase involving a handcuffed Dragon and Chun that is excellent (a part of the throw throw would be used in Shanghai Noon). The last twenty minutes is full of venerable horrors, falls, chilli as a fly (Jackie writes in his autobiography about how he used real peppers in this scene, you can see him in many mouth pains at the end) and it's a worthy conclusion to this movie . The most famous piece from this sequence is his homage to Buster Keaton from Steamboat Bill Jr.. (1928) except that there is no hole and only a weak section where his head emerges. Jackie and / or Hong Kong action cinema should consider what they must own and watch. Definitely yes.
