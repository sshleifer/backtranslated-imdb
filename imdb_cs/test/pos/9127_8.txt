LE CERCLE ROUGE is a very good movie, although it suffers a bit because there have been similar movies already. Too many ways resemble previous robbery movies like RIFIFI and GRAND SLAM and many others. So, while director Melville and the actors did a great job, it seems like a Déjà vu case. For this reason, I had a hard time giving this excellent movie a higher score. One of the unusual aspects of the movie is how the scammers come together. Instead of the usual means, Vogel escapes from prison and just meets Corey, a career criminal just released from prison! They are both a good match, but they both work in parallel on most of the movie until they meet. In addition, as much of the film was expected, it relates to in-depth details in crime planning and execution. I also appreciated how the film showed cheaters in such a cool and secluded way - something that is quite common in French crime films, but rare among American movies until recent years. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's very well done and appreciated to see ... if you don't mind it seems to be repeating, you'll see some gentle gaming, direction and great tension.
