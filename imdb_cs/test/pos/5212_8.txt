This is a movie I come back to for various reasons. As a testimony to the suffering of an ordinary soldier on the Eastern Front in World War II, it is powerful. There are a number of very powerful scenes in the film that help capture the horror of war, such as a tank battle. In addition, from what I see, the experiences documented in the film are "true" - if you read A. Beevor's book "Stalingrad", you will know what I mean. The film is also successful in that it does not allow character or conspiracy to dominate it - it is simply a survival story that tries to depict the battle mainly from the perspective of an ordinary (German) soldier. I read somewhere that the original scenario had to be relaxed, which didn't surprise me at all - if they tried to show what a battle was, it would be almost impossible to be sure. However, there are still some moments that are difficult to follow - this was done before the private Ryan, but maybe it is even more difficult to hit places. Just one word of caution - don't buy a dubbed 'English' version, it's pretty horrible and spoils the movie - try getting a copy in the original (German) version with English subtitles, it's much stronger. In this case, you may have to buy a DVD Region 1 movie just like me.
