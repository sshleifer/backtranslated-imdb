Let's see, we rated this 10 at fun. It's a comedy, not an epic like Lord of the Rings, or with the wind. Still for comedy, especially these days, it's 10. <br /> <br /> It's not a long movie, moving fast and easy. At home, Kelsey Grammar is a loose but brilliant diesel captain, opposed to the US nuclear navy in a war game, designed to see if terrorists could get our nuclear bomb through our defense. (a little irony of this conspiracy ... for 911) Don't take this topic seriously because it's usually laughter from start to finish. Rob Schneider is the second commander (such as "Frank Burns") and has a lot of laughter. All others are ideal for their parts. Rip Torn and Bruce Dern. Look simple and simple, you have 90 minutes and you need to laugh or pick me up and you're not (their language is a language and a hint), then rent it or buy it (us) and enjoy get it! I wish they did part 2!
