Many of us who have gone through high school seem to have done it without having to attend a physics course - I know I am not. But after watching this program, I certainly wish I had it. This document is a guide to the "Holy Grail of Physics" - an effort to unite all the basic forces of the universe into one "master equation." Einstein has escaped in the last years of his life. Brian Green, a professor at Columbia University, introduces us to this theory of mind blowing in this amazingly simple way, leaving us with even greater recognition of the universe we live in. We start with the irritating possibility of a "Master Equation" that could unite and explain everything ... * everything in this universe, including the four basic forces we know exist: electromagnetism, a strong nuclear force, weak nuclear power and gravity. Green takes us to see how our understanding of the universe came with Newton's work, then Einstein, and then with the quantum-level revolution of physics. "<br /> <br /> is at this point that we come across a problem that has been troubling physics for years, and one that no one has ever solved. How can we unite all these forces that we know together? We have found out how Green constantly points to the problem - that the answer to this confused problem may be in string theory. However, if we are to describe the universe in terms of string theory, we have to pay a very great price. It turns out that the mind-numbing mathematical equations of string theory that are consequently found that we could live in a universe filled with not just three dimensions that we see every day plus 1 (on time) , but rather we can actually live in the universe * 11 * dimensions. But the mathematics that comes out of this theory does not end - there is a possibility that in fact parallel universes may exist; some of them right next to you and me! Can we take such a theory that would lead to such consequences seriously? As Green points out; we still have to fully find out, but we know that the mathematics that arose from these equations already shows us that the universe still has to show us. <br /> <br /> For those of you who are afraid of them, you won't be able to understand the terms in this program - don't worry. Professor Green is doing a great job of getting rid of math and harder physics concepts and instead focusing more on the concept of * that, taking all of that math, turns from a monstrous beast to an incredibly simple and as Green constantly points out, 'elegant concept. Viewers of this program do not need any prior knowledge in science; concepts are so simple, even if the child can understand them. When you complete this program, you will truly understand what a wonderful and mysterious universe we are in.
