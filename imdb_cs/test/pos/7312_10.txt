A rich old lady calls to flirtatious divorce to wake up Lothario away from her stupid granddaughter, who is soon married. BE US GAY is an interesting little home comedy that contains some kind of dialogue (courtesy of famous screenwriters Frances Marion) and good performances. Although perhaps a bit annoyed at times, it may be blamed for the difficulties of early sound technology that tended to limit activity and movement. Norma Shearer can be credited to appearing in this smaller film, rather than using her undeniable influence as Irving Thalberg's wife to insist on Class A photographs. She is particularly effective in her first few scenes, where her dowdy flat makeup makes almost unknowable. Her extreme transmogration from goose to swan could only happen in Hollywood, but it is hardly worth spending much time worrying about it. Rod LaRocque did not show much as Shearer's adulterous husband. Overall popular during the Silent Days, interviews were not particularly affectionate to him, and his career would suffer. Here his role is not at least compassionate and one has to think what the masochistic impulse is pushing women to crave so much. Magnificent Marie Dressler is handy as an eccentric widow of Long Island. As a great friend of Frances Marion, one can easily imagine that the part was written specifically for her. It's full of jokes and crotches. But the vast heat and essential good that would make Hollywood's biggest star in the near future is largely absent. Among the supporting actors, Hedda Hopper scored as a serpent as well as Wilfred Noy playing the butler's comic. The film mavens will see little Dickie Moore as Shearer's younger son and older Mary Gordon as her housekeeper, both uncredited.
