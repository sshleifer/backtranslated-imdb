I really have nothing to add to all the other comments, except: For me, the film looked like a silent movie that slowly adapted to the sound. The text boards that bring this story have reinforced this impression that I expect. On the way, the actors were allowed to leave the theater acting; Marguerite Churchill looks like a typical heroine at the beginning of the movie, but finer expressions are allowed at the end. Gus, the Swede, reminded me of the comic characters of Shakespeare's plays, and Windy sounded like the morning Donald Duck. I was really amazed that it was all shot outdoors, and even though the dust of all the cars, horses and cattle obscured the view, it must actually be for the real settlers! It was also clear to me that many of these Indians had to be real, and I did not find any apparent racism against them. And John Wayne looks so incredibly young! As someone who became a true Wayne fan through John Ford's trilogy, and thought the Stage Coach was Wayne's first star, this film was a revelation. The story is very simple, again it reminds me of a silent movie, but gravel is really real! An amazing film that was made with this technique and under these conditions in 1930.
