I have to admit, I was surprised how good this film was when I first watched it. In the summer I planned to see it in theaters, but I found it unpleasant to see that it was and was gone. That's why I expected to be removed from the theaters because it was bad. Then I rented it today and watched it and really enjoyed it. The speed at which the events occurred was controversial, it might have been a little longer. I found it very true for the book, but missed some key parts: the real name of Mullet Finger, etc. I felt like I wasn't reading a book I didn't understand what was happening. The behavior was pretty good, another thing I expected to be poor, but a cop, sorry to remember the actor's name, I could do a little better. All in all, I found it a very funny movie and would recommend it to all viewers!
