Nightbreed is definitely my favorite movie that I wore more than one tape. Makeup is amazing, the story is beautiful. It takes several different twists and is not as deep as the story that is based on (Cabal, Clive Barker), but the source of material remains a very true source for the film adaptation. The only problem with this film was the vain attempt of the producer to turn it into a teen movie slasher, hence the changed end to allow the sequel * eye role *. It seems that one day we will get a director's cut, which (I hope) will make this nonsense clear. In the meantime, I would suggest it to anyone who likes a dark fantasy horror type unlike Freddy / Jason / Micheal slashers. I don't really know what would be comparable ...
