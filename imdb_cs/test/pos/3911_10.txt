I loved this movie !! I'm waiting for this movie to come out so I can see it. I saw how the night was opening and loved it, Some people told me that this movie is not good and that I keep on, but I thought it was great. The actors did great and it was scary and made me jump. Paris Hilton has done a great job for her first film, all of which give her a tough time when she did a great job and didn't have such a big part. The set was great, made of all waxes and made. The two brothers did a great job and the meaning of death was great. The killers were really scary and made me close my eyes and not look at them. I can't wait to see this movie come out on Video so I can see it again and again. Looking at my review is going to see this movie if you like the Hororr movies and you won't regret that I loved this movie. This movie I give 10 out of 10 IT ROCKS !!!
