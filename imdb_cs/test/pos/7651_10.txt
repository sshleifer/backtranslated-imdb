After this show, we met on Sunday morning at 6:30 am while browsing through all the cable channels, which proved to be the best show! It's absolutely adorable. We need shows like this for kids (and adults as I am so out of my childhood years.) As one of the other comments pointed out, this show benefits from the simplicity of characters and stories. The puppets are fantastically cute, the background is colorful and although they are made of cardboard, foam, color and pure imagination, they remind us of our own childhood when we could spend a day in our own grandmother's house and explore the world around us. For those who have never been lucky enough to have a grandmother like Nana, this show is for you, you will have to make up for lost time! This show is a true inspiration and filled with cleverness and humor. In other words, overlook this show just because you're older than three years! Spending half an hour with Mona, Nana, Mr. Wooka and Russell will be your friends to look forward to!
