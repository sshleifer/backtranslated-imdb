Un Gatto nel Cervello, or the Nightmare Concert, as more commonly known among English-speaking audiences, begins as the director of the horror film Lucio Fulci (played by Lucio Fulci himself) for lunch after filming a very cruel and violent scene, even though he orders a steak and has a terrible a vision of cannibalism. Grotesque visions, hallucinations, and dreams continue to affect his mental state, Fulci decides to seek help and contact Professor Egon Schwarze (Dvid L. Thompson) for psychiatric help. Schwarz claims that Fulci can't separate fantasy from reality and agrees to help him, but Schwarz has a more sinister side motive because the serial killer starts to brutally kill prostitutes and Fulci thinks he might be responsible. This Italian production was co-author and director of Lucia Fulci, who also appears in the film as the director of the horror film, Lucio Fulci, who doesn't really feel as if there is a lot of effort in it. nothing else and I liked it myself. The screenplay Fulci, John Fitzsimmons, Giovanni Simonelli and Antonio Tentori is nothing more than an eloquent excuse to put together a lot of cruel footage from other Italian films. It serves pretty well and I assume that Fulci has some fascination on the screen, if your fan of his or her movies, his end is very rushed almost as if he is running out of money because he is just telling the Fulci that they killed the killer and that's it. Another thing at the end, when two cops put a white sheet over a dead killer in the field and then left, left him there without any police presence, I think the police in Italy would leave the dead body in the middle of the center. the field on his own? It moves at a good pace and if you like your gore then you have to see it, even if you don't like gore then you hate with passion, it all depends on yours, so choosing people is yours. Director Fulci was never artistically the most beautiful filmmaker and shows here because his shots are bland, flat and look like they were filmed for television, shots of other films (7 in total) t match the Fulci shot & it is clear that it was composed of different films. If your looking gore you have come across a jackpot, people are disassembled with chainsaws that are put through meat mincers, the faces are melted, there are several decapitation, there are some throat slits, some body is gorillas crushed under the car, the tongue is torn , somebody's throat crushed when a wheelchair is running on him, there's a lot of stings, somebody's got the courage with the hook, there's a rotten corpse that is accompanied by worms, somebody's cut off, someone's head cut off in their eyes, the cruel death piano wire, as it cuts through someone's throat, there are plenty of separate limbs, gallons of blood sprayed around, and scenes of some cats that eat brains and more. They said some of the special effects are a little fake and look cheesy. <br /> <br /> With a budget of around $ 100,000, it shows that it is quite cheap, has no visual style or merit, but then again why would you want to see a Nazi orgy sequence and wall-to-wall gore? Acting in this is terrible, including Fulci. Un Gatto nel Cervello is the best film if your gore-hound is like me, but if you're looking for something with a little more substance or really any substance then these are not for you. That's the kind of movie that divides people down, either you love what it does or hate.
