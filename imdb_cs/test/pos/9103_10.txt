This movie is very stupid and very funny. You can never criticize her for being serious. If you've heard their previous album or seen their HBO videos from the album, you can imagine an extremely nasty, swinging time that's this movie that tells a fable about how Tenacious D came to form. Full of portraits, it not only gives a fictional Tenacious D account, but is also a broadcast of musical history. Humor recalls something about Something about Mary in that they often "go to places you thought they wouldn't," but lacks the scatological humor of South Park. This film does not contain any nudity except for the moon.
