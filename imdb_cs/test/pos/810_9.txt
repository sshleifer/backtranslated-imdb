Hollow is an amazing secret of murder that provides everything you can expect from Agatha Christie and of course Poirot. It is built on a country house at the weekend. As always, all guests are suspicious and it is up to Poirot to find out the truth. With movies like this, it's always best to get too far away so I stop here. What I loved in "Cavity" was that it was a mystery of the old-fashioned way. When Poirot comes, everyone is around the body, for example. Everyone seems to be the culprit. There's a suspicious look and the atmosphere is just perfect for this story. You can expect to have a great time giving estimates of who did it and how and why and perhaps ultimately be surprised. A cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you have a pretty enjoyable experience. <br /> <br /> The actors are very good. As an announcement of curiosity by Edward Hardwicke, who played Dr. Watson at Sherlock Holmes. I like to see him after a few years. Suchet is amazing, as always and fortunately it is on screen most of the time. I found out who the murderer was, but it is still not predictable and it is also very trustworthy. So, finally, a great movie and as always a joy. <br /> <br />
