"Are you alone in the house?" They belong to pre-cable television days when networks have been eager to offer an alternative to popular TV shows. It is a good thriller with talented cast and trusted situations. Kathleen Beller plays a high school student who gets a series of impending letters. He seems to think it's nothing but a joke, but Beller is really scared. Tony Bill and Blythe Danner play Beller's parents, Ellen Travolta (sister of John) is a high school director and Dennis Quaid has one of her earliest roles as a cheerful rich boy. It is a competent cooler with a still relevant social message. Beller is beautiful - if you are 30 or more years old, you will remember that she was very popular with young people. Blythe Danner, who usually doesn't like me, gives a really moving performance. Nice little movie.
