Is it a mystery of murder? Is it a police process? Is it a back-stage view of dirty French music halls? Quai des Orfevres is all these, but more than anything else, it's a fun comedy of infidelity, jealousy and love that takes place in Paris after World War II. It may be surprising that the director of such films as Le Corbeau or such thrilling nailbers as Diabolique and The Wages of Fear is director Henri-Georges Clouzot. But Clouzot was a clever filmmaker. "In the secret of murder," he tells us, "there is an element of playfulness. It is never realistic. In this, I share Hitchcock's view, which says: "The secret of murder is a piece of cake with raisins and candied fruit, and if you deny it, you can also make a documentary." "Quai des Orfevres is a wonderful movie, and it's no documentary. Jenny Martineau (Suzy Delair) is an ambitious singer in music halls and nightclubs, she is a flirt, she sees nothing wrong with using some sex and talent. Her stage name is Jenny Latour and she really loves her husband Maurice Martineau (Bernard Blier) Martineau is something of a sad bag, it's her escort and arranger, she's a little bald, a little chubby and jealous. Then we have our neighbor, photographer Dora Monnier (Simone Renant), who is blonde, gorgeous (thinking about Rita Hayworth) and capable, she and Martineau were friends since they were kids, but Dora is definitely not just thinking about friendship, when she looks at Jenny, and then George and Brignon (Charles Dullin), a magical, rich and dirty old man who often has Dora's "artistic" photos of his young female women, presents himself. He offers a film contract to Jenny, and suggests dinner at his home to discuss the details. Jenny is more than willing. Maurice is furious and forbids it. Jenny yells at him: "You're jealous of the rich!" "You're a dad was a worker," Maurice shouts. "So what? According to Louis XV, I'd be Madame de Pompadour! I'd warm up their pantyhose!" And when Brignon is found dead with a broken bottle of champagne next to a bleeding skull, Dora is here to try to make things safe for Jenny. But wait. Inspector Antoine gets the case. Antoine (Louis Jouvet) is a tall, tired, middle aged bachelor with sore feet. He saw it all. He served in "colonies" with a foreign legion and returned with an adopted child and malaria. The child is now about eight years old and Antoine on it. One of the first things Antoine finds out is not only that someone Brignon's brain with a bottle, someone shot it in the heart. Who did it? Before long, Jenny, Maurice and Dora are making alibi, lying and confessing in one or other place. How does Antoine reveal the killer? Will we have a chance to see some great songs from the music hall sung by Jenny Latour? Everything clears up, but only by the time and perseverance of Detective Antoin. We stayed with many kinds of love that led to all sorts of motifs, from jealousy to the start of the hair to the craving glances ... and all played with a pleasant blend of Gallic amusement. Clouzot takes us to Paris, where there is a tight but non-threatening neighborhood, to subdued music publishers, where piano-playing melodies are played for buyers, discreet private dining rooms. Above all, he takes us to the music hall, where Jenny Latour often performs. We see Jenny singing, couples in the seats and single men wearing coats and hats standing up. And everyone smokes. In fact, the first third of the film takes place mainly in this environment. With Jenny singing about "Her pet tra-la-la, her sweet tra-la-la," we watch her from trying out the song at the publishers to rehearse a beating performance with Jenny in a feathered cap, corset, tights and nothing else. Delair, Blier and Renant are doing amazing work, but Louis Jouvet, who keeps everything together. He was an amazing actor who didn't like movies. The stage was his world, and he married movies only when he liked the director and earning money for his stage work. Jouvet was tall with a long face and broad cheekbones. He was not conventionally handsome, but he had something to control the scene. Let's see how skillfully he can play comedy, watch him at Drole de Drame. He's a fascinating actor. In one place he says, "I liked you, Miss Dora Monnier." "Me?" she's asking. "Yes. Because you and I are of two kinds. We will never have a chance when it comes to women." Jouvet brings to this line all kinds of nuances, from sad regret to subtle amusement.
