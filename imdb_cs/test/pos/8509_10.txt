Many of them hate never say never, because it's not the official Bond movie. However, it is clear that the producers followed the fertile Bond formula. Although the movie does not have a pre-credit sequence, it is clear that training at the beginning of the film is supposed to be the opening scene. It would be impossible for Eona to stop producers from including a pre-credit and title succession, though without a gun-introduction barrel. Sean Connery is in a subtle form as an immortal secret agent and this movie is definitely better than Dr No, Thunderball, You only live twice and diamonds are forever. Although the NSNA is supposed to be a remake of Thunderball, it's a huge improvement. 007 spends more time on the terra firm and a more varied range of exotic locations is included in the film. <br /> <br /> There are some impressive games in this movie. Barbara Carrera is perfect as a bizarre Fatima Blush. One of the best scenes in the film is the groundbreaking grace between Bond and Fatima in Nice, preceded by a dynamic motorcycle pursuit by the city. Klaus Maria Brandauer plays the psychotic Largo and Max Von Sydow is free from the melodrama that other actors depicting Blofeld accompany. The NSNA tends to focus more on Connery than on Bond's character. At the beginning it is stated that Bond is aging and out of order. This seems to refer to 12 years of hiatus in Connery's view of Bond. Bond promises to "never again" work in the secret service; allusion to Connery's display of Bond. Manufacturers seem to have tried to hurt Bond's official French check. However, this movie is definitely worth watching. This is the last time Sean Connery played James Bond, but his performance convinced me that he probably never said "never again".
