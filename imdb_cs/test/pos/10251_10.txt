The movie was very good when it came out, I visited Cooley High and Cooley Higher Center, around 1968 I was also home coming queen and grew up and lived in the Cabrini Greens area, I knew a lot of people in the movie, it was nice to see friends in a movie that lived in this area and had a chance to be a star once in their life, I had good times growing up on the north side, and the hard times I could have about Cooley High are no longer worth it, but a man like I and the others still remember the fun we visited at Cooley High, there's a lot of history around this north side.
