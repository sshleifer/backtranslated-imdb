I just watched this movie this morning and found it a great example of the wealth of faith. Babette gave them another way to look at life; there is no substitute, but an improvement. She shared everything she had with those who gave her as little as possible. I see God's story here. He sent his only son to the man. One could not give anything equal. So for our little sacrifice, we have the ultimate treasure, and so we are transformed. In this film, bickering townspeople consumed a small interpretation of God. Babette showed them that life and God can be truly beautiful in its full sense. The love that God's son has shown to man is the love we should show to one another and our lives will be richer for her. Even film is a metaphor. At first it seems slow, but the investment of time and attention to detail is finally rewarded. It was really a feast.
