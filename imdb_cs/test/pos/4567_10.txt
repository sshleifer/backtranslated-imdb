Claudine is a film that represents the American system on the worst. The social security system was initially set up as a springboard for those families who needed this extra hand to return to their feet. The film showed an accurate picture of how the social system divides the family unit. In other words, if the father or any male character is in the lives of women and children, their financial support from the system would be compromised if it were not terminated. The struggles of the poor can be seen all over the world. I would like to see the reproduction of this film back in stores so everyone can rent it or buy it for the library collection.
