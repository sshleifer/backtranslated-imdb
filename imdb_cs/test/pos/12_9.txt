I was pleasantly surprised to find that this film was shown as a sneaky insight in my local theater. We've all seen this line before (Top Gun, GI Jane, Officer and Gentleman), but a good script still works. This story is basically about training a Coast Guard rescue team with several side story lines. Kevin Costner plays the very successful leader of the rescue team Ben Randall, who is forced to lead a training team after a challenging task. The film will guide us through the strict training process and personal stories of both Costner and Jake Fischer, played by Ashton Kutcher. I am happy to say that Ashton is great in this part. There are no big surprises in this movie and you will probably realize what will come long before it arrives. However, using humor, exploring the toughness of training and the fun of observing Ben Randall "did his own thing as a coach", I was keen on it. I really like watching a movie that makes the whole audience laugh out loud, gasping here and there, and clapping at the end as a tribute to the movie. <br /> <br /> We all had a good time (despite a few hard moments in the movie) and I think you too.
