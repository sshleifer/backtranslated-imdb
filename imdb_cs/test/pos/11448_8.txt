The 1980s produced a lot of cruel horrific horrors, most of them under the slasher sub genre - bringing this film to most of the rest of its ilk. Demon Night is Something Among The Cross Movie The Evil Dead; and haunted house-cum-slash flick Hell Night. Films like this are usually characterized by a mad / deformed madman as a leading bad guy; but here we have bloodthirsty demons, which is always more interesting than a fool when you ask me. There is also a lot of comedy in this movie and the first third of the movie could be easily prepared for a direct comedy movie. But once the characters enter the central location; A Sinister Funeral Home Known As 'Hull House' - A movie morphs into a horror movie that you would expect that title. The plot line is as simple as you'd expect, and we're going to watch a lot of kids choose to have a Halloween party inside the funeral home. But it turned out to be a bad idea as soon as the house turns out to be obsessed; and demons begin to inhabit the bodies of children! Their only salvation lies on the other side of the underground stream ... but finding the gate to the campus isn't as easy as it sounds. The highlight of the film is the Gothic castle where the event takes place. place. This disheveled old house is a great place for horror; The fact that he used to be a funeral home just contributes to it. Director Kevin Tenney shoots the house well, and especially good work is being done to determine the fact that the house is in the middle of nowhere and escape is difficult. The comedy at the beginning of the movie is generally very funny and I was hoping it would make a laugh when the horror begins. The film has its comedy moments when children enter Hull House, but it is never too funny and it is clear that the horror is the main goal of the film. Not that it was a problem; but the Demon Night could have been much better if it had melted these elements properly. Characters are pretty much what you would expect from this kind of movie; But acting suits the film well, and it is clear that the young actor had a good time doing this movie and translating it well to the screen. The effects are good in that they suit the film well and because most death sequences are well done; it's a good bet that most people won't get bored when they look at it. This is not a classic or a movie. But I can highly recommend how it offers a good time and will appeal to fans of silly horror feed.
