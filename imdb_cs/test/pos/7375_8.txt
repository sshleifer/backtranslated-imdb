I saw this movie late at night on a freely available channel and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. Being a horror movie fan, I often watch this kind of midnight movie during school holidays. More often than not, horror movies shown during this time are usually large lamers. 'Campfire Tales' certainly doesn't fit into this category. The Camp Story is basically an anthology of stories based loosely on famous urban legends. They are implicated along with the setting to include teenagers telling these stories around the campfire. This campfire setting has a mysterious plot on its own. However, this particular story is weak and confusing, apparently mainly used to set up other scary stories. There are three stories in this movie (four when you start counting "Hook" at the beginning), all are really scary and well done. In particular, I enjoyed the third story ('The Locket'), which concerned a guy whose motorbike breaks up in front of a mysterious household. This particular story works well when you really get angry with the sudden flashes of the house's history. Besides, the end of the story shocks you completely! The first story ("The Honeymoon") was also very scary, although the second story ("People can lick too") was somewhat lacking. Being a horror veteran, I usually don't get exploded. This movie certainly did the job well! What I liked about this film is the fact that it is divided into three short films. This means that the film will not chase the hour or hour of character development and settling before real bloodshed begins. This makes the 'Campfire Stories' perfect for sleepovers, parties, etc. <br /> <br /> Campfire Stories is a creepy, sharp horror movie that will make your heart stop more than once. It's definitely better than the bullshit you often find in theaters (Blair Witch 2, Urban Legends: Final Cut ... bleah!). Find a copy and watch it ... if you dare! <br /> <br />
