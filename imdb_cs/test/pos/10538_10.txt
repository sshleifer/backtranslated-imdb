The previous user's comments are tough. One wonders if they even saw this beautiful sweet movie. As for being so ugly about it before a writer / director .. thats just plain rude! For those who grew up in the 1980s, it is a refined piece of nostalgia and a sweet story that has behaved and produced. Irish filmmaking has a lot of bitter angry people dealing with it, and the comments on the spleen about it are proof. As people we have a choice; give out and moan about people who actually go there and do things or do something. I know which one is easier ... Do yourself a favor and watch this movie and see how a short movie is made ... you won't be disappointed
