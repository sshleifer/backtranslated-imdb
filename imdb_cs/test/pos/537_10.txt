Most families recognize the similarities between their own family and the family created by the brilliant actors Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon. Natalie creates an on-screen image that justifies her as one of America's best actresses and one that is worthy of a Golden Globe nomination. Controlling her emotions is so tactical that she can slip into them and release an unforgettable scene at every moment of the film. Susan is also amazing in this film because she has chosen a role that is so different from the others and transmits it with real professionalism. Any fan of Natalie would see a movie based on her past successes, but you should see it for the emotions that appear during the movie. It's a really humble experience.
