I wanted to see this movie for a very long time. Finally, I bought it on E-Bay because it's so hard to find a state. But he was waiting ... somewhat worthwhile. I can't say the movie was great. And I can't say the movie was merry. But it was good and has some funny points. That party shots in this movie are just beautiful. And the whole cast, especially Brenda Blethyn (someone I hadn't seen before, unfortunately), was excellent. Finally, it's a good romantic comedy and I suggest you check it if you've had a death in the family. <br /> <br /> If anything, the last chapter is worth the money. >. <
