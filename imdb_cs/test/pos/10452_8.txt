This is one of the best and most under rated teen movies ever made. <br /> <br /> I saw it grow up and it was, and is one of my favorites, maybe not as popular as "Fast Times" but just how great it is, <br /> <br /> This movie it is a serious aspect, as other reviewers have mentioned that it starts as a comedy and morphs into a halfway drama. But this is the beauty of what sets it apart. You get it all. Humor (as opposed to "Fast Times"), Drama and Great Soundtrack. Personally, I think every kid who wants to go to high school should see it. they are about to release. Cmon-what does the child watch, SONEONE couldn't be in the movie? The fact that it becomes so serious it is in the middle when it is also cool and just great well done.You don't even see it coming. Surely a lot of surprises. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS: DO NOT READ ANYMORE HOW TO DO IT. Great humor with a knee that can forget the scene between Gary and Camilla?). I still hear it: "Oh my big strong burrito !!" Invaluable !! Some scenes between Gary and Karin are hard to follow (especially the last scene of the rough). There are so many women like Karen out there who would make exactly the same choice as she did. Think about it - how many women reject men with gold hearts (like Gary) for nerds? I know I did - so I have many women I know. This film will inspire discussion and, despite the countless times I have seen, it still surrounds me with the admiration of filmmakers and performers. Everyone will find someone who is involved in this movie, or more likely, more than one person. Finally, the music you use is just great (lots of cars, u2, lots of obscure (now) 80's songs - 80's purist dream)) <br /> <br /> But don't be mistaken , it's not the music that makes this movie unique, it's the story itself, simple and simple. One of the best is this kind and teen movie classic.
