You don't have to be a fan of a cartoon show to enjoy this movie. I watched it for the first time when I was nine years old, I was a fan of the T.V show, and my parents laughed as hard as I did. This happens in the classic style of Bugs Bunny cartoons from yesterday, and due to today's vulgar cartoons, I think someone would appreciate a cartoon that relies more on "grudges" then on vulgarity to get a couple of laughter.
