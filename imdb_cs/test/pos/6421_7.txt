I first heard about it when I was looking for a 'Network for reviews of another Italian giallo / horror effort, the current PERFUME LADY IN BLACK (1974, whose R2 SE DVD from Raro Video, by the way, I recently received)? ? where it is referred to as being in a similar vein but also equally good. Now that I've been watching FOOTSTEPS for myself, do I see where this reviewer comes from? in that both films deal with the psychological collapse of their female protagonist. But, stylically, does this movie owe much more to an Art-house cinema than anything else? in particular the work of Alain Resnais and Michelangelo Antonioni (and in particular LAST YEAR in MARIENBAD [1961] and PASSENGER [1975]); Accordingly, some have been accused of being "deadly boring"? epithet often associated with such 'cocky' (read: cerebral) fare! Anyway, the film includes a search for a woman (Florinda Bolkan) to determine her movements in the previous three days? he seems to have no memories. Following a series of mysterious clues, it travels to the "mythical" land of Garma (nearby locations, then bear the same fictitious names Muda and Rheember)? where he meets several people (including Lily Kedra as the resort's aristocratic line) who are supposed to recall the hero who stayed there during her "blackout"! But the most prominent is a young man (Peter McEnery) and a little girl (Nicoletta Elmi from BARON BLOOD Mario Bavy [1972])? the first always seems to take place on the scene in good moments, while the other seems to confuse Bolkan with another woman (sports long red hair and middle strip!). Basically it's a mood but it's a clever puzzle: inevitably, vague events are projected at a deliberate pace? and where much of the film's power derives from a notable central performance (which can be seen as an extension of Bolkan's role in the fine Lucio Fulci giallo LIZARD IN FEMALE LEATH [1971]). However, the contribution of cameraman Vittorio Storaro (which provides any number of camera movements and an effective color scheme that includes the use of orange / red / blue filters to create an atmosphere and a saturated appearance for disorienting, bizarre finals) does not deny. ) and Nicola Piovani's melancholic score (the composer is currently best known for his Oscar-winning work on Robert Benigni's tragicomedy The Holocaust-themed LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL [1997]). With this in mind, it is worth discussing how FOOTSTEPS was introduced in the version I watched: well, it's hard to get into its original form (I can't be sure it is this here or not, except that the movie ran 89 years) minutes while IMDb ??? This lists the 96), this release is being knocked out of the pretty battered English VHS (dubbing is surprisingly good, due to the international cast) with burned Swedish subtitles to run (except DivX copies a few seconds stiffened at and a key point in the story around the 82-minute Brands)! Yet we receive a welcome bonus, ie 9-minute "Highlights From The Soundtrack" in MP3 format. I realize that I haven't mentioned the monthly mission of Klaus Kinski on a monthly mission. limited: by the way, by the same time, he had a similarly short but crucial role in another good bohemian thriller with sci-fi oblique movements (and also in a prominent place)? namely, LIFESPAN (1974). When I watched the movie, I couldn't understand the possible connection it had to the central storyline, except that Bolkan mentioned a repetitive dream of a movie he once saw, though not until the end, called "Steps on the Way" Moon "(somewhat misleading alternative film title) first of all recalls the picture called BLOOD ON MOON (which is, of course, the classic western noir of 1948 with Robert Mitchum and director Robert Wise!), which means I took this" distraction " in step as just another great touch to the film (since Bolkan's former work as a translator at the Earth Future Conference) and certainly did not expect the astronauts to turn to the beach at the very end of Garma to watch the women's leadership where sand then turns ominously to the surface of the moon? <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is likely to make more sense at the second viewing? it is better approached as a visual and auditory experience, and one should not really expect him to give a narrative that is in any case clear and rationalized! The only other Bazzoni effort I managed to capture was that I played the giallo FIVE CORD (1971), where Franco Nero appeared (which I shot outside late Italian TV); Some time ago I got to his rendition of Spaghetti Western "Carmen" titled MAN, PRIDE AND VENGEANCE (1968) ?? also with Nero and Kinski ??? like DivX (after I have already missed matin√©e posting) ??? but the conversion proved to be defective in some way and therefore the disc would not play properly!
