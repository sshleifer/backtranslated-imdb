This was a movie that first showed me what really is a great actor Martin Sheen. He modestly claims that Charlie is a better actor, Charlie can't hold the candle to him. I found it tense and enjoyed the entanglement of a love story with the main plot (and usually HATE love stories). In the end, there is a great twist that considered me totally trustworthy, especially in the early 1980s, and probably now. The last scene had me on the edge of my seat. This film illustrates that betrayal is often eliminated by those we trust, while declared enemies have more in common than they suspect, and finally that human compassion can be found where we least expect it. <br /> <br /> irenerose
