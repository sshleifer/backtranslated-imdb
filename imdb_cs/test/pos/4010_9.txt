My favorite show of all time! Yeah, I thought it was so cool, and Larisa Oleynik was the first crush I ever had (AAAAWWWWWW). It was well written, funny - except that it wanted to be serious, and overall a great show. But since we couldn't afford to keep Nick, I couldn't see any episodes after February 1996, and maybe I was thinking more than I was. For me, it's more of an epidemic (now it doesn't look right!) To say "Goodbye" to someone you love, and KNOW you'll never see them again. And I still think so, because as far as I know, there are no plans to release it on DVD anytime soon ... yeah, life is average! I certainly found out (though you can find a special episode everybody here or there ... but I never liked the bootleg copies of things). So enough of my sad life: (... Most kids in grade 7 don't need power like Alex gets to get them life (unrealistic - sure) but then again how many cities have super -White chemical plants that are willing to do something for "Progress at any price"? Gee's show was fun to watch, though I would agree that the diagnosis is a little over developed (and even a little politically correct sometimes). were when the kids had a reason to break into the plant (videotape or something similar) as the children's version of "Rainbow Six" Tom Clancy (which is a few years later that I was addicted to this game series). who is desperate to find an "accident kid" ... very average guys (at least when I first watched the show ... look more sympathetic to me now) I feel very sad for Larisa Oleynik, I'm not sure she thinks that she would this role has given ... ... but I will always remember it. <br /> <br /> Oh and BTW plays Aaron Peirce of "24" is also like a school coach or something ... too cool! Maybe he can get the producers of this show to get Larisa next season "24". I just brought it because Jack Bauer is my next TV hero and I'd like to see things happening, lol :). They're both set in California, so I'll just be dream'n ... I see it now, "Leave me with the suspect for a few minutes ... no, I don't need a car battery!"
