Most people will consider that the greatest performance of Yul Brynner was as the ruler of Siama in King and I. Certainly he gave him a variety of moods to test his abilities, from comics to tragic, from eagerness to learn to control hate. . He also showed him the advantage of being a "singer" and a dancer. Finally, as it was also his winning Tony Award from Broadway, the movie allowed us to capture even something of a big performance on Broadway. But he made other films that showed his talents as well as THE KING AND I. His comic cornering on ONCE MORE With FEELING was pretty nice. Likewise, his performance as General Bunin in ANASTASIA, or his Ramses in TEN ANNEXES. Yet he came so close to being the successor of Eric Von Stroheim of the 1950s as "the man you hate". A certain vulnerability of his plays and roles brought him to the film public, even after his best years when the star was behind him - and more and more moving away in repeating King Siam on TV and on stage. His best performance is for me in this 1959 drama with Deborah Kerr, Jason Robards Jr., Robert Morley, EG Marshall, Anne Jackson and Ronnie Howard. The film takes place in a relatively modern era - in 1956 in Hungary, where it seemed that the Iron Curtain would collapse there as a result of the reforms of Hungarian patriot Imre Nagy and his supporters. However, the Hungarian Revolution collapsed due to poor timing. The Russians and their Polish and East German allies sent tanks to destroy the revolt (and arrested and executed Nagy and other reformers). The West stood and left it: England and France seized in the Suez crisis, and the United States attacked Israel and Israel to attack Egypt. Due to the act of three close allies in the US, it was difficult for the West to condemn the overpopulation of the Soviet Union. It was an unfortunate situation, and the Hungarians never forgot how they were left in it. In Brynner, Major Surov, a Russian intelligence officer who watches some of the leaders of the Hungarian revolt, is one of them, Paul Kedes (Jason Robards). Kedes can get help from some westerners on a bus tour through Hungary, led by Robert Morley (including Marshall, Jackson, and Howard, and Kerr). They are kept at the hotel while their bus is being repaired, and Brynner mixes with them, hoping for a lead to Robards stay. But Brynner is a man - he tries to be kind to these people (everyone sees him as a monster) and, when he gets too drunk, he confronts them with questions that annoy historians since 1945: How (even if we notice that Russia was Stalin in charge) that relations between Russia and the West collapsed so quickly? Overall, the Allies worked well between 1941 and 1945, but all kinds of mutual suspicions broke out after Yalta and Potsdam. Did they? Surov is a good officer, but in the middle he is torn by loyalty to the Communist regimes in the Soviet Union and in Hungary he supports, and his growing fondness for Kerr, who hides Robard, but is also willing to record the Russian mainstream. And as the film reaches its tragic peak, we watch Surov decide whether to follow his sense of duty, or apologize to Kerr, Robards, and other Westerners who want to leave. It becomes a real struggle for him - and one he can win too late. It was a great film about the tragedy of post-war Europe and perhaps the most elaborate role that Yul Brynner has ever portrayed.
