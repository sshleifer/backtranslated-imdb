Scratch is a documentary about DJs and their scratching art. From that one movie description, you would have no idea how fun and educational this little movie is. It is a joyful and lively celebration of a cold subculture that is little known. It is filled with great underground hip hop music and you will see some of the best DJs (eg DJ Q-Bert, DJ Shadow and Mix Master Mike from the Beastie Boys) who show off their stuff.

And you can even learn the basics of scratching by DJ Q-Bert (eg How to use a fader to get different sound effects). All these DJs in their own way have been inspired to get into the art of scratching after watching Herbie Hancock perform their song "Rock It" (remember that song, right?) Live in the Grammys.

There are moments where clips are quickly "rewound" and then "forwarded" several times, which mirrors (in film medium) what happens when a DJ quickly moves a record on his turntable back and forth while using his fader (that "wa- \ t wicka-wicka "sound" Whether you're a hip hop fan or not, you can rely on Scratch to give you a very nice night in the movies. compliment.
