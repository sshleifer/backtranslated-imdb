Above all, I watched this show because I was a little toddler and I always loved it. Sure, maybe I didn't understand it when I was so young, but I still enjoyed it! And now that I have been able to understand it for several years, I love it even more. The score of this musical is the most amazingly detailed score I've ever heard! Every note is perfect, I don't even need to hear singing to enjoy it! Of course, no one could play Mrs. Lovett except Angela Lansbury, perfectly. And she should play this role for several years. George Hearn is absolutely great. Best Sweeney Todd I've ever heard. He has an amazing voice, but he can throw his voice so well! His "revelation" is incredible as you can tell the audience's reactions to it. Judges, Toby, Antony and Pirelli are also amazing in their roles. Everyone is perfect! Well, I still have to go forward through John's green finch and linnet bird. She just doesn't sing that song at all. <br /> <br /> This show can be awarded in all ages but is not always accepted. I'm not your typical middle-aged lover, I'm only 15 years old, but Sweeney Todd gave me more recognition for music than I got from some other musical.
