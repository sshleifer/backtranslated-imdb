I have this eBay movie mainly because I am gay and I like Til Schweiger. However, it is one of those films that when you look at it for the second time you never say, "Hmm. I forgot about that boring part. I'll go do popcorn." He doesn't have that part. It is a very smooth and constantly interesting film. And yes, Til Schweiger is worth it if nothing else. But it's a great movie even for straight guys.
