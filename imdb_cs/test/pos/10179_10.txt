Millions in gold travel by train to the US Treasury. Traveling together is Lois Lane to report on it. On the way, the train is attacked by masked thieves. He disconnects the car with the armed guards in it and attacks the remaining. This leads to an evil battle between the remaining guards and thieves. Thieves overcame them, but Lois Lane jumped in. He beats a thief from a train (using a gun in one place), but the train is getting out of control. Lois can't stop it and the thieves don't stop at anything to get the gold. Good thing Superman is on his way! <br /> <br /> Fast, exciting, continuous action. Probably one of the best cartoons. Just great.
