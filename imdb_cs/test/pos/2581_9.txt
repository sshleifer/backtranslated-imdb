Craig Brewer is now officially a writer / director for whom I will see any movie, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorite favorites this year, with his emotionally charged story and realistic, fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I thought when I saw this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used the music effectively, but there seemed to be a good chance of getting into absurdity and fast. Luckily, Black Snake Moan hits all his brands. Acting is stunning, great writing and editing style, as well as side-by-side music, thrilling all the way. The brewer seems to be the master of getting his characters to have the right combination of compassion and anger when they set out on a journey towards redemption. The first moment I knew I was on healing was at the beginning. As with Hustle and Flow, Brewer puts music across widescreen images perfectly with simply typed fonts that appear statically. The aesthetics of the 1970s were welcomed and helped show that it would be another great piece in the vanity of those who in this decade some of the best films are the best. From there, we continued with short excerpts to the lives of Lazarus and Rae, each vignette mirroring the other while they travel to the fateful moment when their paths finally cross. Adjustments between them were smooth and relevant rather than suddenly cutting until the scene felt ready for its purpose. A friend of Rae goes to ministry and Laz's wife leaves him for her brother. Everyone feels loneliness and returns to what they know in this situation? Rae for sex and Laz for bottle. When Rae leaves the corpse on the side of the road and her savior comes from his farm to take her, the reasons for their actions finally become clear. Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as an older bluesman farmer trying to reconcile his life with God and the body and the pain he has brought to him. There are moments of stoic rigor as well as moments of kindness with his captive / patient. You never think of a setting as comic or unrealistic because it sells what it does so well. Also, the character of Rae is not too long, despite what you believe. The situation starts a little embarrassing when we see that chaining was for her own good and is actually used for only one day or two. As for the chained girl, Christina Ricci really shines. I've never seen her as anything special, but this role is a real breakthrough for her. This girl is so concerned that her past sexual abuse has scarred her very deeply. Whenever she is away from her love, she begins to see the flashes of a man who took her for childhood innocence and itching that could touch any person who might let the image disappear. Her nymphomania is not for joy, but rather for survival from the ghostly nightmares that always hide behind her eyelids. Ricci fully occupies a role and shows all the emotional trauma to great effect and realism. One should also mention Justin Timberlake, who again shows some real acting talent. Where this guy came from, I have no idea, but hopefully he will continue to film and turn away from most of the bullshit he spews. Although not as solid and consistent as Hustle and Flow, Moan is still the same in my mind because when it's on, it's spectacular. Towards the end, we have a really fascinating succession with "This Little Light of My" singing, and earlier, the interaction between captives and captors when the string is first introduced shows some cutting edge work. The real magic moment is when Jackson sings (yes, it's all, like Terrence Howard in Hustle) a titular song while the storm roars and the lights flash. If I don't see a more beautiful shot all year round, I won't be surprised. What these two people do for themselves is amazing and shows what humanity is capable of. One thing I think I really like about Brewer's work is the fact that he doesn't show sinners to become redeemed heroes. Instead, it shows us that no matter how bad you were or how bad life was, everyone can strive for redemption and be better people. We don't have holy but fallen people looking for their ship. If the course remains true, or if it returns to darkness, no one knows, but at least they can say they tried as hard as they could.
