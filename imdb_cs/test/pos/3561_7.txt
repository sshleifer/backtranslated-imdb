The train, which holds union soldiers, transports $ 300,000 of gold, along with banker Clayton, who is there to see that he will reach his destination, but the bandit Monetero robs him suddenly. However, Bahunda sticks with gold and hides it, but when Monetero tries to get him out, he is killed by soldiers. The only trace is a medallion, but Monetero is captured and would soon be executed. An alien dressed as a priest arrives (who after the reward of Moneter) and offers to save his life for half the gold. In return, Moneter gives him half of the medallion, but Clayton notices and finds out something's fine. Soon, all three are moving for gold, but the bank's insurance company and Moneter's gang are watching, waiting for their chance to plunge. <br /> <br /> We're just following the introductory sequence you know. Re in Western Spaghetti with tongue-in-face-style and reliance on sprinkling many links (some nicely implemented) from other films (predominantly Dollar Trilogy) by his sub-genre. Director Enzo Castellari's steep direction is vast and mostly light, but there is potential in many of his spectacular, clever pieces and smooth rhythmic tempo. Most of the time there is a lot of tussles, fist-fighting (and lots of acrobatic stunts), compared to everyday gunfights. However, most of these pieces are very well done and very pleasant, and when the weapons are blazing, there is the energy that burns. The traditional story is close to conventional details, but since there is plenty of pleasure and outfoxing, spontaneous nature assures you that you are never quite sure how to play between the three. This leads to many powerful thrilling moments, clever turns and lots of blinks, blinks. The humor in the starch scenario is pretty crafty. Giovanni Bergamini is a dynamically tense frame and impulsive music score by Francesco De Masi. The performances are very well adapted and form a remarkable relationship. George Hilton is a wise and bumped turn is solid as an ambiguous alien. Gilbert Roland brings class and intelligence to his formidable Mexican bandit Monetero. Edd Byrnes gives ready-made performance like Clayton, who holds up well. Kareen O'Hara doesn't have much to do, but he's a good seeker. Gerard Herter, Pedro Sanchez and Ivano Staccioli provide support. An amusing and worthy spaghetti parody / tribute that throws one arc ball after another and many fertile 'n' dirty antiquities.
