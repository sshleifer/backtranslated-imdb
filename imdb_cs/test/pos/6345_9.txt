Let me start by saying there is no bigger fan of the original "Lonesome Dove" than I. How the Pulitzer Prize-winning book and towering mini-series adapted from it stand in my own experience as moving, dramatic, believable, and engrossing. There is no comparison between "Lonesome Dove" and any Western film - at least not from the legendary collaboration of John Ford and John Wayne. It was with real reservations that I sat down to watch this new mini-series with McMurtry's absence and the missing original members. After watching the first episode, it was clear that it was not "Lonesome Dove". In almost every measurable way, this continuation lacks the original. But what? I didn't expect him to measure it. The film is intriguing, it is engaging, fun and high quality. If it was made as a new story, not as a sequel to "Lonesome Dove", there is no question in my mind that it would not have received as many negative ratings. Jon Voight did a decent job like Call, Barbara Hershey was amazing Clara, and new characters like Gideon Walker and Agostina Vega were well drawn and believable. Louis Gossett jr deserves special mention as Isom Pickett's wrangler horse. The film made me look after the characters and I no longer have more than an actor. It is unfortunate that this worthy effort stands in the shadow of its predecessor - it is worth seeing in its own right.
