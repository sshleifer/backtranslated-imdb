On the surface, TMHS appears to be another generic drama school; underneath it, however, is a surprisingly hidden enormous depth, originality and eccentricity that will not only be unforgettable for the viewer, but also undoubtedly one of the best times the medium has created in recent years. We see the world through the eyes of Kyon, who meets Haruhi Suzumiya, a girl who courageously declares the rest of the class, that she is not interested in "normal people" and invites all extraterrestrials upside down on her first day at High School. , time passengers, riders or espers to meet her. Kyon stares in disbelief, wondering if he is kidding or has a few bolts loose. However, defying his intestinal instincts begins to talk to her. At the same time, it soon becomes apparent that it is not an ordinary college. Not long after that, she creates her own aptly named 'SOS Brigade' school club, and pulls Kyon among other highly unhappy people to attend. Nothing in this anime matches the usual standard conventions, Kyon. the protagonist is too cynical a pessimist and contributes to the witty narration of the show. Far from the usual 2D male leaders who tend to fill the media. The episodes themselves are not chronological and force the viewer to think about the events that are developing and how they relate to previous instances. This is a brilliant move; the effect is like a jigsaw puzzle, because the new piece is laid out to get more sense of the bigger picture. The previous scenes are now given a whole new meaning and their realization is deeply satisfying. However, this means that he feels disjointed (something else), a very cleverly written script circumventing this problem and ensuring that it flows smoothly from start to finish. The story itself is imaginatively original, but I will not go further than the simple outline of bare bones that I have given earlier because it will undoubtedly spoil it. However, what I mention is the conspiracy contains a huge number of genres, from comedy to science fiction. As they managed to achieve it in the space of fourteen episodes, it is beyond me, and no doubt a huge success in itself. TMHS is a true gem that has the variety and depth to refer to. almost everyone who is interested in anime. Watch it, somewhat unusually, is something that lives up to the huge humbug that it has embraced - and even surpasses it.
