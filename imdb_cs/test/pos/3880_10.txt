I thought it was brilliant! It was great to watch each of them follow each of them. Dwight Schultz still looked the same, barely changing in appearance, or Dirk Benedict, still looking as unhappy! I thought Mr. T looked thinner, but it was great to see how he'd been watching all along. I thought it was someone who played Decker and the lady who played Amy took the other cast members to move. It was just a pity that Mr. T couldn't make a real meeting. It was also a pity that George Peppard died and left a gap so he could speak. I wish I could keep it. Hopefully they will repeat it again.
