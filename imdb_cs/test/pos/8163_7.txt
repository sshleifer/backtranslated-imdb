LATTER DAYS <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Light source issues when a boy in love LA party (Wes Ramsey) with a handsome Mormon missionary (Steve Sandvoss). A huge hit on the festival circuit and a limited theatrical release, this likable film - the feature debut of screenwriter C. Jaya Cox (SWEET HOME ALABAMA) - is an exercise in "the opposites that attract" Ramsey's The shallow minded character will change forever after the fall for the vulnerable beauty of Sandvoss, which is limited by the dictates of its religious beliefs. Here is the path of true love paved with difficulty, not least the reaction of Sandvoss's colleague Mormons to his newly found sexuality, resulting in his excommunication from the church and the anger of his indignant parents (Mary Kay Place has a small but devastating portrait as a boy's indignant mother ). However, Cox's scenario focuses primarily on Ramsey's path to redemption because his hedonistic lifestyle is influenced by the influence of Sandvos and the responsibilities that emerge as a result of his mature maturity: he voluntarily acts as a field participant to deliver AIDS to patients. living at home, leading to an unexpected friendship with former party boy Eric Palladin ("er"), whose illness provides Ramsey with much-needed wake-up call. Cox's screenplay is ugly one-liners and various pearls of wisdom (on Mormonism: "Your church doesn't like alcohol or gays? Well, I'm definitely not joining - I can't imagine heaven without both!") , and characters are surprisingly complex and well designed. Ramsey has a more courageous and seductive role (it is seen for the first time that he is doing something rude with a willing participant!), But it's Sandvoss, who has become a gay man, with his sensitive portrayal of an innocent man whose journey from darkness to light leads to a surprising revelation his place in the world around him. He and Ramsey are well enclosed and their inevitable sexual scene (short but unforgettable) is followed by an impressive sequence in which Ramsey describes the childhood trauma that defined his life to date. Filmed on hi-def video and converted to 35mm for a theater show, the film's modest budget limits the scope and grandeur of Cox's ambitions, though characters and situations are strong enough to survive this small disadvantage. Jacqueline Bisset shines as a secular wise restorer at a restaurant where Ramsey waits for the tables and Joseph Gordon-Levitt ("The Third Rock from the Sun") steals every thunder like Sandvoss's fellow Mormon, unlike his friend's relationship with Ramsey on a religious principle ... but ONLY on principle. Although in places where it is a bit, the film suffers from a romantic desire and deserves credit for its honesty and compassion. Best seen with a crowd of like-minded viewers, preferably with a loved one on your side.
