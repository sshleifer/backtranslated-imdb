When Bicentennial hit, I was in Hershey, PA and part of the Middletown Skate Team. We did nothing but skate around and tried to find out what we read on the Skateboarder website. A few local hills provided all the speed you managed. At that time Mike Weed was a hot thing, along with Russ Whats-his-name, with the Z-Hot boys on the tail. I had a plastic plate GT (GrenTech) with urethane wheels Power Paw (free bearings). My parents told me that we moved to California that year and went home. hunting. I was a very good son that summer and asked if I would have to be rewarded with a REAL skateboard from California. They added. It was a glass fiber board with the Surfer Magazine logo. Wide cars and big red wheels (precision bearings, I don't know). They got him on Oak Street, a surf shop in Laguna Beach. <br /> <br /> When I got to California (all 13), Anaheim also had concrete wool and Karlovy Vary. Soon the Odyssey Skateboard arrived in Mission Viejo. An indoor park with every scenario can be imagined. I've been reading about Stacy, Shog, Tony and Jay all the time. This movie was right on the money and a wonderful experience to watch.
