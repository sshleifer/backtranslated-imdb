This movie is probably not the funniest thing I've ever seen, and it certainly doesn't have much redeemable value. In fact, it is no more than a collection of vignette bound by free conspiracy. However, this "make-it-up-as-I-go-along" attitude actually works to benefit the film. "Tommy Boy" succeeds as a comedy for the same reasons that SNL skates Farley and Spade played in succeeded: their well-timed extemporaneous silliness and chaos makes them humorous despite their immaturity.
