First Viewed 10/28/2007, 8 out of 10 (Dir-Jesus Ponce): A simple, sweet story of a homeless couple and their everyday adventures that have survived in an everyday world without a roof overhead. The film starts with the woman from the story (Isabel Ampudia) being released from prison, but we don't know what she is, or how long she was there. It runs through the anti-hero of the story and his friend, who played Sebastian Haro when he parks the cars for a change. They gather under an old dilapidated building with nothing but warmth and a small mattress. It is a drug addict who is just trying to make it from one correction to another, but she has a strange, obsessive appeal to him as a person we eventually accept. He also has some kind of sexually-transmitted disease, so sex for them is out of question but this does not seem to be a problem for one of them. He loves this man as he is, without a doubt, without having to change, which is a rare finding anywhere. Earns you by carrying a bucket and washing shop windows. They eat pastries every day and consider it a feast. Isabella's character dreams of a normal life, but doesn't expect it to happen and doesn't expect it to fit in, so she doesn't think much. Both characters come from extremely broken homes, and therefore the viewer, despite their imperfections, is likable. Without giving up a large number of stories, Isabel's character persisted while the man deteriorates in his drug obsession. There is a nice melodramatic conclusion to the story that picks it up for the masses to enjoy, but overall it's a wonderful independent movie about the relationship between un-secular misfits that keeps you interested to the end.
