I remember when this movie came out and watched it several times on VHS. I was so glad when it was finally released on DVD. I was hoping for a widescreen screen, but the spot would be what was available. I love how they used color in the movie, the outdoor scenes are so vivid with color. The trees are the greenest I've ever seen. Most of the film was shot in Stillwater, Minnesota, a beautiful city on the St. George River. Croix. They had to have really scout sites for filming because they did a great job. The story is well written and driven. I'd consider it the best of Peter Horton. I am also surprised that Andrew Dintenfass (director of photography) did not do more. He did an incredible job. There, too, is acting. It is amazing to see two actors of such a young age who download this type of film. Annabella Sciorra did a great job like Dexter's mother. Who wouldn't want her as a mother.
