When I saw it without knowing that all the hoops surrounding the leading character, without knowing it was based on real-life events, I must say that I am impressed. "Murder at Greenwich" is an above-average production for a film made for television - acting is unanimously great, especially Christopher Meloni, who plunged into stand-out and teenagers excelled in difficult roles. The idea of ​​a dead girl telling a movie is a brilliant move that uplifts the film from mere to excellent. The scenario is exemplary for what is essentially a weekly food for the film and cinema is beautiful.
