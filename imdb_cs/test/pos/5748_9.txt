This movie was amazing. I was in tears at the end of the movie. Well, I know he's acting, but it's not important. The message came loud and clear about God's love for us and the sacrifice of Jesus. The film was realistic and showed real human feelings, be it Pete's anger at the blond girl's grin or the guy who asked. But she also showed the joy that comes from a real relationship with Christ. The cars were amazing and the actors were very hot and attracted my eye. But what I liked most about this film was the clear message of the gospel. Mother and pastor supported Ben in his new walk with Christ and tried to be a pious example to others. Nicky D has shown that no matter if you have the whole world to offer, without Christ, it doesn't matter. Nina showed how wrong, but a good person can easily miss a brand. I loved this movie and I think it will bring many teenagers to Christ.
