OK, most of us agree that this is a faint remake attempt, but it is also a different film in its own right. Don't get me wrong, 'American Werewolf in London' is an excellent movie, but 'American Remake In Paris' is also a decent movie. First, the only real similarities are TITLE, 2 American BackPACKERS and WEREWOLVES. Other than those three things, the 'American Remake of Paris' stands apart quite well with its special blend of humor, action / adventure and horror. Most people who say this film is better than the original is today's youth who thinks that any film made before 1990 is a total crap. While those of us who grew up in the 1980s can appreciate older films and what they have added to horror movies today. Many people do not realize that without old classic movies, including black and white, horror would not be what it is today. Now I get a little further off the beaten track ... <br /> <br /> The American Werewolf In Paris, there is a good attempt to recreate the classic, but it never overcomes the original. With that said, it's still a very funny movie to watch and I recommend it. I give it 7 out of 10. Maybe it's a little generous, but I've seen much worse attempts to recreate the classics.
