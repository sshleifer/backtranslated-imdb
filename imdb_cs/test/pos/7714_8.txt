I've seen three Animatrix episodes, and that's my favorite of all. The second Renaissance gave the fragile universe a fragile story. The program was a stylistically impressive number, feeling a little silly. I think what gives this one this special touch is the direction from Shinichiro Watanabe, the director of the incredibly popular (and for good reason) Cowboy Bebop series. She has some of the best elements of Bebop: neat, sci-fi adventures, no-nonsense, a slightly apathetic hero working for hiring, a rental head (more or less), and a chase scene, all wrapped up in excellent film and noir wrappers. Watanabe's Tarantino style is fluent.
