Genius. My genius. I remember the exact second in 1994. I was sitting in a pub in Shropshire, England. I remember the exact place. "Bill Hicks is dying of cancer," the headline at the NME said. I felt someone thrust into my stomach. Buy this DVD. If you don't find something in one way or another, I'll be impressed. <br /> <br /> RIP Bill, I wish you were here.
