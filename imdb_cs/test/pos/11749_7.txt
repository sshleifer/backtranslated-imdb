"Love is a Many-Splendored Thing" takes place in Hong Kong in 1949-50, and tells the story of a relationship between Mark Elliott, a white American journalist and Han Suyin, half of a Chinese half-doctor. This mixed race love story was a pretty daring subject for the 1950s, and as he often did, Hollywood tried to ease the blow by throwing a white actress as a supposedly non-Caucasian woman who falls in love with a white man, something that would it was today considered politically incorrect, but it would be quite acceptable. (Remember, for example, that Ava Gardner came in "Show Boat" or Natalie Wood in "West Side Story") Setting the story in the British colony was also perhaps a way to explore racial issues in a way that would cause less controversy in America. Suyin is losing her job in a Hong Kong hospital because her British superiors are exempting her from having a white man she can't marry because his estranged wife doesn't give him a divorce. As has been the case in some cases, European colonialism has become a whipped cream for some American failure. Imagine a commotion that would loosen up with a similar film about a female doctor from a black or mixed race at a hospital in Alabama. In addition to racial issues, the film raises international policy issues, referring to both the Communist seizure of China and the outbreak of the Korean War. Han Suyin was a real man and a well-known author of the period; in fact, it tended to support Mao's communist regime, but here it is shown to be firmly anti-communist. However, it is not primarily a "problem" film about racism or politics, but rather a romance, a good example of what at that time would be known as a "female image". Such films, though mostly created by male directors, were mostly aimed at female audiences. From the point of view of women, they dealt with love and romance - often unhappy romance - and had a strong female character in the leading role. The genre often provided roles for actresses older than the standard heroines of the novels. Earlier examples were normally in monochrome mode, but in the fifties in general, like here, used lush, luxurious color. Although Chinese or Eurasian actresses would be more convincing in this role, Jennifer Jones, a very good job like Suyin. I found William Holden as Mark, somewhat non-charismatic, but it doesn't matter because Suyin is the dominant figure. She is much more than Mark and the film explores her family and professional life much more than he does. Although Jennifer was still remarkably beautiful, in the mid-thirties, she was somewhat older than most of the romantic heroines of the movies of that period. Holden was about the same age, unusually for the 1950s when "boy-meets-girl" often meant "older man meets girl". The film is not particularly deep, but it is well made with some attractive photos, especially Hong Kong itself, reflecting the growing trend in the 1950s for filming on the spot rather than in the studio. Hong Kong looked so beautiful; The view from the hill overlooking the city is of particular importance because this is where Suyin and Mark go for their romantic tasks. The overall mood is one of the captivating, doomed romantic, mood-enhanced atmospheric photography and musical scores, including one of the most memorable film themes ever written. 7/10
