Let me waste my time explaining how I approached this film. 1. I have eliminated trailers from my hand because the film looked like an incredible Aliens remake that I consider to be one of the weakest films in the Alien series. Stupidly continued to release the film after I heard about him positive things from people whose beliefs I totally missed a theater run. Then I became addicted to Farscape, in his 3rd or 4th season at the time, and found Pitch Black on the cable one night around the bed - so I said "oh why not, at least it has Claudia Black in it." I soon met Keith David and began to realize that Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser could act (why it should surprise me, I don't know). I was biased. Now I have been captivated for four years. I watched the movie for the 3rd or 4th time and I still love it. It is not an artistic film, not an independent film and its not entirely original, but where it cannot break many new foundations, it will succeed in providing interesting, realistic characters, hard action in a convincing but simple environment. conspiracy and continuous entertainment; absolutely beautiful environment with tastefully drawn special effects. Sounds good to be true? Don't take your word for it ... you see it yourself. The film also highlighted the charisma of the now somewhat iconoclastic Vin Diesel, representing Richard Riddick's character. Diesel would continue to star in the somewhat Riddick-ulous Chronicles (which I also enjoyed, even though I recognize his rather large drawbacks) and is now something of a legend. Diesel is so charismatic, so big and so interesting that it's easy to ignore the fact that he's not just a talented actor, but also smart. Check out the DVD version of Pitch Black, with audio comments you could just throw you away. The film is about the crew of an inter-system transport ship stranded on an unknown planet after a crash. landing in which their captain was killed. The new commander is inexperienced but clear and heroic (Mitchell), but is caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities - a bounty hunter with a mystery (Hauser) and a dangerous criminal who has been surgically altered to see in the dark (Diesel). Is it all? Of course not - the planet is inhabited and the inhabitants are hungry. As unoriginal and unlikely as it may be, Pitch Black is beautifully shot, well said and very well done. Don't expect to learn something and don't expect to have to think about a lot of things, but expect to have fun with this modern science fiction event.
