He grew up in the late '60s and' 70s and couldn't help but become a science fiction fan. With the US high-speed space program, sci-fi books, movies, TV shows and comics, my imagination was stimulated and my mind opened up to the possibilities that exist in the universe. Farscape is so unlike any other sci-fi show, but it has all the ingredients that made the show like Star Trek, Battlestar Gallatica, X-Files and Deep Space Nine personal favorites. One of Farscape's critic is that the casual viewer cannot just jump and watch one episode and understand what's going on. There have been other very successful shows that have used multiple episodes of storyline arches and elaborate characters. This is one of the show's spells for me. I don't need or want to have a story tied neatly at the end of every episode, as various Star Trek incarnations did. All in all, Farscape has amazing and witty characters and a running story that says that while people can be the least developed or advanced intelligent species in the universe, they still have unique qualities and abilities. Unfortunately, myopic people at the Sci-Fi Channel have canceled Farscape's 5th season. They stated that the cancellation was based on falling ratings. Just a few years ago it was their first-class series and critical favorite. It's a pity that all artists who help create this show will not be able to continue their love because of the fiscal problems of the channel / company itself, which made it possible in the first place. Hey, don't take the word for it, watch the show, watch the re-runes and think your own mind. Help save Farscape!
