This is another of those films that I remember being late to watch TV. This is a great movie and stands as a living proof that there were really realistic effects before CGI. This version, which is located on an isolated base in Antarctica, seems almost elevated where the original version (The Thing From Another World). American scientists have discovered a decimated Norwegian base a few miles away. Everyone is dead, and only half the charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to the crowd could offer some answers to what might have happened. The thing is brought back to the American base, and scientists realize too late that it is alive and deadly. Thaws thing out and is gone, not just killing someone and something that crosses its path, but also absorbing them, making themselves into anyone and whatever they want. The film then turns into brilliant paranoia. Everyone is suspicious, whoever can be the Thing, and no one can trust anyone. Gone is the strength and security that emerge when human beings are united in spite of their differences in fighting the monster. The group shatters and is afraid of regular rules. Who's the thing? Gore effects are absolutely amazing and chaotically realistic. I could do it without the dogs breaking up like a banana peel, but that's just a lover in me picky: kill all the people you want, but leave the cats and puppies alone. Sanity and reason fall apart quickly, because one person is taken over by an alien who changes. The strength of this film lies in his paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this version; The real threat lies within, and it is more frightening to see it or not. When it is forced out of hiding, it's anger huge and the results are terrible. This is one of the best Carpenters movies, right there with The Fog and Halloween. All actors give strong, realistic performances and special effects are so strong that they become their own main character. This movie has something for every horror lover. Don't miss it.
