I noted that the official IMDb review refers to Leland as a sociopath. I believe this diagnosis is obviously and deeply incorrect. It is a film about sadness and the ability of one particular teenage boy to see sadness in everyday life because he lies in waiting at every corner, before developing the lives he affects. Sociopathy is a person who cannot empathize with others, and who, while understanding the difference between right and wrong, does not care about this difference. Sociopatka is a subject that places itself at the center of the subject's universe, with total disregard for the impact that the actions of the subject have on its surroundings. One characteristic of sociopath is that the true sociopath lacks the ability to feel empathy - it lacks the ability to feel what others feel and does not correlate the changes in the moods of others that result from the actions of sociopaths with those actions. Sociopathy cannot feel the pain of others nor understand that the pain of others is the result of sociopathic own actions. Sociopathy is a person who is not completely formed. In the psychological and emotional make-up of a true sociopatha, there is no vital piece that makes sociopaths immune to "speaking therapy" and other treatments that involve human interaction and personal feelings. Sociopathy is devastating, even if the subject is treated and placed in a highly structured environment to reduce the damage that a sociopath can do to others. Many sociopaths function more or less normally and never increase the radar fluctuations of the criminal justice system, although they tend to leave a trace of emotional fragments in the wake. Leland Fitzgerald is not a sociopath. It is a person who is blessed (or cursed) with the ability to predict what he sees as the inevitable consequences and outcomes of human interactions. Leland literally sees the sadness written in the eyes and faces of the people around him because he slowly assimilates and internalizes the philosophy that life is about loss, and that people are slowly subject to the inevitable and relentless fact that for a better metaphor to disintegrate. People who fall in love and kiss and now pamper themselves become "pathetic" older couples. Electricity in the eyes of Leland's "mother" (a wealthy New York sociality who loves Leland and who invites him to his home to share with his family when he comes to New York alone and determined to stay in town at the age of 12 disappears when he on her last visit to New York, she explains that she has been told that her husband is constantly cheating on her, that she has a divorce, that she has a broken heart, everyone, and that such a loss is an inevitable part of adolescence. This scene - this explanation is too late - is crucial for understanding why Leland has committed a seemingly wild, meaningless crime (killing his ex-girlfriend's retarded younger brother) Leland knows what's in front of that little boy - life unattainable goals, that they only learn words that mean danger, they never know love for another human being, never feel More than any other character in this film, this little boy personifies everything Leland considers inevitable and scary about the world. Leland's act - killing this little boy - is an act of mercy committed by Leland because it was the only thing he could do in a world where action cannot change results. While a true sociopath knows that actions can and can change results, but doesn't care about the damage caused by others, Leland takes care of it. What most people perceive as a barbaric and frightening act is the only decent thing in Leland's eyes he can do to alleviate the suffering of only one person. It would be nice if we could imagine this is an explanation of Leland's actions - reassuring, but incomplete. Finally, "guilt" for Leland's actions lies elsewhere. As often, there are no easy explanations and no balm to cover the outraged soul. Why did Leland not learn something that most pessimistic people usually admit - that sometimes - only sometimes - DO people remain in love and relationships thrive and that even the saddest lives are transforming? There is no middleland for Leland, no inner core to retreat and regroup. There is only pain and sadness. One is tempted to blame his arrogant and thoroughly unpleasant father - a brilliant writer (played by Kevin Spacey) - for not being there at critical times during Leland's development, but since this man's criminal crime was a blessing . Br /> <br /> In the end, this viewer moved with great sadness. Why was Leland sentenced to see the world through the veil of pessimism and depression? Leland's character - presence, for example, when he repeatedly insists that no one was to blame for his girlfriend who broke up with him - it's both stoic and heart. Stoic, in being absolutely right, despite the heated testimonies of Leland's teacher. But heartbreaking, in that not so much understanding was born as despair. Leland's indifference to his fate is merely a reflection of the absolute certainty of his belief that nothing matters. Nothing he does can change his destiny. <br /> <br /> It's not sociopathic on the display. This is, if anything, its the polar opposite ......
