A baseball player, who is egotistical, is forced to continue his career in Japan, fights a culture that is strange to him, probably a humorous manager, an attractive Japanese woman, and his own professional and social uncertainties. There is a certain subtle charm that flows through Tom Selleck's performances. There is humor, sometimes gently undervalued, as in this movie, sometimes slapstick as in "People!", But there always seems to be some higher purpose involved. Throw in a self-confident individual trying to solve his or her personal problems while sticking firmly to "doing the right thing" and ending with the film both witty and provocative. The cast fits as a master team, and although they do not win a film or film for their efforts, they leave the audience feeling good (and ultimately the best result). You'll want to watch this movie more than once and every time Mr. Baseball hits a home run.
