This is one of those movies you don't want to end. The characters are rich as well woven tapestries. Colorful costumes, music and characters draw you in and tell the story of people who lived in the guesthouse during the decades of the Civil Rights and Vietnam War movement. The young man is impressed by the dynamic, great, cordial woman who runs the house and these are stories based on his experience. It was so well done. S. Epatha Merkerson is amazing as a nanny and brings so much life to this role. You want to be right between her boarders. I enjoyed this movie so much and bought a DVD.
