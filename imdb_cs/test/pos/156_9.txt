The old vampire comes from director Oldboy. Kang-ho Song stars as a priest who is mistakenly turned into a vampire while a deadly, mysterious virus is cured. His vampires and priesthoods are in complete conflict, but he is able to survive by robbing the hospital of a blood bank and unconscious patients who might not mind some of the drained blood. Because of his supposedly miraculous survival, he comes to the lives of the Ha-kyun Shin family. Shin has cancer and his mother believes that Song can cure her. Unfortunately, the vampire song raises his lust level to a height where he can't help but fall for young Shin's wife, OK-vin Kim. Kim is intensely interested in the world of vampire, and both become lovers. The film goes from here in strange ways, which I think he should experience for himself. What should be mentioned is the Chan-wook Park cinematography championship. My God, I have rarely seen such a rare visual artist at the height of my strength. The main drawback of the film is that it is a bit incoherent, especially at the beginning. The park is interested in telling its stories mostly in visuals, which can sometimes be difficult to follow. But when it works, man flies. The movie is also perversely cheerful. The final sequence, easily one of the best decades, is both heartbreaking and pleasantly ridiculous. OK-vin Kim should become the world star after this movie. She gives one of the best performances of the year.
