A good story about Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth), who dreams of being on Broadway, which means she has to leave the little theater where she works with Danny (Gene Kelly) and Genius (Phil Silvers). Rusty is in love with Danny. All three are good friends, and every Friday night they go to a local bar where they get oysters to look for a pearl (never eat). The story of the story provides many opportunities for songs and dance. The film has two questions that Rusty has to answer: Is the fame all that is cracked? and is less really more if you are happy? The answer to these questions is made by the film. The film also does a good job of showing talent that all three directors had. It's never a boring moment!
