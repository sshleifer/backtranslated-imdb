If you are a Jackass fan, Viva La Bam or CKY video then you know what you are. But this is one of those rare events where the sequel is better than the original! And man makes this movie a moderate low blow. But I mean it in a good way. It's the same type of mortally defying, crazy madness we all know and love and expect from Bam, Knoxville and Co. But this time he laughs even more than ever! With the crazy tolerance of Johnny Knoxvil for pain, the love of Bam Marger to persecute his friends / family and Steve-O's gross factor, you got a fucking funny movie. The stunt bar, parody, and Jackass crew's general chaos were raised. Jackass 3? Doubtful because it is almost impossible to improve perfection.
