The commentator in front of me said that this film was the worst thing about him as a child. But I have to say that I loved this movie when I was little and still love it today. The film has the best run theme of all-family togetherness. Given the time period in which the movie was released, I thought the movie was working well. I just wish I could find it somewhere else! Of all the films in the 1980s, I watched my child, from my favorites. I know I saw it at least once a week with my brother and mom. I would definitely recommend it to anyone I know - or I don't know. So if you find a copy of it I recommend watching it! It is wonderful and pleasing.
