I saw the movie when it first came out and never forgot it. My Uncle Antoine is much, much bigger than the sum of its parts. The film, loosely, is about pre-teen who is sent to live with a relative in a small town in Canada. There are adventures that seem more or less typical, but below them is a contemporary building. MUA has a quiet pace, but patience, reward comes. I believe the movie was sub-titled and as with all non-English speaking movies I saw it is well worth avoiding any dubbed version. Inevitably dubbed films reflect the attitudes of the new director and actors with the additional need for lip-syncing lines that are not entirely appropriate. The English-speaking Amarcord is travesty, for example, while the sub-titled version sings. My Uncle Antoine is worth finding time and watching him in French.
