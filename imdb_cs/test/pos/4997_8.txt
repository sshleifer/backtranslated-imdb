There was some harsh criticism of the Comanche Moon on IMDb. I think it's for three reasons. First, the purists are disappointed that the mini-series is not exactly the same as the book. Second, it's not as good as the original Lonesome Dove. Eventually, people like to complain about IMDb and the biggest movies in the world will have bad comments. I'd like to say that no movie will be as good as a book. That's it. Lonesome Dove was not as good as the novel he was based on. In addition, the film Lonesome Dove had some things out there crossed. This is simply the way it will be with film adaptation. So his futile argument looking at Comanche Moon. <br /> <br /> I agree it's not as good as the original Dove. But hey, there's nothing. I know people who manage their lives by learning the lessons they have learned from the dove. If I wanted to compare every book I read, the movie I watched and the TV I saw Lonesome Dove; I'd be constantly unhappy. It is a television miniseries based on prequel to Lonesome Dave (novel) and the sequel to Dead Man's Walk, and that's what you get. It's the best TV I've seen in years. It's fun set for Lonesome Dove. We learned about the history of the Rangers we knew and the love of Dove. Zahn does an amazing job of recreating Gus McCrae. Elizabeth Banks and Linda Forenelli (sp?) Also doing great work like creating characters that help fill rangers and newt in the past. <br /> <br /> If / when it comes again, I promise you'll enjoy it is more than some crumby reality show.
