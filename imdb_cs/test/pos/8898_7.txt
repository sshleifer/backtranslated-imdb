I'm not pretending to be a huge Asterix fan because I only saw one other film adaptation and only read two comics, but this was a great movie. I only saw the English version and found voices that fit perfectly with the characters - Brad Garret as Obelix and Sean Astin as Justforkix. The story itself was both interesting and really funny (especially opposing name names - all viking names end in "af", while all Gaulish names, of course, end in "ix"), with a little romance thrown into it (\ t the story, though it weighed the entire production of useless clichés. The Conspiracy is This - The Viking Chief, Timandahaf, is sick and tired of being attacked and then found by the villages. So, he is consulting his "wise man", a Cryptograph whose entire repertoire consists of old proverbs, and Cryptograph tells him that "fear lends the villagers wings". Taking it literally, Timandahaf believes that fear really allows people to fly, and sets out on an expedition to get the "Champion of Fear", an expedition that of course leads him to Gaul Village, where Asterix and Obelix live. The couple is currently very frustrated - Vitalstatistix's boss is a cowardly, pacifist nephew, Justforkix, has been entrusted to them to train him to be a man, and the boy does little to make any progress. When Justforkix unknowingly confesses to being "afraid of everything" in the presence of the mindless Viking Olaf, he is considered "Master of Fear" and is kidnapped. Asterix and Obelix are sent to Vitalstatistix to go to rescue Justforkix before his father returns to the village to bring his son home. Finally, it's a great movie with a few shortcomings in addition to clichés and occasionally, faulty dialogs. I really enjoyed it, despite the fact that it wasn't true for the comics.
