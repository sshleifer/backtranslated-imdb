I really liked this. (SPOILERS ??) It had a really good plot, the main female in this movie is really kewl. Despite the fact that she is the only one who was alive and her lover was dead, it seemed like a Ninja Scroll. Another kick ass movie. ;) <br /> <br /> Watch it in Japanese with captions. I don't know where the idiots have learned to speak English, but for some reason all dubs get F in translation techniques. Subtitles are correct. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> Quality: 7/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 9/10
