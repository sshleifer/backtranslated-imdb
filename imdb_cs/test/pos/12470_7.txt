Does this start a series (which hopefully will hold every week) of films that came out during my childhood? in this case, I managed to catch it. This was clearly intended to be the last word on the subject, which in principle has been hampered over the years; in its uncompromising quest for a seriously oriented approach (whose benchmark is that the protagonist never mentions a name that has been known all over the world all the time!), filmmakers are more likely to lose sight of the fact that it was primarily meant as entertainment ! As a result, will we definitely get a stable representation of events? with more care dedicated to careful reconstruction of the period than providing a functional thematic environment for your mythical jungle hero! Even so, did Christopher Lambert rise to fame? as well as another debutant, Andie McDowell, playing his love interest (named Jane, of course) ??? with the title role, which he handles in the circumstances. However, Ralph Richardson (to whom the film is dedicated, that is his swan-song) steals every scene he is in, like Tarzan's natural grandfather, who, despite obvious affection for his long-lost relatives, cannot force himself to forget the traditions in his understanding ; the hero, in fact, is much more comfortable interacting with primates (even if he returned after returning home to save his adoptive father from captivity). The film is otherwise very good at seeing (with Stanley Kubrick's cinematography, regular John Alcott, not less), contains a suitably grandiose score and remarkable makeup effects (Rick Baker)? and although basically disappointing as Tarzan's trip, he still retains significant value as a prestigious picture of his day.
