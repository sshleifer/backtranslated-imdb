A movie that tends to be buried under prejudice and prejudice - It's a remake! Doris Day is in it! He sings! - Hitchcock's second crack on The Man Who Knew Too Much is his most underrated film and probably a fully developed masterpiece. This is Doris Daily Movie in multiple ways. Not only does he give the best performance of his career, more than holding her against James Stewart, but the whole movie is gently structured around her character rather than his. This is a film in which music is both a motif and a fence. What is better than her favorite singer of her generation? Consider: Den McKenna has given up her career on stage to settle with her husband and raise her son. It seems that this is a mutual decision and does not seem unhappy. But look at how Stewart teases her in a horse-drawn stroller over concerns about Louis Bernard, which means he's jealous that Bernard didn't ask her questions about her career. This is a clearly repetitive joke between them - she reacts to 'har-de-har-har', which indicates familiarity with this gag, indicating that she has some latent resistance to her imprisonment and that they both recognize it. Br /> <br /> After their son has been kidnapped, Stewart insists on doping her before giving her the news. It is a cruel scene that both actors play brilliantly, demonstrating the power imbalance in their marriage - trying to control and cheat its reactions, basically using its expertise to suppress its marriage voice as well as its medical career. She suppressed her singing career. The effectiveness of this voice is demonstrated in the succession of Ambrose when it has to rule in its highly advanced purity and volume to connect with the female drunkards. act as a warning of what happens to her if she continues to repress her talent. At the Albert Hall, it's her need to scream, perform these formidable lungs that save a man's life, and in the embassy's final, it's her talent and reputation that allows them to find her son. In contrast, all Stewart's male activities are counterproductive - his visit to the taxidermist is a dead end, leaving in the church, while everyone else goes to Albert Hall and his efforts succeed in killing the murderer, relieving the police of potentially useful information. It is only when his activity is linked to the voice of his wife, to save Hank from the embassy, ​​that he actually succeeds in doing something useful. the opportunity to sing, 'Que Sera Sera' acts as the first musical device in a movie that predicts a nightmare that is about to engulf McKennas; "The future is not ours, so that we can see it". It also neatly paves the way for the final, in which a close bond mother and son share through the music will allow Doris to save the day. <br /> <br /> The most famous sequence in the film makes music a central feature - building an assassination attempt at Albert Hall. This lengthy sequence without words can be the only extraordinary thing Hitchcock devoted to film, the ultimate expression of his belief that movies should be narrated visually. We see people conversing in this sequence, but we never hear the word they say. We don't need - pictures say everything. It is also his most beautiful thrilling sequence, where the songs move slowly to where the music is built. The editing is incredibly tight, perfectly matched with music. There is no framework in place - nothing directly related to the assassination gives the viewer a sense of the environment, the geography in which it all takes place. It stops slowly, but the end is almost unbearable. When Jo screams, it's not just a relief for her, but for the audience. The sequence of Ambrose is funny and especially effective for anyone who has to serve in a particular place. Non-conformist Church. The embassy sequence seems a bit flat after Alberta Hall's apartment, which preceded the first observation, but for the second time it seems to be more effective, with a final walk at the shooting range, which really benefits from the wonderful use of background noise in the background. Rear Window ”. The score as a whole is subtle, allowing music from on-screen sources to be demonstrated effectively. Bernard Miles is an inconspicuous villain, a bit banal, but with a dry joke. He is overshadowed by Brenda de Banzie as his wife, who walks the delicate line between sinister and compassionate. All you have to do is look at the way he smokes a cigarette while her husband performs a murderer - her attitude is a pure gangster minor that embodies the exterior of central England but clearly has a soft side and possibly maternal feelings towards Hank. Stewart is excellent, although Hitchcock has really always tossed him as "Everyman", as the director's daughter seems to have, then confirms that Hitchcock had a cynical look at his audience. Stewart played a hypocritical intellectual who held a fascist ideology in Rope, a voyeur who mistreated his girlfriend in the back window and obsessive necrophil at Vertigo. Day is nothing less than phenomenal. Just look at her response to the message that her son has been kidnapped - she never exaggerated anything, but she doesn't even sell it. This is one of Hitchcock's most sensitive films. He'll never let us forget what's for McKennas; they feel that they are completely human from all his oral characters.
