I have to disagree with Leonard Maltin on this short animated film. She loves it and claimed it was cheerful. I liked it, but I didn't see any humor. He does not like hockey either, nor does he know anything about it and loved the story. I live right across the border from Canada, watching hockey for 50 years in both Buffalo and Buffalo. It was interesting and I know what would happen if you wore a Toronto-disaster jersey in Quebec! This is especially true in the period of the Canadians' fame. However, it does not make the story funny. Already in the 1950s, everyone in the Quebec provinces adored Montreal Canadians and their star player Maurice Richard, and they all wanted to be like him. When his mother orders a new sweater, she wears the Toronto Maple Leafs, so the baby doesn't want to be caught dead on her. When he finally does it and heads for the local ice rink, he gets out of the rest. your hockey friends. What's so fun about it? I saw the same thing happening with a baby in Boston who is a stubborn Red Sox and his mom gives him a Yankees shirt! Horrors! You couldn't wear it and vice versa. Maybe someone who doesn't even watch sports like Maltin seems to be strange and funny ... but it's a real life or any bit-time sports fan and his favorite team. It was an interesting story and absolutely credible, but nothing that made me laugh. The art was fun to look at all over, almost like looking at a long series of crayons created by a talented schoolboy. . The French Canadian accent was also good. This film was part of the DVD "Leonard Maltin's Animation Favorites from the National Film Board of Canada."
