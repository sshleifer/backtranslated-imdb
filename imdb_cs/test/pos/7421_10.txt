When the "Happy Ever After" run was over, his characters "Terry & June Fletcher" were revived for a longer run and the more popular sequel "Terry & June", although their last name was changed from Fletcher to Medford. Terry got a new job and as a result moved to Purley in June, where they ended up with all kinds of scratches - unwanted guests who came to see him in an unpleasant moment, the boss himself invites to dinner and Terry is trying to make her arm on DIY, but she always strains her. This IMDb user has marked this show as 'not clever' and 'never well written'. It was pretty smart, but it was all over. When it comes to "never well written" - some of the episodes were quite non-standard, I admit, but overall I found it very well written, very entertaining and very well functioning. It was a heartfelt heart slapstick, not unlike the later BBC sitcom 'Keep Your Look'. Eight different writers contributed to the nine series, giving the show enough scope. Terry Scott was a comic genius, as he proved in productions like 'Hugh & I', 'Carry On' movies and of course here! June Whitfield was also a comedy legend in her own right. <br /> <br /> I enjoy some modern shows - ie. "Still Game", "Catherine Tate Show", "Legit" and "Empty". I even enjoyed an "alternative comedy" - "Naked Video", "The Young Ones" and "The Comic Strip Presents", but I'm more inclined to enjoy a vintage comedy like this. Humor you don't have to think about is excellent when you feel down and want to rise. "Terry and June" were amazing for the record. Particular attention should be paid to the catchy melody that has captivated the show's mood!
