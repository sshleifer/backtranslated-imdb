One of the best! As a Civil War fan, I was very pleased with the first installment of the Northern and Southern Trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives extraordinary performance as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. Watching this fairy tale story turns into a time that will never forget, the objects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony and cruelty come to life. I was first introduced in this series when I was in grade eight. As a young guy, you'd think I wouldn't care about this civil war soap. To be honest, this story stole the hearts of everyone in my class, and that's just the first book. I bought a novel and I liked it and the differences and it was amazing. I'm 17 and still enjoy the story, the characters, the theme, and remember the time of the Civil War. As a film director of the future, I will always look forward to the North and South: Book One.
