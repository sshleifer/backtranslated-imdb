One funny thing to say from the top is not the biggest Seisun Suzuki fan. In fact, I saw quite a lot of his works (thanks to the retrospective film festival) and I found his films just like the Yakuza-driven for my tastes. So I went to Princess Raccoon, who was afraid of what I was going to see. Boy! I was eliminated! 'Raccoon' is a Suzuki musical attempt, using elements of Japanese opera mixed with many modern elements (both Audial and Visual), Raccoon is a delicacy from start to finish. Leading actor Joe Ogdari proves he's one of the hottest actors in Japan in this role. I have to admire that younger Japanese actors still have roles that take place in feudal Japan, when they show up in the Samurai jersey. The story itself is a bit confusing if you don't really watch it, but even if you don't, get ready for the treasures that Princess Raccoon has.
