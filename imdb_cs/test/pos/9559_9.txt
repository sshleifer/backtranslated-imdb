In an earlier commentary, I mentioned how much I enjoyed this movie - the second time. I don't think of that. Surprisingly, I can't find anyone else who likes it. <br /> <br /> My mother will see it, but a few friends told her "No way". My sister and her family saw it, and half of the theater came out. My wife's suggestion is that Australians see characters as normal, everyday Americans and that's why it's not funny. But, hey, most Americans think all Australians are like Crocodile Dundee, so it's nice to have a shoe on the other leg for a change.
