I saw this movie a few years ago and was literally swept away. So charming and so very romantic. David Duchovny and Mrs. Driver have chemistry that is so hot that you have to take off the layer of clothing. The supporting casting is 100% upper notch. Just watching Caroll O'Connor and Robert Loggia play each other is pure poetry. Bonnie Hunt and Jim Bellushi and a great team and some of the movies that are charming are on screen. Like Jim Belushi shouted at his kids to go to sleep "FOREVER!" or dancing in the kitchen. This film wanted me to know that people in my life were like that. Not to mention what a woman doesn't want David Duchovny for a friend?
