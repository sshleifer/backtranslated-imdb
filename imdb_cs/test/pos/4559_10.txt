As it turns out, Chris Farley and David Spade made only three movies together ("Coneheads", "Tommy Boy" and "Black Sheep"), but this was truly "Citizen of Kane" of their couples. Farley plays Thomas Callahan III., Confused heir to auto parts company. His father Big Tom (Brian Dennehy) hires moderate Richard Hayden (David Spade) to take care of him. Big Tom gets married to "Ten" (Bo Derek), so everything must be fine. After Big Tom suddenly dies, Tommy and Richard must try to sell half a million car parts to save the company from bankruptcy. Since then, the film is largely an apology for Chris Farley to do what he does best: do everything in his power. When this movie first appeared in theaters, I saw it with my grandfather. In the beginning he realized that Bo Derek and Rob Lowe were hiding something. But you can completely ignore it and simply brag about Chris Farley's antiques. There is nothing safe around the stomach and the hell has no fury like his happy attitude. The scene in which the cars burn and later the deer scene takes care of pure laughter. Chris Farley and David Spade were truly John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd of their era. It's a pleasure to always and again think of a "fat guy in a little coat".
