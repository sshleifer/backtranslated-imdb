Erollo Morris's amazing film, based on Stephen Hawking's "Short History of Time", documents the life and work of one of the greatest minds in the history of astronomy. He contributed more to science, despite his debilitating illness, ALS, than a capable body scientist could only dream of. The film begins by telling Hawking's childhood, and how he was a poor student that was clearly recognizable. He cleared his way through college and university, where he was diagnosed with a disease that would remove his body's normal function, but allowed him to continue his life and think perfectly. Morris discusses how brilliant Stephen's mind evolved from childhood to the present day, at one point his mother tells how - when she was pregnant - she prophetically bought the astronomical atlas to be read in the hospital. Hawking himself tells the timeline of his discoveries, while Morris talks to close friends and colleagues who were lucky to befriend a wonderful man. He says the first time he discovered the discovery that the universe is expanding just as the star would grow. We also know that stars eventually die and become what is now known as "black holes", if so, will the universe become too controversial, will it turn until we reach "big crunch"? as Hawking states. And when the universe begins to recede, will not time be "reversed"? When asked this question, I began to think that death may not be the end, maybe one day it will go back and our death will become our rebirth and our birth to our death. The universe is one great cycle, just like everything else in life. That's what Hawking tells us, everything in the universe is recycled. This is absolutely logical and can make your mind wonder in a million directions wondering. That's why I love this movie and why it MUST BE KNOW !!! 11 out of 10 ... Morris never stops toamaze!
