In this tense and character-driven romantic tragicomedy, we got an insight into the intertwined lives of four thirty Parisians. On Wednesday is Max Cassell's view. Stellar-looking Romeo, he falls head over heels for the beautiful alien Lisa (Bellucci). Encouraged by his best friend Lucien (Écoffey, in a subtle but effective performance), he wins his heart and lives happily to the end ... that is until repentance, neuroticism and obsessiveness Alice (versatile Romane Bohringer) becomes very involved in life and love of the other three. Rich land is amplified by curious chronological laughter and the film appears as a complicated jigsaw puzzle, eye-candy Paris postcard in the center of it all. The use of color will not go unnoticed, especially in the magnificent Lisa Apartment (probably the film title), where red and yellow cause fires of passion and lust. The Audience May Concern Max Max Really wears a heart on his sleeve and is constantly punished for irony and circumstance. On one unforgettable scene, our addressed lovers (agonistly separated by "choreographic" misunderstandings) are closely neglected in a random encounter that would surely unite them. They travel independently to the same destination: in the subway, in a taxi, virtually tête-à-tête. But it seems to be a destiny for them, and the audience is teasingly charming. The performances in this film are really what L'Appartement stands out for. I still can't understand why Vincent Cassell is not a big star outside France. It has a presence and variety in abundance. Monica Bellucci (Cassell's real husband at the time of writing) has recently found fame in the English-speaking film industry, but perhaps because of bad reasons - true, she is divinely beautiful, but behind it is a talented actress who can dominate the classic lead lady scene which many British and American actresses reject in favor of a "too gentle" approach. <br /> <br /> Everyone watch this movie! I doubt you will be disappointed. It is a breathtaking, satisfying, fun, sad, rich and informative lesson in artistic filmmaking.
