People were often uncomfortable with the "merchant of Venice", due to his anti-Semitic subject. Fortunately, this film avoids showing how anti-Semitism ruled in Europe in the 16th century instead. The story, of course, is that Antonio (Jeremy Irons) needs money to give Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) a hand at Portia (Lynn Collins). Earns money from Shylock's Jewish usurer (Al Pacino), who asks to pound Antonio's meat if he doesn't pay the loan. When Antonio can't repay the loan, Shylock is determined to get what he owes him. <br /> <br /> We would expect this cast to do a good job and not disappoint. It's another proof of what's great actor Al Pacino.
