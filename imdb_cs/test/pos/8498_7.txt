If somebody pulled me about 15 minutes into 'Ray' and asked what I thought about Jamie Foxx in the title role, it would be time to look blank. What does this (fictional) person actually talk about? It wasn't Jamie Foxx on the big screen. That was Ray Charles. This is one of the best performances of someone in recent years. Like the soundtrack, Jamie as Ray is a brilliant brilliant. The blind Genius soul (who revolutionized the Gospel with R&B) died during production. The film about his troubled life is good, not big. Taylor Hackford's direction and James L. White's screenplay follow a worn biotic outline. The super-talented young man fights against adversity, reaches grandeur and at the same time self-destroying, then rises from the gutter for a happy ending. The film shows Charles's defects (heroin abuse, chronic aging, permanent bastard-fatherhood), even if he sucks you with his beautiful music. Kerry Washington and Regina King play major women in Ray's life, one of his long-standing wife and the second his longtime mistress. Both actresses correspond to Foxx per step. What leads him to another level is his deep understanding and unusual personification of a great musician. All cast is effective, particularly Sharon Warren as his stubborn mother and Curtis Armstrong as music manager. Hackford's stars are likely to be rewarded with trophies, and even better, more major roles. I wasn't a Ray Charles fan before Ray. The movie seems to have missed a lot (just like any biopics), but this image works like an old-fashioned crowd of pleasure and a dark investigation into a brilliant / troubled man. For those who whine that Foxx doesn't actually sing (as if it somehow reduces his performance), go on a trip. Like Mr. Charles, no mere actor can sing. You can't have everything. What a talented star does in this picture is about as close to everything as we'll see for a while.
