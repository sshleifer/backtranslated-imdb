I should no longer be surprised when critics lack the most obvious things in art because they are human beings, and the vast majority of human beings are by nature lazy. This means that the simplistic notion that Ingmar Bergman's great film, Shame (or Skammen) is a mere anti-war film, causes considerable damage to the reputation of this very high-definition movie. Compared to his more film-showoffs, the predecessors, Persona and Wolf Hour, Shame is a seemingly more classic movie in terms of story. But the keyword is seemingly, because when he lacks bravura pop psychologizing Persona and gaudy horror shows from the Wolf Clock, it is one of the best films about war, not as an anti-war movie, or a pro-war movie. As such, it must rank with Wild Strawberries as one of its biggest films, as well as one of its best scenarios, if not the best. Although it is seemingly more psychologically outward than films that preceded it, it actually says much more realistic things about the human psyche and the will to survive. It features Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman Jan and Eva Rosenberg (perhaps a nod to the infamous American spies many European intellectuals felt innocent), two musicians who played for the local Philharmonic Orchestra before the outbreak of war, and they retreated to live on a small scale land on the island, content to work in a greenhouse. The country they live in is unnamed, as is the island they live on, although the film was made on the small island of Bergöm on the island of Farö, near the northern end of the Swedish island of Göttland. Their nation seems to have been in a war with the invading country for several years, or perhaps engaging in a civil war with insurgents from another province. All this is deliberately foggy because this war is to symbolize all wars. This is reinforced as the film begins with multiple war quotes on the screen, as credits roll. These include quotations from Hitler to Vietnam era US military figures. After the early morning scenes that capture the prosaic nature of their country life, and then the arrival of war, where even the old men are taken, the air raid devastates the Rosenbergs because the enemy planes fly overhead, bomb crashes, and what appears to be chemical. Guns Agent Orange as Nature. One aircraft is hit and the skydiver jumps up and ends up in a tree. Jan, who starts from the film as a torturous coward, refuses to go and help, so Eva goes alone. Jan joins her and finds out the pilot was shot. It seems to be really part of the invading force, or maybe rebellious. A bunch of government soldiers will soon stop at their home and ask for a dead pilot, then advise the couples to leave their home as the Invaders are near. there are film misinterpretations on the micro level, such as that of Bergman scholar Marc Gervais, who provides film commentary on the DVD movie. Like many other critics, he claims that Jacobi is Quisling, who collaborated with Invaders. But this is clearly and demonstrably wrong because Jacobi is with the original fascist government. As evidence, first, Invaders are repelled after they attack Rosenbergs land and shoot their agitprop interview. We know this because the government, which later questions them from the false conversation, and the words put into the mouth of Eva, sees the film as the alleged evidence of their betrayal, and Jacobi clearly cooperates with them, the fascist big brother. Second, Jacobi is in charge of deciding which of the monks is sent to concentration camps, working with Invaders, and the Rosenbergs are again among those who are spared. Third, in his seduction of Eva, Jacobi tells her his son is on vacation from the army, and clearly, if he was Invader, he would not talk so happily to his son to serve the state. Also, rebel forces are not official armies and do not grant official holidays. Finally, Philip is clearly with insurgents, or Invaders, an organization, and why would he kill a colleague? That Gervais and other critics mistakenly misinterpret and omit such a key, and the apparent point of this film questions their ability to recognize all aspects of Bergman's films. It's a great and great movie and very tall in Berman's canon, but it's disappointing to read how few critics and viewers really understood his complex message, instead choosing a cheap, lazy and easy statement about their being. only an anti-war and relatively simple film compared to his two predecessors. And this is a real shame of shame in the long run.
