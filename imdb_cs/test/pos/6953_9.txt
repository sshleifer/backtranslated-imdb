Where the Flow North River is, the story of the struggle of two people who live their own lives in the face of "progress" and development is a well-told story. In addition to enjoying the movie as a fun, I also learned about life in rural New England quite late, in the late 1920s. The camera captured the raw beauty of northern Vermont and created the scene while the music brought the film to life. Very well done for the low-budget, locally-produced film. I found out that Michael J. Fox's character is the weakest in the movie, but Rip Torn and the Tantoo Cardinal turn in two of the best performances I've seen for a long time. I was sad that this year she didn't get a nod as the best actress (I suppose the movie was too "little" to be considered).
