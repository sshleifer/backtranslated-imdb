"Shadows" is often recognized as a film that was a breakthrough for the American independent cinema. Whether it is true or not, it is an undeniably important film whose influence can be traced back to today's Sundance feed. Here is a film that deals with controversial topics of the day (especially racism), and refuses to give light answers and show them in a manipulative way. She also deals with sex honestly that Hollywood wouldn't even say until "The Graduate". Is it still a question of whether it is as powerful today as it was when it was originally released? The answer is yes. While many important movies are hard to watch and date today, "Shadows" retain every ounce of emotional resonance when viewed now. It deals with racism as a personal problem and not a political one, so it is still relevant. In addition, it works as a great time capsule that captures the 1950s and the New York generation with an art scene that has no other film. It is irregular at the technical level. Cassavetes has not yet gained full confidence as the director and jerky editing reflects the low budget of the movie. But the story of the film is still powerful. In addition, the acting is phenomenal due to the inexperience of the cast and the improvisational nature. All around, actors create realistic characters that remain compassionate despite their often less than admirable actions. "Shadows" is absolutely mandatory for viewing movie enthusiasts. (9/10)
