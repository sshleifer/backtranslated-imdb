Somehow, CHANGI has lost MY BROTHER JACK at the AFI Awards. The second, high-quality adaptation of George Johnston's immortal novel was excellent - but in my opinion he's not as good as CHANGI. I have heard that many CHANGI critics have rejected as irrelevant, unimportant, historically inaccurate, or even disrespectful. Who and where are these critics? CHANGI is excellent. More than it. Brilliant. It shouldn't be a documentary - I can definitely forgive the real survivors of Changi (or actually all the surviving prisoners of war) that they are disappointed with production - but the rest of us, CHANGI, represents a remarkable power of a friend in times of extreme adversity. It includes a part of Australian culture that gradually shrinks as times become easier and less demanding, but we should never forget: Australians have been respected around Gallipoli and WW2 worldwide for their duel and sense of humor. Rating: 96/100. See also: GALLIPOLI; PARADISE ROAD; LAST BULLET; SUGAR PRODUCT.
