Dead places and superficial "postcards from Africa" ​​just about the funeral of any interest I might have read Isak Dinesen. So when my brother bought me "Babett's feast" and knew he was based on Dinesen's story, I didn't exactly go to the VCR. But as the titles rolled, it was clear that this was not an ordinary movie. Jutland (where set) is not Africa; The cool fog that collects on camera shots is not inviting. Winter, forbidding the sea; heavy, gray clouds; the pale, icy green cliffs - they translate into difficulties that show up on the faces over which director Gabriel Axel leans. The most serious is Bodil Kjer as Philippa; amid countless merits of the film, the most memorable is the face. It becomes a map that admires her father's precious apostolate before us; as a maze of long overlooked fjords, where the complications of perseverance and devotion to her corps hang like shining coats. Gathering that it is Dinesen's view of how the world is drawn inexplicably to Christian devotion when Philippa is rejected by her only serious suitor (because he fears that he never measures to the rules and severities of her little religious handles), and he returns to find her mistress whom he considers the greatest cook on the continent. It is also her point that Christ responds to the doubts and regrets of those who give up mundane success (sister Philippy Martina reprises the guest baritone (Jean-Philippe Lafont, whose cheerfulness creates uplifting counterpoint to the diffusion of the spirit that surrounds his discovery). to become an opera star, the title character leaves France and an enviable reputation and seeks a sanctuary as a servant of two sperter sisters) to watch artistic triumphs only for God and those closest to him. But it is Axel who weaves together the lives of these people with the richness of Martin and Babette Hersant's table and influences what you never expect from a film about sacrifice, faith and religious beliefs. What distinguishes this film from other religious films is its humorous humor. "Babett's Feast", that is, the banquet itself - the posthumous memory of the 100th birthday of the minister - is a beautifully controlled clash of emotions that brings the comic moments of a group of actors who are unparalleled in their subtleties. It is this agile comedy that enriches the festive feelings of closing. Together they do seldom do pious movies. He leaves the believer enthusiastic and unexpectedly decisive and humble.
