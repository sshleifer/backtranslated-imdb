Some time ago I saw it when HBO was pointing it out and from what I saw it looked like a good movie. So today I am at Blockbuster and I see it there with DVD and decide what the hell it is. So I rent it. After watching him, I was shocked at how good it was. Everything in it was so amazing. Stories, Actors, Dark Humor, MUSIC !!! Don't get me to start the music in this movie. PT Andderson is one of the greats. Definitely the best thing to do, because Quentin Tarantino (God). After I finished my first viewing, I watched it again with Anderson's commentary (I was surprised at how great he was.) <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in movies should watch this movie if not yet. Apparently Anderson is a movie lover. In the film he tears so many other directors tecniques. Such as a pool scene with a camera that follows a girl with water. Apparently he broke out of "I Am Cuba." But I don't have any beef I am with it. The movie is very decent with his ripoff. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who can deal with some movie content (porno.) <br /> <br /> 10/10
