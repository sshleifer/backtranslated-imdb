Haunted demons "Gentlemen" capture the voice of Sunnydale residents to steal human hearts without screams. Giles found that, in accordance with the legend, if a lady screams, the animals will be destroyed, but Buffy and her friends, including Riley, must fight the monsters without speaking. "Hush" is certainly the best Buffy fourth season episode to this point. I really enjoyed having a lot of humor and funny situations. Spike is cheerful, the romance between Xander and Anya is fine, but I loved the "intense" dialogue between Buffy and Riley. The Gothic scenario of the last battle against "The Lords" resembles the "Dark City" environment. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "SilÃªncio" ("Silence")
