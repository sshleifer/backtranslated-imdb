From the perspective of the hectic, contemporary world we live in, the so-called "good old days" always seem to be much calmer and innocent; an idyllic era with only memories and shadows on the silver screen, like "Christmas in Connecticut", a warm and cute film by director Peter Godfrey. Barbara Stanwyck performs as Elizabeth Lane, a popular columnist for Martha Stewart magazine, who writes about life on her beloved farm in Connecticut, always with the latest recipe in the middle of the story. One of her biggest fans is Alexander Yardley, played by Sidney Greenstreet, a magazine publisher for which she writes. Yardley never visited her farm and, in response to the idea she had given him in a letter to Sister Mary (Joyce Compton), decided to spend an old-fashioned Christmas with Elizabeth, her husband and child, and as a special guest, certain Mr. Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor he just recovered from spending fifteen days at sea on a raft after his ship was torpedoed. Of course, Elizabeth can't refuse her boss, but there are problems; Last but not least, it has the fact that it has no farm and writes a post from the comfort of a high-rise house. This is for the precarious situation for her as well as her editor, Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne), as one thing Mr. Yardley demands from his employees is absolute honesty. What follows is a charming and beautifully romantic comedy that sends the audience back to seemingly easier time and space to share the Christmas past, where a warm fireplace, good food and kindness prevail. Barbara Stanwyck is absolutely shimmering like Elizabeth, with a smile and presence warmer than any of the farthest fireplaces she can provide, and utterly convincing as a city girl totally out of her element on the farm. Morgan also thrives well as a somewhat naive sailor whose trust in his colleague is admirable. Even when there are scams around him, he is the kind of person you know will somehow land on his feet, and eventually it is Elizabeth that you really feel. But one of the real pleasures of this movie is Sidney Greenstreet. His Yardley has a grumpy exterior, but below you know he is a man with a heart as big as Texas. It is a straightforward, honest view and it is a pleasure to watch it work; the most memorable scenes in the film belong to him. The supporting cast includes Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), amazing Unu O'Connor (Norah), Frank Jenks (Sinkewicz) and Dick Elliott (Judge). Crothers). Feeling a good movie that plays especially well during the Christmas season (although it would work anytime of the year), "Christmas in Connecticut" is an unforgettable movie that is never taken too seriously, is uplifting and leaves you with a warm place in your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world a good place. It's a real classic you don't want to miss. I rate this 10/10 10/10. <br /> <br />
