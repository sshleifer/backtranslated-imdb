My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released. The controversy surrounding the original release (teen nudity, physical intimacy, and reluctant pregnancy) were subjects that never touched our view of the film. We were close to the same age as Paul and Michelle, and we had many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to be trapped in simplistic (occasional) play and in oblique (occasional) emotional twists. This film has spoken to us that he could never have an adult love story. I still remember sitting in the cinema with my girlfriend and holding her hand while she was crying during the tragic (albiet syrupy) closing scenes.
