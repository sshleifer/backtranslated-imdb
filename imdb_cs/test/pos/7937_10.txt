There is a version of "Nevsky" that is shown with a live symphony orchestra, chorus, soloist and film. If this is EVER done during one day's journey you see "Nevsky" like this. The Oklahoma City Philharmonic has done it with the OKC Canterbury Choir (one of the best anywhere) a few years ago. I think I screamed the whole thing, it was one of the most sensitive film experiences of my life. Right now I'm listening to "Nevsky" on the radio and it still tears me up. There are movies that I love, and I love classical music pieces, but there is no combination I would think is approaching the impact of "Nevsky" in real time.
