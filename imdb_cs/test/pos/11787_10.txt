After my daughter was born in 1983, I had to lose weight. I tried 20 minutes of exercise and I was addicted. I lost about 50 pounds. it was the hardest thing I've ever lost in my life. I can't believe this show is forgotten. it would be a blessing to start a cable channel exclusively for exercise and include a 20-minute training session. I think it was the best exercise video ever made. I wish I could buy it somewhere and somewhere. the routine was easy to learn and you sweated into it. The trainings they have today are too complicated and too hard to learn. Do your best to get this video back into circulation. I pray that it will be a blessing to all who see and use it.
