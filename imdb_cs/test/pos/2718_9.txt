This is how I interpreted the movie: First Things First. There was no single scene in the movie where you saw the wrong (Taylor) torture or nailing Ben's hands to the wall. The same cannot be said about girls. Eventually, he disappears with Taylor as he walks. Looks like the message was "Wasn't Taylor". And the whole film was a product of Ben's imagination. Also, during the tormenting moments, there was no scene in which any of the gals came into the same frame as Ben. It was Taylor all along. But actually he was Taylor Ben. If it were two different people, then why wasn't there a scene that would both show in one frame during terrible times? But of course, before both of you see both of them and that's just Ben's imagination at work. Also, when Ben was out of jail, the text on the screen clearly says that Ben's story was unrealistic and there was no place to explain it (read mine, cars, etc.) Although Liz Hunter left Kristy and came back to find Ben, she wouldn't find him. Why??? Because Ben (Taylor) was looking for girls. Instead, Kristy has all the time in the world to look at Taylor's (Ben) webcam, photos, and so on. Taylor was Ben. So my conclusion is that Ben was schizophrenic and the movie you see him and Taylor in one shot was nothing more than the imagination of his imagination. Otherwise, if Taylor really were, they should find him with all the detailed explanations from Ben.
