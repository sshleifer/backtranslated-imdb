Being a Cornish and brought up with a history of tin mining, this film is quite special to me. Filmed in and around Cornwall, it captures the story of two of your children imprisoned with a group of miners. "Haunters" in the title refers to "Spriggins" - the ghosts of the miners in the mine who say they bring evil to all who are there. The events take place with an American who wants to invest in local tin mining, but when young local boy Josh is plagued by watching a young boy's spirit, he and his American "girlfriend" went to decipher the secrets behind his death, culminating in the rescue of himself and several miners from almost certain deaths when a new shaft is opened and Spiggins saves them. <br /> <br /> Top-of-the-line film, though low in budget and short, but worth a look if you're from Cornwall and / or tin mining!
