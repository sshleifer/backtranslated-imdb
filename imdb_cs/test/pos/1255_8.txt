When I saw the first trailer for this movie, I was wondering what angle it would be. After all, the plot to return from childhood to contemporary sheets opens up many possibilities. However, Bruce Willis has an outstanding role in the role he has received. I was surprised to see how well he could act in this part. This is also a good career step, as many others have said, but after I saw it, I agree. This film is mainly about the memory of the child you used to be and the recognition that you are not the adult you planned. It's a wonderful story and a stimulating story that thinks all of us. We usually despise in the films "What if ...". For example, Waterworld tried to answer the question "What if the world should be covered with water and ...?" But truthfully, no one cared. But this film affects everyone in the theater. It is true that young children may not fully understand the idea of ​​growing up and having all your dreams blown away, but leaving a big impact on adults and parents of these children. This movie is definitely worth seeing. Although it will be a better second time because you will not think so much (about how the boy got there and why and all those things) just relax and have fun. And take something with you when you leave the cinema. Take the piece of your childhood you forgot and enjoy.
