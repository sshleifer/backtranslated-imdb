any movie that has a series of dialogues that goes something like that ... "Judy's getting ready for her date, Butthole!" must be good! I found it unrated on the DVD, unadjusted and was pleasantly surprised that a lot of hard work was put into making this movie. Actually, I enjoyed it more and more that I saw many 80s. A great addition to my movie collection. The buildup was great, setting the fear for the rest of the movie. He loved GORE and T&A. I never thought the eyeballs looked like cracking ulcers, the color of the eye drop was rough! I'm thinking that "Rog" looked like Tiger Woods, but blacker, someone agrees?
