He just saw this movie 2 days ago. A very interesting look at people and our world in the world of wine. I have no particular interest in wine, yet I have found it very instructive. The director gave me the impression that he had the ability to show people how they are. While exhibiting many things that are under the surface, he cannot stand up and leave it for the viewer. It shows a lot of sympathy for people (and dogs) and sympathy and lets people tell their story while revealing what they don't want to say. <br /> <br /> The film shows where our world will be the benefits and the high price we pay. It's a film about love for wine and love to be big, personal and global, character and formula. The real stars of the people for me are the elderly winemakers with a disillusioned look on the world and on themselves. <br /> <br /> Taking hectic camera movements and adjustments takes time, but it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
