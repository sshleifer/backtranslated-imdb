The French are not known as great film producers. Although their Amelia reaches high points at the Oscars. Asterix et Obelix is ​​a very different film of what I am used to from French. It's a great movie especially for kids. The only thing that boddert was to me was that it was spoken in French and subtiteld. Normally, I don't need to read subtitles with English-speaking films (here in the Netherlands). But with the French language you have to read to understand. The story he owns is just great with Obelix, who doesn't remember him from his own fat, but also nice details especially in names like Brucewillix and Malcomix. You all know the comic book story and this film shows all the snapshots of the picture. Every thing in it, from the braking of Sfinx's nose to the pirate red beard, they lose three more ships. I'd say a great movie for a weekend with kids.
