I have to admit that when I saw a preview of "Inglorious Basterds", I had great expectations. THIS FILM DID NOT Disappoint is not <br /> <br /> Rarely, when I watch a movie with such high expectations, I have met or exceeded these expectations; This movie did it and more. I rarely applauded at the end of the movie, that's me and everyone else in the theater. I have to say, I'm a little biased towards Quentin, I grew up with "Pulp Fiction." I watched it when I was 12 and it's still my favorite and most influential movie. However, since then Quentin has not really lived until his billing. His style was a bit predictable instead of confidential, the quality wasn't there honestly (I've never seen Jackie Brown and then Grindhouse is here). That's up to "Inglorious Basterds." What Quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre, the spaghetti feeling that only Tarantino or Sergio Leone could do, but when he saw Leone dead, Tarantino was a self-appointed guy on this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Let's take a look at a movie I won't give. Writing was in place, a beautiful transition between using not one, but four different languages ​​in this film. Not to mention, this film was created in the classic Tarantino mold, a great scene of rich meaningful dialogue and a sudden shocking action. <br /> <br /> Acting was excellent !! Christopher Waltz deserves an Oscar, really. I'm not saying this often, but honestly one should get one for this movie, he spoke every language in this movie, and set off with such a wonderful touch and poise. He stole the show in a movie that was amazingly impressive. I have no problem building this movie because this movie is the best movie I've seen all year and probably next year. Frankly, the more I think about it, this movie can burst my best movies of all time and it's Quentin's best movie from Pulp Fiction. Take it from me, watch the movie. I loved not doing this movie enough justice. I watched him yesterday and I'm still blown away. I thank Quentin from the bottom of my heart for making this movie. You're up again, buddy. I can't say enough for "Inglorious Basterds!"
