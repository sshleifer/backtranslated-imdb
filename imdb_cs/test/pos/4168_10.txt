The name of my report largely covers my assessment. That's what Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was 5 years older for someone. Even though I missed the little wave of pop culture, I hugged the toy line and t.v. a series that was mighty Max with both arms. <br /> <br /> Want to know how it was? I went like a mighty Max on Halloween. <br /> <br /> Thank God for the Internet. Thanks to Demonoid, I saw this great show last week for more than a decade since my childhood. Now I watched it because I was blown away by recognizing Rob Paulson Animaniacs, and I'm also a loving celebrity humor in "Tar Wars". 4 minutes, and already mentioned, by name: Clint Eastwood, Governor Arnold, Dustin Hoffman, John Wayne, And Ace Ventura. Damn Yes. Damn, this is just about writing this that I realized there's no way in hell I can give this series something less than a perfect score. Any imperfections were lost in the mist of time. This is my childhood. That's amazing. This is powerful.
