This extraordinarily intimate story of unsuccessful romance between two married women tied to their traditions, in 1962 in Hong Kong (in turbulent times as we know), can remember the essence of old Hollywood in a lush color scene, evoking yet limited sensuality ( Unlike the necessary sexuality and occasional nude scenes that have become part of the romance norm of the film), and the use of facial expressions that suggest subtle changes in mood or communication. It is not difficult to see the influence of Marguerite Duras here, because he is known for his minimalism in narration and also the description of a powerful drama using the art of verbal and nonverbal conversation between two characters with a strong bond as well as the use of repertoire. - Scenes that could eventually take place in both characters' lives. From Hiroshima MON AMOUR to MODERATO CANTABILE is here since we enter the cramped rooms of Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs. Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung), the last pens that are heavily visible on the last scenes that explain the intensity, that she feels she recalls the opportunity that was lost in re-affirming this relationship. The story even recalls something that Duras wrote: Mr. Chow and Mrs. Su Li-zhen, neighbors in an apartment apartment, while both are quite successful professionals, are beginning to emerge in the most banal ways their husbands are they cheat, and appear naturally, it's one with another. The question is whether they should act on what they feel about each other or that they would not be like their partners? Each scene plays with the idea that they give up each other at any moment, and at one point it is suggested that they eventually do, even if they are as distracting as it is in the camera when they tell us in detail about their encounters (which appear to be on a daily basis) As you can see from the frequent changes of Cheung's dress, we never see it. And just as if neither of their husbands see their own love story without seeing them attract, they make the final division even bitter, because at any moment we want something to happen - some catalyst - and the only thing that comes up is when Leung tells her that she loves her, followed by his quietly brutal revelation that she will never leave her husband, which means neither. It also gives us insight into what culture and timing can do: from the western point of view, their romance could be completed in a stronger, lasting relationship, especially in the 1960s, but as Hong Kong is, cultural values ​​are significantly different. The performances here are at a high level: it is very easy to play a love affair, but to play a suppressed, platonic relationship that is full of desire is barely designed, it is hard and makes all sensuality more cerebral than tactile or visual. Cheung and Leung smolder, and their burnt chemistry persists long after the credits have returned.
