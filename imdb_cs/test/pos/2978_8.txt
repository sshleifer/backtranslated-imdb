This film grabbed me right from the start, looking at a sweet-looking teen girl who visits the grave itself. she was naively unaware of the theft of the car and the prostitution that was happening around her. The whole film is a beautiful, dreamy, romantic collection of young love scenes, holding hands, living in the country, wild horses, fields of wild flowers, sunsets, wine toasts, evenings by fire, entertainment and entertainment. general innocence, all set to Elton John's romantic music. It's magical. Somehow I missed seeing this movie when I grew up. I'm sure he would leave a strong impression on me if I saw it then. I remember the radio commercial for the film in 1971 when I talked about how it was a special movie with Elton John's music, and choral songs "Friends" playing in advertising ("Makin's friends in the world who see ...") , but at that time I never heard anything else about it and I never saw it until I borrowed it 35 years later from a video store. At that time it was modified, censored, and all kinds of unhappy people with angry political agendas used all kinds of ugly words to describe the film. What can I say? The world has gone crazy since then. The story is that a 14-year-old girl is forced to move with her cousin in Paris after her two parents die. (It was their tomb she attended in the opening scene.) One day, when she visits the zoo itself, she meets a 15-year-old boy, hits him and agrees to meet the next day. The next day, when they were riding together, the boy accidentally drives his car into the lake in a frightening solo car crash. It was his father's car, he can't carry to come home to face his father's anger, so two teenagers start living together in the French countryside, with a common background that both of them both hated at home. Settling into an uninhabited cottage, the boy takes special work to support, their supposed friendship turns into romance, the girl gets pregnant and has a baby at home. All the while, the boy's father is trying to find his missing son. On the 1-year anniversary of a paired flight, the police finally find a boy's employer by personal investigation and say they'll see the boy next morning when he comes to work. The next morning the boy is shown leaving his cottage to go to work, saying sweet farewell to his girlfriend / wife, and happily making cartwheels as the scene freezes on his girlfriend waving goodbye. At least that's how I saw the video version. It is an unexpected, albeit well timed end, probably showing the last moments of bliss before a boy is taken back to his parents' house and his happy life with his wife and child is broken. How beautiful the story and pictures are, the storyline is terribly unrealistic and highly processed. I think it is better to enjoy the film as a fantasy of fantastic young people and to go further into the analysis because all logic and credibility are falling apart when the story is explored more deeply. Why should a fully furnished and stored hut be left unattended with unlocked and unobserved doors throughout the year? What did they plan when the owners returned? Why should a girl trust a car thief to get pregnant? Didn't they think it was unethical to use other people's homes and food? How could they ever hope to need dental care or other emergency medical care when they live outside the company? How could a boy have a car crash on a country road without collision and no other cars around? Where are places anywhere near civilization where wild horses run for free? How come a teenage man wouldn't have sex as the primary thing in mind when he took a girl to the zoo? (Elton John's song lyrics just don't fit.) Why would they take off their clothes when they sleep outside at night when it's cold? And so on. Wild horse scenes are created to appeal to girls, as well as the unrealistic theme of "friendship before romance" and all scenes with washing and tickling with predictable results, running through flower fields to each other, haze filters, scenes shot through flowers in foreground, baby duck , and so on. It works, but it's definitely fancy. Yet it is a film about youth and freedom, and this ideal has not changed since the 1970s. Today, young people are still seen as property or lost pets, instead of being treated as mature human beings who have the same needs of romantic love and freedom as the adult world. freedom. Therefore, the message is universal. It is clear why the sequel would not work: this story is about a magical, year-round delay from the real world. Such a situation could never be prolonged indefinitely, assuming that it could come first, and the real life story would then lack the magical appeal of such an unreal state of existence. I really hope that no teenager took the film seriously to try such a stupid piece. Likewise, I hope that the teenagers who were stunned by this film in the 1970s learned something about it, and have since attempted to make such a magical world a viable reality for others instead of maintaining a variety of hate and repression on society, especially on own children.
