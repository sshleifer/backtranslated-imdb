The Twins Effect - Chinese Action / Comedy - (Charlene Choi, Gillian Chung) <br /> <br /> This vampire action comedy is one of my favorite things to have a lot of fun throughout the film. Characters are memorable and contribute countless classic scenes. Charlene and Gillian are naturally cute, charismatic and funny. This movie was my first exposure to them, and all I wanted to do was get through the TV screen and give them a really big HUG. The remaining cast played well in their supporting roles, including Jackie Chan, Karen Mok, "Duke", Josie Ho, Edison Chen, Anthony Wong, and vampire evil boys (one of them looks Will Ferrell familiar). Even the nasty terrible Ekin Cheng was good at this. Of course, good characters are important because they avoid the feeling of boredom by keeping things interesting between action sequences. And when we talk about action, this movie has a lot. More importantly, quality choreography is emphasized. One aspect that has helped in this regard is the weapon of the protagonists? sword with pull-out rope with spear. This weapon itself opened up a series of movements that would otherwise be impossible. Josie Ho and Gillian Chung, in particular, do some bad aerial maneuvers using these devices. <br /> <br /> In addition, the fencing is excellent, and is highlighted by two large swords fighting? one takes place during the opening sequence of the train station and the other takes place in the final of the church. In fact, the maneuvering blades that appear in this film give some other highly overrated fan favorites a big shame and I really apologize to those who would quote the horribly choreographic waste seen in Ashes of Time, Storm Riders or Man Called. A hero with well-planned, precisely executed sequences seen in The Twins Effect. It's not even close. I can't understand why this film gets so much criticism. I'm sure these stubborn apologists for the "golden age" in Hong Kong will hate it because they don't fit into their narrow-minded view of what Hong Kong should be. We should learn from the fall of John Woo - one trick pony who has never learned to invent himself again. We don't need another clone. We need something else. The twin effect is one of the good examples. This film was so good that he actually made me disappointed with other Chinese films with the same actors and actresses. This is especially true for Ekin Cheng, whose other films almost always suck? and yes, this includes obscenely overrated and exploitative wuxia crap mentioned in the previous paragraph. Even the twins have never been able to balance the value of this film when both were the main actresses in the film, although they were able to hit a few good movies when one or the other takes a leading role (eg, Beyond Our Ken, Good Times Bed Times, House of Fury ) or when one or both are in support roles (eg, Truth Color, New Police Story, Just One Look). The twin effect 2 should be a direct continuation instead of a family fantasy. I still want to see Charlene and Gillian team and kick some ass in another movie, but the fact is that The Twins Effect will hit all the war, optimize their charisma and avoid descent into agitation (as in Protégé de la Rose Noire). <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie has everything you need to have fun. And can I remind the reader that it is this? ZÁBAVA ?? who judges the size of a film, more than artistic dramatic elements or senseless prizes from established critics' academies who usually have no idea what they're talking about. Finally, the effect of CLASSIC twins must not be missed. <br /> <br /> Rating = 5/5 Stars <br /> <br /> PS ?? Hollywood managers have decided to kill this movie when it was released in the US by renaming it The Vampire Effect and cutting out 20 minutes of footage that includes portions of action scenes. The final version of the American version, however, has a better soundtrack than the original version. Therefore, I bought both versions, which allows me to first track the original up to about 1:20 brand, and then swap disks to watch the final fight on the US version.
