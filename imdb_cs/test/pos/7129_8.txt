Better than the original, "The Gamers: Dorkness Rising" manages to pull out a funny comedy with good acting, subtle special effects and comedy that goes beyond the player's "knowledge base" and does it on a low budget. I have seen many low budget movies that were horrible and almost none, which would be as good as their high budgets. This movie blows most mainstream movies away! The parts are a bit weak (a bit with pirates and ninjas - so far fun - it goes a little long without explanation and takes you out of the film a bit), but overall it is a very strong movie. I'm very happy to say that I bought this movie as soon as I saw it and brought it home. Any chance we can look forward to another feature film Gamers from these guys? :)
