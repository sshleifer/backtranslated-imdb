Anyone who was interested in how it was with black film was like in the 1970s. Some dialogue in this movie is such a funny IE summary of my submission. Also, make sure that the microphone is deployed in some scenes as well as some of the best karate events ever. Don't take this movie seriously or you will be disappointed, go into it with an open mind and enter the world of one of the worst mutha in the world of Dolemite !!! Editing a wise man together as it was sliced ​​into a shaver, but again this movie is a lot more than what you see in the movie that affected the black community in ways that you can't understand !!!
