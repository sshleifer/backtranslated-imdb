For those of you who have no idea what a Bug Juice is or isn't, it was a children's reality show about real kids living in a summer camp. Bug Juice is a show that inspired me to go to camp. It was full of romance, friendship, fighting, overcoming fear and solving the struggles for life away from home for two months. It was an amazing show, which is no longer on t.v. regularly, but it is incredible. The show was never boring and always attracted my attention. It's really nice for kids who have never been to a summer camp to really see what it is than to go. Plus, Disney did a really good job picking camps to show off, because who wants to see a show that's in the camp just a week. The length of the camps, ideal for this show, and the environment where they were, was fantastic. Where camps throughout the United States provided campers with unique activities. It was a really incredible show.
