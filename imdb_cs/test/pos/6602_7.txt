I hate movies about sports. I think the prefabricated Hollywood sports movie is a little hard for me to swallow because it follows the most identical thoughts every year, which is to say that there's not much creativity in this genre. Use exhibit "A" ?? "Game Plan" as proof of if you want. Needless to say, I was hesitant to watch this documentary for a sports theme, but at the same time I couldn't wait because I love documentaries such as "Step in Liquid" and "Billabong Odyssey". I took a step, plunged into the unknown, and frankly, at first I wasn't happy. I didn't like the direction, the people or the style the film presented to introduce these young sportsmen. With my first look, I thought history could not be fully recorded, so I thought Stacy Peralta was linking the footage of the songs to the faux-actors who acted like the late 70s. The music was intense, well matched. Peralta made this generation a mixed tape for our enjoyment, but the visuals were something other than suggestive. The elongated scenes, using awesome music to support, seemed red and too long for my attention. I wanted to get to know the pioneers, not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool. I wanted a combination of who these children were, where they went during the rise of fame and where they are now. It was like looking at the birth of our nation with a great score for settlers just rowing their boats all day. I wanted to know men for myths. Then, with the idea that I had another negative review under my belt, I watched the movie again with Peralta's audio commentary. His passion, his voice, his knowledge of people, and what he had to do to make this film "wow-ed" me. It suddenly turned into a movie I wanted to see. Peralta gives us more information about where these kids are today, what they are doing and how difficult it was to get some of them into the camera. He didn't see many of them in 20 or more years, so hearing these challenges brought the human element back to the surface. He was honest; he was sympathetic, but he showed so much devotion to this project. Although I disagree with everything he has decided to do (ie Sean Penn's mess is not PUNK ROCK), this movie has revived for me. This was because of this commentary, which I rate this film much higher than originally expected. Jay Adams. Tony Alva. Jeff Ho. Peggy Oki. Wentzle Ruml. These are just a few of the names that need to be mentioned and constantly praised if skateboarding is to continue the rapidly growing trend they currently see. While the name of Tony Hawk sells products, it is these boys, these gentle sidewalkers who redefine the whole sport. Of course, others probably did it in the Stone Age, but these guys did it with style, grace, and pushed it to the next level. It was a hobby for them, but it was also driven in a direction that I believe none of them were prepared for. "Dogtown and Z-Boys" is a story of evolution that is in the right place at the right time, living in a generation without televisions to keep us planted, and friendship. We have seen so many stories over the years that show the progress of mankind, and that is certainly a story that should be added to it. I can't say I loved this movie, neither did I, but it should be standard viewing for anyone who learns or wants to experience the trend of skateboarding. Was it sad, was it emotional and these guys are not millionaires again? They are people with passion and rarely see it in documentaries. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't watch this movie again, but I'll recommend it to friends and family from time to time. I think the fall for this movie, for me, was filming ??? avant-garde attempts with a style that eventually broke away from characters and events. As already mentioned, there were some elements that stretched too much, which left us with a little time to know where these guys were. Obviously Peralta had a passion for this sport, for people, but at times it seemed too sharp. The music was intense and worked perfectly with the film. Sean Penn was not needed at all when he was decent with his voice. They could spend money elsewhere. The positive thing is that the audio commentary captures everything that a normal movie was missing. Peralty's voice, instead of Penn's, brings a stronger human element to the scene while telling us better stories of people, places and events. Check out this movie, but don't expect it to blow away. Listen to audio commentary; I think you'll be amazed. <br /> <br /> Class: *** Â½ of *****
