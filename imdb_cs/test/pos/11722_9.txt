This is Burt Reynolds' "Citizen Kane" .Tragically nothing else that was ever involved came approaching "Sharkey's Machine". It seemed to me that he gave everything he had to it.It is a movie that is in love with Initial Sequence movies where Detective Sharkey unilaterally saves the hostage bus load is an extremely exciting piece of cinema. Everything moves as fast as it turns out that it seems to marry its own life, a greatly achieved effect. It looks cool, tense and dangerous on Mr. Reynolds' streets. The precinct house looks dirty and tired, full of desperate people on both sides of the law, screaming, cursing, trying to do business or just staying alive. Recently demolished Sharkey - a bungled drug reward (caused by a corrupt cop) - falls into this underworld - he and his team are part of the vice president. The information they pick up on a crooked politician takes them to the world of top girls and unscrupulous drug barons. Watching an apartment of one such call-girl (Rachel Ward) Sharkey falls in love with her portrait on the wall (I know, I know) and when a woman's body appears in one of the rooms she thinks she thinks (Well, I said, that it was a movie that loved movies). The scene in which he works, works beautifully, even if you saw the original. The film is full of good touches, especially Charles Durning's War Story, gently acted and shot in sharp contrast to Sharkey's kidnapping and torture that is properly rough and brutal. I must mention Vittoria Gassman and Henry Silva as two different but equally evil brothers who have no redemption features at all. They are "full" every time they are on the screen and there is no loss to society when their time comes, the end of Mr. Silva is truly extraordinary. As mentioned, this is Clint Eastwood's movie, which Clint never gave. The biggest compliment I can pay for "Sharkey's Machine" is to point out that in my opinion Clint Eastwood couldn't do a better job. The soundtrack is of the same high standard, featuring Sarah Vaughan, Joe Williams, Julie London, Chet Baker and other top artists. Randy Crawford's "Street Life" plays for the title sequence, and I can never hear it without it in my mind, seeing Sharkey walking down the sidewalk. Like other correspondents, I've never understood why this movie is a bit flop. I hope it's due to a critical review, especially when so many copies of movies and shows without a quarter of their energy, freshness and total joie de Vivre are praised from the roofs . If you've ever been tempted to think of Burt Reynolds as a burned-out - pony trick, put "Sharkey Machines" in your video machine. \ TI promise you won't be disappointed.
