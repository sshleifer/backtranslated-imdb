I think it's one of the best Tamil movies I've ever seen. I love the fact that it revolves around a guy and a girl falling in love and they made the movie brilliantly. The cast did a great job and I mainly congratulated the litte girl. She was brilliant and really brought the feeling of an adopted child looking for her real mother. The best of all are songs, beautiful music and moving lyrics. There are some great songs in this ya'll! in particular "Kannathil Mutthamittal" and "Velai Pookal". Great songs, both. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good scream and some great performances (and excellent songs!). Cheers Simran.
