Why did I vote for this movie 10/10? Quite simply because if you let it be funny, you can just laugh until you get tired. Some people may find that it goes too far, it's definitely not for everyone, but whenever I'm down and need something really really stupid to laugh, chuck on Bottom or GHP and forget all my problems and be transported to the magical dark and the strange world. "Outside the guts" is an Australian expression, it has no literal translation.
