If you like this movie, be sure to check out the other directors of Hrebejka - you're in healing. Unfortunately, this is not his best, but still a million times better than the average mainstream movie. It explores relationships, especially the rough ones, has some strong as well as sweet moments and great acting. Some conspiracy mismatches, clich√©s, and hollow moments spoil the overall effect. The previous reviewer and his comments on the Czech psyche: an interesting approach, but I do not see that this film became a Czech blockbuster. These people are somewhat spoiled by their filmmakers (also look at things from Sverak, Gedeon) and this lags a little behind.
