1983 was a "bond bond". That year both Roger Moore and Sean Connery played in two separate films by James Bond, the former (Octopussy) was produced by "official" filmmakers of Bond while later (Never Say Never Again) was produced by "The Unofficial" band. led by Kevin McClory who held the film rights to Thunderball. Surprisingly, it is an "unofficial" movie that is better despite the obvious mistake and the fact that Never Say Never Again is a remake of Thunderball. Never say never again, it has a sporting awards. the best casts ever assembled for Bond. It all starts with Sean Connery, who returns to Bond for the first time since 1971, when diamonds are forever. Connery might be older than he was then, but it looks better than he did at Diamonds Are Forever. Dr. Bond of Never Say Never Again is an elegant and dangerous Dr. Shark. Well, From Russia With Love, just a few years older. Connery's delivery of one liner and dialogue is as dead as ever. The only downside to Connery's age is his credibility, especially when it comes to movie ladies. Let's face it, even Connery, although in top physical condition, looks strange as Moore, when she weighs women half her age. Despite this plausibility problem, Never Say Never Again shows Connery in one of Bond's better performances and a clear improvement in his two earlier performances. Kim Bassinger plays Domino in one of his early film roles. Bassinger plays a role with considerable confidence for a relative novice and she makes the character credible. Bassinger holds it against his teammates and has a lot of chemistry with them. In fact, her Thunderball counterpart Claudine Auger may well overcome. Then there's a villain, Maximilian Largo was played by Klaus Maria Brandauer. Brandauer Largo is all that should be James Bond film villain: polite, charming, evil and above all believable. Brandauer makes the role realistic and decides not to fall into the trap of the other Bond villains who have reached the top. Brandauer plays Larga with a silent threat and an invisible charisma in many of the 007. <br /> <br /> The excellent casting extends into the support casting. Barbara Carrera made a progressive mistress in Fatima Blush and the screen lights up when she appears. Max Von Sydow has a nice look like Blofeld, although his appearance is more similar to portrait. Rowan Atkinson acts as Bond's blunt contact, which makes some of the best scenes in the film. The highlight of this cast is that it comes from the MI6 team of Edward Fox M, who makes a great contrast with Bernard Lee, Pamella Salem, who has been fond of Moneypenny and the icing on the cake with the amazing Qem Alec McCowen. has a pair of omissions though in the form of Bernie Casey as Felix Leiter and Gavin O'Herlihy as Jack Petachi who both seem to lack credibility in their respective roles. Otherwise, this film sports one of the best castings ever assembled for Bond. <br /> <br /> At the top of an excellent casting, the film has several other essential ingredients. From the opening series Central America to Shrublands to underwater sequences and chases on motorbikes, this is a movie where action sequences are not only great, but also serve the conspiracy for the most part. The film also has good special effects in terms of missile models, explosions and all the things we expect from Bond. Irvin Kershner, then fresh, doing The Empire Strikes Back, brings a close sense of film, especially in sequences such as nuclear warhead substations and the subsequent rocket theft. Yet this film is far from perfect. Never say never again is easily one of the most dated Bond movies with its heavy use of 1980 computer video game sand. While the technology comes from any film after some time, the heavy dependence of this film on it, especially in rocket abduction and Domination cruising, makes the film incredibly dated a quarter of a century after its release. The script also tends to suffer from predictability due to the fact that it is a remake of Thunderball. Yet for his predictability script for Never Say Never Again is pretty good. The script sports good dialogue scenes, not one cringe worthy one liner (how many of Roger Moore's era scripts can you say about?), Some funny situations, and yet is observable and tense for the most part. Once you look around you for being a remake, there are good things in the movie script. Music is in fact the biggest weakness of the film. Due to the "unofficial" state of the film, the James Bond theme could not be used. That said, it could show up with the right composer that the Bond score without it working. Unfortunately, Michael Legrand's score is far from sufficient. Legrand's score is absolutely out of the way in Bond and there's only one or two places where it actually works. To make matters worse, the film is also burdened with one of the worst cover sequences ever loved by James Bond. Despite being strongly dated, somewhat predictable and having a bad score Never say never is a good Bond movie. With one of the best casts of any Bond movie, good action sequences, good special effects, good direction and some amazing dialogue, this film proves that "unofficial" is not a bad thing. In fact, it's better than Octopussy and the winner of the "Bond Battle".
