This film is a great performance from start to finish, a great soundtrack with original Douglas Brown music and a well-tuned script that is full of surprises. movie showcases promising talent especially in the case of Craig Morris, who plays the main character Eddie Monroe. Morris, who also wrote the screenplay, portrays a calm power combined with strong emotional performance as he creates a credible character on the screen. Also Paul Varia's annoying van, who plays Uncle Benny with real warmth, was so convincing that he made me hungry when he lovingly prepared his Italian sauce. Great new faces, great new music and a great new story - what more could you want. This movie is highly recommended!
