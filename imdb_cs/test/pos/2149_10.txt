I saw this movie in Santa Monica on August 23 and stayed with me. I want to thank the filmmakers for digging into the details of Harry's mysterious, eccentric life. And also for showing Nilsson's mistakes and shortcomings. Thanks for showing good and bad, ups and downs, and for revealing the amazing BBC tracks. The film is also a great showcase of the huge amount of Nilsson's music that is very well placed in the film. I recommend this film to anyone who likes good documentaries, especially if you are interested in Harry Nilsson or the music scene from the early 70s. Some reviewers on the Ain't It Cool website wrote that it was the best film movie they saw at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, and I believe it. The film is informative, fun, sad, touching and full of amazing music. This will succeed at all levels. Really, really good.
