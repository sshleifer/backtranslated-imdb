This film is about a single mother who is happy to be almost irresponsible, and her sensible teenage daughter who is going through teenage riots. "Anywhere But Here" is an engaging movie from start to finish. Ann and Adele are well-described at the start, so we know how different their personalities are. Fights inevitably arise and are engagingly presented. I find myself so attractive to their condition and circumstances. It's like living my life, feeling what she feels. Susan Sarandon gives another excellent performance in "Anywhere But Here". She is charismatic, happy, happy, hedonistic, warm and loving. I always liked Susan Sarandon and I think he's grossly underestimated. "Anywhere But Here" is a captivating emotional journey.
