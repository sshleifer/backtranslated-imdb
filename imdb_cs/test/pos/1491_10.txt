Mr. Bean Rowan Atkinson is placed directly with Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, Marx's brothers and other comedies. I have never seen people laugh out loud so heartily and literally drop out of their chairs, as when I introduced them to Mr. Bean through my videos and DVDs. I will never forget when my brother first saw him. He was visiting and asked him if he ever saw Mr. Bean? "Who?" he said. So I got my video and showed him where Mr. Bean is in the church and begins to nod. My brother laughed so hard that he dropped out of his chair and held his stomach to laugh. He became an immediate fan of Mr. Bean. We all know how cheerful these episodes are, but the fun is sharing them with others. I have seen so many people laugh when it hurts! Popular episodes are: visiting the queen, staying in a hotel room, late for a meeting with dentists, a Christmas episode (classic ... plus kids love her!) And a New Year's party. Rowan Atkinson is a comic genius!
