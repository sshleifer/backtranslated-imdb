I can never imagine whether it is the most active soap opera ever created, or the Soapiest Art Movie. Regardless, John Seale cinematogaphy is totally ravaging. Ondaatje's novel is not reduced, but once, promoted to film. If it's a mistake, it's in the original novel, not in Anthony Minghelly's beautiful movie. Anyone who has a problem with its length almost certainly did not read the book and probably did not read it. I do not like repeating adjectives, but honest serves purpose. <br /> <br /> In addition to the story, players stand out. But it is an Australian sense of light and shadow that will ultimately prevail. As an antipodean Dutch master, Seale uses a light burst where Van Rijn would use a shadow. One could cry after this amazing cinema.
