I saw this film recently in our local Helsinki Film Archive. The Danish Film Institute seems to have reconstructed it in 2006 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Nordisk filmcompany, one of the largest in the world in the early 20th century. I believe there are currently several copies with English translations. I fascinated the film and the trip to Mars was thought out. The plot line is certainly original, but at this point I really don't want to reveal anything, because now there is a danger of spoiling things for you ;-). The movie is available on DVD, a query to the Danish Film Institute (Det Danske Filminstitut) website on dfi.dk with 'Himmelskibet' to get more information.
