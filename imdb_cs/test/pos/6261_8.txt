This is a beautiful, fun, live movie. It's even better than "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" - which is parallel but does not replicate. The story complements the whole circle and the theaters lit up as the credits rolled. One hundred years after this story takes place, we are equally fascinated by the flickering images in the dark theater.
