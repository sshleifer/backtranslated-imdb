The art of absurd life is alive and thriving in contemporary Danish film! At least it's in this movie. Nobody in this movie is amused. Everyone is either upset or shocked, and soon they will be! It is a story of deceit, murder, embarrassment, dignity and ultimately love and redemption. Cool, awkward humorous style is idiomatic and will not appeal to everyone, but I personally found that it has the right fascinating bizarre and absurd mix. Too bad that the characters from a distance, even if you do not like close up and personal. But their story is so tragic that it is for you to forgive and be happy for them, even when they get murdered. This is, in my opinion, definitely the best Danish film of the last few years. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
