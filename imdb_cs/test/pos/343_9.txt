Sri Lanka ... it is not the country I have ever thought I must admit. I didn't even know it was near India, let alone that there was a bloody civil war since 1983. The Tamil minority insurgents seem to be in constant conflict with the country's military regime. for many years, causing many deaths and widespread suffering on the island. The latest film Mani Ratman, PECK ON THE CHEEK, tells the story of a young girl named Amudha who is separated from her Sri Lankan origin. Parents War and Resurrected Young Indian Couple. Amudha is a bright and vicious girl whose life is turned upside down when her parents tell her she has been adopted as a child. Although her adoptive parents love her as much as she can and raise her without prejudice with her biological children, Amudha can't help but want to know more about her biological family. Mani Ratman is probably the best known for his 1998 film DIL SE, which hides the story of terrorism and politics inside a love story (or is it different?). Similar territory is occupied by PECK NA CHEEK, but perhaps more ambitious in the country it covers. The central theme of the film is love among all family members, especially between the child and the parents. It's a fairly honest and open look at feelings that can be very moving and pleasing at some times. It is an emotionally complex film with characters that are somewhat idealized, but still behave in a very human way. The film revolves around 9 years old Amudha, playing with charm and vivacity from the young actress P.S. Keerthana in his first and only acting role. She is a princess and a monster, always in trouble, but so charming that no one can remain angry with her for a long time. The young actress is perfectly cast for her role and does a tremendous job in the various and often difficult emotional scenes she requires of her. THE STEP TO CHEEK has such an innocent name that I was quite unprepared for. intensity of experience. Never such a small act has such a huge emotional impact, I dare say. The film is a bold and artistic effort to explore issues that are not often related to the silver screen. The direction of Mani Ratman is excellent, very confident and mature - the most challenging work I have seen the director from this point of view. The film is visually very stylish, with excellent cameramen and paintings. A.R. Rahman provides a movie soundtrack that is not as good as his classical music DIL SE or BOMBAY (at least based on the first impressions), but still shows his great musical talent. I'm not aware of the DVD release for the film yet - I saw it in Tamil with English subtitles thanks to the San Francisco International Film Festival, whose film was undoubtedly the highlight. Indeed, production is a first-rate effort, and I am sure it will be popular with Western viewers because it is getting a wider exposure. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
