Misfit recruits private Owens tests drill instructor Sgt Moore's (Jack Webb) skills. No explosions or bloodshed or hip soundtrack or sex. It is located at Parris Island S.C. and most casts were real Marines. One-line memorials abound, and the final "consecrated ..." credit is intense. With such strong male and female characters, this film could not be produced in today's touch world.
