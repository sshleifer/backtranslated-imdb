Another, which slipped into the majority of no one's radar. This little B jewel is so full of new ideas in the old genre and so totally refreshing and resourceful that the horrible cojones feel in today's cinema is slowly overtaking your body. The final set is so innovative in its environment and style that it predetermines everyone from Tarantino to John Woo. And if you think "dying lines" are all clich√©s, wait for the dying FF line. A piece of dialogue that might tear you up with laughter will take your heart. True pleasure. Look for it and see. You will not regret.
