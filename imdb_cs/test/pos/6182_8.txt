Gary Cooper (Michael Brandon) played the role of an American millionaire who had seven bad marriages, but always divorced his wife with enough money to live. Michael is on a business trip to Paris and goes to a French department store to buy a pair of pajama tops and sellers refuse to sell it on top only, they must buy a bottom or no sales. Nicole DeLoiselle, (Claudette Colbert) listens to this conversation and offers to buy the bottom of these pajamas. Michael is very interested in Nicole and has the opportunity to meet and go on a date. It's not too long for Michael to propose marriage to Nicole and she is very much taken back with his marriage request because she doesn't really know him. However, when he finds himself to become Michael's eighth wife, he begins to change his mind and this story becomes fun and entertaining. Don't miss this movie, it's great veteran entertainment. Enjoy.
