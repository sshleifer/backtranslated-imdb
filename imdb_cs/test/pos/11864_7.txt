Good. Here it is. I have read other viewers' comments - some trashing movie and some say it's the funniest, darkest, blackest comedy ever created. Whiffy of Tarantino, etc. Well, not exactly. But guess what? It's still a fun and ultimately funny movie. Not brilliant, not garbage. Liv Tyler gives you great performance and you can't tear it off. It's a woman with very strong decorating ideas ... Matt Dillon, a very underrated and underutilized actor, is as wonderful as ever. He always manages to walk on this delicate line between scratches and soul and frees himself from the comedy. Ditto John Goodman (though religious undertones, probably funny in the script, don't really work). Paul Reiser is very good --- definitely better than he was on TV. Usually unbearable Michael Douglas is actually great at this role. As for his coif, okay, check out the movie. In the meantime, "Wonder Boys" reminded you that Douglas could act. The film will laugh at you in parts. Okay, not so completely belly, but I'm definitely very amused in the category I am entertained. If you rent it, you expect another "Pulp Fiction", forget it. But if you want something sideways and a little fun, it's a damn good choice.
