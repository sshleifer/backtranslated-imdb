Lovely Candace Bergen as a widow of Perdicaris are kidnapped and held for ransom by Sheikh Raisuli played one spirited Sean Connery. The incident comes during 1904 when Theodore Roosevelt stands for presidential election. Brian Keith as Roosevelt needs a good example of how to show the United States' muscle foreign policy. He gives the Sultan of Morocco a stunning statement, "Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead." But in this adaptation from this incident, the famous declaration is the only real thing about this story. The Perdicaris in question was in fact one Ion Perdicaris who was a Greek immigrant and playboy playboy. In fact, Perdicaris gave up his American citizenship years ago and was back as a Greek citizen. It doesn't matter that even though his troubles were sufficient at the time. The girl in need makes better material on the screen, even though she is a widow woman and her two children who are at risk here. Of course, as mentioned here, some of our European powers are using this incident to get to Morocco. Intrigues far exceed the requirement of a brigand to ransom. Wind and Lion are hardly history. But it's a nice movie and Sean Connery is always fun to watch. Brian Keith also fits my conception of Theodor Roosevelt, and the scenes in Roosevelt's White House are true for all narrated stories. John Huston plays the still patient Foreign Minister John Hay, whom Roosevelt inherited from his predecessor William McKinley. But children do not use this film to skip the reading of Theodore Roosevelt's history.
