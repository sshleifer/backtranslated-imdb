Brighton has a traumatic drama in his family's chest: Emily Brighton (Taylor Roberts), 20 years old, is delayed because she was one, and her overloading mother, Martha Brighton (Amy Madigan), blames her for accident. Seventeen-year-old Evie Brighton (Lauren Ambrose) loves her sister and reads poems and stories for Emily. Their father Harry Brighton (John Savage), a bank investor, lives in the basement with his train and railroad models. Evie is mysteriously sabotaging her talks for rejecting various universities and teaching her own poems to Emily. When Martha hears Emily's recurring poems, she takes notes and shows them to an English teacher Stewart Worthy (Christopher Lloyd), who believes Emily had a moment of genius. When Evie's only friend James (Fran Kranz) reads the notes, he immediately reveals the truth about the poets' authority. But when Martha learns, Evie finds out the reality and launches a series of revelations. "Adoption" is a very powerful drama about the need for love and guilt of the complex. The performances are stunning, and this is Lauren Ambrose's first work, from Six Feet Under, which I see and is amazing. This independent film is an excellent choice for viewers looking for a refreshing story based on cast. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cumplicidade" ("Complicity")
