This film exposes an expensive irony, a hairy roundabout doggy, woven with subtle cultural references, classic parallels, masterful use of rich rich colors, and a fabulous rendition of hounds. The file work of cast and crew is charming. Literally. How else could I continue? This film speaks to everyone. Smart and Agile Use of So Many Universal Archetypes: This is what makes this film so deeply satisfying. As a mature film student, I found out that Checking Out contains all the important elements. Sure and Bergorra, it's not GODFATHER, but it will perfectly serve as a follow-up; Tragedy is a compulsory game of Satyr, which sweetly binds our collective rebels. Get into the theater and watch this movie.
