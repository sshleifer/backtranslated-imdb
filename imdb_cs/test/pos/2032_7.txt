There is nothing unpredictable in this film, but a solid movement in all respects. Everything from playing to cinema was solid. It's not a perfectly linear line, but there was nothing you couldn't see. Perhaps tad melodramatic in points, but again, quite a decent movie however. Definitely worth checking out. If you have any doubts about which movie to rent over the weekend, do it. Even though you may not feel that it might happen and buy, I found it worth it.
