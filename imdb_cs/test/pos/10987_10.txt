Manna from heaven is heavenly. This is a family movie - teens and grandparents can enjoy it together. But it is not syrupy sweet or stupid. Characters are really "characters". The plot is somewhat complicated and you have to pay attention, but it's like putting the puzzle together as it all drops into place bit by bit. The beginning of the season is like watching an old photo album or remembering when. It's very well done with very accurate hairstyles and costumes. The story moves quickly with twists, turns and lots of fun. A special experience is to watch the great cast of familiar faces, many of whom we haven't seen for too long. Part of the fun is to recognize and name them mentally as they appear, though it can be distracting. Cloris Leachman looks like she has makeup on "Oprah" by the end of the movie. I've never seen Faye Grant in a movie - I only met her as Grace's mother in the television series "Saving Grace". It was great, even a minus southern accent. And I didn't even know Shelly Duvall. The five sisters who created this beautiful film are a very talented quintet and Sister Theresa is a heavenly treasure.
