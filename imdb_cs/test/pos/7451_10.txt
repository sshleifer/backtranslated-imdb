After watching two advent children twice, the story is not as shallow as most criticized in my opinion. If you haven't played FFVII or you haven't liked it for some reason, this movie is most likely not for you. Being familiar with the original story is a prerequisite for understanding AC fully, otherwise you will only see the greatest CG animation in your life so far. Without really worrying about the story, I have to admit that after seeing AC with our friends, we relied on our knowledge of FFVII. When he saw it a second time, it was possible to pay more attention to the story and most of the questions we had were answered. Some were not. AC is clearly for FFVII players / fans and is no doubt trying to be anything else. FFVII, which serves this purpose, has little realism. Music is mostly reconstructed FFVII themes with a heavier touch (TBM team by end credits) and without exception works well with eye candy. I found music that enhanced the experience added to the visual fireworks in all situations. We all know that FFVII can't give in 1.5 hours and keep in mind that the story actually offered more than me I expected. FFVII has two problems: AC and both stories were very smoothly wrapped between action sequences. And believe me, when I say there's a lot. The action that is. I'll change my voice from 9 to 10 after watching it a second time because I missed a few explanatory sequences that I couldn't put together when I first provided some answers. As a warning, it will be easy to ignore the story and focus on the graphics, but try not to judge Adevent's children for that. If you don't want a story, it's no wonder it seems sloppy. I will not praise the graphics because I assume that we all know they are amazing, which could be underestimated. Especially the characters speak much more with their facial expressions than ever before. I hope you pay attention to the story, which actually makes sense and works well with the whole. Get ready to ride your life, there are no breaks.
