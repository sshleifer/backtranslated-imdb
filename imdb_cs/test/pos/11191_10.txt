I first saw it with friends. It ended in his parents' hands by the earl; some videostore / bike repair! he went bankrupt and treated as if it were grabs. We saw it twice in a row and the pants were almost wet as we laughed. I've seen historical documents like Ninja Mission and Plan 9 from space, and still remain good finalists compared to this. Almost 15 years after first contact, he is now considered the best cult film of all time (in my circles); I showed it to all my friends ... Now we have a tradition of looking for films in the same category: unimaginable. <br /> <br /> In no case can it be explained or reviewed. A normal way, because every scene, every move, every move, contains at least one mistake in terms of editing, dialouge, direction, etc. <br /> <br /> For all cult fans, it's the final prize, the gem of all gems. Raiting: As far as crafts are concerned, it cannot be rated because it would even be an insult to home movies and weddings. <br /> <br /> As for pure entertainment, the funniest movie I've ever seen; more fun than any comedy that has ever been past or present. Everything less than 10/10 should be considered an insult to the good sense of our fungi.
