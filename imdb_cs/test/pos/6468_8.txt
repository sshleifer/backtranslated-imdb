Martin Ritt's cleverly directed film, in which drifter and anti-hero, John Cassevetes lands in New York to escape the tragic incident in his life, where he killed his brother in a car accident, as well as in AWOL's army. Cassavetes, always an intense actor, shows grainy in his film. I was surprised that Montgomery Clift didn't get that part. Ruth White is his mother and does remarkably well in two scenes on the phone. Once in New York City, he acts as Sidney Poitier as two dock work. Immediately, Jack Warden, a tyrant and villain in this film, takes a disgust at him and tragedy follows when Poitier attempts to defend his friend. Ruby Dee, plays Poitier's wife in this film, and is brilliant in the scene where she urges Cassavets to reveal her husband's killer. This is definitely an interesting film of moral values ​​and a loner in society. The background of the apartments shows the correct mood in the movie.
