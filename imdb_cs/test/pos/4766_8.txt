One of my favorite. As a child growing up in the NY metro area at the end of the 1960s and early 1970s, she often gave me the opportunity to visit NYC with her grandfather or father because they were doing business there. The harsh, lively, human reality of this city, especially in the winter, has stayed with me. This film very aptly captures the sharp, cold, factual feelings of the NYC winter season, while enthusiastically revealing the underbelly of the infamous crime world and police work in the region. Great shot of place and time and culture. And the chase for cars is just amazing. At least on par with one in "Bullitt", and overcome the persecution in the "French Connection". Over and over, I can watch the suspension stop at the Plymouth Fury police cruiser that turns toward GW Bridge in pursuit as it returns to this sharp right curve, jumps and scratches itself. The stunt coordinator for this scene made "Bullitt" and "French Connection" as well as many other noatable movie chases. Good acting behavior and a decent plot. The music score is nervous and convincing and cinematography and direction are top. Great if underestimated by the 1970s police drama. Breeder. Not yet on DVD, though. <br /> <br /> Comparable Style and Content: French Connection and Super Fly. Early 1970 police dramas set in bleak NYC winter months.
