This movie starts a little slower, but quickly kicks into comedy gear. Each of the three "teenage girls" offers their own credible, distinct, assertive and entertaining personalities. Especially I enjoyed the dialogue and interaction between Keith and Lisa. When one looked at the superficial "action" that had taken place, Keith's character treated Lisa's "deflowering" with tenderness and thoughtfulness. The following comic book development was, in my opinion, professionally pulled out. David Boreanaz gives a great performance as an adult male, who clearly gets into more trouble than he can. The dialogue was sharp, fast and flowing nicely. The director and writer of this film clearly showed how none of the main characters sought moral elevated land after all the shenanigans they had dragged. Although the film appears on the surface, it reflects all the gray areas that become adults, human emotions and desires.
