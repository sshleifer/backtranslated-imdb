Since 1950, there has been a sleek thriller about smuggling diamonds from abroad as well as contagious smallpox disease. Evelyn Keyes pulls out all the stops as the basic victim of this film-noir. Once back in the United States, she is not aware that she could spread the disease to everyone and to whatever she comes into contact with. Finally, it is monitored and must be stopped before the epidemic occurs. In addition to Keyes' remarkable performance, there is good support from the villains of Charles Korvin, William Bishop, Dorothy Malone, Lola Albright and Whit Bissell. The final is a shiver with Miss Keyes on the ledge of the building with spotlights and hundreds of spectators. Good B flick!
