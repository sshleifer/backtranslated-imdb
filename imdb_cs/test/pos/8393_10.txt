This is about as good as gone with the wind was. Can't do it. He loves him so much. This is the story of true true love. It started with the wind and ended up in this movie. The only real way to end this movie for true love was to have Scarlett and Rhetta at the end. how it ended with them along with their daughter. It's not a better end to this great love story than this. What else can I say about this great movie.
