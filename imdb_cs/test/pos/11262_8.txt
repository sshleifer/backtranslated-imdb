to be a high school student, I have to take a medical class. this year they're drugs. we have learned of the damage they can cause to a person. I still believe in what we are talking about, and I know that drugs can really beat a man. My teacher wanted us to follow it. we naturally moaned and started to sleep, but like the rest of my class I really enjoyed this movie. It was completely real and not sugar coated at all. the characters were amazing and believable. Even the storyline was extremely realistic and believable. What I liked about this movie was mainly how it got the point of effect the drug can have on the perpetrator, and the consequences that one has to deal with. they all make sure that nothing bad happens to them. but he will be serious. anything can happen in a small town, even your best friend like Sam and Chris. This movie shows it. one can really learn a lot from watching it. it was pretty effective.
