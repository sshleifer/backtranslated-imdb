Perhaps one of the best movies ever made. Orry's and Goerge's friendship runs deep, and the war puts pressure on their strong friendship. As Southerner, I can honestly say that this epic is as accurate as possible. Brothers fight brothers. Can you imagine what life had to live at that time? The best part of the film, for me, was when the South surrendered; General Grant urges President Lincoln to glue him to the south, saying, "Mr. President, many people want the South to bleed over what they did ..." There was enough bleeding in the south ... so we ... "I threw myself into tears and took a deep breath. What President! It's like a father who said his son was punished enough, and despite his anger, he realizes that his point has been made. This war was a very dark time for our young country and it had to be fought. President Lincoln knew that. I invite anyone who reads it to view this movie and add it to the DVD collection. Then thank God that our country has been preserved. As Jesus said, "a house divided against itself cannot stand."
