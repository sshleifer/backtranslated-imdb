It is a very dark film, somewhat better than the average film Asylum. It was much better than I thought it was a combination of a psychological thriller and a horror movie. The voice on the phone is really scary - this voice without a face, this unknown and threatening voice in the movie works really well because we never see the killer's face on the viewer's imagination. The action and tension never drops and becomes vertiginous after the first half of the movie; There's not much gore in this movie, it's enough to serve the story, and the director also does a good job of keeping your attention. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 8/10 because of some clich√©s.
