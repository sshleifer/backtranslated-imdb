I have to admit I've never heard of this movie. I caught it last night at TMC. I thought it was hysterical. I laughed so hard and loved the end. An image of what Marx's brothers would want if they worked with Salvador Dali and Malcolmn X and then they all dropped LSD. Nowadays there are two overused words that are slightly more than 200 IQs. Most comedies today and surreal to run. I had to be at 6:00 in the morning and watch until 2:30. I slept and missed my duties. Still worth it. I would not recommend renting it, I would recommend to own it. It was so good. The only warning I have is that the links are dated and don't get younger people. Bare with it and use your head. <br /> <br /> I'd have to put it in my best ever comedy.
