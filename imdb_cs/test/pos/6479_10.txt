You don't have to be a Notre Dame football fan to enjoy it because I'm not .... but as a football fan in general it was fun to watch. It almost makes me a fighting Irish devotee. If you can't capture the emotions in this movie, the fan of the grid, or not, check your pulse because it's an emotional movie with some very moving scenes. As a sports fan I loved watching classic morning high school shots. At that time they had nice wild games with lots of siderails. They dispersed that footage with Pat O'Brien shown as head coach of Knute Rockne on the edge and some players, such as George Gipp (Ronald Reagan). Reagan gets a pretty good bill in this movie, but it's not really that big. O'Brien is the only actor with a big role. The rest - they all play nice characters - belongs to Gale Page as Rockne's wife "Bonnie;" Donald Crisp, as Notre Dame's "Father John Callahan;" Albert Bassermann as Professor of Chemistry "Father Nieuwland" and Reagan, as Gipp, perhaps the most talented and well-known player of Notre Dame ever. <br /> <br /> What this film does is a balance of personal story with football. Not one angle is exaggerated. The characters here are all the people you can take root, because there are no villains. On my last look, it was interesting to discover Johnny Sheffield - son of Tarzan - playing Rockne at the age of seven and see one of George Reeves's players, TV Superman. There were very few football movies made in Hollywood, for some reason, and rare few good ones. That's one of them.
