I saw this movie in the early 1970s when I was about 10 years old. old on TV. It was after school, and when I watched, I was so drawn into the whole idea of ​​two cosmonauts going on a mission to another undiscovered planet that I asked my mom if I could get a tape recorder. She left me. So I wrapped the microphone cable around the channel knob so the microphone hung in front of the speaker. This movie is the first movie I paid enough attention to - and made sure I was recording. (Just a sound - there were no video recorders at the time.) The story hangs on every word ... every minute of this movie. After you follow the path to the far side of the sun .. You will have flashes in your mind for a long time. I've played the sound for many years ... and "I've seen it over and over in my mind." Then - maybe 15 years later ... when the VCRs were normal and sold tapes in stores. I've always been looking for it ... but I've never found it. But when the internet came one day, I was looking for it and I bought it in a second. So, after about 30 years of seeing it for the first time, I have to see it again. WOW! ~ ~ It was spectacular! Just for information .. I had to watch it 50 times since then.
