For those of you who have seen this pic on VHS, I would recommend a DVD. In fact, VHS is total waste. The main reason is that the movie was shot with a widescreen display (2.55: 1) and the producers ran out of money that made the VHS version and released it as a 4: 3. Drag, less than half of the cars are showing because one is on each side of the screen. The DVD is actually a reasonable version of the movie. <br /> <br /> Many of the best scenes in the film were filmed before the final release. They were considered too offensive to minority groups. In fact, the prospect of an American release caused even more cuts in the film. For example, Americans misunderstood words like Petrol & Strides. Mike's father and mother were supposed to be hippies. Father survives in the film as a useless guitarist smoking a drug. However, the following mom scene was cut out. The scene took place in the roof space of the house, which was lined with aluminum foil, fluorinated lights and filled with plants ... you get the picture. The producers rounded up a lot of real plants in the foreground, and when they saw the result on the big sheet, they got angry and the scene was cut out. Cowards! Yes, the film is known as the Australian cult classic. Voted # 2 in the street machines best 100 movies of all time, tightly missing on Mad Max ll. It had more than ten times the ROE budget. In fact, the ROE budget was so small that the director couldn't afford to destroy any of the cars ... even if there was a public scream if someone destroyed the real HO. (Compare it to Smoky and Bandit or Blues Bros, where dozens of cars were destroyed.) So there is one real GTHO and two fakes. One of the counterfeits was purchased from a local tribal community in Cobar after the emergency GTHO crashed into the back of a Country Boy. (It was unscrewed! The car was supposed to go out of the car.) Because the budget was so tight, the car was made of ordinary brown camouflage tape instead of the painted gold trim of the real thing. br /> <br /> 55 chevs is absolutely real. The car started as a very simple 4 door and was brilliantly and quickly transferred to the '55 blown in the movie. The engine was marinated by 545, which made about 1000 bhp. This was reduced to about 600 for filming. The car was able to easily shoot at 170 mph, as shown on several scenes in the movie. Just for the record, anyone with $ 12,000 could pick up ALL cars after the movie. HO, Dodge, U53, Rammer 53 Chev ... a lot. Wonder where are they now? <br /> <br /> SW
