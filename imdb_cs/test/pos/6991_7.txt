Although this movie begins with the usual: something goes wrong, the spacecraft crashes, people are stuck, etc. It still downloads and introduces new ideas to the viewer. Riddick is a somewhat bad ass who has condemned and altered his eyes to be able to see in the dark, which is a very desirable ability due to the ship's crew situation and he gets inside. Good and emphasizes the mysticism that curtains around the anti-hero and male protagonist: "Riddick." The story in Pitch Black is, as mentioned, somewhat very unoriginal and dissatisfied, but cutting and editing in a film mixed with some of the surprising elements that have been added to the story helps him to continue to support himself very well and one left them with a hybrid feeling of satisfaction and hunger for more. Vin Diesel behaves really well in the role of Riddick, and even though his character is a tough, tough survivor, he still makes moral choices almost on the verge of good, but that doesn't mean that his decision won't change at the very end ... Why destroy already so perfect reputation? All this is a very good movie, though not perfect. The story seems very unoriginal on the surface, but enough originality shines beneath it to entertain. Some scenes have this wow factor, while as a whole it is slightly better than average. It could be described as a cult film and it is definitely a recommendation for people who want a spicy sci-fi story mixed with some minor psychological moments and an interesting protagonist, specifically Riddick.
