I hope the writer, director, editor and composer (and don't forget the producer) will read it ... because their work was really incredible on this film. Let's start by not linking this movie. I'm just an ordinary guy who has been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and has seen it about 8 times. <br /> <br /> Every second of this movie touches. Every scene is classic. The deal is real. The film is honest. You can refer to these characters as people, not actors. This story follows three different killers at different stages of life. The story is carefully thought out and every partial plot is intertwined and entangled together, culminating in a message that lets us think about the right and wrong values ​​that each of us carries inside. Crispen Glover, Daniel Roebuck, Dennis Hopper and Joshua John Miller (as a 12-year-old boy) are absolutely amazing, real performances. I saw this movie about 8 or more times and I still get into my performance by forgetting to watch the movie. It is alright like this. Great work anyone who worked on it. Good job. Music is also beautifully harmonized and scary. With the selected cast, carefully timed editing and stimulation, mood and tone, and even the theme, the director made some of the best decisions for a movie I've ever seen. This movie is real. It's honest. It's a real cinematic experience you'll never forget. You don't have to be in the subject, but it's something you can't ignore. In the end, it's about people being people ... and everyone can relate to it. I recommend this film to fans of drama, tension and horror over almost every other film.
