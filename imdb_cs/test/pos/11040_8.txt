I loved the great lighting and was warmed up by this story of American working-class society and life in ports in the first half of the 20th century. I was attracted by the timeless vigilance of this realistic performance. see and feel the power of the star. melancholic "Greek" comedy. Anyone in the mood on your back with beer? ... or a little ginger? Hey, waterboy!
