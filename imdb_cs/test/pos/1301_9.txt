I watched it because a friend told me it was damn good, and I saw a video on it, so I really watched it. I watched it, and damn, the battle scenes are really good. If the guys can't fight like that in real life, they're sure to have fooled me. There are not as many fights as I want, I have to say, but the struggles that are in the movie are pretty spectacular. They don't show much, but you can say it's violent and cold. But there is also a conspiracy that goes around the love triangle among the main characters, though it is a little twisted. Tae-sung is a carefree guy who seems to love to get in trouble and fight. He is the leader of his school and is a rival of the Hea-won who is the leader of his own school - a little playboy, a hot-headed and rich boy. Then there's Han-kyung, a girl who doesn't go to her very much - her father just died and she came back with her mother, a guy she likes to go out with her old friend - and then meets Hea-won who goes to her school, and Tae-sung, who calls her "nuna" (older sister). Finally, she finds out that Tae-sung is her brother, the fruit of her father's affair, and she loves her despite their blood relationship. Meanwhile, Hea-won falls behind her and takes her as her friend. But she is torn between her boyfriend and her little brother who admits her love. Overall, it's an amazing movie, but if I was really depressed after the end and I just couldn't help but think there are all Korean movies I'm watching about fighting / death / depression / incest ?? Because it was the case of an old boy and the temptation of wolves. It's a very good movie, but people have to be ready to cry at the end.
