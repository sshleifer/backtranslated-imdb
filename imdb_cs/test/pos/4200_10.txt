I heard about John Garfield, but he didn't know him. I loved this movie. I've never heard of it. I just picked it up randomly. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He was also in real life, so he knew his part. There was a refugee in the movie. Someone else killed the man. The character was blamed. He is related to a family who has questions and is not entirely sure what to do about him. Following are all kinds of small conspiracies. My favorite was the scary swimming scene in the water tower where the water was deep and one Dead End Kid couldn't swim, and none of them could get out. Dead End kids were great as his friends and followers. One of them until the very end. Ann Sheridan played the daughter of the family and John's potential love interest. She was believable, but in my opinion she wasn't nice - the only weak link in the film.
