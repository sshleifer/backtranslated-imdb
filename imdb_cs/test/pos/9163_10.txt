The film was shot less than a year after the Soviet appearance from Afghanistan and was fresh in the spirit of cast, director and audience. Most of the cast are real soldiers and officers just since the war. The Soviet Army has worked quite a lot in the making, which is strange. Afghan Intervention was a bloody and senseless war in which even generals forgot the causes of bloodshed. This film shows the tension and cruelty of military life, the emotional atrophy experienced by soldiers, and the pain that overthrew a small nation torn by war and civil war. There is no lack of powerful scenes. One of the first is a record of steel coffins loaded for transport to the USSR. The soldiers go about their work, while the officer calmly clears the targets: Moscow, Rostov, Donetsk, Baltic Sea. Earlier commentary describes the last scene with Majo Bandura as illogical. It is absolutely logical and in the spirit of the film: Bandura's only human relationship was with the Afghan family he accidentally killed in the attack. After losing his only bumper against the absurdity of the war, Bandura turned his back on the boy (and his weapon) in resigning his fate. Especially I liked the last scene: a flock of MI-28s rises above the mountains as the pilot's voice roars, "I guess! Afhanskii Izlom is an excellent movie - brutally honest and relentless as they come.
