* Minor Spoiler * <br /> <br /> Residents are not scary, but it's scary. It's an interesting "little" story with good acting and great makeup for special effects. Basic Conspiracy: The little girl blames strange things happening in the new family house and the accompanying theater on her friends. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't waste time moving around, even though the end could be more involved. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie to those who are expecting / wanting a hardcore horror movie, but I recommend it to those who want a cooler and not necessarily a thriller.
