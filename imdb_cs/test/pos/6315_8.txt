The consequences of love: There is really something special about this movie, but it's hard to put your finger on. It's a love story of its kind, but I haven't actually seen it yet. It has several love themes running throughout the movie. One person loves a younger woman, the younger mans loves his older brother, the mafia love of money at all costs, these are just some that blend into a story that guessed you or rather doesn't know where and how it ends. The cast is excellent from Sophie teasing barmaid to straight face-ness titta movies central character. With a simple but affective camera, it bounced off the ever-changing soundtrack that combines a low-fi trip hop with lush orchestral pieces. The style of the film changes beautifully with a few styles without intertwining. Love never seemed as diverse and powerful as the stories we tell us that it collapses to various conclusions. The director married old and new in a rich Italian classic.
