I'm usually a comedy guy. I rented it on a video store under comedy and thought "Albert Brooks! Awesome!" and rented. It seemed like a romantic comedy, and I remembered that I hated them, and I had the full idea of ​​hating this movie. Boy, I was wrong. Although it is a romantic comedy, it is an amazing lead and accompanying cast (Brooks, Hunter, Cusack and Nicholson) and everything works well inside of you. The script sounds real and is not enforced, as it might happen in the news station you watch at night. It takes your emotions and makes you enjoy Hunter and Brooks and hate Hurt, which makes the end a little unhappy and infertile, but shows how you don't need a happy ending at the end of the movie, just a true ending that's what everyone got. Not every life ends well, and it shows in Broadcast News. Maybe people don't like the end because it's not your typical happy ending with romantic comedies ... but it works, it's real and it's a genius. Broadcast News is a classic in time, and a gentle romantic movie out there with "Casablanca". Well, maybe not so high, but it's the only other romance I think I like. Broadcast News: 9/10.
