I recently got this movie on DVD as a gift and at first I wasn't sure it would be appealing (though one of my favorite actors has a leading role). In fact, it's on the way to becoming a favorite. First, fortunately, it's * not * the same as a book whose end is, in my opinion, too melodramatic. Second: it's one of the best films about World War I. "What?" you can ask. "It's not a war movie!" True: we see no battles or bombing, no trenches, no gas. But it shows the cost of war, the damage to the lives of the men who fought it, and the impact it has on those who are close to them. First we saw Helena (Sarah Miles), a Baronet's widow waiting for her release from a psychiatric hospital. All the women in the film seem to be widows: some from the war, but Helen's much older husband, Sir Thomas (we see him later in the photo), were sick and died when she was at the party, hence her guilt - disintegration. She's lost and lonely. The wire around the hospital evokes prisoner-of-war camps and trenches: like many men from the outside world, Helen suffers from a kind of shock shock. From the hospital, he must find his feet again in the world: a world we experience through eyes as bleak, desolate and hostile. Her mother cannot give her any real support. She is a widow herself, she has built up her own emotional defense, for which she hides to avoid the suffering of her daughter. (Like many people, especially at the time, he seems to be mentally ill.) Ledbetter, a hired driver, becomes a supportive presence and helps Helen adapt to life, not realizing he's with her dangerously possessed. This is a great performance of Robert Shaw. Ledbetter is a former regular soldier, a former sergeant who runs a boxing club and founded his own car rental company. Superficially it seems to be hard and strong, reliable, but there are cracks below the surface: it is not really adapted to civilian life. He brings (for reasons that he later explains) a family and home life he does not have; He has brutal outbursts with colleagues, and affection-less sex. Getting closer to Helen? a woman who, even with greater post-war social freedom, could not realistically hope to marry? it reveals the psychological disorders that tear it up. These days, one could diagnose PTSD. The same goes for the second man in Helen's life, an ambitious politician, Captain Hugh Cantrip (Peter Egan). He is ambitious, handsome but also very young. His girlfriend, Connie (Caroline Mortimer), tells him that he has a hair comb and makes sure he has a clean handkerchief before he comes out. He is known to both Ledbetter and Helen: the former served under him during the war, and Helen met him in political circles and considered him "popinjay". However, he and Helen are now starting a relationship, with Helen wanting to promote his political career, financially and emotionally. Peter Egan, fresh from his stage success as Stanhope in the R C Sheriff's 'Journey's End', makes Hugh more than an immature cad. There is an obvious, unobtrusive scene in the back of the car between Helena and Hugh, in which they quote Brooke 'The Old Vicarage at Grantchester'. He asks, from his war experience, "Was it very bad?" She can't answer. He says, "Well, you're back." But his gently spoken answer? "Am I ever?" ?? is the key to his character. As light and shadow blink over his face, we know that there are some horrors that cannot be put into words. Excessive losses suffered by younger officers of their kind? directly from school or university and is expected to lead from the queue? are well known. In a nervous speech (during which Helen assures him) to the local political people at dinner-party, he reveals that he will stand as an Independent, no longer as Liberal (the party that took the country into war). His emotional life is just as damaged as Ledbetter's life. She can't easily break free from Connie, who is emotionally and financially dependent on him: reading between the lines, she's probably a war widow (perhaps a former comrade?) With a child whose drawings we see on her house's wall <br /> <br /> * ** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> The trio crisis is slowly evolving with the scary scene between Helen and Ledbetter in the car, and Ledbetter is listening to Hugh and Connie as he drives them, as Hugh tries to convince Connie that though his relationship with Helen is developing, they can continue their own; that it will at least continue to support it. Jealousy, obsession, and his belief that he must protect Helen from duplicating Ledbetter's golden dredger to force her into her home with her and Hugh. The end is totally different from the end of the novel and is better for it: it is dramatic but less melodramatic and keeps an unsentimental tone. We started with one character who recovered from mental breakdown; we end up with other sufferers. Helen, one of the senses, is now wiser and stronger than the two men who could not fully adapt to the so-called "hero-friendly land" they returned from a total war nightmare. The new end is open: one feels at least equal to anything that is ahead of us, without illusions. In this, the reality of the times in which women (Helen, Connie and many others) have picked up pieces of the world in which too many men have died or come home with varying degrees of mental health are well reflected. and physical damage. <br /> <br /> "Well, you're back." ?? "Am I ever?"
