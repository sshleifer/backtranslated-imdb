Remember Greg the Bunny? It was this show that started on an independent movie channel, but got out of a full-fledged sitcom on Fox. My cousin and I thought it was pretty funny, except for the premature idea of ​​puppets that took TV-PG material. Puppets Kill occurs in a similar universe, where puppets live in the same world as humans, and like us, we take work and our own lives. Let's say if you can't handle it, then don't bother to watch PWK because this show is a profile of 4 puppets that fell out of social good manners through drug abuse, hedonism and violent crimes to end up in half. House. There is a lot of violence, sex and bad language (so it would never get on the way to the US TV network). As if sociopathic puppets were not enough, the fact that this is happening in Canada makes it even more worrying (btw, the government pays for it), and I think any American television viewer would demand more demented feed like that. I don't know where you can get him in the US, off the satellite TV, but I'd advise you to try. Really funny things. (Comedy Network in Canada)
