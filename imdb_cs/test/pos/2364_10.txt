Britain's funniest movie I've ever seen, "The Supergrass" is a story about sex, drugs, creamy teas and murder by the sea. Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmonson), the average Moron, is to impress his so-called girlfriend, Andrea (Dawn French), because she thinks she is too lawful. So to be with her on a romantic escape, he came up with a plan that might impress her and tempt her to spend some time with him. The problem is that Dennis's lie is to get involved in the international drug group in some way, and when he told her, a couple of policemen heard his rant and nickname. And so this witty movie begins, full of neat comedy and rough jokes. Dennis is banging into a local nick, and much to arrest officers' delight, there seems to be no way out (Andrea's earlier attempts to explain it was all a lie was dismissed by the cheerful tune "Stand At Your Man" Then follows Robertson (Ronald Allen), Chief Intelligence, Scotland Yard. He'll make a deal with Dennis that if he helps him catch drug smugglers, then he'll be freed and allow what he likes. Dennis agrees, and is affiliated with Harvey Duncan (Peter Richardson), and Lesley Reynolds (Jennifer Saunders). The rest is an unforgettable ribbing experience when Robbie Coltrane as Sergeant Troy adds a humorous color to the film. His walk on the dry dock against "Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Two Tribes" is an excellent and probably the best scene in film history. Two officers, nicknamed Dennis, are beautifully played by Michael Elphick and Patrick Durkin, and Alexei Sayle as a motorcycle cop is laughing! If you want to watch something good on Saturday night, then I suggest you rent it. You will not forget it!
