If you loved the 1993 movie (eroticism, sci-fiction) cyborg "Nemesis" then you will love it. I loved it when Elvis Pompadoured hero pulls out a samurai sword during a break. Like "Nemesis," it takes place in a post-apocalyptic slum of the future. They are both police thrillers, where a well-armed hero must take well-armed rebels to solve the plot of powers that are against unwashed masses. but this is where the similarities end. An ambiguous mayor in the dead or living is trying to keep the masses calm on the drugs he sells. The mercenaries and cyborg-backed insurgents are trying to hinder their choking on their subjects. After several unsuccessful attempts to hinder the rebels, he sends his chief cop to murder the insurgents. This film follows the trail of most action adventures, but is not afraid of color off the line.
