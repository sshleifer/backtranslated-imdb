I am amazed that 'Hail the Woman' was ever created; Just one year after American women got their voice, this turgid drama is a serious reason against a sexual double standard that judges women's sexual behavior harder than men. SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD. Prologue, based in the Plymouth Colony in 1621, shows the Pilgrim girl sentenced to a duck stool for flirting with the boy; boy is not penalized. Now we come to Flint Hill, New Hampshire today (1921). Oliver Beresford (Theodore Roberts) is a bastard-thumper: what we call in Britain and Australia is "crazy". Beresford decided that his son David (Lloyd Hughes) would become a preacher, no matter how David felt. As for Beresford's daughter Judith ... well, Beresford believes that women are not important enough to be more than wives and mothers. God told him in person. David's evangelical career is compromised when he impregnates Nan Higgins, the stepdaughter of a local enlisted man. (Tully Marshall's character is only identified as "Odd Jobs Man" in credits, but control details reveal his name to be Jake Higgins. The 1921 prejudices require him to be Nan's stepfather, not her biological parent. To save his son before the scandal, Beresford will buy his stepfather Nan with a check. Nan goes to the city to melt into oblivion as one unwavering mother. Judith is naturally horrified by the limitations imposed on her by her sex. Other people see it.) He meets Wyndham Gray (Edward Martindel's outstanding performance), an author who encourages her to overcome sexist stereotypes, but Judith is informally involved in the local lute, Joe Hurd, who is not satisfied with such nonsense. , a turbulent artist now only remembered for comedy roles (as the second banana for Harry Langdon, and as a villain in three Stoog Unfortunately, in real life, Dent spent the last few years in poverty and total blindness as a result of diabetic retinopathy. Finally Judith works at an orphanage. From 1921, I expected the orphanage to be just white, so I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be one Chinese boy. (And unpleasantly surprised when used as an ass for a racial joke.) The film makes one special mistake here. In the Christmas season, we see the lady's orphanage reciting "Visit from St. Nicholas" ... but (in the dialog name) she is more likely to be devoted to Santa Claus with a SIX reindeer than an eight. It is followed by a short animation sequence showing Santa with six reindeer on his sleigh. I suppose the animators (either by accident or saving money) missed two reindeer and the cover card reworked the poem to fit the error. His best known performance is his role in "The Lost World", where raging brontosaurus is easily upstaged. For his climactic scene in 'Hail Woman', Hughes gives an unforgettable performance as he finally rebels against his father's tyranny. In his performance as a gospel-screaming father, Theodore Roberts was charged with overacting to the point of making his caricature role. I disagree: unfortunately, decades after this film was made, I continue to see "holy" fools just like this man ... willing to destroy the lives of everyone around them and firmly believe they have God's power to do so. In the central role of Judith Beresford, Florence Vidor gives a sensible, realistic and intelligent performance. I usually don't like Vidor, who tended to be cast in glamor roles, but wasn't enough to justify them. The physical appearance of her character is less relevant than usual. This whole film is impressively directed by director John Griffith Wray, who deserves to be much better known. Sadly, Wray died at the onset of an interview era, in the mid-thirties: if he had lived for another ten years, he would certainly have several early sound classics. There are several extremely beautiful compositions on screen in 'Hail the Woman': I was particularly impressed by the scene in the New England Forest when Vidor and Dent had a quarrel in front of a huge uprooted tree. (I wonder where it was actually filmed.) 'Hail the Woman' deals with an unpleasant subject, but it deserves to be much better known and I rate this ambitious drama from 10.
