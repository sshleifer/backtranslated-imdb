Florence Vidor plays as the daughter of a strict Bible toting father who throws her out of the house when gossip taints her name. In a big city, she finds a dying woman of her own brother (both secretly married) and educates her child herself. Years later, he returns home to stand in front of his family. This old melodrama is heavily dotted with fascinating feminist motifs (around 1921 but remarkably modern). Some of them are laid with a trowel (as a father, Theodore Roberts puts an eyebrow of real training), but it is well designed dramatically and lovingly composed and filmed by cameraman Henry Sharp.
