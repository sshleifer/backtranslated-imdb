As a Canadian, I didn't know much about the release from Whitlam. I read the Wikipedia page about these events, but that was about it. Earlier this year, when Canada underwent a potential constitutional crisis (which was fortunately dissolved), which could have led to our Governor-General's intervention, Whitlam's release was mentioned in the press. In order to learn more, I ordered a DVD of this mini-series through EBay. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed with how interesting the account was. As dramatic as it was with events, it could have been a very boring political drama. However it was a very exciting mini-series. I was also impressed by how understandable it was, despite my lack of familiarity with Australian politics. It didn't take long for us to find out who everyone was and what their roles were. <br /> <br /> Since it's not a completely impartial account. Certainly, Malcolm Fraser is portrayed as a Machiavellian character who will not allow any person or thing to get into the way of his journey to be prime minister. Gough Whitlam is displayed in a nobler, almost light light. However, the actor portraying the Whitlam nobility channels in such a way that it comes more like pomp. I thought Sir John Kerr was quite likeable. <br /> <br /> I have to warn people that the DVD is of poor quality. I understand that it was made for television in the early 1980s, but it seemed that no effort was made to restore image quality or sound quality. It was very disappointing that no additions were added. A document, or even some interviews with historical figures, would improve this experience, but it is nothing. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this mini-series to all those interested in real life events.
