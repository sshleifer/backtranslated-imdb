Martin Donovan's promise to play Jesus was pretty honest enough to see the movie. Definitely worth it; smart and witty without exaggerating it. The low quality of filming was probably a good effect, but it ended up a little uncomfortable and the end sounded more like a PBS than Hartley. Yet there are too many unforgettable lines and great moments for me to judge it hard.
