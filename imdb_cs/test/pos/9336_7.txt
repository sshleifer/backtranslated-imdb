In 1983, Michael Jackson's popularity was that if he wanted to make a $ 1 million horror video with the American Werewolf team and represent Vincent Price, then that was what he did. And never had a music video of such a sensation, before or since ... when it was released on VHS, this 13-minute short became the world's largest musical of all time. But chances are all about it, because whenever there is a list of the biggest music videos of all time, it's almost always at the top. It starts with Michael Jackson, who walks down the street with his date after the car broke down. She explains to her that she is "not like other men" (damn right), and then the full moon appears from behind the clouds. His girlfriend is standing there screaming and screaming, and then screaming even more, during a thoughtful transformation sequence when Michael Jackson becomes a werewolf. He chases her through the forest, catches her, and we ... cut into the cinema. Ah, it's all happening in a horror movie that Michael Jackson and his date are watching. So we are five minutes and we still don't have any clues about "Thriller". Extravagant, a lot? Anyway, you have to know how it goes from here ... dancing, singing ... cemetery ... Vincent Price ... zombies ... "What's the problem?" ... then stop credits. End credits for friggin 'music video. "Thriller" is not one of Michael Jackon's most memorable songs, but even today's standards make it a bit of a visual experience. If you haven't seen it in full, then you should come back soon.
