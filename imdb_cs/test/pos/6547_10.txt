I saw UZUMAKI about a year ago and was fascinated. The only Japanese horror movie I saw before was KWAIDAN (which I proudly own on DVD), excellent! The idea of ​​a city swallowing spirals sounds just like something from Lovecraft. It is certainly reminiscent of the SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH, where the people are slowly turning to monstrosity (in this case, giant snails). And who can forget the washing machine sequence? I hope to see the one available on the Region 1 DVD soon (I see that Sundance has recently shown it on American television, hopefully they will do it very soon) so that we can all see it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!
