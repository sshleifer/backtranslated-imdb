I lost counting the number of times I watched this movie. I have never been tired of it because it is a movie that you can enjoy and interpret on many levels. they just don't make movies like that anymore. After the recent final tracking of the heartbreaking documentary about making this film (Hearts of Darkness: filmmakers go crazy), I'm even more impressed by the fact that this movie even ended up, but it went so well. The fact that they made the film in the Phillipines jungles is the greatest benefit of the film. in fact, you feel like in Vietnam. all the actors are fantastic, with my favorite are still Robert Duvall ("I love the napalm smell in the morning!") martin sheen and great Marlon Brando. many people complain that the film is coming to an end. well, remember what Coppolla said about this movie: "This movie is not about Vietnam, it's Vietnam!" that means this movie is about MADNESS and not about war. This film is based on the story of Joseph Conrad "Heart of Darkness" and is opposed to the Vietnam War instead of civilian. wars like in a book. I think it was a brilliant combination in my opinion. This is a perfect, challenging movie that is dark, violent, funny at times and well done in every possible way. <br /> <br /> a real classic rating <br /> <br />: 10
