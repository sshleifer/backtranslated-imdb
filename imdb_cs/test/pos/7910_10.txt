Finally, I discovered what I thought I had for four years. After I saw the color version of the 1960s on VHS, I told myself that I remembered that I saw it in black and white 2 times before. Now the IMDb has helped me know the truth that it was broadcast twice (2 productions) in black and white in two successful years, 1955 and 56. I did not realize that the 56 broadcasts were not the same as 55. In 1960 I was nine and the color production didn't do it for me. The black and white version was amazing as well as the stunning and amazing effect of today's high tech movies, even without any computer effects. You had to be there! Please comment if you have had a similar response to the b & w version.
