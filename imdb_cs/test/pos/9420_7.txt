It is one of the paradoxes of Sherlock Holmes's anti-Nazi war films (Voice of Terror, SH in Washington and this) that while land and settings are mostly terrible, they are so good at them. Despite the bizarre windy hair that should look younger, every scene pervades such a bite and attack that you barely register how complex the land is. Here also has a great acting relationship with Lionel Atwill, who makes Professor Moriarty a great repulsion - a heavy cap cockroach with nice allusions to sadism and corruption (it doesn't have to be children). At the top, he turned into a lab coat to get Rathbone's blood "dropped by drop", the worst sinister as Seinfeld's arch-nemesis Newman. The film itself is an ancient children's matin√©e fare, but benefits from director Roy William Neill's attention to the staging and atmosphere. It also looks pretty sharp in the DVD UCLA Restoration - not even thinking of buying any other edition, all of them faded, jerky public domain prints.
