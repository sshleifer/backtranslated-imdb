This spectacle of Fox was a big hit when it was released in 1954. Its production, with great music and orchards, interesting casts, moves slowly but interestingly. Edmund Purdom is strikingly handsome as Egyptian, becoming a respected physician, juggling three stunning women: Jean Simmons, a girl who passively adores him, tempting Bella Darvi who escapes him, and Sister Pharaah Gene Tieney who wants him as his Pharaoh. The popularity of the film has not escaped because being re-pointed to AMC (preferably in widescreen). Purdom is particularly large, his character apparently hits out with women and ends up never married and "thinker". Darvi is amazing and irritating in her femme fatal role. Victor Elder, Michael Wilding, Peter Ustinov co-star. Check it out.
