After reading most of the comments, I feel like I also have a word. What worries me most is that most people think this film is either for or against the topic of death. and whether she worked with them. I remember reading an article in 1995 when the film was published (yes, I was so interested because I heard that it was revealed that I hadn't forgotten the articles I was reading at that time) in which Tim Robbins said that he did not want to make a film to persuade viewers of either one or the other. And I think it's absolutely right. I have to admit that I am convinced that in the way he made this film, he was a bit immersed in the party against death, but people are still allowed to choose for themselves. And that is a very rare thing in American movies. I've shown this film to many people since it came out, and I've seen all sorts of reactions. Fans of death have become opponents or have become even stronger in their faith. And many opponents of the death penalty (including me) intensified in the belief that the death penalty should be abolished everywhere. But I even saw that opponents become supporters. This and the fact that people seem to fight here prove to me that there are really many ways to look at it. So whatever influence it has on you, the important thing is that it does THINK. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies that really gives you a choice that does not avoid a simple way to be convicted either wrong or innocent. This can be a tough thing for people who prefer to have fun or learn a lesson. There is no lesson you should find yourself. <br /> <br /> Everyone praises acting, directing and music, but since it has been said so many times, I won't repeat it. > <br /> So if you haven't seen it before, do it - if you dare to challenge it!
