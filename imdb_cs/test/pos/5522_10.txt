Abe Zwick perfectly perfected it, beautiful. He never made another film, but created a brilliant portrait of a homosexual self-hatred in this film, which is as corrosive and influencing. He orders the screen, representing the crumbling debris of a man who crumbles under the pressure of an ever more meaningless life. Paul (Zwick) is an aging queen who has somehow convinced Stanley (Wayne Crawford), an eye-eyed idiot who has no sense of the future to follow his star. He is a tiny thief who has recently escalated hatred. He was forced to skip the city and move to a suburb in Miami. As a disguise, she dresses like a dried old blue stocking with as many sexual troubles as a church lady. She tells Stanley to tell his friends that he lives with his "Aunt Martha". Paul himself has no friends, spends too much time alone in the house and has to deal with Stanley's bad lifestyle. It would be enough for every man to cross the line into transgender murderous mania. Zwick once again portrays Paul as a tragic figure who has completely lost any understanding of how to relate to other people. In his anxiety, however, there is a certain poetry that slowly burns during the film. It is tragic but also elegant. This is a very sad movie. He certainly has many cheerful moments, but there is such an undercurrent of despair and despair that humor is bitter. This movie is worth watching Abe Zwick's performance. He could really build his career at Marta. It's quite gas once you know it. Just make sure you cut your hair and stop. He really hates it!
