"Chipmunk Adventure" is one of the greatest animated films of the 1980s. Alvin and Chipmunks were always interested in me because they got me into rock and roll. Neither Chipmunks has any bad features. Alvin is really a star and has all the amazing looks. Theodore is nice to be sensitive. Then there's Simon (my personal favorite), the smart guy who's often partying. I also like Chipettes very much. There's Brittany, who, like Alvin, is the one that always tries to be so popular. Then there's Eleanor, who, like Theodore, is sweet, sensitive and loves food. Janette is the only Chipette who is not very similar to her counterpart; He's very naive and really clumsy. In the very first Chipmunks movie, David Seville is on a business trip to Europe and leaves the boy with Miss Miller when she's gone. While playing an arcade game, Alvin loses against Brittany and then says that if he had the money, he would race on Brittany around the world. For children, he is the best-known man named Klaus Furschtien and his sister Claudia, who tried to come up with a tricky way to deliver diamonds around the world in exchange for cash, overheard the conversation, and said they would let them race around the world for $ 100,000. Alvin and Brittany accept it and go to the race. <br /> <br /> This adventure movie has a lot of great songs. "Off to see the World" created for a suitable movie theme song. Then there's "Getting Lucky", one of my favorite songs in the movie. "My mother" is most likely the happiest song in the movie, but it always makes me cry. "Wooly Bully" is the only title song used in the film (the rest was entirely original). Then, of course, there's "The Boys and Girls of Rock and Roll", which, in my opinion, must be one of the greatest music numbers in the history of the film. I watched this movie very often until the tape was recorded. But I still watch the movie. This is actually a fun movie for people who are going on vacation to a foreign country for the first time. This will give you an idea of ​​what you would expect from traveling around the world. Certainly one of my childhood movies and the one I would recommend to 80's fans and Alvin & Chipmunks fans.
