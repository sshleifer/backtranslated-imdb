As the father of four forties, I thought this film was a convincing look - if not on the edge. I deserve a much higher rating than the 4.3 I had when I wrote it. (I gave it to 7.) <br /> <br /> I agree with some comments about the characters, but Cameron Diaz was again in a very different role. The story was a little stupid, but instead of the film, it was beautifully summed up in the finals, quite unreal, succession. Moving end for each parent. I could imagine that young, one block can find a movie quite boring, but for other people who aren't set on high doses of testosterone would find something sweet in this.
