I think my husband and I are a little slow. Usually we do not warm up in series until they are almost at the end of their manufacturing lives. In this case, we didn't start watching KoQs until almost sixth season. I'm not sure how long it has escaped our radar. Besides, we're not big fans of "appointment" watching TV. Our plans are that we don't want to watch the show every time they come (and we haven't had a DVR yet). So I think it wasn't until TBS started running again on their daily lineup in the evening when we started to watch closely. By the time we were addicted, there were a few more seasons left before the series was canceled. But we are still watching almost daily on TBS. I almost prefer to see serials this way because you can watch several episodes every day and help build continuity and what's going on with the characters without waiting a week. But the episodes stand alone since the stories don't transfer from week to week. But that's okay with me because you can watch the episode, then miss the weeks - and still pick it up. My only criticism is that writing has not always been consistent. Some episodes would be incredibly cheerful and some would be just slightly funny. So I'm not sure it was the quality of the writers who had Seinfeld or Raymond. But I loved casting and the characters are quite plausible and realistic. Kevin James is just funny to look at it! So even if the storyline isn't so great, James's body talks and expressions make the show worth watching. Leah Remini is great as a "play-it-straight" wife. I think it's harder to play a straight character for laughter than a comic character, and it does a great job. She has sarcasm and insults like no one else. It's one hard cookie! And who can forget Arthur as Carrie's father who lives with them in the cellar. This great series and I was sorry when it was canceled. But big thanks to TBS for keeping the king alive in repetition!
