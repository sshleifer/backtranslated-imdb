I was looking at the Sleeper Cell with a little bit of concern about whether the terrorists would be celebrated. This fascinating series not only handled the topic responsibly, but created depth and essence for almost every character. Oded Fehr just engulfs the screen in every scene he is in, and while his character is the charismatic leader of a terrorist cell in jihad, he still has hypnotic appeal. Michael Ealy held his own well, though in some scenes I was wondering why he wasn't shot on the spot because of the frown he wore on his face. Fehr and Ealy, well-written characters, all of whom were believable and tragic, and troubling issues that the story dealt with. When I married a Muslim, the atmosphere was quite realistic. Disadvantages, to me personally, was that the female T&A was exaggerated like most gratuitous as well as some sex scenes. Despite the grip of the series that will make you think. Someone gives Fehr more juicy roles like this, and let him run with him. It has an incredible presence on the screen and a strange kind of innate power that radiates from it.
