Like many children born in the 1980s, I grew up on Mel Brooks films that were not necessarily "racier" like Blazing Saddles and History of the World Part 1 (but I saw you, of course, though not as often as now), but you that were meant for "the whole family", Spaceballs, and this movie. At that time I knew I hadn't seen a great art, but just a campground, goofy, though always a laugh, worthy of Robin Hood and / or adventure movies. But if it calls a family movie in quotation marks, it means that a) adults can really enjoy it just like children, if not more because of little jokes and stupid vulgarity, and b) once the child sees it when they visit it again, how I've had several times, it's still so fresh, but with some things that aren't quite first understood. It's a comedy that's not just full of jokes with Robin Hood's movies and other movies (of course the Godfather, but also a little mention of other modern films), but also those that also refer to Brooks own movies; it is a filmmaker who is not over playing entertainment even in his own style. The Basic Story - Robin Hood (Cary Elwes in one of his best moves) returns home from the Crusades to see what's happening with King Richard away and so goes up to cultivate his country and , naturally, rob the rich to feed the poor. Along the way, he meets Acho (Dave Chappelle), head butts with Prince John (Richard Lewis) and sheriff, and of course still pine for the love of Maid Marian. This is, of course, the usual line for Brooks to let the comedy run into the scene, and while sometimes a joke may not work, or it might become a repetitive watch, so it keeps on being hard to laugh. It also helps that a few bits are one of the best in any Brooksfilm, such as the Godfather Battle (Dom DeLouise at his best), Brooks' own portrait as Rabbbi, Lewis and Chappelle's acting turn and endless killed quotes. and a few language songs. Some of them are obvious, yes, some of them get right from the Blazing Saddles site, sure, but is it the right time for the right crowd? Certainly - and for parents who grew up in Brooks in the 1970s to work, this is a fantastic way to introduce young people to his work through it (even suggestive sex jokes and such are not R-rated, all in good fun).
