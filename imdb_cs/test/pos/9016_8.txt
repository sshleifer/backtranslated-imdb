It would seem that some previous reviewers might have had too high expectations in this movie. I found that he was scanning satellite channels for something (he didn't know what) and it happened on it. I thought by the title it could be one of the myriad soft-core porn movies that regularly appear on movie channels, but I was pleasantly surprised. Although there was some male frontal nudity (in fact, more than your typical soft-core title - go figure!), This was not the focus of the movie. It was just fun. Don't be fooled by my tastes: my recent screenings included the previous waterfalls and Europa, Europa (as geat, IMHO). But I'm also looking forward to a complete mental shutdown while watching the movie. Virtual sexuality has done it for me and it's not a bad thing!
