I didn't plan to see this movie, but I wasn't disappointed when my friend dragged me. Although there are no real surprises, the guys understand reasonably well with their obviously modest budget. <br /> <br /> If you've seen this trailer, you probably know what from this type of movie you can expect, and there's a fairly constant stream of jokes here, with a couple of classic moments, with a highpoint probably an excellent flashback on what guys were as in the 1980s. I also read elsewhere that the end was disappointing, but I found it refreshing from what I was expecting from this genre. Overall, this movie won't change your life, but it has a lot of laughter out there to entertain you.
