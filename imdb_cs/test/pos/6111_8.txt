The "Pink Flamingos" was revolutionary for its time, and even today it is still hard to watch. Not that I don't like the movie, it's fun; But it is very repulsive and Jonh Waters pushes the envelope as far as possible. The story is about Babs Johnson (Devine), he's the most vulnerable woman alive. She lives in a trailer with her son Crackers and daughter Cotton. Not to mention Edie's overweight, who is obsessed with eggs and sleeps in her crib. Then there's Connie and Raymond Marble, two dirty perverts who are jealous of Babs. He wants to overcome it by being the most vulnerable person alive. This means that their janitor must impregnate kidnapped women and sell children to lesbian couples, flashing people in public, and even send mail to Babs. Babs is fighting back to prove he's the noblest person alive. Which even includes incest, murder and eating dog crap and other sick sex acts. It's a movie that's fun for the whole family. (well depending on where you live?) Watch "Pink Flamingos" but don't forget the barf bag. For more perverse, weird sex and body functions also see "Sweet Movie".
