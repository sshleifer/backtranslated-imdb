(The review is from an original version from the 1950s that was not restored in the 1980s.) In a country where the king does not like and no one loves kings, the king of the shepherd and the chimney sweep of two close paintings comes to life. A portrait of a king who loves a shepherd kills a real king and takes his place. A huge bird, the title miracle, acts like a hero of species and helps our two lovers. This is a strange strange movie ... no surrealistic, very unreal. The background style is very European, while the characters are Fliescher meet Warner, but soon arty Warner of insignificant characters. They move in both realistic and cartoon behavior. It's a strange movie and it takes a little bit to get into it, but Peter Ustinov as a bird is uneasy, his kids and puppy are amazing. There are cops in rubber ducks and a bear design that makes you smile. And there is a deep philosophy in the film, about the existence of the world out there ... outside the metropolis underground city. This is a really elegant movie. There's something so special and unique about it that will reward you if you stay with it all the time. It's not perfect, but what the hell is it. <br /> <br /> This is the movie to look for. If your local DVD negotiation bin has a capcom version (paired with Alice in Paris) buy it. It should run you under ten dollars, about five and the price is absolutely worth it, especially when you realize it comes with two full length cartoons, two short cartoons and a few elegant ads and other fun stuff.
