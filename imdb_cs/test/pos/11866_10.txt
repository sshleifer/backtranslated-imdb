Very funny movie. Michael Douglas "To" Worth Watching This Movie If For No Other Reason. I'd like to see him do more of these low life roles. He was amazing, just like all the artists. The movie hit me just like American Roshomon, just fun and easier to watch because it was in America and didn't need any stinkin headlines! Br /> <br /> In a funny laughing movie every minute or so, two of the best were with John Goodman (not someone I'm crazy) - 1. Tells the priest that Jewel is doing something he liked and he says, "I had to wipe the smile off my face." The visual shows that she is not smiling and clearly a man who never smiles, but probably does not know. 2. A scene at the end between Goodman, who suited his cop's jewel, and shook the leather Reiser hunched over the table ... and two of them protested that they weren't gay to another character on the scene - deserves a special Comedy Academy Award.
