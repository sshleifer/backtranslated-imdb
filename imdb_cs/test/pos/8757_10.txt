I was very curious to see the original six-hour miniseries on which Steven Soderbergh's latest film was based, and now that I like to say that one is no better than the other. Both are smart, engaging and very fun. The only real advantage the miniseries has over the film is that it is three and a half hours longer, so we know the characters deeper. There is no false note that should be had in this production that you should definitely spend when PBS re-broadcasts these miniseries sometime in 2001. You will not regret it.
