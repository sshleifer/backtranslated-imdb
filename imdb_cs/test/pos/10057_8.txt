Nikki Finn is the girl I'd marry. Never get bored, always think positive, good with animals. Okay, as one reviewer wrote, a little too much peroxide, lipstick and eyebrows (only Madonna could get away with it). But that's why I love Nikki Finn, he's not your ordinary girl. He does things always exciting to be around and always honest. Sure, she's stealing, but she's not robbing or murdering (unless you're out of making her in). They know which rules may be violated and which rules should be followed. He knows what to take and what can't be stolen. If you need a favor from her, it's 100%. Bottom line: She knows how to enjoy life. Nikki is always loving (hence having a journey with wild animals) and is completely devoted to those she loves and who loves her. Who is this girl? It's the girl for me.
