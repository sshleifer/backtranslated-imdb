In view of the frightening results of Mick Molloy since I went to myself, I had quite a few expectations from Crackerjack. Even the movie posters made me nervous. In fact, if it wasn't because I got free tickets to the preview, I'd resist the pressure of the lady (who thinks Mick's a piece - there's a fear) to pay for it. /> <br /> The first few minutes of the movie bothered me - it starts with one of Micks tired of "getting angry at insignificant things" routines, but it was given an elegant touch that at least made it a little refreshing. The rest of the script was pretty good and very light - even the typical humor of Mick Molloy (and Judith Lucy) was delivered well, and when I never had to get out of the aisles, I generated much more laughter that I was expecting (and was consistent) . There's nothing new on the property - quite predictable, but it has moved quickly between lines and other jokes - I never felt that he was on any element too long or too short; Mick had to work hard to polish his script. There was one or two "late show" in-jokes, and one or two jokes that only Melbournians would get - but surely there is a lot of generic stuff out there for a wider audience. Something I found disappointing was the relative infallibility of John Clarke - he just doesn't seem to work like a bad man, but it doesn't take too much on the film. Exactly, I liked Australain comedy, and was pleasantly entertained throughout the film. I left the cinema with a decent smirk - which is pretty hard for my hard-core Australian comedy. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br />
