I remember watching this movie when it came out as a t.v. film of the week in the early 70s. Although I haven't seen this movie in over 30 years, I remember how scary it was ... the dead sister's body in the basement, the storm raging outside, the haunted house without electricity, and the killer still in the area. Just don't make TV movies like this. Elizabeth Montgomery was a very underrated actress and I liked her not only in "Betwitched" but also in several of her post-Bewitched roles like this and 1975 "Legend of Lizzie Borden". I really want someone to come out with a DVD that has a few of the 1970s movie movie of the week on one DVD. Wouldn't it be amazing to watch "When Michael Calls", "Bad Ronald", "Don't Be Scared of Darkness", "Crowhaven Farm", etc., All on One DVD? I know there is a market for DVDs like this for all of us baby boomers who grew up in the 60s and 70s. Maybe if we're lucky, once someone offers us a DVD with a large selection of t.v. movies like this.
