Robin Williams is a genius. One of the best comedians in the world. He really shows up in this, cracking jokes left and right as comedian Tom Dobbs. From the previous one it seemed that it was a sore laugh. And it was funny. But there were a lot of serious parts in the movie that I didn't expect. I would describe it as drama / comedy. But it is still worth seeing the money and I still found it almost all I expected. Robin Williams is in his best place with the famous Christopher Walken. They play a very good team in this movie and I was actually shocked to see how well the two were able to work together. I recommend anyone looking for a light film.
