A well-designed documentary targeting two Sudanese refugees who have relocated to the United States. It's your basic fish from a water story with a non-fiction twist. I found it fascinating to see how Peter and Santino lived before coming to America and how they adapted when they came here (in Houston, Texas). States. They go from hopeful idealists to somewhat more realistic skeptics. Wherever they go, bureaucrats meet with paper paths that most citizens can take for granted. They fear they are blacker than African-Americans here and do not feel accepted because of that. One of the "lost boys" manages to leave Houston to go to Olathe, Kansas, where he finds conditions slightly better but still less than ideal. There are people trying to help them and try to hurt them in this movie. They didn't show up but talked about them, those who gave them a gun to their heads and robbed them, which led one lost boy to negative comments that "all blacks in America are not good. I also found it interesting that they arrived in Houston in August 2001, a month before the terrorists attacked the World Trade Center. I was hoping to see their response to this tragedy, but it is not mentioned at all. Yet, in all, a really well done documentary without narration. None is really needed. "Lost Boys" do a great job that tells about the events that happen around them without any help, thank you very much.
