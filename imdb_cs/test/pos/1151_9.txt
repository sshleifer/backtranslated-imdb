Then I returned from Morocco, where my father was attached to the German embassy when the film came out in Europe; she took on all her friends, showed them the beauty of the country where Jimi played - and remained -; where the hippies stopped after leaving Ibiza and before entering Goa. Sean Combs recently celebrated his friends' restaurant in Marrakech recently, Djema el Fna was much wilder than he was in those days; The stones there went earlier, Brian recorded in Tangiers; so it's a memory and family fun and I'm glad my son will learn about North Africa and watch this movie. Candice Bergen looks beautiful and oo7 / Connery is really funny; and Teddy Roosevelt as Brian Keith played quite impressive.
