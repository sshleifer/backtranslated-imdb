Beautiful little production. <br /> <br /> The shooting technique is very unpretentious - very old-BBC fashion and gives a soothing and sometimes unpleasant feeling of realism to the whole work. The actors are very well selected - Michael Sheen not only has "all the polari" but also has all the voices down too! You can actually see the hassle-free editing led by links to Williams' diary records, not only is it worth watching, but it's a wonderfully written and executed piece. Master production of one of the great masters of comedy and his life. Realism will actually return home with little things: the fantasy of a guard who, instead of using traditional dream techniques, remains solid and disappears. It plays on our knowledge and our senses, especially with scenes about Orton and Halliwell and the ensembles (especially their flat with Halliwell wall paintings adorn every surface) are terribly well done.
