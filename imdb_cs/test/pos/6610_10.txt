In the mid-1970s groovy is a shabby bunch of harsh young Venice, California adolescents from broken homes and the bad side of the city, known as the Z-Boys, with its original attitude, radical unconventional cavalry, turning the former faithful world of professional skateboarding to the ear. the style and unbridled spirit of pure aggression in the face, the revolution in sport in this process, and the pavement of the path for many extreme variations on the sports that have emerged in their influential awakening. Director Stacy Peralta, one of the legendary Z-Boys themselves, combines the incredible use of this amazing crew with a harsh and hard way that is both informative and wildly entertaining. , bold photos bring one hell of infectiously kinetic buzzing, projecting a sense of total joy and full of energy that is absolutely a pleasure to see. Better yet, this document does not burden or refuse its objects: these tough guys were so strongly competitive and themselves decided that they all set out on their way when the bait of fame and wealth manifested themselves in their lives. The ultimate fate of certain guys is annoying and heartbreaking, with the gifted and spontaneous rating of skateboarder Jay Adams as the saddest and most tragic. The other guys are also very colorful and personal; Charismatic Ball Puffy and Defiant Fire Tony Alva especially comes as one arrogant but impressive piece of fiercely assertive work. Marvelously narrated with the wonderfully easy'n'breezy nasal nonchalance by Sean Penn. The amazing rock soundtrack also smokes seriously. However, what makes this documentary a winner is its refreshing complete lack of pretense: It is as dynamic, lush and bigger than the extraordinary life as the gloriously outrageous Z-Boys.
