I really liked this movie, it reminds me of my high school days. The soundtrack is amazing. I am a huge fan of a nice cage and this is my favorite movie in which it is. I like the story, it's a total love story, unlike what it is. I think the one who graduated in the early 1980s (1980-1984) should see the film. It completely reminded me of high school.
