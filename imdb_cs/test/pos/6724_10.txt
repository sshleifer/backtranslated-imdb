First I saw a Korean version of Daisy. It happened as a simple love story that ran nicely from start to finish. I saw it three times as I waited for my director's copy to arrive. Then I got DC and watched it. Wow! I think this is REAL's first cut I've ever seen. Amazing how detailed is editing in both versions! DC is interpreted as a hardcore thriller, with a love story in the background. It moves slower than the Korean version. The variations between the two versions are so drastic that it looks like two completely different movies. I thought I'd wear out again if I watched the movie and tried to look at the added scenes. That wasn't the case. It really feels like I'm watching the whole new movie. <br /> <br /> While DC is 20 minutes longer than the Korean version, you will press hard to determine where or what has been changed. 2 seconds chopped here. Second joined. The whole scene was added here. Another one disappeared. In both versions, scenes were added, dropped, or re-arranged and reordered. In some scenes, entire lines of dialogue have been replaced or rearranged while the scene itself has been untouched. Even simple sound effects have been added / omitted from each version - they have a great impact on the mood of the movie and sometimes even change the scene's result. What appears to be a tender moment in the Korean version is sad, grim in DC. The ends of both versions leave room for interpretation. As far as I can say, both versions end LOT differently and were intended as such. <br /> <br /> I suppose most people get the director's cut of the movie and the movie will be pretty nice but a little long and boring. If so, check out the Korean version. Same movie, but a different feeling. I think it's a luxurious 3-DVD version that includes both cuts of the movie - not sure. The versions complement each other so well that as a couple I will watch Daisy more often than I do any of my other favorite Korean movies. I would say the Korean version is a nice love story I have watched once in a while. Director's cut, I'll watch maybe once or twice, then I'll never be when I find boredom. But they go so well together! For what I consider the best experience, I would say that I watch the Korean version first. Then watch the director's cutout to help you fill the gaps in the story you were curious about. The cut is the real star of the movie.
