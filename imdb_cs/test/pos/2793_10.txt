I love this movie (I don't know why it is called Pot Luck in England - it's a waste and a completely irrelevant name!), I spent 8 months in Barcelona, ​​not as an Erasmus student, but I lived with other strangers so it was just the same. It brings so many great memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries and from the city itself. I really want to see the sequel to 'Les Poupees Russes' (Russian dolls), I guess it won't be here? My brother saw it in France and said def was not so good, but he had a lot of the same cast (Wendy's brother got married). Anyone who knows anything about this movie? and whether it can be released?
