If you can watch the 1983 Bond movie, which isn't as good as Octopussy and still enjoy it. <br /> <br /> If you can receive production values ​​that are not so high above the TV movie level. If you can look at Sean Connery with wrinkles on his forehead under apparent toupée and still see James Bond. If you can get through inexperienced Basinger, the weaker Largo and the cheerful Q. <br /> <br /> If you can learn to love an idiosyncratic score, not there with Barry on his worst day. <br /> <br /> If you don't believe hyperbolic reviews, it was welcomed with the release. <br /> <br /> If you can meet a poker battle and a video game that takes place and enjoy the same things. Sincerely, you'll never say anything and everything in it. What's more, you'll probably enjoy it, my son!
