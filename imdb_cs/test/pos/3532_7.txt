I have postponed the purchase since his DVD release? for one thing, because I was somewhat overwhelmed by the two other director's horror titles (SQUIRM [1976] and BLUE SUNSHINE [1977]), but also the fact that the film itself says it was slightly cut off for gore at Media Blasters / Shriek View 2-Disc Set! Now I figured it out as a rental and I'm glad I did it ?? because not only is it superior to earlier efforts (at least on this preliminary assessment), but I also found that the film is one of the better imitations of Texas juggling SAW MASSACRE (1974). But this factor only helped me remind myself that I haven't tried another example yet? Wes Craven's classic THE HILLS HAVE EYES (1977), which I bought a 2-Disc R1 from Anchor Bay some time ago, but after all, Halloween is fast approaching ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie handles effortlessly turbulent atmosphere (was shot in the forests and mountainous regions of Oregon)? with lots of effective frissons throughout but, fortunately, not too much violence (even if the last of the villains is sent in a fairly outrageous fashion!). The main young actor here (one of them played by son son of Jack Lemmon, Chris) is not as uncomfortable as the ones we usually encounter on this type of genre offer? in spite of free devotion to Shenanigans, one encounters teen-oriented movements, which to a large extent still persist! George Kennedy seems like a nice Ranger; Although he has nothing to do, his characterization is definitely improved by making him a lover of plant and animal life. Also notable among the locals is the well-known character actor Mike Kellin in a nice role as a drunk who first comes into contact with the murderous duo of the story? His warning to teenagers, of course, goes unnoticed, but he is later able to lead Kennedy to them. The Hermetic Family Teens Bump In The Woods, Then Them Revealed It Hides The Skeleton In Their Wardrobe. While one of the girls shows real curiosity about the presence of intruders, the rest is openly hostile to them? and in the case of turbulent and uncomfortable twins properly haunted (one of them is even prone to manic laughter during his rampage); at some point the Ranger even offers an interesting explanation for the nature of his aggressive and generally uncivilized behavior.
