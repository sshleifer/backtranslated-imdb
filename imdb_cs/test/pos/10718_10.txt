This is a phenomenal film. Really one of the best movies I've ever watched. I am a serious critic and it excites me a lot, but this film had all the right combinations for "mixing". The passion of actors, without overclocking, sore for all involved characters, serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce, all have to see the film, despite the fact that it is the 1970s. This is definitely not an "old movie", but a classic / vintage movie. I hope you will deal with it just as much as I do when you think about how volatile relationships of all kinds can be when you also think about how profound the pain associated with love can be and how hard the decisions will always be the most painful, but as soon as The pains are receding, but only gradually. This film certainly shows that the most stable relationships are not necessarily weak relationships and that leaving is certainly not synonymous with lost / lack of love. The 'creation' of this film is definitely coming from a place deep in someone's heart and mind.
