Read this: <br /> <br /> BOYZ 'N HOOD is a SCENE-BY-SCENE, COMPLETE RIP-OFF of this movie. Two friends in the hood, one focused on intellectual pursuit and the other on the athlete. A friend who is an athlete joins the wrong people and kills them. (The athlete just happens to be Washington from "Welcome back, Kotter".) <br /> <br /> That makes me crazy that people don't know. Every time I go to a video store, it bothers my mind and Boyz 'n Hood is in the' Drama 'section while Cooley High is in' Comedy '. It's an embarrassing shame. This film is more fun and dramatic than John Singleton's rip-off. At least Singleton could have dignity to say that his film is a tribute to Cooley High, but no, he never said a word. Boys 2 Men, however, named their record footage after this movie.
