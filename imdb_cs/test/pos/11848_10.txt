I paid attention and enjoyed the very rich speeches of chief actress Julianne Nicholson. I have no words to describe how enchanted I was. All the actors and actresses played well. Especially I noticed a solid good character that was consistent in predicting the future - Andy Richter, who played Carl. I think the idea of ​​showing different friends and relatives with different opinions and several consulting meetings is like a real world. Jay Mohr, who played Ed, the future husband, also played very real behavior. However, I want to reiterate the point of a very rich expression repertoire that Julianne Nicholson is able to do and does naturally, was amazing to me. The theme that this film deals with seems to me to be very important and touches on the very meaningful ideas of many people. I saw this movie several times and I wasn't bored. He rises over and over again in my thoughts.
