The only complaint I heard about this movie was that it was slow. Although this is the right point. These two characters encounter unforgivably, and the slow creation of tension creates anxiety between them. Complex and subtle gestures and minimal dialogue lead to tension where an otherwise normal argument shocks the audience. Istanbul and the surrounding area are dreamy, fascinating scenery and the plot is exciting - not in the "look", the hero blew up another car and he is now flying his motorcycle. I had winter on my spine as the figures moved in and out of their spheres and watched as the fog swallowed Istanbul.
