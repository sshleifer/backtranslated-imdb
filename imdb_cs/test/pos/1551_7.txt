After Columbo was in the air for a while, he returned with some new mysteries that were created for television, and although they are not as good as the original series, they are better than the shows that were made in the late 1990s. "Murder can be dangerous to your health" then uses (and I think if you think about it) a real crime shows up as a murder situation. Murder is committed by a very successful, egomaniac, a real guest of the crime show, George Hamilton (in a nice piece of casting). His chain-smoking nemesis who lost his job on him, played by Peter Haskell, attempts to blackmail Hamilton when he reveals Hamilton porn videos with a minor actress in his salad days. Hamilton uses Haskell's cigarettes to deliver a deadly blow to poison, giving him an alibi. Columbo is brought to see what happened. You know the rest. Highly fun.
