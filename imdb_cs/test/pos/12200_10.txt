The surface was one of the few truly unique shows on television last season. I can honestly say I've changed my plan to be home to watch every episode. Tons of action, tension, science fiction, etc. <br /> <br /> The story was about a boy who found an egg that hatched into a sea creature. The same sea creature who killed the main character's brother and the female figure (oceanographer) saw. Most people think it's a deadly killing machine, but the one who was raised from the egg was very friendly. The only problem is that NBC is canceled, so we'll never know what's going to happen ... Hopefully Sci-Fi or any other channel will pick it up.
