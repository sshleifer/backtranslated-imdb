This is definitely the movie "must see". Excellent director Alain Chabata (also featured as Ceasar) has managed to capture the essence of "Astérix Adventure" (the French comic book on which it is based) and create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy that is also a tribute to the world of animated films. This movie is so fun, so full of jokes (both visual and spoken) that it could take two or three projections before you notice them all, among your flashes of laughter. The only drawback is that a non-French audience (or at least a non-French speaking audience) may not get all the "private jokes". There are so many translations that cannot be translated, so many situations that are directly related either to comics or to the French way of life that entertainment can be alleviated. However, it is still worth seeing on the beautiful picture, stunning stunts, music, absolutely crazy atmosphere and excellent acting. All the actors are great, but the film would not be the same without Jamel Debouze, Gérard Darmon and Edouard Baer. And please, you can't compare EVER with this horrific movie with a horrible previous movie based on the same comic books: "Astérix et Obélix Contre César" and director Claude Zidi.
