At the time that movie was made most housewives knew exactly who Barbara Stanwick was parodying. Today only some women over 50 probably remember Gladys Taber, whose column "Walnut Wisdom" ran in the magazine Family Circle from before World War II until 1970. She lived on the Stillmeadow Farm in Conecticut and her columns were collected in several books, Stillmeadow Seasons, Stillmeadow Daybook, etc. The lines that Barbara Stanwick recites when she wrote them for her column are typical of those that started the typical Gladys Taber column. A lot about your favorite dogs, mostly cocker spaniels. You can say that Martha Stewart is Gladys Tabor today. <br /> <br /> Christmas is Connecticut doesn't have to be any movie masterpiece, but it's a nice, cheerful fun, soothing stress, and that's good enough
