a few years ago I saw this movie, without subtitles, on TV, and although I didn't understand a word about what the characters said, I still have a general idea and the film's mood fascinated me no end. Finally I saw it again a few weeks ago. my heart skipped when I saw the picture in the TV guide, and for 8 days before the movie was actually shown, I told everyone I knew I'd go and see it. the story reminded me of the dizziness of alfreda hitchcock. a slow, tense movie about a guy who someday believes he sees a girlfriend who disappeared years ago. What follows is a wild ride on the flashback rollercoaster, changing perspectives and truly inventive twists in the plot, and at the end of the movie I stayed breathless. I definitely didn't get what I expected (and I actually saw the movie!). Be prepared to be confused. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
