I enjoyed this movie and to this day it's one of my favorites. The story was excellent, though its end was too predictable and I knew what would happen too soon. Usually, when it happens, the movie is spoiled for me (like "The Other"), but even though I knew the result was, I enjoyed it to the end. Looking over the comments of other people was amazed by the performance of Kelly Overton (Eve), I'm afraid I wasn't. Her performance seemed to be a weak part of the film, unlike the amazing performance (or characterization) of James Haven (Don Wake) ... I hope to see him more. What a little movie that is recommended to everyone!
