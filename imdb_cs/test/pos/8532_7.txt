Shooting is cheesy. Some actors are exaggerated. Some actions are inexplicable and inexplicable. But ... <br /> <br /> This film is in the psychological drama of the 1950s. It's a moral game. Similar to the film in which the "method" actor becomes evil character he portrays on stage, Ed is forced to watch slasher movies because he is a film editor. It gives him a nervous breakdown that leads to a complete psychotic break. <br /> <br />
