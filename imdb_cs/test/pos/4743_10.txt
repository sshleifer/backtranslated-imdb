Things that are now just "news" have been taken in this shocking document. I'm afraid that as the investigation proceeds, the producers of this film will be defended in a spade. Producers show us Davidians, government agents, investigators, with all their mistakes and all humanity. Nothing the reviewer could say could reach the impact of tracking and listening. Pieces of Evidence - Congress Testimonies, 911 Tapes, News Footage, Expert Comments, Interviews, Photos and Home Videos - are seamlessly woven together and telling a disturbing story. <br /> <br /> Don't wait. Check out this movie and tell your friends.
