I think those who have been in a unilateral relationship of some sort will be able to identify with the leading character Minako (Yuko Tanaka), a 50-year-old woman who is still in good pink health as her daily work has shown. grinding routine awakening very early in the morning to prepare for milk delivery work, where she must take Megmilk bottles into a bag on the route around her city as a watch, exchange empty bottles for full and collect payments and receipt. And it is always that one delivery stop at the top needs to enlarge a long stair step to achieve customer satisfaction. And it was this stop that was a break that a man with whom he is in love with for almost all his adolescence in adulthood, and did not rate the product, but poured himself a sink. When we went to the same school, we see that they don't talk together and in their daily lives they always seem so close physically, but so far. There is no eye contact except for random views by chance, and little recognition of their existence. We have learned that he shares the past, which apparently destroyed all the notions of being together, where the clear attraction between them was hampered by the further development of the earlier generation. While I thought Minako was an intriguing woman in herself Whoever kept her feelings suppressed for so long, she might wonder what damage she would do. If I read that the original Japanese title means "At some times you read books," and it is accurate, I felt that the movie had a wonderful final with this shot from its well-stocked library, which is likely to suggest that it is not alone everyone, and probably returned to her crutch to deal with the pain of being alone, and back to the lifestyle she was used to for 50 years. Besides immersing himself in two jobs, he has those books that serve as a form of escape, and occasionally a pen of little sweet note on a radio show. Yuko Tanaka did a laudable job as an emotionally strong woman resigned to her fate and her decision to love anyone else, her object of affection, Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe) was a more interesting character with more aspects. Staying true to the promises of marriage, he spends a considerable amount of screen time fostering his ill bedridden wife (played by Akiko Nishina), while juggling his work of social welfare in the Department of Children's Affairs in City Hall. I felt that as a childless couple, his work provided him with the means to care, not for his own, but for the children of other people, for those who are troubled and neglected. In a rare moment of anger, we see angrily chasing such overwhelming parents who do not respect and waste their children's lives. The story of Kenji Aoki provides little things to make his characters appealing and has successfully tried to provide much more insights and dimensions to them, such as how Takanashi is the hopeless poet Haiku despite being a member of Haiku , and support characters such as Minagawa's old couple, where Masao (Koichi Ueda) borrowed some comic, though sad moments, when he slowly became senile, while wife Toshiko (Misako Watanabe) tells and brings us through this one woman's love story in 50s. enlightened state of knowledge of your husband's past and selfless and painful decisions in your ill condition. It is what you can expect from a typical Japanese romantic movie, without young young people as stellar cros sed lovers, but with all the other elements on the spot, such as romantic set ups, love songs and those quintessential limited but loving behavior. I thought the story was in danger that when unrequited love gets over, but director Akira Ogata managed to avoid the usual melodramatic moments in such stories, though the story called for some obvious plot development in the final act. what you can predict, especially if you've missed your Romanesque movie 101. <br /> <br /> It wasn't your average story with a nice dovey, I thought Milkwoman said a strong story with unrequited love as a central theme and frankly , a recommended romantic movie (although it is measured at a measured rate) if you are in the mood for some bittersweet loving, memories and efforts to live without regret.
