As a giant fan of horror, I surrendered in a vampire sub-genre because in most vampire whiskers a vampire has become feminine and threatening, benign and basically weak. That was the attitude I brought to the Soul's Midnight tour, and I am glad that the vampires in this film are at least hungry to kill the old ladies and sacrifice the children! Armand Assante, one of my favorite actors of all time, was born to play a charming vampire with wild intensity. Another thing that interests me is that the Borgo Hotel is the central location. That's fine because (and I went back to high school to find out) in Dracula, where Jonathan Harker needs to get to Dracula Castle. Finally My Hats Anyone has decided to make the creation a true effect and not a damned CGI! This is one thing that is great on many low budget movies, they can't afford to irritate the computer effects that plague many Hollywood monsters. The Bottom Line ... This is surely better than Underworld, especially if you're the purest vampire. Cheers, JA
