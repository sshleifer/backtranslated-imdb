I bought this movie last night and I love it. They all played great, especially Ryan Dunn and Bam Marger. The whole story was great, and as Dunn said in the DVD comparator, he seemed to survive it all again. This movie made my number one place in my favorite movies! I can't stop playing scenes again and again to see it again. I've never done it with any other movie. I would definitely recommend it to others to watch because it's a great movie and if you like Bam Marger, it's a great movie for you !! Small photomontages that show between each scene are just great. I think it must be my favorite part of the movie. They are very sad, especially with the music from the band 'HIM', which is of course my favorite band.
