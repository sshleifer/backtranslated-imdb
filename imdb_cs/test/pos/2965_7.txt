To summarize this story in several sentences: A teenage girl (Amy) uses her hot body and "supposed" virginity to lure a young troubled guy (Matt) with a potential football scholarship to give her "Full Ride" out of town. Come to learn that it has a pretty good reputation & slept with many football players in the past hoping to offer her the same deal. Both of these children come from troubled and dysfunctional homes. Matt's mother, an alcoholic who has repeatedly troubled him before her friends and mother Amy, had a bad reputation herself and got pregnant with Amy at a young age. Matt falls in love with Amy and tries to straighten her life. Very predictable end. The actress who plays "Amy" is actually 33 years old trying to play a teenager!
