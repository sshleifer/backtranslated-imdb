I saw this film twice and I am very impressed with it. Interviews between Nimi and her mother and Nimi and Matthew are very moving. The Nigerian community is shown very true and as colorful as usual. Although some things could have been done with a little explanation; If we knew why Matthew was first in the south of France, the scenes after Matthew, which are in his car, would be more understandable. Fortunately, Optimum Releasing has a website that includes detailed production notes. that helps to better understand these scenes. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see it again, but unfortunately he had a limited edition in London and is no longer visible. I hope the video release reaches a larger audience because the film deserves it.
