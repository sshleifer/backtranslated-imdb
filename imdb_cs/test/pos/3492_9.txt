The way I learned about this movie was when I was watching American Pie 2, at the beginning I had a trailer for Ali G indahouse, I was watching the trailer and it made me buy a DVD, it looked incredibly funny! So the next day I went to the local store and picked it up for Â£ 3.99 (Bargain!). The film is about Ali G, who is a "gangster" in the West spots of a massive crew who are rivals in the East stained massive crew. Ali has a "Cub Scout" children's pack where he teaches them how to survive in the ghetto by teaching them how to swear and steal cars after Ali discovers that the government is stopping money coming to the leisure center where Ali teaches children, he runs for the MP for spots and overthrows another MP in his attempts to get rid of the leisure center to make room for the airport in spots. He laughs during the movie when Ali gets to some crazy things! Borat also appears in the movie for a few seconds, that's what he has to watch for a movie for all of Sacha Baron Cohen's fans!
