Some users are confused about the identity of armed men who go up the stairs of the "Odessa Staircase". These men are not Cossacks, but ordinary soldiers. The Cossacks arrive on the scene a little later and they are men on horseback who slash in the crowd with their sabers. <br /> <br /> For Russian History Professionals: Correct me when I'm wrong. But there are several lines in the movie that no one has ever learned. After taking over Potemkin, someone in the crowd on the shore says, "Kill the Jews!" That's just a few seconds on the screen, but it's there. How cruelly typical history, not only in Russia, but in many other countries, immediately, indiscriminately and instinctively blaming Jews for any domestic problems! Perhaps other parts of the film are not historically factual, but the cry against the Jews is too real. Comments, anyone? Also why can English speakers not learn to pronounce a name like "Potyomkin" instead of "Potemkin"? In Russian it is necessary to distinguish two possible pronunciations "e": either "ye" or "yo". Sometimes two dots are used to distinguish these two pronunciations but usually the distinction simply has to be memorized.
