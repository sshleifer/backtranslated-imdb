He just went to YouTube and finally watched this animated short film directed by Richard Condie. I used to watch his funny getting there. In this one pair plays Scrabble. The wife is still shaking her eyes while her husband has nothing but E on her side. The woman leaves for a while to suck up her bed and bath (!), Before she grabbed her husband, who was looking at her side. Briefly before that, the husband catches a television show called "Sawing for Teens" with the stars cutting something and the husband did his own. This program is interrupted by a special report on a nuclear war that is happening (a journalist is skeleton) when everyone is panicking outside, even though the husband has fallen asleep during this time and thinks the procession is happening when he and his wife are still arguing The game ... There are a lot of other bizarre things that happen before they touch the end. Pretty hilarious and well worth seeing all the buff animations out there. You can't wait to see more animated movies from Mr. Condie ...
