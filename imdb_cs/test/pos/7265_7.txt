This movie, no doubt, is the best I've seen and really shows what British talent can do. Its effects are extremely good given that the film takes place in the mid-18th century, and at that time all the dirty and disgusting filth of England is captured. The character is developed and complemented, from MaCleane's courage to develop it to the highway and exhibition film "The Gentleman Highwayman", which contrasts well with Robert Carlyle, who shows cynicism and honor that you can love thieves and criminals because I quote: "He got them more honor in his little finger than any of you fat bastards! "<br /> <br /> Of course you're not talking about you! But it is probably the most surprising and most emotionally charged scene ever recorded in the film, but all you have to do is just say it's a rope around your neck. <br /> <br />
