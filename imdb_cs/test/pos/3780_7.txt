Pretty funny stuff. Charlie still worked at his peak when he made it a little bold short about the soldiers in the trenches of World War I. Brave because, after all, the war is still going on, and that was a serious business comedy. Gags are fun without being jolly or jerky. One successful scene follows another, because Chaplin and his friends are trying to sleep in a bunker that is deep in the water. (This is where we got the term "trench foot" from.) Probably the most ridiculous episode of Chaplin disguised himself as a tree and thwarted any number of German soldiers trying to execute an allied soldier caught behind the lines. Edna Purviance, the main Chaplin woman at the time, is a woman who works with Americans and is also saved from execution. Chaplin would continue the funnier and more ambitious stuff, but it's better than most others. his short films during this early period.
