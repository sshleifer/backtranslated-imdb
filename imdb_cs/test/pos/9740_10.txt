In the 1960s Cleveland TV viewers could watch an episode of "Flash Gordon" as part of the Ghoulardi show (11:30 PM Friday). That was the best fake material every one of us ever saw in junior high. We should make regular "sleepovers" (though we didn't tell them) just to be on the fun while watching this thing with a group of friends. Then next week we will quote our favorite corn lines from the last episode. Watching today is the same reaction. But if you can stop laughing at dialogue, lame creatures, stupid costumes and terrible spaceships long enough, there are some good things that I didn't appreciate for the first time. Manufacturing designers have built some excellent sets, both in the room and in the lab. Charles Middleton's "Ming Merciless" character was everywhere-the best screen thief, sure until then and questionable better than anyone ever since. Jean Rogers is amazingly beautiful. Then again, what do I know? I'm just a child.
