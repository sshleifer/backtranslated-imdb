Just sophisticated to be credible and still a lot of fun, it's a clean piece of the seventies (even cops need a haircut!). Shooting in and around London, a conspiracy of an American former account who is trying to go straight, but finds himself as an electrician at a bank in Mayfair, and then has the bolts that gave the crime Lord David Niven, and finds that he committed a century crime is well processed. <br /> <br /> I liked its simplicity and even innocence, it goes back to a time when the bands of movies, where it is, capers, and violence were not part of the agreement <br /> <br /> All in all, they could do a lot worse than watching this: it has enough twists and turns to make some oomph and cast that apparently enjoyed doing it. <br /> <br /> Nicely made and guarded.
