For Greta Garbo's first interview, MGM wisely selected Eugene O'Neill's Pultizer Award winning 1921 to play ANNA Christie. Also wisely, producers backed Garbo up with not one but two members of the original Broadway Cast (George Marion as Anna's father, Chris, and James T. Mack as Johnny Priest - converted to "Johnny Harp" for movies to avoid insulting ". <br /> <br /> This little change is interesting. Just like too many accused films (those who want movies to be FILMS and ignore their beginnings), they're" a little bit more than plays ", the problem is not the game, but the filmmakers who would not be more loyal to this property. By diluting the great movie scene so that it does not touch or open it because many people have lost the first The respect that the studio had for O'Neill and Garbo, fortunately allowed ANNA Christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably at Frances Marion's sensitive screen. Sight, even permitting BOD scenes where Garbo's Anna reveals her past on a "farm" to a man he wants to take badly, and to a father who sent her in tact! What the League of Decency had to think about! The biggest source game problem has always been that Chris's friend Martha tends to leave with the first act and then disappears from the last two, so Anna can have a stage - both sides of a really good woman don't always recognize men. Perfectly cast Marie Dressler (who cut off her teeth at Broadway before leaving for Hollywood) is the perfect balance for Anna Garbo in the area and also for a fast-moving movie just 90 years old. minutes, will not allow us too much time to miss it - one of the few benefits of the atmosphere is shown rather than eloquently described in the original - And screenwriter Marion is wise enough to stray from O'Neill to get Dressler back on touch the scene two-thirds of the way through the movie, which will commemorate the many other acts of Julie Laverne in SHOW BOAT. The earlier scene of Anna and Marthy together on screen (16 minutes into the movie) compare each other's peace and set all the tension of the rest of the story. Do not miss. ANNA Christie is a great tragic game and a good movie drama. It is hard to imagine that the remake of the last day, which would almost certainly lose gravel and the atmosphere of this 1930 remake (which was first filmed without sound in 1923 - also with the original Broadway George Marion), could improve on this excellent shoot. <br /> <br /> The inner scenes are closest to the game, but no one should look outside to watch the atmosphere. While background work is not in line with modern technical standards, backgrounds provide a better view than most real-world movies in which the game is set up (especially in New York). Almost all the naturalistic performances of Garbo's era have grown great (just too often a parody scene of death from CAMILLE, 7 years later, sometimes drawing snickers for heavy handed direction and parody), but this ANNA Christie, NINOTCHKA ("Garbo Laughs!"), Along with a number of her 1932 films, MATA HARI and GRAND HOTEL, and the amazing touch of Lubitsch on her 1939 comedy, is definitely worth the best. About 'Neill Fans Who Are Taken With This Game On The Edge Of His Praised' Sea Plays, 'Should Track Down The Fine World War Shaped Movie Issued In The Year Before The United States Entered Conflict, LONG VOYAGE HOME (1940). It is almost as skillfully drawn from those marine games as this is from ANNA Christie, and features young John Wayne in one of his rare non-Westerns promoting the fine cast of veteran actors showing him the way.
