This is one of the best movies I've seen from a silent era (sad to say I haven't seen too much except Chaplin / Keaton). Very visually brilliant, with an insanely influential style in style and composition. Really unique (especially for its time) camera angles and extremely hectic adjustments. He must definitely see a movie nerd. The downside is that it's a little too much in your face about his politics (I don't have a problem with the politics in the movie if they are subtle or at least somewhat imperceptible as the back seat to the story). Also, it's not a "fun" movie that's fine, but it's not something I'm going to watch billions of times. This is an art simple and simple like it or not. It is worth it that A + be influenced by myself, but on the basis of personal enjoyment I give A.
