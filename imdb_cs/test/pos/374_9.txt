Safer. Hitchcock is a cinema from time to time; but we all know that our perversions are ours too, so we forgive him. And we not only forgive him, but we also wish him a clever way to invite us for an unforgettable train ride. I saw Hitch's 1953, I admit, a week before this, and I both put it in the same category as part of his trademarks. These trademarks reside in his genius, which questioned and throbbed his artistic veins, spilling psychological drops of blood on the viewer, without leaving any stains of guilt, instead of a very subtle awareness of ashame. The pen is always more powerful than the sword, and Hitch firmly wrote the most controversial questions with his wrist and then held his hands firmly, holding cameras that always reflected people who yearn for blood (most people have), otherwise the comedy would not be Mostly a tragic thing and making people laughing wouldn't be that difficult. Mixing all the dark elements of "high society" with a rich psychopath Bruno and an ambitious tennis player who wants to be a politician, Guy, the story is one of the Most Well Designed and Guided by Hitch, inspiring many filmmakers, not just with his plot, but with intricate images provoking dark smiles and happy nightmares. <br /> <br /> Hardly perfect!
