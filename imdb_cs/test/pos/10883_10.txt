This game requires stealth, smart and stable hand. The game is simply the best; What's more, add-ons are interesting - bullet holes remain in the walls, enemies react to specific places where they were hit by bullets, there are tons of motion-captured animations that make enemies look very real (for example, looking through the window at the guard where where it flies, sneezes or scratches, the list goes on. This is the best licensed / movie conversion ever and it puts you in a suavest super spy bot. This game is the best reason for N64 ownership.
