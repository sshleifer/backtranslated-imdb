what was the quote of the archbishop tutu at the end of the film about the past of man? this film was very disturbing when looking in the sense that it was a real story and that I think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years that it is ashamed <br /> <br /> everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their lives in peace and harmony <br /> <br /> live and let live <br /> <br /> if someone knows the quote please let me know <br /> <br /> this movie would It should be shown much more publicly as real events that are horrible, as stated in the movie, it should be known to everyone in the hope that things will change sooner than later.
