I know Gerrit. He currently lives in the USA. This film is based on events in the life of Gerrit and Celeste Wolfaardt. It's a remarkable story. That inspired me to read "Cry, beloved country." The film is well made. The music is beautiful. The story is told in flashbacks. You will learn the stories of the white South African racist (Gerrit) and the black South African (Moses). Their lives intersect violently. The End Is Not Typical Hollywood - It is unusually realistic and ends with a note that encourages you to think about characters and topics. <br /> <br /> Remember to review your credits - see Gerrit footage in real life.
