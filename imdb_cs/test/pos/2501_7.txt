This movie isn't half bad. It can be a little long at times, but carried along the beautiful scenery, IMMENSELY beautiful love letter and great actors, you can forget about time and enjoy. The main prize, however, is Blythe Danner and Geraldine McEwan as well .......... that it would be a storytelling, but they are just great!
