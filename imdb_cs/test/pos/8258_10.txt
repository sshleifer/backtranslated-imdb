Please why not give this fantastic DVD movie, I was looking just like a previous writer for years, what to hold or show it on TV. his so underestimated his one of the most romantic and beautifully written books that i have ever read, and i believe i've read some.I seem to think it was read on radio 4 but i can't find that one. Why not try and make it even, I promise it will be the highest earnings, people love the kind of stories, so please either release it and take us out of our misery or remake, even if I doubt it might be improved. Does anyone have read on the ground the same author or seen a movie with Jennifer Jones, it is excellent, but not in the same range can be.
