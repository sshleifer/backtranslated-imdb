I've seen the movie so many times, it's so good. Maybe because I can relate to Tittas's way of life is why. Not everyone would find it to their taste. Also, my Italien is getting better after every viewing. Am I a sad case? I thank Mr Sorrentin. I look forward to your next film. Although I didn't see the movie in the cinema, I have a DVD and would encourage everyone to buy it. Extra features are also worth it. The amount of time a director devotes to making a film is seldom appreciated, the DVD comparators give an excellent insight into filmmaking. As for the film's story, I'm more interested. It happened to me that I was all raving about my friends, but as I said, I relate very much to the main character who is a loner in a situation that is not his own choice. The Mafia in Sicily uses Titt to launder money at a Swiss bank. They owe them that they cost them millions of dollars in the stock market that went wrong.
