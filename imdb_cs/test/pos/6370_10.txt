Michael Ritchie's "Couch Trip" is a wonderfully anarchic comedy about what a good psychiatrist is doing. She is so gentle and impious that you begin to realize what it is. It is also Dan Akyroyd's best film, made in a particularly large film year (1988) for him. First, "The Great Outdoors" and now this. Akyroyd plays as John Burns, a career cheater that counterfeits to escape jail. Now it would be a stupid comedy. But "The Couch Trip" uses this as a springboard for everything else. Beverly Hills psychiatrist George Maitlin (gently grinning) has a nervous breakdown and has chosen a replacement: Lawrence Baird, who becomes Akyroyd's psychiatrist! You can pretty much guess what happens, but the great thing about "The Couch Trip" is not what happens but how it is done. "The Couch Trip" gives Dan Akyroyd the best role he has ever had. His John Burns is one of the truly original comic creations in film history. Part of it is a bad one steamer and physical humor, but what makes it special is that Akyroyd makes Burns a nice character. We spice behind it and grow so much that it likes it during 98 minutes of running time. But Akyroyd isn't alone here. He receives strong support from other great comic actors. Walter Matthau joins herself as a convoy minister who seizes Burns' secrets and commits delicate blackmail. Charles Grodin "slows down burns" his way to another big comic role as a burnt-out psychiatrist. Grodin was one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. He's a criminal who didn't use him more often. Richard Romanus plays Grodin's slimeball lawyer to perfection. "The Couch Trip" is one of many films made by the now defunct corporation Orion Pictures Corporation. MGM spent a fortune buying Orion's library, but they didn't get their acquisition yet. "Couch Trip" joins "dressed to kill", "blow out" and countless others in collecting dust rotting in the vault. Shame on MGM for their inaction. Hopefully, with the new leadership, the Couch Trip will find the audience and respect it deserves. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
