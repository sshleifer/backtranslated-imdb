The conspiracy "In the mood for love" is simple enough: A married man and a married woman (though not in contact) slowly develop a romantic bond with themselves. The pace of the film is insensitively slow and very little is happening between them. However, the background of Hong Kong in the early 1960s and the enthusiasm of director Wong Kar-Wai to capture the beauty of the environment, as well as the main characters, make this film a pleasure to watch. Actors Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are excellent and Wong Kar-Wai has done an extraordinary job of capturing the feeling and nostalgia of the past (something that so many films and directors do, but usually fail). There are so many minor details that add to the film's charm (director's trademark), and color and cinematography are what sends this otherwise simple story over the top as an amazing film success. 9/10.
