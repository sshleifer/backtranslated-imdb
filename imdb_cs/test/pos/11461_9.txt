I absolutely love this movie! Evil Dead has nothing on this movie! Demon Night 2 and 3 is total boredom, but this is a classic. It's super cheesy, and acting is fine at best, but what more would you like from a 1980s horror movie? Stooge has some of the best players ever to hit the screen. (She is my favorite character) Many people talk about the lipstick scene in this movie, but my personal favorite is the end, unfortunately, has nothing to do with the main characters when the old man eats his left over Halloween apples. the pie and his throat are crushed from the inside. The soundtrack is amazing. Angela's dance scene is totally scary, especially when the stroboscopic light comes on, and you can see her jump from one floor to the next with each camera shutter sound that clicks on the song being played. Make-up effects in this movie are pretty sweet; Angela gave me nightmares as a child. If you are the kind of person who demands perfection from your shooting experience, you may want to give this card. But if you're like me, and you're really biting a whole Halloween, a haunted house with a clich√© of demons than this one you must own.
