This film comes from Turkey, where you can't find any horror movie tradition. At first I was only afraid to follow the adaptation, but when I saw it, I changed my mind. He has an original script. Most players are not known young people, but their performance is proof that a new generation is coming. Maybe it's a sign that Turkish cinema is coming back after 20 years.
