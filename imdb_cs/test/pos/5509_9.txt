I don't understand where these bad comments come from. The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you a little scared to go to the car at the end of the night. <br /> <br /> The part that gets you is that it could all happen. It is not in the extent perceived in the film, but the whole idea is reality. This film took this reality and turned into Dee Snider's nightmare. Three inches (the third is from a dead body in my freezer).
