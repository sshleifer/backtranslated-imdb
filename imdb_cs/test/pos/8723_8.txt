Like I like Walter Matthau, I felt that most of his roles were adapted to his personality. This role is one of the exceptions. He plays a dentist who is both charming and dishonest. This role requires much more games than most other roles. I liked that the film is honest, as a professional can be dishonest to avoid a commitment in a relationship. His overall goal was to find a way to be in a relationship with a much younger woman, but he must not be committed in any way. Alibi - Using his secretary (Ingrid Bergman) to pretend to be his wife. At some point in the film, pretending to be Mr. and Mrs. are actually deceived into believing that they were actually really devoted. The end was good because a middle-aged man found that the pursuit of someone in his own age group was more valuable. The film was funny, funny and not sold out by preaching.
