There is always something to follow for such a film in the coming years. Clive Barker, the man who brought "Hellraiser", makes a horror movie that is part of Goth, part-mythology, and all the horror movies in between. "Nightbreed" is a bunch of mutants who come out at night and roam around a place called Midian. Now a man named Boone (Craig Sheffer) claims to be suffering from hallucinations that go into this shrinking Dr. Decker (David Croneberg) who "helps" Boone with his problems. Decker, who is not aware of this situation, claims to be a purist who is disguised as a hateful monger. But Boone goes to Midian and says there is one of the mutants. But a mutant named Peloquin (Oliver Parker) sees Boone as meat! His bite, however, saves Boone, so after being killed by a firearm glove, he is now one of them. After Decker was mistaken, Boone is doing everything in his power to protect Lori (Anne Bobby) from him. Lori saves the mutant from the sun and in turn helps others. I liked Mrs. Mutant, who gives a smoky "kiss of death" and a woman Porcupine who dreamed Boone to show off her power, which is so seductive and deadly. I enjoyed this horror movie all the way, and the rule is that you never trust shrinking! Rating 3.5 out of 5 stars!
