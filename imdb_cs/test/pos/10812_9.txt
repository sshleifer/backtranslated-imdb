This film from 1794, the second year of the French Republic, created after the execution of Louis XVI, captures the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders Danton (Gerard Depardieu, his best) and Robespierre (the magnificent performance of Polish actor Wojciech). Pszoniak). The gentle revolutionary, Danton, has returned to Paris from his country estate, where Robespierre has been dismissed as head of the Public Security Committee since last year. He is opposed to the "reign of terror" which resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens, mainly by guillotine, who are thought to be opposed to revolution. Danton is convinced of the support of ordinary people and tries to persuade Robespierre to suppress bloodshed. But Robespierre and the Committee fear that Danton's popularity will lead to their overthrow, and Danton and his followers will be brought to justice for traitors. It was the first French film that Andrzej Wajda made after arriving in France from Poland. His Polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support of the Union of Solidarity Union, which opposed the Polish government in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His previous film "Man Of Iron" (1981) dealt with the Solidarity Department and its leader, Lech Walesa, and it is easy to compare relations between Wales and Polish leader General Jaruselski and the relationship between Danton and Robespierre. Danton / Walesa is the voice of reason against Robespierre / Jaruselski, who continue dictatorial rule despite the fact that they have lost the support of the people they claim to represent. The film is based on the Polish play "The Danton Affair", written by Stanislaw Przybyszewska in the 1930s, and some have criticized the film for its release for being static and theatrical. But the film focuses on the meetings of committees and scenes in the National Assembly and on the courtroom rather than on the streets of Paris.
