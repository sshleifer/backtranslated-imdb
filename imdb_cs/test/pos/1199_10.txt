The anti-war musical "Hair" is my cult number one film. I don't know how many times I've seen this movie in film theaters and VHS, or how many times I've listened to a stunning soundtrack CD, and this masterpiece has finally been released on DVD in Brazil. The pacifist and moving story is still amazing, the hymn of freedom, friendship and freedom of choice, and images of the resistance of the generation against the stupidity of war. I don't know what happened to this amazing generation of 70s counter-culture and their dreams, because the current world is probably worse than in the 1970s. I don't remember winning an Oscar in 1979, but Treat Williams and John Savage deserved at least a nomination for their amazing performances. Beverly D'Angelo is extremely beautiful in the role of a hypocritical spoiled high-class teenager. I saw "Hair" probably more than twelve times and my eyes always wet, while Berger goes to the plane singing: "It's me, it's me, it's me," and I start crying with his tombstone in the cemetery. I believe this is one of the most beautiful, sad, and moving conclusions of the cinema history. This woman is also loved by my wife, my daughter and son. therefore I can guarantee that "Hair" is timeless and recommended for all viewers. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Hair"
