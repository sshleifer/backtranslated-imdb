Lackawanna Blues is a moving story about a boy who is raised in a house by some pretty unusual people. It's a cut and a soundtrack that really pulls you into the story and lets you experience the film as the writer really wanted to see. Music is a truly bound story that comes to life. The cut made the story more progressive and engaging. I was also surprised by some of the cast performances, especially by S. Epatha Merkerson. I can't wait to see a performance of one man who presents these films to writer Ruben Santiago-Hudson.
