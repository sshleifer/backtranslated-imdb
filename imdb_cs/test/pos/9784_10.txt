Critics say this film is one of the worst movies ever. The Rangers also claim the same thing. But there's a flip side to the coin. They're bad, very bad. It's the most intelligent movie I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> From start to finish you see a story that's unrealistic. A story that reflects the real world. This film is like a mirror. You see another way that people see you. To understand the directors' opinion, you have to see it again ... <br /> <br /> When you see this movie ... Try to understand the story (and follow the background) ... Listen to the lyrics of music ... A feel industrial complexes ... <br /> <br /> This film is of a kind. You will hate it (most people do it) or you will like it (and you will understand it completely). Ernest Hemmingway once said, "The world is a good place and worth fighting." I agree with the second part.
