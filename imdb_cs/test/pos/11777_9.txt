I just got a DVD for Hardware Wars, in a shiny new package, looking irresistible. I stuck it in my DVD player to find more fun stuff. More DVD content is even longer than a movie. For those of you who have (shame!) Never seen the Hardware Wars, it's a fantastically stupid Star Wars spoof (of course from Episode IV). Household appliances (eg, Irons, Toasters, Vacuum Cleaners and Waffles) stand behind Ty-fighters, X-wings, R2D2, and Star of Death. Instead of Princess Leia, we have Princess Ann-Droid, complete with Cinnabon hairstyle. Are you sure. Mad Stupid and Fun Ride for All Star Wars Geek (Like Me!) <br /> <br /> Now, DVD - wow! The director's commentary, which essentially turns off the film, makes fun of himself and the whole project. Interview with Fosselius about Creature Features and a cheerful "director's cut" and "foreign version" of the movie (of course, all the jokes). Anyway, it's great. I loved the Hardware Wars in the theater and I'm glad I had a DVD in my collection - wedged between MST3K: Movie and Thumb Wars!
