After I read that '' At the time of its release in 2002, its budget of $ 47 million, or FRF 327,000,000, was said to make it the most costly French movie ever. However, Astérix et Obélix contre César (1999) had a budget of $ 48 million, or FRF 274,620,000, making it the most expensive French movie ever "I discovered why I considered this film to be one of the most beautiful and beautiful." Colorful of everything I've ever seen. I loved the scenarios, clothes (especially those from Cleopatra) and the atmosphere of the movie! It's so happy and happy! I found clever and cheerful jokes and I must consider this movie to be in my favorite comedy of all time! The cast is also excellent, with Monica Bellucci (who is very beautiful as Cleopatra) Gérard Depardieu, (Big Obelix! Christian Clavier, Jamel Debbouze (I saw this for the first time in '' Amelia Poulain '') others! :) <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to people who don't do it I know Asterix and Obelix comics. You'll have lots of fun! aka <br /> aka "Asterix e Obelix: Missão cleópatra" - Brazil
