It is no surprise that Larisa Shepitko was married to Elem Klimov, who would later direct the most horrific war film ever made, "Come and See (1985)". 'Output (1977)' ?? Shepikto final finished movie before premature death ?? it is built in the very same form. During World War II, the film follows a pair of Soviet guerrillas trying to provide food for their starving army while avoiding the occupying German forces. The first forty minutes is terribly tense, because both men stretch in the rough, snowy landscape, the world around them has completely disappeared with life, heat and color (really so monotonous is the scenery that literally took me to realize long ago that the film was shot in black and white). After capturing the guerrillas by German soldiers, the film becomes a cold meditation on loyalty and morality. While Sotnikov (Boris Plotnikov) refuses to betray his army, even under extreme pressure, the less resolute Ryback (Vladimir Gostyukhin) is trying to save himself. Is it wrong? Ryback's betrayal is daunting, but the film does not condemn his actions treacherously; the viewer is forced to consider what their own reaction could be in such a situation. Shepitko pities Ryback as a biblical damage to Judas. Both men betrayed their allies to the enemy and were forced to follow them. However, while Judas committed suicide by hanging up (at least according to Matthew's Gospel), Ryback found that this possibility was closed to him as well? in an extremely tense climax, the waistband opens around the neck. <br /> <br /> 'Output' draws its emotional strength from Shepitk's amazing realism. I have no doubt that the two main actors spent the days at the end walking around the snowy ground on their hands and knees, and their misery is really so convincing that I was watching the movie (I really did). Interestingly, the film faces this reality several times when Ryback introduces himself to want to offer freedom, and then is shot dead by German prisoners. This device, though unusual, works well with its Biblical allegory; Ryback is judging his worth and facing a new dilemma at every turn he chooses a selfish alternative, his own life as the only decisive criterion. He is still alive at the end of the movie, but the nightmare of war and guilt persists.
