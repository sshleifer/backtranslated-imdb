I think "Key West" can do well as a DVD. There's probably a lot of unsuccessful Star Trek that never had a chance to succeed. We'll never know if it could be a big series. I wonder if there is a way to see older shows like this, or are they just other notes from Hollywood? Is it possible to find copies of these shows so that loyal oddballs can enjoy them again? The show had great writing talent and some if not all episodes left you with a feeling for the characters that is often lacking in today's hit shows. very unique characters. Thank you.
