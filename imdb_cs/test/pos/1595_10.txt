If all the films had to be destroyed and only one could be spared, Death in Venice would have to be. It is a monument in film history. Much criticized for being slow, boring and too obvious in that it is a point (the old man discovers beauty in a young boy and is tragically destroyed, first mentally, then physically), we should appreciate this film for what it is Yippee. "Morte and Venezia" were shot more than 30 years ago, and this is even longer in the early twentieth century. Life was slow compared to the present. People should behave in a certain way, hiding their real emotions from themselves. Director Visconti and Dirk Bogarde, a leading actor, succeed admirably in how the aging composer Von Aschenbach discovers his romantic interest in the young boy. For a man like von Aschenbach, he had to be too strong in his time to deal with him. We see his inner struggle, mostly on the face of Bogarde, against the beautiful background of Venice and accompanied by the most beautiful music written by Gustav Mahler. <br /> <br /> This movie is slow. . No special effects, car chasing or fighting to tie the audience to their seats. No perverted sex scenes; the interaction between man and boy is limited to alienated views from a distance and an occasional smile. So, nothing really happens in this movie? Not if you want your senses to be hit as a basic drum. If you want them to play like violin strings in a romantic concert, it's a movie that will do it.
