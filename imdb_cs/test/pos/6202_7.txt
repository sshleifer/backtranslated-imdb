I liked this series, but I felt that the whole thing was caused by sound recording / mixing. For whatever reason, they had to employ a lot of what is called ADR, where the actors replace the original audio signal with re-recording in the audio booth. The reasons for this are usually due to problems on the ground or because someone has screwed somewhere in the sound production chain. . It wouldn't be so bad if ADR were done well, but sometimes it's just distracting. It's not just ADR, that's the problem - the sound mix just doesn't match the quality of the shows and pictures. I'd be curious to see what happened.
