This film set the standard for African American film excellence when it was made. I have heard of various stories about the film over time that there was pressure on nomination for the Academy Award when it was released. This movie plays about different emotions, and you definitely feel for all the characters. Certainly, some of the actors are a bit wooden, but fortunately these parts are not decisive. Music is sensational, and if you don't think the end is a blockbuster, there's no heart in your chest. If you watch "Cooley High", you'll see that many, many movies have copied various elements from it to boost their own movies. The biggest example is "Boyz N The Hood".
