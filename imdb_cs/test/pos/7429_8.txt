A young girl becomes a war sailor who finds herself at war, and when she visits the end of the war, she expects someone a little more "available". Everything finally works well, naturally, but not before all the participants chew the scenery thoroughly. Errol Flynn's dead-on-impression Humphrey Bogart from "Casablanca" is a highlight, as are the different post-ups of his own swashbuckling image ("jumping" the scene in the kitchen with Forrest Tucker's Uprising). It's Tucker, even if he "tucks" the film under his arm, he'll lower his head and barrels over the goal line. He showed that the comic atmosphere is fully developed twenty years later in "F-Troop" and lends the vibrancy and energy Flynn repeatedly plays to increase his own performance. Eleanor Parker is doing a great job as the woman is being watched and the little magic of Patti Brady as Tucker's real friend. A gentle, light-hearted comedy of "coming home" in a gentle setting where children and romantics of all ages should have fun.
