This is a perfectly enjoyable, well-played film. It's funny and sometimes merry. The final is a little disappointing because it tries to pack everything into a too clean package. The film is better remembered for its precious medallions: Jane Austen's production, camping trip as examples. B & H does not seek to mirror the prevailing attitudes to homosexuality and bisexuality. Most characters are very acceptable for sexual diversity. In this sense, it is a joyful holiday from a homophobic society. And it's a celebration of flexibility, the release of strict sexual categories - maybe a happy foretaste of things to come.
