Im die hard dad army fan and nothing will ever change. I got all the tapes, DVDs and audiobooks and I always watched / listened to their brand new ones. Movie. The film is a re run of certain episodes, Man and Hour, Enemy Inside Gates, Battle School and numerous others with a different border. The introduction of a new general instead of the Captain's Square was a brilliant move - especially when he didn't want to check (something that is rarely done now). <br /> <br /> It comes from the early years of getting equipment and uniforms, starting and training. All in all, it's a great movie for a boring Sunday afternoon. <br /> <br /> Two moves. One of them is a false German false accent (one comes, the Germans can't pronounce the letter "W" like us) and the two cast Liz Frazer instead of the famous Janet Davis. I like Liz in other movies like this, but she carries it right in this and Janet Davis would be a better choice.
