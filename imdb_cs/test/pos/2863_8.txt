My tastes in movies still amaze me and probably annoy the readers of my reviews, but each one of them myself and I have a weak spot for crazy horror movies, slasher flicks and See No Evil is happening exactly and more !! I think the biggest mistake of the film's producers and filmmakers is that they imitate it as a WWE movie and "play" KANE. WWE can have great consequences, but it is a very, very specific group that follows the incredibly cheesy and (sorry people) kind of trailer park "sport" and those who do not love it HAATTTE IT !! It could lead to avoiding the otherwise typical gory slasher flick that people would come to see in horrors. Look at No Evil does not violate any new horror land, it is exactly the game played by the typical horror with some of the best, terrible bloody scenes that sincerely make your screen. They really lead her home and go because of gratuitous violence. There is no psychological aspect exactly, even if it is being persecuted by this monster it has some elements of fear for it. KANE (wrestler) also known as Glen Jacobs plays religiously and physically tortured man Jacob Goodnight. It's the ultimate cross between Leatherface and Jason Voorhees. He is not an original murderer, nor is his killing really going to be unique or original, with the exception of killing a girl by forcing her to swallow her cell phone ... yeeeeah !! He does a good job and the man is rightly huge! Standing 7 feet tall and monstrous without any special effects !! Tiffany Lamb, Penny McNamee, Samantha Noble, Michael J. Pagan, Luke Pegler, Christina Vidal, Rachael Taylor all play a typical "think they're invincible" party teenagers who accidentally fall victim to a serial killer. The story is that in exchange for a month of their imprisonment for petty crimes, from theft to drug possession, they are sent to the old hotel to "help". It turns out that a serial killer lives upstairs, removing the eyes of his victims to clear them of his sins. Luke Pegler stands out as a sack of smells that eventually becomes a hero of his kind, even by saving his ex-girlfriend he was battling with. The rest of them all play their role roles pretty well, but it's not a great stretch of acting ability. Sad Porn Director ... yes PORNO ... Gregory Dark, doing a good job putting together a modern day slasher movie. He even goes with a bit of history with the killer, and although his back story is not unique, in fact it is a bit musty, it's still interesting enough. And in the smallest shots when a movie visitor really sees the killer's eyes, it is interesting to hear voices and see things distorted like him. He throws in a mandatory soft core nude shot, and a grotesque, blood-soaked scene, and turns everything around. Well suited and for a horror fan like me it's fun. Kane's serial killer is terrifying, and he is haunted by the brutal intelligence and silent terror. The film is strewn and wrapped, and I don't blame anyone because it's pretty bad, but isn't that the reason? It's a horror movie and I think it was exactly what it should be. It jumped off me, made me bend over, even turned to a few parts ... of impressive standards. It's fun, with a decent storyline, and lots of settings to serialize See No Evil until the 15th installment if they wanted to and I say to bring it !! It's true that the film is full of plot holes, laughter details, but deadly gore and horror over rides it all. Is it all that you love horror movies? Do you really love them? If so, then you'll think it's an amazing slasher ... if not ... you'll hate it ... plain and simple. 8.5 / 10
