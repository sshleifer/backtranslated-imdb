If you don't mind paying a little more attention than you would normally have for other films, it's one of the best "thrillers" you'll ever see. The film depicts an incident that may occur in real life; in fact, nothing in him seems to be fictional. It also shows how people could react in real life. In fact, it portrays it so well that it seems like real life. Combine it with a lack of soundtrack and you almost got the best news movie you've ever seen. Jane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are particularly good at the end of the seventies in this masterpiece, evoking at the end of her concern at her end and real tragic compassion. I highly recommend anyone who likes thrillers.
