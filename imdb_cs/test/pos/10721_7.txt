Moving out of words is this story of disintegration that results in a tragic bond over a seven year old boy. One of the "Kramer v. Kramer" strengths is his screenwriter Robert Benton. who has an amazingly customized Avery Corman novel on the big screen. It keeps things beautifully simple and most realistic, while bringing all the drama right from the heart. His talent for telling emotional stories like this was to prove himself again with "Places in the Heart" where he showed, as in "Kramer v. Kramer", that he has the natural ability to work with children. Another strong point in the film is a wonderful gaming that deservedly received four of the nine Oscar nominations, two of them leaving the winners. One of them was Dustin Hoffman (the best actor) who is great as a frustrated businessman Ted Kramer, a man who forgot that his wife is a person. As Joanne's wife said, Meryl Streep claimed that the Oscar actress had a strong and sensitive image of a woman who had been lost in eight years of marriage. Also nominated was Jane Alexander for her fantastic turn as a good friend of Kramer Margaret. The final stakes must go to the young Justin Henry, whose incredibly moving performance will bring you back to tears again and his journey deserves a well-earned Oscar nomination. Also brilliant is Nestor Almendros "The camera and Jerry Greenberg are in early cut, while the musical Henry Purcell's classic piece is used." leaves. They grow together, get to know each other and form a whole new and amazing relationship. Ted finds himself with new responsibilities and a new perspective on life and slowly realizes why Joanne had to go. Certainly, if nothing else, "Kramer v. Kramer" shows that no one wins when it comes to custody of a small child, especially the child himself. Saturday, June 10, 1995 - TV <br /> <br /> A strong drama from Avery Corman's novel about the grief of the link between alienated parents who feel they have the best interests of the child in their hearts. In addition to the great script and the incredibly controlled direction, both from Robert Benton, it's a superlative cast that makes this image such a winner. Hoffman is brilliant as Ted Kramer, a man torn between his career and overthrow. son he wants to keep desperately. Also excellent is Streep as a woman lost in eight years of marriage who had to get out before she disappeared as a human. In support of these two is a very strong Jane Alexander as a mutual friend of Margaret, a superb Justin Henry as a boy caught in the middle, and top cast extras. This highly emotional, heart-rending drama more than the well-deserved prize of 1979 for Best Film, Best Actor (Hoffman) and Best Actress (Streep). Wednesday, February 28, 1996 - TV
