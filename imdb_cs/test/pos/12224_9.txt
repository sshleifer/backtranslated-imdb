I'm constantly overwhelmed by US networks. What's wrong with them? Yet another very promising series, deployed after only 15 episodes, and we didn't know what the hell was going on. I really enjoyed this show and I'm so angry that we'll never know what happens to characters and "monsters" in depth. This show had it all. Humor, tension, action. What more do you want. Why did it pull the plug? It just doesn't make sense. Buffy continued in 7 series as well as Charmed and fun as they were, Surface, Invasion and Dead Like Me were even better. Just because the show doesn't get a terribly high rating doesn't mean it's a waste, and if they gave it a little longer, it would probably catch more people and end up with a big hit on their hands. One season doesn't give enough time to get caught, and the nets are far from eager to pull the plug. They should learn that, like good wines and cheeses, they need time to mature. Bring back the surface and invade back - P L E A S E !!!!!!!
