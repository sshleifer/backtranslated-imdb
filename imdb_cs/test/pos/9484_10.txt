After watching this DVD I was on the floor. It's amazing. Not only will he capture Led Zeppelin during the convent shows, they will last for several years. It just shows the band's growth and the growth of their great music. This DVD is MUST HAVE! The DVD is over 5 hours long, with add-ons. Accessories are also great pieces, some of the band perform in Denmark and other promo spots. It includes shots that were once lost, fortunately restored and carefully restored to 5.1 Dolby Digital, under the direct supervision of Jimmy Page itself! It includes many timeless classics such as Stairway to Heaven, Go to California, What is and should never be, Moby Dick, and many more. Great acoustic songs are also included. It corrects all the anticipated that Jimmy Page is not the tallest guitar legend!
