"Caribe" is not a masterpiece in any of his narrative aspects. But it adds a perfectly pleasant story along with beautiful cinema. The structure of the narrative is set around two narrative axes, one of them embeds the other, each with elements that relate and coexist in great harmony. The story never loses proper stimulation and shows a very good mixing of the human character with the natural environment (which is a sign in itself). Acting is great, and we owe it to the new director, Esteban Ramirez. In addition, the characters are very well written and masterfully complex; So, once you meet them, you can feel their feelings without telling them. I can't say that I liked this picture because of all the hype that he created (in Costa Rica), but rather because of how it really does, showing an interesting portrait of what happens when you interfere with the balance of human life. Hopefully Caribe will create a reference for future projects in Costa Rica because it is a very good example of a nice movie making.
