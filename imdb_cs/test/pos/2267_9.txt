2005 was one of the best for films. We've had so many beautiful movies like Batman Begins, Sin City, Dead Bride, History of Violence ..... We've also come to get Brokeback Mountain, King Kong .... , then we wouldn't miss this year. The first film as a talented Lieva Schreiber director is a wonderful, cordial, moving drama that also brings one of Elijah Wood's best roles. He is as perfect as Jonathan, a curious man who is heading to Ukraine to find a woman who saved his grandfather in World War II. Liev Schreiber, who also writes film, leads a masterpiece, with unforgettable scenes and (lots of) funny quotes. This is a real comedy mix with a drama that brings a movie that will be commented on for years. Serious Oscar contender, everything is illuminated is a strong, original, and why not say lit movie. But when you enter the movie you should keep in mind one thing: leave behind. That's special .-- 9/10
