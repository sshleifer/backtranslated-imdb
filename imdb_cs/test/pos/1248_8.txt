hi, are you looking for a family movie to watch Friday night? Can not find what you're looking for? I thought it was a very nice movie. Good for the whole family. I found that it has a remarkably rare combination that is attractive to both adults and children. It was at least brilliant. The acting of Bruce Willis was excellent, there was a lot of humor and a great movie. In my opinion, this is a necessary film. And I don't think about a lot of movies, trust me when I say it takes a lot of movie to think. It is clear that Bruce Willis did a lot of work. A great story, a good acting performance and once again a totally pleasant movie.
