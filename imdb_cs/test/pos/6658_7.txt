I expected that for all hype and Oscar nominations, there would be an epic civil war drama (and something with the "size" of an English patient "of the same director.") This film is not epic, but it turned out to be a relief. It's a love story in the midst of the horrors of war, where young men are sent to battle, deserters are watched and killed, and women and children at home are left alone while men are gone. I thought Nicole Kidman and Rene Zelleweger they are pretty decent and don't know much about Jude Law, he was fine, too. Rene Z. seems to have had a fun part of 3 leaders and was able to cleverly play a lively, wild woman who was acting very well. seeing an actress, Kathy Baker ... someone who has talent must be more recognized / recognized. <br /> <br /> This film is worth seeing - I can't formulate why Really, but maybe because it's a piece of America. <br /> <br />
