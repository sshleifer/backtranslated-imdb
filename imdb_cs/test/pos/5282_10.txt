It's rare that the movie will wipe you away in your world and let you want more as credits return. Ponyo Hayao Miyazaki is such a movie. The film is a story of a young goldfish called Ponyo who wants to become a man. He floats ashore and is a young boy named Sasuke, who promises to take care of her. The course of Pony's father, an ecologically obsessed wizard named Fujimoto, tries to keep Ponya from becoming a man to maintain the balance of nature, which eventually turns out when Ponyo finally turns into a little girl, causing a massive typhoon. Ponyo is a very rich movie. It is full of amazing fantasies, lovely characters and true hearts. What director Hayao Miyazaki has done here is to tell a simple little story, and even though it makes authentic film magic. The love between Sasuke and Ponyo is very pure and true. Miyazaki's ecologist is as evident in this film as in all his previous works. Miyazaki shows dirt and dirt that falls into the ocean in an almost shocking light, not to mention that Pony's father is on an obedient mission to purify the world's oceans. While the story is simple, Miyazaki can add this extra layer to evoke the idea of ​​expertise. The film is a wonderful work of art, every hand-drawn cell looks like an amazing pastel. The film looks different than many other Studio Ghibli productions, but art is still as spectacular as ever. Underwater scenes are simply beautiful to watch, Fujimoto Fortress under the sea is very resourceful, and the sequence where Ponyo runs through jumping fish in typhoon to reach Sosuke is iconic. <br /> <br /> Thanks to his beautifully designed character, this film makes this an unforgettable experience. Sosuke is a young boy who acts older than he is, and the energetic Ponyo is laughing for a while. Every character is just so fun and very memorable. Overall, Ponyo is an amazing experience, charming in every way. While the film can be sold as a children's fairy tale, I believe that many adults and their children will be swept away in their fantastic world. While the film may lack the density of some Miyazaki's previous works, here he keeps it clean and simple, being true to himself, delivering a movie that is fun, pleasing, and fun to all in one. This is a wonderful movie. I give Ponyo the perfect 10 out of 10!
