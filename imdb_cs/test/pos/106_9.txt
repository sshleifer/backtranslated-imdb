As well as showing a lesbian love story, FIRE is also a comic satire of Central European (?) Indian culture. I found it to be a quality that doesn't really appreciate the film. These two genres (ie the deep meaningful alternative-love story and the comic satire) usually mix together as well as oil and water, but Mehta (somehow) manages to achieve a balance to almost perfection. Behavior of Jatina's servant, treatment of his family, the constant inevitable presence of a bedridden grandmother, Ashoka's obsession with Swami's teachings: coming from a culture that is just like India, these are the things I can immediately identify as typical. They shouted to be alerted and ridiculed. In developing his primary subject, Mehta managed to achieve this secondary theme skillfully. In fact, much of the humor in the film, which provides basic relief from the heavy objects of taboo lesbian love and gender issues, stem from this satire of seemingly ordinary. The film goes from comic to serious with great subtelty. All in all, the brilliant use of symbolic instruments (Radha compared to the Sita Legend and coming from fire unscathed and thus pure; the young Radha's desire to see the ocean finally reached when she gains freedom). Kudos Shabana Azmi (Radha), Lighting crew and Deepa Mehta; Their very un-Hollywood-like (and un-Bollywood-like!) talents made this movie special. One criticism: the first scenes seemed somewhat inconsistent in the fact that they didn't get into each other very well. Verdict: 9 to 10. No less for a movie with scenes so burned in my mind.
