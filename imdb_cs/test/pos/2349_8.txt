The Naruto TV series Anime TV has so far filmed two feature-length theatrical films and the third this summer is coming. The first, released in the summer of 2004, was an entertaining adventure featuring Naruto's main characters in an exciting adventure. However, one must be blind, deaf, and one legged chicken denying film errors. While the first one was certainly nice, there were a lot of things that could be improved. Naruto Movie 2 but all these aspects and stands out on them. Especially the action was incredibly cinematic. Lighting, settings and style were three times as effective as in the first movie. In the first one we got a basic action, well-animated and choreographic animation, but nothing happened, but the film's cinematography was exceptional, combining shadows and lighting to make the action more intense, very effective and added to the film. the power of the fighting. The animation was very good. To rival Disney, however because this is a movie about television characters, there was nothing exceptional about character design or detail to current characters, however, the animation was incredibly fluid and realistic. I think they even used twice the cell for every second because nothing was nervous about the animation, it was incredibly smooth. <br /> <br /> Music ... I think this movie will fail. The original composer / conductor of the TV show was used for the film and I don't feel like he did it well. Most of the time, the music reminded me of a lot of pieces used in old SNES games. The composer is very good, but the synthesizers used for the film could not communicate very well. However, the film failed at all and added it as a good accompaniment to the action. But with the exception of a few violin / string pieces to the end and some choral work, the music did not excel any boundaries or acted like something special. The story was fun. It was a fairly typical story for Naruto and was very similar to the first films, except that it all came back into the story of the first movie and improved on it. The characters were much more interesting and the way the story progressed followed me throughout the film. You still think the movie should end every second, but then it could go on, but instead of being pulled out, the actions and characters did everything that was still fresh and exciting. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is goodun, but however good it may be, it's definitely not for the fans. I enjoyed the movie, but that's because I'm a fan! But I see, like Advent Final Advent kids, that it doesn't stand out as a movie, but it only works as a fantastic fan service for a good hour and a half. While I think this movie is acting as a good introduction to the series for non-observers, it won't give full effect to anyone but those on Naruto screens. However, despite all this, it was a fun movie to get during this depressing period of distressing fillings.
