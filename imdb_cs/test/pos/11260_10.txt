What can I say? I couldn't sleep and found this movie on MTV. I started watching it with every intention to change the channel if it began to limp because it makes so many drugs, but I got into this movie and couldn't stop watching. Nick Stahl has done an amazing job with his character, and in my opinion he really did a movie that is worth watching. I was interested in buying a movie soundtrack (or even the movie itself) and MTV.com didn't help at all, but believe that Amazon.com accepts pre-orders for the August 5 release on DVD. I know I hardly followed it and I'm sure other people have the same problem. I buy my own copy, so I can drool over Nick Stahl while waving my eyes out at the same time with an emotional story!
