As the previous reviewer said, Travolta stole every scene he was in. It was Vinnie Barberino, they all grew up and still a little slim but still nice, oh yes! Disappointed were William Hurt and Bob Hoskins, perhaps because their characters were badly written, or they just didn't care. I saw one of Baldwins (I never remember what) in the role of Hurt, so Hurt's incredible talents were not unnecessary. Andie McDowell is a sweetheart but not very believable; partly writing. Character development wasn't a big deal in this movie. Just watch Travolta, sit and enjoy.
