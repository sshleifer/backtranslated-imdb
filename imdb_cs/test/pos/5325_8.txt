There are little things in this movie that I think many people may miss if they aren't careful. You really have to follow what Leland says and read his character to find out the intended "why" the film represents at the end. Nothing that is solid is not unambiguous, it is about what the individual viewer will take. I think it was a go-go plan, people don't want everyone to understand it in the same way, it's almost about creating a personal relationship with Leland so you can feel a little better. The storyline is interesting, but its summary never explains what the movie really is. It's dramatic and provocative thinking, lots of hard ideas, but the pace of the movie is almost reassuring, even with its more intense screaming scenes. I think it's probably Leland, he's just calm and almost calm, even for his entire sadness. The film personifies Leland in a way. Of course it's charming and attracts you if you leave it, but there are recycled ideas. Leland has a lot of impressive dialogue, it's something other than typical, but he's not a prophet. Everything he says is not revelation, many people I know have mentioned the things he has mentioned, even noticed a few things he has observed. Leland is a unique and appealing character that is probably mainly for the portrayal of Ryan Gosling. Finally, playing is extraordinary, there are no real bad guys, there is no way to psychologically evaluate Leland, just to understand and live a little better. Comparable to Igby Goes Down I think it's not comic but similar in its general view of life.
