I'm not a movie fan, I'm not familiar with the names of leading directors, screenwriters, producers, and so on, but when I see one of them, I can say an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> The creators of this film can now be at the top of their fields, or they can get there pretty well. I know the actors are already there. Talent takes a closer look at genius to prove with such realism how national tragedy like Vietnam has affected the everyday life of a typically average American family and to see us in close proximity to why there are so many homeless Vietnamese homeless. Without getting into the gratuitous scenes of gore and bloodshed, it makes us understand why so many youg men had flashbacks of what they were over. The dialogue is particularly interesting and gives us an idea of ​​what has happened in so many families as a result of Vietnam. <br /> <br /> I wish there were other good movies like this, not just about Vietnam, but about other social conditions.
