After a long wait, "Bedroom and Hallway" made it a cinema in Perth - not commercial thinks - and I thought it was fun, honest and took a swing on those 'tribal shouts' groups running around trying to find meaning in the rocks and " what is behind my eyes ". He plays full houses here because he tells a story, has amazing actions and says something about the human state.
