I think it was a pretty good movie. It shows how someone grew up in an environment that created a rich and powerful man, but unfortunately due to his ambitions and the people around him he led to his destruction. This shows that you cannot trust anyone, especially in a world that deals with a lot of money and envy. She was another ambitious, powerful and merciless woman in the human world who loved and respected Kilo. She also knew that trade was business and dangerous. Everything she did was risky, but she did the job. She helped Kil get rich by joining. Overall, I really liked this movie and got it in my collection and waiting for El Padrino 2.
