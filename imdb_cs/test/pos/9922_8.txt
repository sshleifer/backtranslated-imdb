This is a standard fare from a director who is among my favorites. Although it is very flat compared to many of his other works, but his Argento and it can be biased, but I'll give it a good review as well. <br /> <br /> It has lots of good ideas. A subtle voyeuristic element. Under the eyes needles. Cruel and disturbing death. And the cliché of Argento flashback cliché. Weaknesses include heavy metal soundtrack, gaming, and ending. All the film is worth the birds in the theater sequence near the theater. End. <br /> <br /> A pretty good movie from Argento, but he did it better. Much better!
