It took me about a year after I saw this movie to write about it. Sir knows I wanted to, after what I witnessed, I knew I had seen something I hadn't seen before, but I wasn't sure why. Now that I've been thinking for a while, I know, it's just this character that I can't stop thinking about yet. Remotely briefly and slowly tells the story of a relative (Yusuf) who comes from the country to live shortly with a well off it photographer (Mahmut) in the city in hopes of finding a job. However, it is clear that after Yusuf assumes he is a sailor and his job prospects are weak, he is actually searching for something else, some purpose in his life. They are accepted through a seasonal environment that is shot beautifully. The context in which they occur makes the scenes more powerful in two specific cases where Yusuf's girl suddenly meets her significant second and Yusuf's face as she looks into a basket of fish and shots and light reflecting off his tortured face. This scene itself has to be one of the most beautiful movies I've witnessed. I don't know how long. Finally, Mahmut also has his own demons, but ends with his relative. that he is not really trying to find a job and is forced to ask him to leave, in a scene that is very simple but has a real heart feeling. What is left to the viewer is plenty of Reflection and reflection on these two people who can see each piece of themselves. You should not be put off by the pace of this movie, which is worth every breath. Rating 10 out of 10.
