Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to his eye with his fascinating epic "Alive", there was the legendary Mexican director Rene Cardona, who used the same drama as the outline of his ambitious movie "Supervivientes de los Andes". The unforgettable lethal flight Fairchild 571, which crashed in the Argentine Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost many passengers, most of them a professional rugby team. But 16 of them were eventually rescued because of their strong will to survive and because they made their living from the deadly remains of their unfortunate companions. Of course, you cannot claim that this cheaply made and roughly edited film is better than the famous 90's, but I appreciate this film and respect it more. After all, the exploitation film requires much more input, both from cast and crew, while the large budget of Marshall, though intense, feels more like routine money making. Kits and special effects naturally cannot compete with "Alive", but "Supervivientes ..." brings the same impressive sentiment of hopelessness and creates even more frightening hell. Cardona's film is ambitious, surprisingly impressive, and easily ranked among the most remarkable Mexican productions ever. I am really impressed that Cardon's acceptance of this story is not exploitative and explicit. However, scenes where deceased passengers are shortened and consumed are difficult to digest, but only serve to increase the credibility of the disaster and highlight the inhumane conditions of the survivors. Rather laudable for an evil director who has earned fame with his notoriously bad films such as "The Night of Bloody Apes" and the Santo series. Unidentified young Mexican actors do a great job and the music score is cute. Of course, the story is known, so the scenario does not offer any unexpected shocks. Whether in history or before you saw "living", you know what kind of drama these people still have to endure before they are saved and you can just wait for them. Yet it is a good movie that should not be so often overstated.
