As John Grierson emphasized: "The documentary genre can be defined as follows: creative interpretation of reality" This fabulous 180-minute documentary film presents for the first time a computer-generated project about dinosaurs that respects the viewer's intelligence. When I saw Jurassic Park, which I was expecting with great enthusiasm, I was very disappointed. Of course, dinosaurs were great, but storytelling was pointless. I thought, "What if they made a documentary about dinosaurs, without crying babies or bad words, just dinosaurs to be as realistic as possible so we could wonder what was once a reality." My dream has come true. The BBC has created an exciting documentary exploring the different era of dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> This section is for all people who disagree with having to argue in many places regarding behavior, skin patterns, etc .: Of course. Nobody was there. I think it's fantastic that they could present something so realistic. All rumors are based on the knowledge of many paleontologists and allow the viewer to have a good idea of ​​what it was. If you want to stick to what we know for sure, then go to the dinosaur museum. That is why I have incorporated the Grierson quote into the beginning of this commentary. By the way, hats made by creators.
