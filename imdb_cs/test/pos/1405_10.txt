A rugged, self-centered army cadet arrives at WEST POINT with a dangerous wise man's attitude toward the church. <br /> <br /> William Haines shines in this very pleasant story of honor & friendship in a role that is clearly tailor-made for him. Haines during the first half of the film is a stealer of the scenes, and it is according to his usual behavior, which he should normally have limited to the guardhouse. But the last half becomes very serious, leading to Haines' moral redemption and giving him a good opportunity to exhibit his acting talent. If WEST POINT does not reach Haines' previous TELL IT TO MARINES (1926), this is undoubtedly due to the absence of the charism and quality of Lon Chaney for Haines with whom he could communicate. But this tribute to the army is a very effective pastime and should be honored on its own merits. Joan Crawford appears to be Haines' love interest, plays a virgin daughter of a local innkeeper. Joan is pert & pretty and especially shining in her first scenes when she meets Haines on the Hudson River Ferry and is exposed to his usual immature antics. Together, Haines & Crawford have made five silent feature films and have been huge friends for life. He was a much bigger celebrity during this period and gave her many tips on how to get to Hollywood. The superstar herself, since the early 1930s, returned from MGM in 1932 when she encouraged her career change to decorate the interior. Little William Bakewell is effectively cast as Plebe, who adores Haines; their relationship is actually given more sentimental treatment than Haines & Crawford. The film was made with the full cooperation of the War Department. Extensive filming on campus is extremely helpful with MGM's production ambitions for stunning production values. WEST POINT was recently restored and gave David Davidson a new amazing score.
