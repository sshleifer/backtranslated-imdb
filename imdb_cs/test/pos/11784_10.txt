Nothing is sacred. Ask Ernie Fosselius. These days, everyone has a camcorder, and the movie is barely out before spoofs begin to fly, quickly written and shot, and often sent directly to the internet. Spoofs is hot these days and we're out of the way to make sure the filmmakers aren't on their own. 25 years ago, when the first Star Wars were made, it was a different world. Filming was a playground of several selected and spoofs were very rare. Then God gave us hardware wars. It was a shot to look cheap (or was it just cheap?) And the sound was apparently recorded after the reality. Does this experience take away? SAKRA NE! That's what's so great! It was raw and unpolished, and hit relentlessly at some of the more spectacular moments of the original movie. From Fluke Starbucker waving around a flashlight instead of a light sword (I did when I was young!) On Chewchilla the Wookie Monster, on Augg's note Ben Doggie's "nah, just a little head", this film is short as part of a phenomenon like any of Real Star Wars Movies. Lease. Buy. Borrow it from a friend. And it can be Farce with you. Always.
