This was the very first movie I've ever seen. Dubbing is not the biggest but much better than I've seen. The plot is much better than some that are being done today. Sometimes it's bloody, but that's what gives him that special pressure. There is no academic material. But if you want to watch the fighting and a decent story, it's for you!
