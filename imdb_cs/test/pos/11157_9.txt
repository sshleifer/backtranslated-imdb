Well, I know it's a clich√©. It's a bad movie on its surface - maybe in a league with "Plan 9 From Outer Space". The dialogue is suspicious (but Singlish is quite nice ...), the plot is not quite believable, Gavin's character is overly exaggerated. While watching a movie, something is going on that really interests you ... Nice and Kim on the tank, Gwen eating a banana in the bathtub, just about everything Gavin says and does ("psssssssssssssssycho !!") These things taken separately are possible shortcomings. All in all, they are just jokes. Watching this open minded movie (especially if you're not familiar with Singapore culture) and an open group of friends is guaranteed to bring a lot of laughter and unforgettable time. You can't go to this movie to expect a masterpiece, or even expect to take something serious at all. If you can take this movie for what it is - an underdog movie about underdogs, filled up to the brim with your own jokes - then you should have a good time watching this one! I've seen it three times and I wouldn't hesitate to watch it three more times !!
