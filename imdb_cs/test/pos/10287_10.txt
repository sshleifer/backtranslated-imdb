From a conspiracy like Vertigo or Brian DePalma's obsession to Peter Chase's score, reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann's sounds, this little pearl appears to be eye-catching. Remarkable play by Roman Boeringer and Vincent Cassel in bohemian Paris portrayed from the famous Thierry Arbogast. Little cult! It is a pity that the only available version on DVD is French and English. The director of a controversial artist like Gilles Mimouni could be considered a small tribute to Cinema's masterpieces. It's a French film, and like everyone else, we could say it's a dessai cinema. Although it is not so published, it could be remembered for several reasons.
