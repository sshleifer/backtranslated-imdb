Wow! Fantastic movie in my opinion, I didn't expect it to be so good! I was fascinated from start to finish - it is a very well made and educational film that really gives us a fascinating look at the experiments Darwin had to go through to communicate his thoughts to the world and record his life as he writes. species'; to fight with both personal demons and the unconscious society of time to do so. He struggles hard with his mind, body and soul because personal belongings reach a turning point and even his family seems to slip ... while the rest of the world stands against him because he knows that his findings literally shake the very foundations of their lives , culture and sense of existence. It's a fine film (by no means over-exaggerated in this typical Hollywood way, it's a British BBC movie), but fortunately, it's very strong in the sense and that is thanks to the amazing scenes and great acting of Bettana. . Connelly acts more like a light support role, but I enjoyed her in this and she is as good as she can, as always, her chemistry next to her husband was definitely strong and cute, you felt the connection and their real husband / the marriage bond certainly shines through their performance. The show's star is definitely Bettany and does a great job, a very moving performance - as I understood him, he sympathized with him when he fought against his own humiliating health and approached "madness" to try to understand what he had uncovered and come. when it comes to what all this really is and the means when he found that his thinking was in conflict with his feelings, and found that he was losing everything, including his wife, who, of course, was a strong believer in religion and a strict Christian, while he was in the realm of science, two worlds that could not be seen in the eye, so their relationship was also at stake. Anyway - a really very good, well-behaved emotional drama and courage I say I tossed in a tragic climax. which was really heartbreaking, as well as beautifully annoying and moving. The film is also symbolic and very intellectually artistic, in fact I can't wait to look at it again, because there was a lot of time in the first round I missed. Easily one of the best movies I've seen this year.
