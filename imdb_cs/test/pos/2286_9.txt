* Minor spoilers * I just wanted to say that for everyone who likes fun baseball movies, it's definitely in my top three. Only a small Big League and Major League can compete with this in my mind. I would also like to praise the writers of this film for creating such a fun dialogue !! Without being too specific, I would say that the lines are very suitable for each character. Tom Selleck seemed to have no problem creating a realistic character as a ball player. His hostility to playing overseas in Japan sets the tone for comic but meaningful interactions with his new Dragons team. She has to adapt to her life in Japan ("Wash yourself first, then bathe!") Finally, she sees her coach in the eye and sets her goals to have one last season of size, though in a much different environment than ever. imagined! So for all baseball fans or someone who wants to watch a good baseball movie, Mr. Baseball won't let you!
