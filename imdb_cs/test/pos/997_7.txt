Where would Hollywood be without Fredrik March as Robert Browning or Dennis Price as Lord Byron, the famous lovers of their day? Even the actor as normally strapped as Michael Redgrave once brought some moody charm to display W.B. Yeats. Writer's life is an endless source of inspiration. But all of the poets were Dylan Thomas, a charming, loving Welsh who enjoyed a pint or two (and killed himself in New York at the age of 39), a filmmaker. closest to the industry. During World War II he produced scenarios for British propaganda documents. He even wrote a script for a vapid melodrama called Three Strange Sisters, in which three old maids in a Welsh village plot the murder of their wealthy half-brother. All that is now forgiven. John Maybury's Edge of Love plays Thomas Welsh actor Matthew Rhys. It's not biopic in its entirety. The film covers four years in the life of a poet during World War II, when he lived with two women: his wife Caitlin (Sienna Miller) and former lover Vera Phillips (Keira Knightley), whom he met again during the war. He seems to have loved them both. The relationship of these extraordinary women - to Thomas to himself - is the heart of Maybury's absorbing film. As it happened, the story is almost as remarkable as the story of the lovers themselves. Rebekah Gilbertson, the film's producer, is the very granddaughter of Very Phillips and William Killick. William, a war hero (played in the movie Cillian Murphy), married Vera as she was still in love with the poet. Gilbertson was inspired to make the film when she discovered a book about her grandparents, Dylan Thomas: Farm, Two Houses and Bungalow, by David Thomas, describing their tangled lives. Sharman Macdonald, who wrote the screenplay, is Knightley's mother. Part requires Knightley to sing, and her mother included songs specifically for her. No film with such happy family connections certainly deserves otherwise than to succeed. We'll start in London during the Blitz. Bombs are falling, sirens are crying, and Phillips sings to conceal the crowds in the underground subway station. He happens to meet Thomas in the pub, and after all these years he finds out he has a wife and a child. Phillips and Caitlin create a friendship that is untamed by jealousy or rancor, and will soon exchange beds and baths, listen to Thomas to read his poems, exchange intimate secrets, and smoke heads as they did in wartime. Caitlin proves to be more experienced in world travels ("my first was Augustus John, he seduced me when I was 15"). But he's a sophisticated and soulful Phillips who raises Thomas's deepest reactions and eventually succumbs to his magic. Meanwhile, she reluctantly married Killick, who saw her at the subway station and was immediately impressed by her beauty (if not her singing). It's an intense and weirdly beautiful movie. Thomas himself can be his least impressive character. He is best remembered for Under Milk Wood, his verse radio plays for days in the life of the mythical Welsh village Llareggub, whose name spelled backwards wasn't something polite English teacher attracted attention. I once had a vinyl recording of Richard Burton who read a poem (appeared in Under Milk Wood in 1971), and I've never forgotten the creamy, seductive quality of his voice. The legendary charisma, the magnetism of man, is something I missed in Rys's performance. Thomas encounters a strange, even secondary character compared to women in his life. In his previous film, Love Is the Devil, Maybury explored the tumultuous life of painter Francis Bacon and his sadomasochistic life. relationship with his lover and model, George Dyer. Edge of Love seems to me to be a richer and more satisfying film. If you ask what views she offers in the sources of Thomas' creative inspiration, I would have to say Llareggub. But as an insight into his egoism, his smoldering mood and his general indifference to the feelings of others, it is amazingly sad and obvious. Thomas had good war, drinking and writing, while other men (including Killick) were traumatized by the horror of battle. In one scene that is coming to an end, Thomas' behavior towards his friends seems irresistible. But this is not Thomas's film. Murphy gives us an amazing study in a convicted passion and emotional weakening of the war. Miller is charming and pathetic as wife. And Knightley looks almost too gentle to be real (as she did in Pride and prejudice). But this is probably her best performance. And in every respect, the film is worthy of her.
