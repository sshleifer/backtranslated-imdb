Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leaving him, his son (uncredited James Franco) not respecting him and losing the patient he operates. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and finds her husband cheating on her. They both have to get away. At the same time, he looks over the beautiful ocean inn in Rodanthe, where he booked a room. They are all alone together. You can pretty much find out the rest. This is what is known as weepie or female film. It's beautifully shot with a romantic setting and lots of quiet scenes. There is tragedy, romance, tragedy and uplifting end (something). Gere and Lane's great acting helps disguise the fact that this film is not about power. Every single piece of the graph is predictable. At some events I turned my eyes a lot. Also it's too short - I didn't believe the romance between Gere and Lane for a second. If it comes out of nowhere and moves very fast. The movie still works. The inn itself is absolutely amazing and I was at the end with most of the viewers. So it's a predictable but beautiful movie with beautiful acting. He does not deserve all the criticism he receives. I give it 7.
