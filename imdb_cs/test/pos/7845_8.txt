Beggar is one of those who are in the director and / or actor's career invisible films that end up better than expected. In the same year that Clint Eastwood and Don Siegel collaborated on Dirty Harry they also worked on this little psycho-sexual drama laid out in the Civil War era country of the country. It's almost 180 of what Harry had for the audience. Here's a movie that is under radar, and a low budget for almost no business compared to what Dirty Harry pulled. It's also a story where Eastwood is not surrounded by a world full of dangerous men, but women who, despite their first appearance, have darker sides to them. And there is even a romance between some of the rougher and more complex scenes. But in such a framework to make a film, Siegel therefore actually has a little more freedom to do things with a style of image that roams into something more European; It reminded me here and there of Polanski's work in the 1960s. It all works, though with initial doubts that these two figures of male filmmaking (Eastwood is obvious and Siegel, who has created a niche in B-noir and low-budget thrillers), can pull out material that could be created for Lifetime Film. It was also charming and really dark comic here and there to see Eastwood performing work outside these girls. He does a little subversive in his speech by still having such a kind of Eastwood machismo - if there is something close to his film image clich√© - by taking it one step ahead of this little school for young women at times and not at others. To see Eastwood in a show like this, like with Play Misty for Me (another Eastwood work from 1971), shows how cool he can act credibly with very good actresses. In particular, there are four main female characters, each of whom has different ages and each with different "Yankee" attractions. While Siegel's work on all actors has its moments in the first half, it's really once when the story crosses half the mark in a succession of dreams (less successful than the director could prove) that the real juicy scenes start to rise. Much of this is the best that Siegel has directed dramatically, pushing the psychological and emotional edges of scenes where he is not expected. It's a difficult movie, all praise as it does nobody Like too decent - just Hallie's character, Mae Mercer's slave, is detached from what's going on between too curious women and McBurney. Along with that, Eastood here is acting in a role that is and is not what is usually seen as during this time of his actual formative years in movies. He is an anti-hero who was his trademark of westerns and other thrillers he was doing at the time. But unlike those films, he is not, in fact, in such a regime that he is "greater than life" to do so, because he is both a deserter and an assassin, a deceiver, and a sneaky at his most charming and pleasant moments. If it's not one of his best gaming tasks, which is hard to put together with his catalog, it's the one worth looking at fans who might want to see his next side. It is a merit for him, but also what he clicked with his cooperation with Siegel, because they both had a chance at that time in Hollywood.
