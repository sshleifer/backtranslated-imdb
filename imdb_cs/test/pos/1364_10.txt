Believe me, when I say this show is just cheerful. The basic story is about Kintaro Oe, who travels from city to city part-time, chases women and learns everything about life. Kintaro must be one of the easiest to do with the characters ever made. He takes everything to the extreme and always laughs out loud. From his constant never-ending quest to study life, to small things that he immediately throws into life or death. One of the most entertaining things about this show is that Kintaro is constantly over the extreme expressions and reactions. . They spend a lot of time in different super deformed modes like Dragon Half or Trigun. Other times in less than 0.1 seconds his face will not change only seriously, but manga-fighter-style life or death expressions like a weightlifter trying to benchpress a new record. It's cheerful. If that's not enough, writing is excellent and the English voice acting couldn't be better. The English VA Kintaro is just perfect and you will move when it says nothing. One thing to mention is the Ecchi series. Practically defines a word. If you're an adult anime fan who can get a laugh from movies like American Pie, you'll love it. Rirath_com
