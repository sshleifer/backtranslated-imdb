What impressed me most was how it was when my daughter mentioned her mother's cancer at the beginning of the movie. As a depressing topic was, it was a refreshing change of tempo instead of being blind with the revelation of the character's deadly disease 2/3 into the film ("Love Story" "Conditions of Affection", etc.). Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger and William Hurt have very powerful performances that don't cross the border. The characters they play seem human; they are not perfect people. (It might be said that the character of "Martha Stewart" Streep, but throughout the film, I found that her character is noble in a dissatisfied manner. "One True Thing" is an attentive, unsentimental family drama in which tears were well deserved at the end.
