SOME BIGGEST SPOILERS YOU WILL BE SIGNED <br /> <br /> Yesterday I saw this movie at the Venice Film Festival and I must admit that when I was a fan it was REQUIRED. Excellent graphics, great music, great dubbing, great action sequences and so on ... But it's here. The whole film was considered EXCLUSIVELY for the players who loved it, so you can enjoy every single link, character, joke (you should see a joke with winning music that is particularly comic) etc. Of course, FF will see the generosity of the technical part, but CANNOT understand the inner satisfaction with vision, such as Barrett, who appears and shoots Bahamut completely out. He asks himself, "WHO ARE ALSO BROWN?", And I can't blame him. He can't even understand what a player feels when the opening music of the game is in the opening sequence, Nanaki runs in the canyon with his two chicks, howls at Midgar's ruins, and then "498 years ago ...". Almost all the characters made a look or quote (including Reeve, Tseng and Elena), and Reno and Rude were really cracking and comic to see, but the ultimate impression of the movie went to me was "tough player's last dream, but far less for a MOVIE ...
