As far as I know, it was my first experience with Icelandic films. It's such a relief to see something other than your regular Hollywood movie. It's a pity that movies like this have little chance of succeeding in the big world. I can only hope that people watch it by accident, recommendation or others ... <br /> <br /> Because it's really worth it. I left the cinema really sad. I couldn't get the tragic fate of the characters out of my head. And I was even more impressed when I was thinking about the complexity of the film. Not only was it a tragic story, he had excellent comic reliefs and a very good soundtrack. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, watch it! It's really thought provoking and made me think a lot. <br /> <br />
