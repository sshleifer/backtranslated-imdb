I've never been a big fan of Oliver Stone, often because I found his films were forced, preaching, and generally wrong. Two stone films that I really like are JFK and Talk Radio, but Talk Radio takes the cake for being the best success of Stone. Stone is a director you're either a fan or you're not, it's safe to say that I didn't like a guy before watching Talk Radio and considered him one of the most overrated directors in the film industry, though some of my perceptions changed after watching Talk Radio. Talk Radio is a disturbing and entertaining attack on what is now known as "reality TV". Talk Radio follows a confident, dysfunctional, determined, hysterical, outrageous, and confused radio host named Barry Champlain who hosts a controversial late night radio show in Dallas. He quickly becomes known for his courageous and unpredictable presence of air and becomes a late night feeling when inverted drug addicts, offenders, racists, sociopaths, sick, perverts and ants are calling to laugh in the air. The film shows the rise and fall of a man's career and carefully makes an accurate representation of freedom of expression. Originally adapted from a play, the film joins the theatrical theme that was originally built and beautifully expresses the wild nature of the film. <br /> <br /> With wild energy and non-stereotypical air, Talk Radio Brings all the joy of "crass media". It remains even more annoying than in the late 1980s. The film goes in depth to study the forms of arrogance, self-obsession, offensive behavior, controversy, hypocrisy and ignorance. The film shows in a controlled way how good it is to have a personal opinion and freedom of speech, but it is something that should be used wisely rather than shamefully. Stone is trying to show how freedom of expression is crucial in life, but it is something we should be careful about and careful about. The film asks the question "is our main protagonist as well as the sad people who provoke the show?" Stone creates a wonderful cinematic key (radio station) with an ambition and cool atmosphere. Then he manages to capture the isolation, fear, ambiguity and dangerous emotions that arise on the radio station. Eric Bogosian is perfectly cast as an isolated, self-embedded and complex genius Barry Champlain. She perfectly dismisses her role with such enthusiasm, urgency, confusion, sharpness, and ultimately the boldness of his offensive nature. The performance is characterized by a spark that was obviously robbed by an Oscar nomination. His voice matches character, is that the primary element of a radio host and his power to act alongside tragedy and comedy works brilliantly. There is a strong use of editing in the Stone and Talk Radio movies boasting some of his purest, rhythmic cuts. It uses beautifully controlled camera techniques that differ from calm and sudden turbulence. Behind the film is live energy, whose raw and beautifully beautiful writing works as a central piece of film size. The remarkable and ambitious cinematography excels at times both inside and outside the studio, impressively capturing the city at night. Don't forget the spooky heart and yet the darkly funny climatic "spiral to decline" is ultimately a remarkable cinema. <br /> <br /> Talk Radio is a basic modern masterpiece, I'm sure you'll be amazed at how great it really is. I highly recommend Talk Radio to anyone interested in media or film. Talk Radio is a great example of cutting-edge, intellectual and smart entertainment that still contains a well-deserved call. Ultimately, if it wasn't for Eric Bogosian, the film wouldn't be a fun, enjoyable, and lasting masterpiece today.
