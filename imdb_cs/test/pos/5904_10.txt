Mon Oncle Antoine observes the jagged face of the home community from different angles, slowly and slowly, passing its time as it should until we emerge from fragmented (but banal) hopes and expectations, into swirling ecstasy of dreams and hearts. stopping revelation about the terrible destruction of mortality. The infinite basin and approaching the snowy mountains soothe the mind and hypnotize the viewer. This turbulent camera is embodied in a marginal figure who is equally a wanderer, leaving his work in a coal mine and leaving his family to cut lumber, and then giving up again and returning to the dead man's hard humanity. The charming old woman cheats on her husband and dies the young boy. Old things are becoming new and new things are dying. There is snowy whiteness throughout, as a miracle-stricken history of cinema.
