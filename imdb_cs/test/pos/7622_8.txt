This movie is good. They seem to have used Tyrannosaurus Rex as a blown-out balloon, just like Godzilla, maybe in those 60-70 days, the scientist doesn't have enough information. for all kinds of dinosaurs. At that time, the scientist still makes a dinosaur, so I think this film was based on the movements of the Tyrannosaurus Rex in 60-70 years. Even the part where a giant rock, fired by someone on a Tyrannosaurus Rex, damages the Tyrannosaurus Rex and was knocked out for a while. Finally, the Tyrannosaurus Rex returned to search for food. There's something wrong with the film, just like a rifle, as one rifle can kill Tyrannosaur Rex when it could be 1000-5,000 stronger than us. If this movie is going to be a remake, I suggest it be more good and excited because watching an old movie seems to have a remake if it's lucky.
