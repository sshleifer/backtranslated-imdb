Spike Milligan's books and games have beaten filmmakers over the years and, unfortunately, the 2002 Puckoon is no exception. The 1924 novel relates to the division of Ireland, particularly its influence on the lone community ("Puckoon" title). Due to a colossal error, half of the village is now in Northern Ireland, the other half is in the Republic. Local people go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find barbed wire that blocks their way. Drinkers crowd like sardines into the corner of a pub to enjoy a cheaper pint. The dead man must have a passport in his name before the villagers can get to the cemetery to bury him. 'Puckoon' is an Irish "Under Milk Wood" with comic characters and incredible events. The lead character, Dan Milligan (renamed 'Madigan' in the film) is ruthlessly played by Sean Hughes, and has interviews with the narrator (Richard Attenborough). Also in the film are Milo O'Shea, Griff Rhys Jones, David Kelly (from Robin's Nest), Freddie Jones, Joe McGann and Elliott Gould. In an interview for 'Making of' Puckoon, a documentary, writer / director Terence Ryan expressed unbelievable admiration for this book. Appears on the screen. But, unfortunately, as well as the unfortunate movie "The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy," a good book doesn't necessarily mean a good movie. The problem with 'Puckoon' is that, like the other Milligan books, they just don't work on the big screen. 'Puckoon' is basically a collection of jokes in search of conspiracy. No way the movie can be compared to train wrecks like 'Sex Lives Of The Potato Men', 'Fat Slags' and' Lesbian Vampire Murderers, but it's not as good as it should be. The last half hour includes a lot of running by the police, the British army, some locals who have the explosives hidden in the coffin, and it is really boring to sit. Ryan's decision to stick to the book is the main reason for his inability to work as a film. Another problem is the complete absence of magic. 'Waking Ned' had it in spades, while the television series 'Father Ted' was far more enjoyable. Spike lived long enough to see the movie, and he probably enjoyed it. His daughter Jane has a portrait as Madigan's bride. But the highlight for me was the quote at the beginning: "I don't mind dying!" I don't want to be there when it happens! â€œ.
