The saving grace of this film is his humor. Warner Brothers threw himself into the strengths of his star and cast his version of General Custer on a rough, lively, irreverent joke with a romantic stripe and unexpected tension of idealism; It was Robin Hood again, and Flynn flourished in the role. All his best action pictures took advantage of his talent for mischief and comic timing, and this was no exception. It also benefits from the return of former co-founder Olivia de Havilland, despite an earlier agreement to break the partnership; part of Libby Custer's heavily-minded is better than sweet-love types of interest that she tired of playing for the studio in later Flynn movies, and after seeing the scenario specifically requested by de Havilland, he was cast so that she could do the justice of that part. In this final collaboration, she accumulates all her considerable acting skills into what she is, in the heart, basically a romping adventure film, and the chemistry of the screen is again - again, that she and Flynn get the chance to develop their characters outside the initial romance of the old married pair, into the same winning effect. The pairing of Flynn / de Havilland and the comedy strip are what gave this film a durability when most of the other Flynn westerns remained so affectionate to the contemporary American public, though allegedly not their star - they have long forgotten. The action scenes are fairly cursory (despite the irony that death in addition to a fall during one of the filmed charges) and the villains of this piece turn out to be school-fashion to be the same people who were terrible to our hero. on his very first day at West Point, and thus continue to frustrate him throughout his career. This reduces the cast on the list, but it's a little too morally comfortable. However, these are quarrels largely irrelevant to a movie that never set out to be more than an exciting piece of fun. Errol Flynn, who has been enthusiastically supported and supported by a skilful group of support players (including unforgettable Anthony Quinn in the role of leader of the Sioux), is practicing his way through the plot of his usual arsenal: a glamorous look, unexpected sweetness, malevolent flashes, indignation of lightning, cheerful community and absolutely octane charisma. It's a ruthless braggart, but you can't help but like him. And it's hard to go away without the "Garryowen" tune threading its jaunty way through your ears for many days afterwards. <br /> <br /> This is one of Flynn's permanent hits; it also contains a surprising amount of good playing between fun, and is a film worthy of being remembered.
