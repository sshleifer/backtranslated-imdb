This movie was beautiful and moving. She touched the place deep inside me, and I'm not sure why. I am a happily married woman and I have never had a lesbian tendency, but my film almost did something I desire. Choreography, plot, dialogue ... the film was a work of art. A spoiler-free synopsis is that a woman gymnast dissatisfied with her life and search ... something, anything. He's with a man who doesn't want a baby, but he does. This does not mean to her, but does not treat her as a woman should treat her. She stayed in shape for all these years and decided to return to the gym. During acrobatic training, she meets another woman and develops an intimate and beautiful relationship. Throughout the film, she has another friend she has trained in her younger years and has remained close friends. The relationship that is developing is .. I don't know the word completely, but very understanding, comfortable, intimate, but sexy ... something that could only exist between two women. A relationship that could really make sense in your life. Someone who feels strange, exciting, beautiful, confused i. <br /> <br /> The relationship with her close friend is beautiful in a different way. They have a close and intimate relationship. Her girlfriend showed me what a real friend was. Someone who is understanding, easy to go, REAL, fun to be with someone who is there for you no matter what it is. Someone who is supportive, and you can curl up and tell your deepest secret. Someone who shares your past but does not share your secrets. The story is simple in that it wasn't an exaggeration, but in no way did it. It leaves a lot of sensual images to capture them moments. Dance and choreography were amazing. I can watch it over and over again. The way the artist captured the feelings and emotions of the main character was. Dance and pictures were very dazzling and fascinating to watch. What a cozy story! I fell in love with this movie. If you have a chance, rent it and watch it !!
