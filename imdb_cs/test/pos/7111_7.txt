A year after the release of the average "Frankenstein House", Universal released another Monster Mash, where all their famous characters would collide again. "House of Dracula" would reunite Dracula, Frankenstein's creature and Wolf man for what would be their last battle and eventually close the studio era. Directed once again by Erle C. Kenton, "The House of Dracula" represents a mild but noticeable improvement over the previous film and delivers a better-designed (though still faulty) story that is far from perfect, more appropriate than the previous film. The story ignores most of the events from the previous record, "Frankenstein House", and brings the story a new angle. Count Dracula (John Carradine), tired of having to hide in the sunlight, asks for the help of a brilliant scientist, Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens), a doctor who is known for his research in biology. Edelman is fascinated by Dracula, and soon experimental treatment begins, in the meantime, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), a Wolf Man, visits Edelman to get rid of his curse. Soon Edelman realizes that Dracula is a monster that must be destroyed, but his own exposure to Dracula's blood also causes illness. The discovery of the Frankenstein monster (Glenn Strange) in nearby catacombs will bring more confusion to the mind of a brilliant scientist. <br /> <br /> After the previous clash of monsters, it is good to see a series that comes back. to the roots and bringing almost straightforward Gothic horror, returning to the dark pessimistic nature of this kind of film and moving away from the comical relief of the previous recordings. The story (Edward T. Lowe Jr.) has many interesting topics, such as the contrast between Dracula and Talbot (both looking for a cure but with different purposes) and Edelman's growing madness. Probably among the most interesting topics is the inclusion of Nina's character, a wonderful but deformed woman who helps Dr. Edelman hopes to be cured of his condition. Director Erle C. Kenton is again and this time she finally captures the dark nature of these three characters, the nature that was apparently lost in the previous film. Despite the low budget, Kenton crafted Gothic horror that, while simple, is quite effective, and even manages to present old partners such characters in a fresh way. While it is never at the original level, "House of Dracula" restores the charm once made by the Universal Studios horror movies, and Kenton ensures that at least the last time the monsters get a chance to experience. The cast is very good this time, with Carradine, Chaney and Strange, who overcome their roles (although Strange's role is significantly smaller) with more enthusiasm than in the previous movie. Adding Onslow Stevens, Jane Adams and Martha O'Driscoll to cast returns the tragedy and drama to the series, with Stevens giving amazing performance as Dr. Edelman. A small portrait of Lionel Atwill and the presence of Skelton Knaggs as the haunted Steinm√ºhl has completed one of the best casts of universal horror movies in years. <br /> <br /> "Dracula House" is a nice addition to the series, especially after the average "Frankenstein House". It's nice to see Kenton in shape in a somewhat serious horror movie, and although the storyline is quite original, it suffers not only from the budget, but because the film tries to do a lot in a very short run with a bad result. It is true that the characters have all the inventive storylines, but the film devotes very little time to each of them, and the film appears to be hurrying and incoherent. by far the worst of the series. "The House of Dracula" is a nice closure of one of the best times for a horror genre, when ghosts and ghouls roamed the foggy nights, and mad scientists gave life to nasty monsters. Later, the monsters would return to "Bud Abbott & Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948), but that would be a completely different context. after unsatisfactory previous records it is easy to reject the "House of Dracula" but give it a chance and let the monster roam the last time. 7/10
