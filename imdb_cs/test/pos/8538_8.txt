Evil Ed is a Swedish film about a man named Ed (of course) and his collapse into total madness after editing a series of horror movies B known as The Loose Limbs. Ed is so mad he thinks he sees demons and monsters, but in fact they are people he knows and people who are close to him, like his wife and daughter. I saw this film for the first time in 1998 and was confused by what I saw. To this day, I consider this film to be one of the darkest comedies. Since the film is almost slapstick funny with its gore scenes there are still a few scary moments. <br /> <br /> This is a cool movie, but don't expect anything amazing. It's just a fun movie that is good to show some of your friends some laughter. 8/10 stars
