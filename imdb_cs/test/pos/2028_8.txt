WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS! 'Rock Star' is one of the hard rock movies I've ever seen. The original idea of ​​the script focuses on a young singer in the 80s, who leads a band of one of the most famous hard rock bands of the period. Not only does he play his music on the note, but he also lives the life of his idols. When his friends give him up in search of some originality, fate plays a good turn and hires him to replace the lead singer of the idols. Did the dream come true? Nearly. While the life of the famous, including drug and sexual excesses of the 80's rock scene, begins to live, he will also have to face problems in his relationship with his girlfriend, who will support and finally have to answer questions about creativity and talking in band music . I liked the film, one of the reasons why it is one of the first times when the life and music of hard metal bands is shown in a realistic way. Fans of the genre will be satisfied with the soundtrack. The whole idea is original and questions of how the artist lives his life and creates his art are published in a reasonable and balanced way. Acting is pretty good, with Mark Wahlberg better than most other action flics I have seen recently, and Jennifer Aniston in tune with nice-girl-who-know-a-lot-about-life. More problematic is the end, which is quite conventional and can disappoint. It looks like the main character after finishing the big and famous band found their own creative path. But in the ironic twist, the music he plays in the club at the end is the worst in the movie! <br /> <br /> 8/10 on my personal level. Worth seeing - however, expect exposure to a high dose of metal. If you don't like this kind of music, you can avoid this movie.
