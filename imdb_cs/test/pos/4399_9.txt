That was the best movie I saw in 2000. The Cohen brothers have never let me down before and certainly not this time. It's one of those rare movies these days - it's funny, smart and extremely fun. I left the cinema with heat in my heart. Of course there are a lot of things Cohen - special characters and special aids, well-developed land and magic camera. But no Cohen movie resembles any other Cohen movie if you overlook its overall quality, of course. A big surprise for me was that Clooney was so good. But the real masterpiece in this film comes from Tim Blake-Nelson. But the rest of the cast is also great. A movie that is a light comedy with a musical touch that develops its story around old collections and ancient country music - dripping wit and intelligence. This is a very unlikely combination. But it's exactly what this picture is.
