The historical inaccuracies of this film have been well documented. It has never been intended to be a serious history, but a fun saga, and it will succeed. Errol Flynn was never better because this role was adapted to him. Olivia DeHavilland has never been more beautiful. Arthur Kennedy has never been more wicked. Anthony Quinn has never been more noble than Crazy Horse. She had a lot of humor and pathos and captivated your interest. The only historical aspect I found most inaccurate was the last "Last Stand" that took place on the banks of the Little Upper Corner. The film version was filmed in the desert where there was no river. But I still find this a wonderful entertainment typical of the golden age of Hollywood.
