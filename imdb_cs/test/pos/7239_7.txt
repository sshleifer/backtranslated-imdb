A very bizarre presentation of the tragic love story of William Shakespeare on screen. The Que family and the Capulet family have a long-standing hatred that often leads to violence. Hatred has something to do with film society and the fact that everyone is pretty crazy. In the midst of this madness are Tromeo and Juliet, the best-known lovers of literature, who at first glance fall on each other and problems arise when they realize who the second family belongs to. <br /> <br /> The film follows the basic picture of the original game remarkably well and the key scenes even use the original or almost original lines. But the infamous Three Bizarre without the passage of film from beginning to end. That's for a movie that's definitely not for all tastes, but it's pretty resourceful. Tyrone (Tybalt in Shakespeare) has a particularly funny scene of death. 7/10 <br /> <br /> There are many different edited and rated versions. Everyone contains violence, profanity, drug use and sex, all with a great deal of bizarre.
