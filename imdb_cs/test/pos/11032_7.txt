I remember this movie, it was the first movie I watched in the cinema where the picture was dark in places where I was very nervous that it was back in 74/75. My dad took my brother and sister to Newbury in Newbury Berkshire England. I remember tigers and a lot of snow in the movie also the appearance of Grizzly Adams actor Dan Haggery I think one of the tigers gets shot and dies. If anyone knows where to find it on DVD etc please let me know. The cinema has now been turned into a fitness club, which is a very big pity, because the nearest cinema is now 20 miles away, I'd like to hear from others who have seen this movie or the like.
