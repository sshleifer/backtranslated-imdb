I have been a fan of the Heavenly Gate since my first release. I saw at least half a dozen and imagined it for a long time as a masterpiece. So it was with enthusiasm and foresight that I took myself to see the restored director's cut. To my surprise, I was disappointed to see him again and since then I have revised my movie estimate. The Gate of Heaven touches size in parts, but overall it lacks thematic and narrative consistency and passionate urgency characteristic of a really great movie. First, two technical issues: The sound quality is scattered throughout the movie sometimes turning to inaudible. Some of them, perhaps, are intentional - a way to mimic the chaos of history as it unfolds. But at key points one can't register what the characters say. Cinema is similarly scattered. Images lack sharpness and peculiarity of details. The result is a certain graininess and lack of image sharpness that will succeed in the foreground and background blur. Structurally, narrative is turned off the world, as if Cimino couldn't think completely about the effect he was on. He certainly wanted an epic. But a pastoral or dramatic epic? The film meets uneasily and unconvincingly between styles and possibly genres. Sometimes it reminded me of Terrence Malick's "Days of Heaven" or even "Elvira Madigan" at a small pace and elegant scene. At other times, it threatens to become a robust "Western" more like "The Wild Bunch". In fact, this second film offers an instructive point of reference for assessing the Gate of Heaven because it shares the same period of interest and uses a similar tone of ambivalent nostalgia for a darker but more heroic America. <br /> <br /> This structural and thematic uncertainty does not help the poor quality scenario, which often sounds and rips out in the ear. The result is an apocryphal sense of the period. The approaching size of the heavenly gate lies in her pieces. In particular, the succession of roller skates is amazingly beautiful, one of the most evocative scenes ever made. Another set that works very well when it comes to uniting the theme, mood and setting when Kristofferson and Huppert go in the new platform to the lake and she is washed while he sleeps in the shade. Mild stimulation, evocative music, and monumental scenery in this scene combine to convincingly portray a love story that could only be at the heart of the film - and which could be his saving grace if persecuted more persuasively. Some critics have complained about the length of the film. That alone doesn't bother me. A good movie can't be long enough. Renewed minutes are critical to restoring motivation and characterization that are missing in the cut version, and are full of image interest. Probably the main glory of the Heavenly Gate lies in a terribly evocative soundtrack. A repetitive waltz motif and its various modesty (whole band, guitar, solo violin, etc.) lends spooky quality to the foreground and creates a thematic consistency that is missing in the story itself. deficiencies, especially the absence of convincing narration, is a sense of grandeur in film. One leaves the cinema with a stupid sense of missed size and the desire that Cimino could re-establish the film - with the wisdom of time and a look back to correct what is so wrong.
