I haven't seen the more recent 'Traffic' based on it, but I'd bet on what's better. I know of no other film that portrays the complex tragedies of drug trafficking and the "drug war" so well. I have seen it at least four times and enjoy it again as part of the 30th anniversary of the Master Theater.
