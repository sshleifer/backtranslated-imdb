I rarely write reviews, but this movie just requires more attention than it gets because it contains the most hysterical kidnapping that was comedically badly shot. I only saw that once and found it the funniest movie I had the honor to watch. I laughed from start to finish. It's such a pity it's not on DVD or on video. You can only compare his cinematography with the film It's crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy world or promising something. Only this story is not as complex as a crazy world. I hope this movie will be released in the near future because it would be a shame to lose such a comic gem among the morals we have today.
