This film was a huge surprise for me when I watched it at Cinequest at the California Grand Theater in San Jose. It's a musical that I usually don't like, but I have to say this was different. Robert Peters, who directed and looked at the film, did such a great job. During his Q&A he told the audience that he had only two other people for his crew! Most dialouge was made in flight and he actually made a film while attending another film festival in Germany! I can't say a lot about this movie, the only bad thing is that you really notice the camera is working and shaking a little. If you come across this movie, check it out!
