Quai des Orfevres takes too long and Clouzot is so in love with his back-stage environment that he is almost in danger of forgetting the story. However, once he does, it's Clouzot at his best. Bertrand Blier (Bertrand Blier's father and co-founder of his Buffet Froid) is a world-renowned pianist who has married under him and who plans to kill a dirty studio studio with suggestions for his wife to find out that he has been beaten. Not only that, but his carefully planned but clumsy alibi falls to pieces, not least when a thief steals his car on the murder scene? The film really plunges into life with the arrival of Luis Jouvet's police inspector, a somewhat fabulous half-Alistair Sim in Green for Danger, and a half-tired Maigret with better dialogue. In a neat running gag, his investigation is constantly conducted at the top of the voice against chaos and noise, be it noisy police station typewriters or loud exams. The police station itself is a wonderfully realistic creation, a wealth of messy and telling little details that makes Steve Bocchco, a once-revolutionary American policeman of the 1980s, look like outdated museum pieces. If Suzy Delair is a somewhat unconvincing femme fatale, the support cast is more than just compensating, with beautiful Simone Renant, who is like a lesbian photographer in love with her from a distance and is always wrong with Blier's lover Delair and more stakeholders (just Jouvet, similarly unhappy with women, understands and really sympathizes). With a large black-and-white photograph of Armand Thirard, it is a wonderful little thriller with a nice ending and a beautiful scene with a taxi driver who reluctantly identifies Renant at the police station. (Trivia note: Pierre Larquey, who played playfully philosophical Dr Vorzet in Le Corbeau, appears in smaller roles as a taxi driver in both Quai and Les Espions.) <br /> <br /> The DVD criterion is quite excellent - great picture quality and a lighting listing from a French TV show with interviews with Clouzot, Blier and Renant.
