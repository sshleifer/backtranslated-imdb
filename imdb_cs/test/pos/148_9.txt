'Oldboy' director Park Chun-wook returns with what must be one of the most beautiful and most serious vampire films in film history. The credibility of the latest Hollywood pigeons, vampires these days, should be rather nonviolent, asexual, loving chevaliers instead of the evil fiercely sexual man who manipulates the mind and the person who manipulates people. This is the movie you want to see if you want to remember the sticky excitement of the past ... well, at least in the second half. 'Thirst' begins with a long exposure of character, culminating in a slightly different love story. The vampire transformation of the priest has been pushed to the edge of the romantic and sexual aspects of the story for some time, causing some unpleasant watching. But the last 40 minutes are surprisingly cruel. Well, maybe not so surprisingly when you know 'Oldboy' and 'I'm Cyborg, but that's okay', but I think it's fair to say that 'Thirst' will beat Park's earlier films in terms of face-to-face violence. All in all, it is not an artistic cinema or a horror. For many, it may be too disgusting and for some too tame. Thirst is original, fun and fortunately a little less strange than previous Chun-wook efforts.
