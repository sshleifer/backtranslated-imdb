Running from time is somewhere in the middle of the Johnny To cannon, in the "solid good" category. As a criminal thriller it's not terribly original or overwhelming, and the action scenes won't let you blow, but it has something else to do. After all, it's Johnny's movie, it must. Andy Lau has 72 hours of life. He decided to play a weird cat and mouse game with the host of the HK police negotiator, Lau Ching Wan. This is a storyline. In addition, they heap layers and twists that keep driving interesting all the time. Occasionally it becomes too convoluted for its own causes, but it never allows it to make the best of it. However, like Johnny's going to hand over a slippery and well-made crime flick (which, let's have it, are dimes), he slips in pieces and pieces that bring running from time alive as a full emotional experience that provides soul and heart well oiled skeleton. The concepts of synchronism and minimalism (kernels in his work) are explored to a large extent here. Always subtle, letting images speak for themselves, giving them time to develop with long shots and slow tracking of shots, exemplary cutting to score, it's all here. The little love story on the bus between Andy Lau and the girl belongs to the highlights of the movie and the part of the "heart" I'm talking about. So simple, but so powerful. Ditto for Lau's and Lau Ching Wai and bowling room demonstrations. However, something prevents me from saying that running from time is a masterpiece. It has all the abilities and craftsmanship up to the notch, but he can also be too industrious or indistinct at times. When it's good, it's REAL good. There are even an isolated moment of pure brilliance that are just a TOO good for their own cause, leaving a bitter taste to the rest of the film. I am convinced that if it gives him a heart, he can make a really great movie. It's another of his films that are flawed but enjoyable. Under the neat HK style, it's black humor and a heartfelt drama that makes it a compelling movie. Certainly worth watching.
