Here we have an intelligent blend of typical hongkongmovieshootouts, worlddestructionthemes and smart filmmaking. Not that the script does not have its big holes and a few specialeffects are a bit cheaper. But cinematography is optical treatment and the soundtrack is the first speed. The blend of quick action consequences and color slow, sometimes almost poetic parts, has no comparison in its film, so the classification is quite tough. The closest genre is catastrophe or terrorist movements with deeper human and political remarks than usual. It is worth seeing the world in cinemas. But I hope that for so many other (mostly Asian) movies before and no one seems to believe me. Unfortunately.
