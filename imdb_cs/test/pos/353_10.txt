the mario series is back, and in my opinion it is better than ever. Galaxy is the most creative Mario yet; even more than super mario 64th controls are great; some of the best for the wii. beautiful graphic design. levels are very big and good old bosses are back. in this game you need to explore tons; certainly a high level of playback. I have only 2 complaints: 1: The story is a bit similar to Mario 64 and 2: The difficulty is not very high; although it requires some patience. Mario Fans: The game you've been waiting for. Casual Players: This game is more than worth buying. 9.8 out of 10.
