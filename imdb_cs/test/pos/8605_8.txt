When the Hiroshima atomic bomb hits, fierce bodies lie all around the body, deformed victims try to communicate with relatives who cannot even recognize them, and one person dies from radiation exposure one more time. This black and white film, however sad and frightening, is not humorous. The story revolves around the young woman Yasuko, who was hit by black rain after the explosion. They are trying to get married, but everyone is dying and people are afraid it will happen to her. After finding a suitable partner (who loses his mind after being in the war for too long), he ends up with signs of radiation sickness. This film is a great portrayal of atomic attacks on Japan, scares you and maybe will cry. Acting is good, not too dramatic, like many other ww2 movies that have been made.
