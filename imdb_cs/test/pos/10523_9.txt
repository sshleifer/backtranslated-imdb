It happened to me that I captured the last 45 minutes of the movie, late in the evening about 8 years ago. What a wild and funny 45 minutes. I was totally eliminated by the chase-shoot-out at the end of the night, inside an old hotel that is torn down by a demolition ball .... Incredible. I vaguely remember Stacy Keach, stealing a police car, pretending to be a cop and a strong armor of some winos ... Wino Keach "Hey, why did Ya hasslin? ... Keach" It's my job. Big movie ... Golden70 ... Let's hope they'll see the daylight as a DVD along with other lost treasures ... Hickey and Boggs are one of those.
