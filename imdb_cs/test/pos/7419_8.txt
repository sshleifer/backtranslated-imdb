This movie has one of the best club scenes, a very good soundtrack (if you like techno / trance music) some situations (as the main character Carl starts taking drugs for example) are a bit out of reality, but the storyline is fun , but the characters are a bit shallow ... <br /> <br /> I don't recommend you see this movie if you don't like techno music <br /> <br /> For the land itself, this movie is 4/10, with really great special effects and club scenes and soundtrack is 7/10, but if you want to go to the movies just to hear nice tracks and catch a little club feeling, it's 10/10. <br /> <br /> Special effects are sometimes hidden, sometimes clearly visible. (ie fast moving clouds / sun / moon, morphing background, morphing cuts) <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it for myself, shame was no dance floor in the cinema;)
