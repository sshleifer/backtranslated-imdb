I've seen this movie for the second time. I first saw it in the mid-90s as Vanguard Video Selection. That has retained power. <br /> <br /> It is interesting from several aspects. One is that it is based on a true story. Two is the starting field for two interesting actors: Keanu Reeves and Crispin Glover. And three, it has Dennis Hopper in one of his better social misfit / psychotic character roles. The film is also a study in the way people act in different settings. You have characters in one person, in the family, in a group of peers, in school, in the general environment of society, etc. The story demonstrates how one will act in every environment. <br /> <br /> I wish I could find the details of the actual murders compared to the movie. I saw a short piece indicating that it had taken place in California, and that a few of my classmates had been taken to see the corpse. <br /> <br /> This is a good choice for renting a rainy night video. Be prepared to feel dissatisfied at the end.
