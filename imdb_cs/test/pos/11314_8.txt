Before I saw this picture, I was quite skeptical, I do not like movies with an agenda, nor do I think I was afraid to think like a writer. I was also afraid it would be like a two-piece mini-series "10.4" that had a concept, a small relationship to the real world, and a very poor performance. At the beginning it is said: "This film is fiction, but the events portrayed and information about British emergency planning are based on extensive research"; And the general feeling is that you are not being sold for thought, but that you have taught a lesson in civil awareness. The message that is being transmitted is obvious from the beginning: it comes and we are not ready. Using real places and a scenario that could not only happen - There are plans to do it - all of which contributes to the disturbing effect of the film, even on the cynical viewers. The film's perspective is in society and will stay away from the refracting personal moments that won't release the message, so none of Romeo-Juliet's drama we're used to.
