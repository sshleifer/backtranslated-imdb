This is certainly a quality movie with classy cast. As for the movies about Carlos Jackal, this beats Bruce Willis' weak effort in 'The Jackal' to bloody flesh, then spits on them. I am a little surprised that this film did not attract more voices, something like a sleeper. Too bad because this movie is definitely worth watching. It's smart and never boring. You see it, 7/10
