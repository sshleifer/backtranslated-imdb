It's a little dated now, it's almost 30 years. It's amazing that I have this on BETA tape and it still plays well. If it came to the DVD, I'd take the pulse. Medicine Humor is not appreciated today as it was then. Then it wasn't so harmful. As well as driving without airbags, seat belts and child seats. I remember my father crying that he was looking so intensely. I had associates in the 90s who saw it and I could break them by getting on the intercom and saying, "Iiiiiiiivvvvyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy". three decades later!
