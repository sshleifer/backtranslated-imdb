It is an excellent, exciting film about murder and mystery. Not only was the plot full of tensions and intrigues, but for a few hours you see the beautiful Ryan Gosling, what it is not to love! Also Sandra Bullock is good in this movie - I've always been a fan of her (I just wished she didn't decide to be in "The Lake House" that was terrible, but that's a completely different story). Obviously, there are thousands of other murders / horrors out there, there are bound to be similarities between them, no need to bash this movie for having some similarities with at least a few that have already been made. By the way, it's a great movie for those of you who really have "scary" movies, it's a bit dark and twisted, but overall a great movie !!!
