I was a fan of Larry King's show for a while, I think he's doing a great job overall, and I don't think he ever "dared" as many people seem to believe. He's a savvy Scorpio, getting into it when he needs, just as he did last night with Paris Hilton during her first prison interview. The thing about this is really impressing me is that Hilton is still apparently clueless about why Judge Sauer gave her what she believes is too hard a sentence (and what's more, MADE eats it) served). All the time she was in jail, supposedly only 23 hours a day in her cell, she had never returned in her mind the events that led her to the sentence Judge Sauer tossed her to. She never realized that she could go to the main red flag when she (1) appeared late in the court for the original hearing and (2) continued to be informed when she asked her that she didn't know her license was suspended, she didn't get the papers in the post that "I have people who read something like this to me." Throughout the time she was in her cell, she had never come to know that this action (appearing late) and this statement - and more importantly, the attitude - the utter cavalry contempt of the court System and law in general and her driving privileges, especially what she showed - maybe she did Judge Sauer (forgive the pun) for her to chew on her. Last night, at the royal exhibition, after giving her lips how her traumatic experience had changed forever, how she had "learned" the lesson, she answered her question: "Do you think you have raw trade? "With a loud voice. And during the conversation (if you can call it), she said more than once that she didn't feel she deserved what had happened to her. The king asked, gently, more than once, when he didn't feel that she creates a situation in her life, in which she "finds herself", to which she has looked unconditionally, in principle, therefore, has a conscious belief that she has been sacrificed in this situation; , her cavalier attitude with the judge.I think it is very sad - tragic, even given what is the huge "pattern" of Hilton for some people, and does what she said last night about her so-called rehabilitated state, spheres of total and utter helplessness, contradiction and hypocrisy. During the conversation, Hilton mentioned spending a lot of time in his cell reading the Bible. what is her obl She replied in confusing fumbling with her poor remarks (completely superficial insights she had read in the air, as if it were Nelson Mandella or something) and finally hoarse, "I don't have a favorite passage." Judge Sauer, in my book, is a hero, and last night, like Larry King, for the fine Hilton exposure for what he really is.
