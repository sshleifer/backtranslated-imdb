I have to admit that this is one of Cameron Diaz's unheard of movies and I was also surprised she had an important role, but she wasn't a leader. I was very touched by how I can really recognize the pain of losing a loved one as I experienced it from a nearby neighborhood. Camilla Belle and Jordana Brewster were really good at their portrayal of the protagonist Phoebe and I have to pass it on to people who are looking for two actresses who look so similar that I thought they were sisters (in real life). This is one of those movies Cameron did for acting and not for stellar billing. She looked at a part of a beautiful, rebellious hippie who wants to change the world, though sometimes she leaves as a rebel without cause. She comes from a dysfunctional family where her only source of power is her big sister Faith, a little girl Phoebe is, of course, very upset when faith leaves Europe. As she grows up, she goes in search of a sister and gradually becomes disillusioned with the truth about her sister and the fall for her sister's friend. <br /> <br /> Great story and the same great filming location around Europe. do it again.
