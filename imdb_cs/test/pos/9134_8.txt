While it is not a masterpiece that "Le Samourai" was (I accept now that Jean-Pierre Melville has never been able to top classics), "Le Cercle Rouge" is much better than "Bob le flambeur". I felt that "Bob le flambeur" was an above-average and influential b-movie, but still a b-movie. "Le Cercle Rouge" proves that as a filmmaker Melville has improved as he continued. John Woo is a massive fan of Melville, though their film-making style differs. While Woo uses a quick move for shootings and an operative sense of violence, Melville has a minimalist style that suits him very well. He was not interested in creating fast-moving action movies, but in a more meditative crime thriller. He was one of the best in this department. "Le Samourai" is still his best work, mainly because he has more characters than this, but at the technical level, it's probably the same. In addition, while "Le Samourai" had one great performance, it has four. Alain Delon is a super-cool gangster on the hunt again - the silence of this man is fascinating. Bourvil is an excellent police inspector in the event of a robbery and has escaped. He steals every scene he is in and proves to be a skilled dramatic actor (in France he is best known as a grotesque comedian in Buster Keaton's mode). Yves Montand is also great as an uncertain and paranoid weapon expert. Gian Maria Volont√® (regular in spaghetti westerns) is overshadowed by her three stars, but still does the job. Again, Melville's direction is excellent. A man who has the same influence on both American criminal thrillers and the new French wave, always knows the best shots and angles he chooses. This is much slower than most fast movements, but it really pays to end. "Le Cercle Rouge" is slightly smaller than being an absolute classic, but it is still one of the best movies ever made. Tarantino had to see it before she made "Reservoir Dogs". (8/10)
