This is one of the few movies with amazing acting, a wonderful story and a good track. It's about changes in life. It's about how happiness can be found when one is true to oneself. It's about accepting yourself and others. It's about life challenges. It's about getting to reality. It's about courage. It's about love. Both actresses are very faithful to their role. The actresses had very good chemistry in the film. This is the key to the film he made. It's rare to see an independent movie like this. One could say the hard work the film crew had to make in making this film. I want to see more of this producer's movie. Watch the movie, you'll love it.
