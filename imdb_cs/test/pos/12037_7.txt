Turner Classic Movie Channel spent the month of January with one of my favorite actors, Robert Montgomery. His films are rarely watched these days, except for those that have been atypical to most of his career - that is, the roles that often appear on TV are AVAILABLE, LADY ON LAKE, JUNE BRIGHT, NIGHT MUST BE SAXON CHARM , RIDE THE PINK HORSE, RAGE IN HEAVEN, EARL CHICAGO (briefly films he fought to get into the role because they weren't the usual comic fluff he usually discovered). Ironically, today, when one thinks of Montgomery's career, it is films that were mostly made after 1937 and that were broken into the original image that MGM and Louis B. Mayer were pushing. Too bad Montgomery was a gifted comedian and saved many movies from routine. PETTICOAT FEVER is one such film. Made in 1936 with PICADILLY JIM and TROUBLE FOR TWO it was the banner year of Montgomery's good performances, and helped lead to its ability to convince the forces that are in MGM to allow him to play "Danny" at night must fall next. PETTICOAT FEVER takes place in Labrador and Montgomery is a weather station operator called Dascom Dinsmore. He has lived there for five years and most of the time he was not in the company of women (except the Inuit women). She has a girlfriend named Clara (Winifred Shotter), which he has designed, but it has been two years since he heard from her, so she believes she gave up. Dinsmore's World Shakes When Sir James Felton and Irene Campton (Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy) Appear. They flew to Toronto for a business meeting that Felton was about to address. Felton is employed in Campton, but Dinsmore finds her charming ... and gradually considers him equally attractive. Certainly pompous, confident and hopelessly inept Felton is not a contest (it's the scale of Owen's acting that keeps the character entertaining, though it's hard for them to believe that such a breast is a Canadian industry captain). There's something surreal about this movie - probably because of the original game. While the "Labrador" scenery is quite fake looking it serves its purpose for comedy (witness th polar bear sequence). But the height of surrealism is the dinner Dinsmore serves to his guests, the "pemmican steaks" dinner Owen dreams of with a real taste. Owen (a smaller nobleman like a baronet) is dressed in normal clothing - a winter suit for the climate). But Montgomery is dressed in a suit of evening gowns (as if taking part in an embassy ball). Loy, as she wore him, also dressed her clothes. Servant Dinsmore - assistant, Inuit Kimo (Otto Yamaoka), who also has an evening dress suit, is shown to be Owen! Owen, who had previously insisted that Dinsmore turn into a suit more suited to his station, is the only person who is inappropriately dressed for this dinner !! Montgomery was MGM's most elegant actor in a tuxedo or evening dress (Franchot's tone was his closest rival). It's a toss-up in the movie if Montgomery or Fred Astaire was a more elegant figure in such suits. Hard to decide. The process of love does not move smoothly in comedy or drama. Clara is appearing (at the beginning of the film we are at the beginning of the movie when we see her on the ice ship). Will Dinsmore stop with Clara? Will Irene and Felton stop? The movie is funny and Loy and Montgomery make a nice couple. They appeared together in one other film, and both were in separate scenes in the second, before this film. But that would be their last movie together. <br /> <br /> The last point of interest - at the beginning of the movie, when credits are displayed, you see illustrations of men and women in comic situations. They are based on the work of John Held Jr., the great cartoonist / illustrator of the 1920s and 1930s - who was a drummer and "Jazz Age" writer. It's an unusual choice because it has absolutely nothing to do with a movie plot or Labrador.
