Story-wise does not belong to the best or cleverly written Columbo movie, but the film is very well made, with excellent direction and really gentle gaming. Especially acting in this film attracts attention. Director Nicholas Colasanto did a great job with the actors in the film. Peter Falk and John Cassavetes left a lot of space to play, even though they are both added as unrecognized directors of the film. He must be part of his directorial style to allow the actors so much space. This works very well for this movie. Maybe he did it because Colasanto himself also worked as an actor. He is perhaps best known for playing the role of Coach in the hit-series "Cheers", from the very beginning that in 1982 until his death in 1985. <br /> <br /> So Peter Falk looks better than ever before \ t in his role Lt. Columbo. Also, veteran John Cassavetes does a great job as a movie by his killer and is a good match for the lieutenant. In addition, the film also includes Myrna Loy. A big star from the silent film era and also Pat Morita, in a small early role. But not only is the film's acting direction really good. It is also a really great movie visually and technically, with slow long shots, without any cuts. Perhaps the reason why this movie is longer than most Columbo movies. It really takes time to set things up and tell your story. The film also includes some nice artistic and experimental shots. Of course it is really suitable for the 70s. But as I said, story-wise doesn't just belong to the best Columbo movies. This time there are also some obvious traces left out for the lieutenant. He's doing the killer as a little stupid, as if he didn't think his plan was good enough, while the character was probably an intelligent man. This time Columbo is also trying to irritate suspects and other characters a little more than he usually tries to do to solve this crime. Peter Falk's and this different approach is why his character might be so different than in other Columbo films. But otherwise, this does not mean worse. The film also includes a rather good musical score by Richard DeBenedictis, who then became a stable composer of Columbo films. <br /> <br /> Great Columbo movie you can watch! <br /> <br /> 8/10
