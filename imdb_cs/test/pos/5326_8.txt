Before I saw this movie, I read a note from someone who didn't care much about him. I have to admit that I was afraid to spend 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life, but I'm glad I did. Ryan Gosling is a fantastic actor, especially I loved Believer. Don Cheadle was also fantastic. The film presented an interesting look at life and death. It was very moving and very sad, but I was still wondering which strange stories they couldn't do. It's a movie that ruthlessly discovers whether you like it or not. It was unique and I don't think anyone can duplicate it. All young actors surprisingly well presented the theme and emotions that had to go into it. I was pleasantly surprised.
