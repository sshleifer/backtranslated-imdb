It seems that all people don't like Steven Seagal: Just look at his nomination list, there are only razzie nominations (with one win), but I don't think he got anything on it. I saw good movies with Steven Seagal, I saw bad movies with Steven Seagal. And PATRIOT (1998) is one of his best films, almost as good as UNDER SIEGE (1992) or HARD TO KILL (1990). PATRIOT shows its nature conservation activities. This film is certainly not great and I have to say that there is more violence than me and why must Seagal's best friend L. Q. Jones die of the victim's death? Dr. McClaren is one of the best performances of Seagal. He has, as always, a very good charisma. In short, PATRIOT is good fun - and the average rating of only 4 points is the most underrated movie of all time. Sincerely, Hans-Dieter
