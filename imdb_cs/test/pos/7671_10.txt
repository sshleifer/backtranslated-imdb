I found this movie as one of the best at this time and time. The cast was very exceptional and the most entertaining for all who saw it. looking for him every year. The film showed me how far we got to become gifted at the craft, where we could only have pointless roles to act as buffons and servants. Porky and Bess showed some of the city life in my neighborhood when I saw it when I needed good solid male models. Singing and acting skipped me for days and played the role of different characters in this excellent movie.
