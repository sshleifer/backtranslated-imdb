Pleasantly cynical, sarcastic and intense film, mocking and imitating Pulp Fiction and stylized gangster movies, is a fun, fun and fun ride on Thursday. An amazingly eclectic mix of high-end characters and bizarre entertainment situations, this day in the life of a shooter trying to go straight, it proves to be a worthy addition to a series of films trying to emulate the genius of Tarantino's dark, humorous Pulp Fiction. Nick (Aaron Eckhardt) stops at Casey's house (Thomas Jane) to catch up on old times. Casey was a former drug traitor who has since reformed, became an architect, married a successful businesswoman (Paula Marshall) and is now considering taking a child. Nick, still tied to the gangster underworld, leaves Casey's case packed with drugs while borrowing a car to run several errands? a.k.a. unfinished business. Casey is disgusted and angry with the introduction of drugs into her home and flushes them into the kitchen sink. This is the moment when, one by one, Nick's double hybrid, the rape of Rastafarian messengers and crooked cops, all come to knock on unsuspecting Casey, who is about to have one incredible Thursday. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a hilarious sequence at a gas station where Nick is looking for the best coffee cup offer. After thinking about what size cup to get, a fiasco breaks out with the cashier when he demands a free snackie cake and uses a $ 50 bill to pay. The result of a comically brilliant bloodshed is the situation when a cop intervenes and gets caught in the most unusual circumstances. This opening segment creates the perfect mood for the rest of the movie, which is never taken too seriously and contains outrageous characters who in this pointless gangster movie seem to be aware of their own existence. divided into segments based on different events and times during one day. This effect is very similar to Pulp Fiction, which is similarly given to the chapter, although Thursday does not hold a chronological order except for occasional flashbacks. Like Tarantino, the music represents every scene and every character. Strangely enough, a funny creature like a Jamaican hit-man pizza delivery man who rapes over the phone and shares his hashish, and Paulina Porizkova's more narcissistic Dallas, who tries to rape Casey, add humor to every event no matter how frightening and unnerving some from coincidence. When Mickey Rourke is introduced to a quiet backbone-chilling crooked cop Kasarov is introduced, a rigorous staging and complex setup is fully assembled, and Casey's sticky situation is becoming even more daring and commendable. Definitely wannabe Pulp Fiction, with plenty of violence, witty dialogue and extremely fearsome antagonists, Thursday does some things right, but other attempts to pay may go so far as to mean a rip-off. The Flashback sequence that shows Casey shooting baddies and a sports hairstyle that exactly matches what John Travolta does in Pulp Fiction is one step too far. Mike Massie
