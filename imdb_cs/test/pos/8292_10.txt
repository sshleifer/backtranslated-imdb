I loved this movie for a long time. I didn't see it in a minute, so I checked it again and found it even more enjoyable. I loved the Chipmunks cartoon when I was young, so I naturally adored the "Chipmunk Adventure". <br /> <br /> I honestly can't imagine a better plot for this movie. It's not wildly creative, but I've always wanted to travel around the world, so I enjoyed watching my desire to travel grow even more. The part with Elenore singing to the little penguin always makes me cry ... <br /> <br /> 'Chipmunk Adventure' will remain my favorite forever, I'm sure. I think it's because I saw it when I was so young. I don't think it would affect anyone older to see him for the first time. (Of course, if they don't have a young heart)
