This is a very moving movie about life itself. The challenges that a person with a disability must face in a country that expects perfection to come to the fore so that everyone can see and perhaps understand. It should teach society fanatics that we are all human beings, and while some of us are endowed with minds, hearts and healthy bodies, there are decent human beings that exist in the world and are not so happy or maybe we are. unhappy again. We do not always see the beauty of the world because we are packed in our "blind" ambitions and we see it in just one light "what can this world do for me !!!". Maybe we want us to be like a Radio, a loving happy individual ... who loves everyone.
