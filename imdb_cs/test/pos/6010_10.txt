This film is a great example of the quality dramas that Channel 4 and the BBC have produced over the years. Ted Danson brings a powerful performance to a man who is tortured by memories that no one will accept, and a society that believes he is mad. It's a remarkable achievement of a man best known for his role in Cheers, a television comedy. Supporting casts are very well chosen, not least Mary Steenbergen, Danson's wife, who plays Gulliver's wife in the film. But above all, they are smooth and very subtle shifts between our world and the Gulliver world that make this film. The difference in perspective between giants and dwarfs, who have acted as real actors, is beautifully captured. A rare documentary on cinematography and directing.
