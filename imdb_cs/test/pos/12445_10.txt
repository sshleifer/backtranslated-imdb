Slipknot is a heavy metal band from the big city of Des Moines in Iowa, in which the rockers wear their different mask (I know someone has said it, but I have to fill in the space for this review). Band members include Joey, Mick, 133, Sid, Clown, James, Corey, Chris and Paul. This band is in my opinion one of the best new metal bands and should be heard by anyone who loves hardcore rock. Another good movie is called "DISASTERPIECES", which shows the band's performance in the London Arena. The "My Plague" video was recorded on DVD. Most kicking the ass song they did is also there there (Sic). So if you love the band, you have to see it and if you like heavy metal music you have to hear this band.
