The problem with film is simply simple, Conrad's prose is powerfully detailed and cannot be adapted to film. Marlow's narrative in the novel will capture you from the first sentence and you just "see" what Conrad is writing about. In the movie, it's different, you see the visual, but the description and reflection that really makes the novel is terribly missing. However, if the customized book has been adapted, it has a good level. There are exactly the same scenes that are labeled quite geniously, but never have the same effect as in the novel. The storyline has been improved and works very well to make it more interesting. References to ancient Egypt have been thoughtfully inserted. My tip, read the book and keep it that way, there are better movies.
