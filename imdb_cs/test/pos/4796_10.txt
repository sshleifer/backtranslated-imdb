I love the absurdity and biting humor of Buñuel's surrealistic films (such as "The Discourse of the Bourgeoisie" and "The Outminating Angel" to name two). Other, earlier works (such as "Forgetting", about juvenile delinquents in the suburbs of Mexico) are more serious and provide a strong social message. However, I think it is "Nazarin", which shoots most in the viewer's heart. Although it is true that it is full of irony, it nevertheless reveals the aspect of Buñuel, which would appear to be fascinated by the beauty and feast of the spiritual quest. While the director (usually typically) throws innumerable blows in the Catholic Church, he seems surprisingly showing admiration for true Christian thinking and his practice of selfless love. "What did Luis Buñuel unbelievably praise Jesus' character? I always thought of him as an absolutely cynical artist without a trace of faith in human virtue ... that is until I saw" Nazarin. " that he satirically exposes the difficulty of following Christ's example in a society infested with senses, ignorance and sin, but also represents the hero, Father Nazari, as a beacon of light in the middle of the sea of ​​darkness. Some would argue that Father Nazari's doubts about his faith point to the loss of his secular values. (Unfortunately, if he cannot do good in this world, who can?) I would say, however, that this "mistake", his frustration , precisely makes his character more proud because he shows how human he is and how difficult his struggle must be in. And who says the priest could not emerge from that "dark night" and regain confidence? We were presented only with a heavy part of his spiritual journey, and the elegant, open end (in which he desperately accepts the fruit offered by a female stranger) allows us to imagine the final result of the story. <br /> <br /> In Buñuel, I recognize an aggressive, self-confident atheist blessed with brilliant wit and social awareness; but after watching "Nazarin", I also feel some warmth, depth and maturity that is not so evident in his other work. For the sake of contrast, I strongly recommend watching his short film "Simon of the Desert" (also made in Mexico, several years later). He deals with a similar theme - leaving the ego in the face of temptation - and only in a hysterically funny and utterly irreverent style.
