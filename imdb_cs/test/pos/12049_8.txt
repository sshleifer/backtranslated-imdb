The films Shahrukh Khan and Yash Chopra never failed. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is a romantic classic. Dil To Pagal Hai was fresh and perfect to watch. Mohabbatein remains as one of my favorite movies ever. And Veer-Zaara was magical. Darr, though not the best, is a romantic thriller that differs from the above movies, but it's definitely worth watching. And the SRK, who fired me with excellent performance in Baazigar, repeats the villain. And this time he gets Juhi Chawl and Sunny Deol to support him. Before I comment on acting, it's not just playing, but also an amazing script that's worth it. It's writing that compliments great acting. The story is breathtaking, but characterization is what stands out. The comedy song is doing well. But the film tends to shift too much to romance. The viewer is obliged to lose interest and make a few yawns. But the movie is still good. Shahrukh Khan is brilliant in his author role. Again, Shahrukh Khan is sympathetic and cruel. At the end you have to cry. Juhi Chawla is decent. Her screams must become uncomfortable after a while. But the facial expression is excellent. But her final scene is brilliant (though it was overshadowed by the SRK). She has an authorial role that makes her very sympathetic. Sunny Deol is sufficient. His character was very sympathetic, but too perfect. And after a while it gets bored. He has a good job. Anupam Kher is really funny, but his role felt a bit out. Tanvi Azmi is well supported. The songs are nice and come at the right time. Jadoo Teri Nazar (Magic At Your Sight) is my favorite song and presentation is like the 90's. Tu Mere Saamne (You're in front of me) and Likha Hai (written here) are nice love songs. Darwaza Band Kar Lo (Close the Door) is also a decent love song. The instrumental song is danced to perfection as well as naughty wedding song Solah Button. The film doesn't have to be perfect, but it's well worth your time, especially if your favorite actor is in it.
