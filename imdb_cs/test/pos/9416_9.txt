This movie has a voice of horror and makes it better. holmes protects the inventor in Switzerland and is on the trail of a professor's morality that has become a Nazi. this is a better version of holmes in the world of WWII. Rathbone does a great job with holmes like a spy and a detective. You see it if you like horror.
