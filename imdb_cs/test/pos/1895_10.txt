If you watch this movie you quote and refers to it for a long time to come. It's been a few years since I saw Dolemite and I quote it to this day. It's a real classic. It's so terribly horrible it makes a cheerful look. Every terrible line of dialogue is absolutely amazing. Every wobbly shot a work of art (?). And every stroke and kick so woefully executed. You won't believe your eyes. That's all I can say. If I really get into how fascinating this movie is, I'm not going to be able to stop and I'll go over the IMDb 1000 word limit. <br /> <br /> Please watch this movie. You'll be in hysterics. Either 1/10 or 10/10, depending on your sense of humor.
