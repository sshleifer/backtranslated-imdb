I have found that this step is beautiful, pleasant and uplifting. At first, I was intrigued by local places in a movie that was filmed here in Buffalo. Later I found myself lost in the power of the film. How do you repay God's gift? The ability of the characters to emerge above their basic nature and respond to the touch of God warmed my heart. The whole audience clapped at the end of the movie. I left the theater with a lilt in my step, a joy in my heart and a hope for a human race. What more can a film do? Hollywood, I hope it will pay attention to you. America makes positive, positive films.
