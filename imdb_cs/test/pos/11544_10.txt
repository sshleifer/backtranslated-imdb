Numbers are not, 109 people voted for this film. This tells a lot about the position of one of the most intuitive comedians of the late 20th century. And for those of you who know Bill Hicks' work if he were alive today, imagine what he would have to say about the president from his home country? That his short career remains unrecognized is a sad situation and this film, or rather these two films explain why. First, you see how his talent was clear from the beginning, over and over again, those who knew he was Bill Hicks always say he is not only funny but also unique. The film also shows how the quality of its material was too demanding for many in the entertainment industry. His drinking also contributed to his career problems, but that is less evident in this film. And then the second movie is full power. If you've never seen or heard of Bill Hicks, it's an amazing introduction to a person and his dark but intelligent humor. Especially since these topics are now almost 14 years old and still ironically topical, it is underlined by the fact that many events were held for the first President Bush. Watching together - the first biography and then the show - will alert you to how much this young man has been gifted, how quickly his life has gone through and how the American media can sometimes work as a big big homogenizer. Make sure nothing is too provocative, nothing will be too interesting And the result? Well, as the man himself said, going to sleep America, your government is under control ........... During his lifetime, at least in the UK, this artist has been recognized for his talent and has been successful there. 11 years after his death, 109 people on IMDb can say something about the movie. After you both saw them, I hope you understand why more people should listen to Bill Hicks.
