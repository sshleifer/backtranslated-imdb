Tenacious D: In The Pick of Destiny tells a fictional story about Tenacious D band formation and their quest to find a Pick of Destiny, a guitar pick with supernatural powers from Satan's tooth itself (played by Dave Grohl). JB (Jack Black) and KG (Kyle Gass), connected by fate, must travel to the Rock N 'Roll Museum and steal Pick of Destiny to become the world's largest band. The film is cheerful and delivers continuous laughter. Jack Black and Kyle Gass work perfectly together, have been real friends and co-workers for over 20 years. The film is partly a musical. All (or most) music was written and performed by D. All songs are new material and many of them are classic. The soundtrack is definitely worth checking out. This movie will be especially appreciated by Tenacious D fans, but if you're not a D fan, I still think you can enjoy the movie. If you are a D fan then you must see this movie. Acting is not as bad as you can think, and laughter and cruelty will never cease. I highly recommend this film to anyone trying to get their socks into the cradle and laugh as hard as they laughed for a long time. Check out the portraits of Dave Grohl, Ronnie James Dio, Meatloaf, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, Tim Robbins, John C. Reilly and Neil Hamburger. Also, stay tuned for the next scene after credits.
