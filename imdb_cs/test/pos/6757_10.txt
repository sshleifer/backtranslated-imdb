A brilliant animated piece that was far ahead of its time, and far ahead of what was released in mass production at the same time in history. The influence of this work on Timm Burton's "Nightmare Before Christmas" is easily apparent. One can only imagine Starewicz celebrating every beautifully detailed picture of this masterpiece. There were very few animated movies of this caliber. It is a pity that more people have not seen this jewel. <br /> <br /> It seems that the IMdB now requires comments to be at least ten lines long, so it's the tenth line. That must be something new - but I really have nothing to say!
