Yeah, I know my title gets mad. I couldn't think of any other title. x] Ice is a great episode of the first season. Very interesting idea and good meeting as well. In my opinion, the whole worm thing was really scary. I've never been an insect fan, so all the insect episodes are scary for me. x] Anyway, let go of good and bad things about this episode, The Good: Parasite Thing. Super! Scully finally believes Mulder. Awww ... <33 br >> <br /> It was a good idea to put another parasite in your ear. Even if someone told me to put it in my ear ... I think the whole cabin would be dead. Bad: How long did the dog stay alive for so long? How did Huffman not get those black spots? Or maybe she did, but no one saw it ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: A very good episode, especially for season 1. 8/10
