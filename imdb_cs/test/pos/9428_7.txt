Due to propaganda during World War II, Sherlock Holmes was moved to that time. One of the results is "Sherlock Holmes and Secret Weapon", starring Holmes, Basil Rathbone, along with Nigel Bruce, Lionel Atwill, Dennis Hoey and Kaaren Verne. It's Holmes' task to deliver a scientist, Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.) and his gun design to the British government before the Germans can get him. However, as soon as one arrives in England, his problems are just beginning. Can Holmes decode the message Dr. Tobel left before he fell into the hands of evil morality, saved the weapon, and maybe even the scientists? This is an effective story of Holmes, set in the atmosphere of Switzerland and the darkness of England. The series worked fine. It was not without problems, but these problems had nothing to do with the time period. Whose idea did Watson become an idiot? The characterization of Nigel Bruce - supported and supported by scripts - has always been a false note. I prefer to characterize Edward Hardwicke in Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes series - there's an attractive, intelligent and believable companion for Holmes. In Rathbone, Holmes is often condescending and treats Watson as a fool who is. However, in this particular movie, Watson has a chance to be quite useful in several parts. I confess I am a complete sap for Rathbone's Richard II recitation. Earth, this England "- I can't imagine how much it meant to the British who watched the film in 1942. Sherlock Holmes really served its purpose.
