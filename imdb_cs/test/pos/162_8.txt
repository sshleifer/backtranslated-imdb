Three children are born at the same time, during the lunar eclipse. Just before the tenth birthday, they set out on a deadly spree. "Bloody Birthday" is a typical slasher since the early 1980s. evil children never create any threats and there is almost no tension. There is also no terror in the "Blood Birthday", but the movie is slightly fun. Unfortunately, no real explanation gives children sudden murderous mania. Quite terrible, for example, we have a death hand gun, baseball bat, skipping rope and shovel.
