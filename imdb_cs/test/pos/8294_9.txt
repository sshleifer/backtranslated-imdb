The only copy of CHIKAMATUS MONOGATARI I was able to find was helpless - I could barely follow it. Which is a shame because it's one of Mizoguchi's biggest movies. The story, which I believe was done before and by other Japanese directors, is somewhat more straightforward than my favorite Mizoguchi movies (SANS THE BAILIFF and UGETSU MONOGATARI), and it's basically the story of a tragic romance, in this case transgressive romance, which goes beyond strict class boundaries. As always with Mizoguchim, there is a wonderfully voiced tone of defiance, and - bad press aside - I was very pleased. As with all Mizoguchi movies, I am eagerly awaiting a renewed DVD release - whenever it can ...
