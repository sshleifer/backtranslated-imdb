MY EVENING WITH JIMI is a glimpse of Howard Kaylan's dizzying ride and his dizzying ride to fame with his band Folk-Rock, 60's. The turtles were a "second degree" in the 1960s, but the film clearly shows that they could eat, drink and party with hippie culture titans. Not only that, they had musical chops to back them up. Many of the stellar acts of the era are seen as they communicate with the band at work and in the game. This provides my only film complaint. Almost from the beginning of the film, one sees that it is almost impossible to find actors who can convincingly personify such recognizable stars. Too often, during the film, I felt that I was following an engaging exhibition of fake wigs and mustaches. But if you are a fan of The Turtles or The Swinging 60's, it may be a movie for you. And don't forget to check out The Extras. Band members, Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan, have very funny (and instructive) information about their catastrophic experience with managers and agents.
