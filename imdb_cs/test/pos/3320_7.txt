Claire Booth Luce's "Women" shows relationships with men through a woman's opinion in the play, (and a 1939 film that also has Joan Crawford starring a bitch: a character who might have been Amanda Farrow 20 years earlier), it has none \ t . Here we see male characters and what are partners. They use women as toys and throw them away so women suffer. Ironically, women in "The Women", perhaps because they are all we see, are displayed in less than favorable light, alternately silly and bullying, with a single "nice" person, (Norma Shearer), growing "claws" end. In "The Best of Everything" we see men doing things while women are mostly innocent and vulnerable. This is a movie about women jumping from things. Diane Baker jumps out of the car (perhaps the most absurd scene in the cinema history that isn't in the book). Suzy Parker falls from the fire escape. Women in the movie jump to the workplace, looking for success and love at the same time. Women would jump into the future and leave this type of soap opera in the next decade. But in the 1980s and '90s, he returns to him in the novels of people like Sidney Sheldon and Judith Krantz (though their trashier works are not that good). <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is how it looks. I like shiny movie films from the 50s and 60s. They look much better than the pixel-intensive home movies we've made, especially in the mailbox version we see on TV and DVD. The memory is also about the appearance of a young beauty. This movie probably has more beautiful women than any other. It has a supermodel, (Suzy Parker), Beauty Queen, (Myrna Hansen, who was not Miss America 1954 as Ron Jaffe says in a DVD commentary but rather Miss USA 1953, on IMDb: But So What), and Playboy since January 1957). My voice goes to Suzy, one of the amazing beauty of all time. Her actions are not as terrible as people pretend: they simply react, as people have done, to the supermodel (first, really), trying to act. No one seemed to care for it. Her role, which is apparently a secular woman who turns out to be the most vulnerable, is the most complex in the book and makes it cool. The most moving thing on the film is now the age of female leadership at the time. Hope Lange was 27 when they shot it in the spring of 1959. Diane Baker was 20 years old. Suzy Parker was 26 years old. The hope that looked like Grace Kelly's heiress never made her really big and ended up on television like Mrs. Muir. for IMDb, he ended up living in a house with "coffee table crates" because she spent her money on the causes she believed before she died at the age of 72 in 2003. This film seemed to her a very distant and irrelevant memory. . Baker, always a welcome face on the 1960s television (especially Richard Kimble), still active as an actress and actress, turned 67. Parker found "best of all" with Bradford Dillman 40 years before he died at the age of 70. same year Lange did. But here they are, young, beautiful and ambitious for success and love, as well as their characters.
