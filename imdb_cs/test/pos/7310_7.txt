Beautiful wife Norma Shearer (as Katherine "Kitty" Brown) waits for her husband Rod La Rocque (like Bob Brown) hand and foot. Mrs. Shearer prepared him for breakfast in bed and helped him dress up for a Sunday golf trip. He suggests joining Mr. La Rocque for the day and noticing how often they both see each other. But La Rocque puts her aside and says that her presence is adversely affecting his play. Then, unexpectedly, Shearer meets the real reason for her husband's frequent absence? his pretty blonde lady! Three years later, Shearer is a charming and flirtatious divorce. During her summer stay in Paris, she established a friendship with the rich, older socialism, Marie Dressler (as Mrs. Boucci Bouccicault). Mrs. Dressler invites Shearer to her island, Long Island, to associate with friends and ask for a favor. Dressler is worried about her granddaughter's relationship with a polite, secular man. He wants young Sally Eilers (like Dionne) to marry Raymond Hackett (like Bruce). Dressler, aware of Shearer's coquettish conquests, asks her to lure an unwanted man from Mrs. Eilers. Shearer is impressed to find that the man is La Rocque, her former husband. Shearer and Dressler make this cute entertainment program. They are in top form that guarantees guaranteed performance with enthusiasm and professionalism. The story is stupid and predictable; in a way that helps a funny situation. And the end is smart enough. In fact, the comedian "Let Us Be Gay" may have aged better than Shearer's larger-produced, and more serious, "Divorc√©e", which was released around the same time. The cast is fine. La Rocque is better than his film with Lilian Gish; but his role is not at all cute. Gilbert Emery (as Towney) and Tyrell Davis (as Wallace) are funny supportive suitors. Those who are not familiar with Norma Shearer may not realize that it is she who appears in the opening scenes as a woman who acts as a wise woman. This is Shearer as "Kitty" before her make-over. Take a look at Shearer shots with light, natural make-up, for a good look at a beautifully beautiful woman. ******* Let us be gay (1930) Robert Z.
