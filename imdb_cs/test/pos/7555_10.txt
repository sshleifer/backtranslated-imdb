Beautiful movie about people. I first saw four friends when it was originally seen in theaters and I have seen it many times since then. If I don't watch him when he's on TV, I'll be renting out with friends. The people I watched this movie always consider it nice. He deals with friends from childhood to adulthood, in the 1950s and 1960s. It is very funny and touching, dealing with the first love (and first sex), racism, war, politics - the whole sixty years. It can also be quite dramatic. If you like movies about people, it's definitely worth the time.
