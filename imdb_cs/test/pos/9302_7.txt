This is a weird and convincing movie. The theme of the atomic bombs created in Los Alamos, NM in the US and used in Japan during the second part of World War II is huge and of course deeply disturbing. The plot of the film takes a lot of trouble and the actors have to bear a lot of creative tension. I've never seen the movie, or I was wondering, I have to admit I read the book "Smoking in Bed: Conversation with Bruce Robinson". Robinson wrote the story and the script. I think the movie was better than I expected from reading Robinson's look at him, but I see how he thought he was derailed. I think Paul Newman is pretty good, but he's somehow down, wrong. It's too Hollywood. At one point, a big, mid-looking guy storms into Newman's office and has such a remarkable presence, I immediately thought he should play Newman's character playing. Another leader who plays the lead scientist is also quite good, but somehow he is not ingenious enough to portray the enormous anxiety that goes with the work - the immense responsibility for creating the ultimate machine of death and destruction. One of the more effective characters seems to be a composite personality, played by John Cusack. She is strangely influential, and finally she is a character whose fate really hits the home and who has been thinking me live about the fate of more than 200,000 Japanese people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
