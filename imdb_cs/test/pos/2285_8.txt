Too many people don't seem to know about this movie. Which is bad because I think it's pretty good. Sure it is a little cheese at times and can have a predictable story. But the presentation of the film is pretty good. I think casting is good with nice actors / characters. Tom Selleck does a good job of playing a baseball player (go figure ... not too many slots I suppose) and Ken Takakura (of Black Rain) plays the lead (coach of the Japanese baseball team). It's not too much to complain about. It's just a light, cheerful comedy and I recommend it.
