This film has recently been shown by a subtitle that is not dubbed on a special TV station in Australia. I thought I read here that sometimes there is a presumption that * Revenge of the Rat * is a continuation. In fact, rats take revenge for something that is happening in this film or in human history. As far as I know, there is no prequel. Now let's go Pied Piper from Hamelin out of the way. Maybe this story attacked me when I watched the movie, but that's it. There was the use of the word "box office" at the end of the film. A dazed mayor tries to justify his actions by saying that "the cash desks are empty". "Coffers" is not the word you hear for most of these days if you read folk tales to your kids like me. Since I saw rat revenge, I've read two versions of The Pied Piper of Hamelin. Now I see a comparison. The metaphoric fat, but literally ugly mayor, promises more than a city can afford to get rid of rats. That's about as far as I can follow the analogy. The children are not led to the mountains door, with one lame boy who has left the knowledge of the land of winged horses and fountains, where he is always spring and everyone is always happy. a lot of that is pretty mainstream about this movie. Romance and above all resolution. Female characters have potentially strong roles in society, but they are really powerless. Where this film is quite rebellious (compared to American cinema) is that it is anti-authoritarian. The helicopter pilot is fired by the mayor for "good performance". Mayor and local government are shown as corrupt and panding big money. Finally, one doctor is left in Frankfurt to solve the epidemic of fatal and contagious disease. Obviously, there is no national authority for infectious diseases to coordinate things or send backups. I'm not a horror enthusiast, so any horror I see is usually mixed with humor. You can see from a rat in a blood bank that it will have the right balance of horror and comedy for most viewers; a huge number of rats are impressive and horror fans also seem satisfied.
