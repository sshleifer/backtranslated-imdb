This image has no great explosions or expensive chase sequences. However, it has really wonderful performances and an exceptional scenario that puts it on top of my "indie-must-see list." Taylor Nichols and James Remar are great together. The young cast surprised me with really consistent action. Usually, indie images have some weak link, but there are no weak links here. Impressive. Go get this.
