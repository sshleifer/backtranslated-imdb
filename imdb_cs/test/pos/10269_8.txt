One Year After 'Love Thy Neighbor' Made His I.T.V. he made his debut along the 'On The Buses' and 'Steptoe & Son' routes by taking a big screen on Hammer Films. It opens with a violent patriotic expression that praises the virtues of the English green and pleasant land, then shoots at the shot of Eddie and Bill walking down the street and arguing furiously. This escalates into a strange sequence of white and black neighbors vandalizing their homes of each other. At least the original melody is preserved (even if it is sung by someone other than Stuart Gillies). The local book "The Gazette" organizes the competition for the best neighbors. winners landing Mediterranean cruises. Barbie suggests Joan should enter. The thing is, Bill and Eddie stay friends long enough to win it? This is the main part of the conspiracy. The movie is about big episodic. One piece is picked up straight from Season 1, namely Bill and Eddie go to the club pretending to be on the 'trade union'. In fact, they see a stripper (they don't meet two girls). Another part of the film has Bill, along with other black factory workers (in the series he was the only), to break the strike Eddie helped bring various ploys (including being smuggled through gates in beer kegs). While the other (seemingly inspired by Powell and the driver 's for Ada' s love) sees Eddie 's spoken mother (the gorgeous Patricia Hayes) get friendly with Bill' s father (Charles Hyatt). Top of Episode 1 Season 1 will appear in expanded form. Bill once again puts on a color and towel to scare Eddie, but his friends join him and dance around a naked booth to pretend to cook and eat him. Then Eddie has to go home in nude (surprisingly there is less nudity than it was in Episode 2 Season 2). The film ends with Reynolds and Booths winning the Thy Neighbor Love Competition and along with the voyage, but there's an unexpected crackdown involving Joan's sex-mad brother Cyril (James Beck - 'Private Walker' 'Daddy' s Army '), who works as a steward. This is your typical sitcom-to-70 movie, with all the defects that usually prevail in such movies. The laughter is scattered and interest is diminishing after half an hour. The cast is extended by familiar faces such as Melvyn Hayes (cast as 'Terry', character from Episode 2 Season 1, played on that occasion by Leslie Meadows), Bill Fraser (as Factory Manager), Anna Dawson, Andria Lawrence (who seems to was in every '70's ​​British comedy movie, mostly cast as nymphomaniacs), and Arthur English. The director, John Robins, was also responsible for "The Man About the House". The funniest moment - while Eddie sleeps in a quiet part of the factory, Bill paints a black face. The first thing he knows is when a manager secretary screams in horror. The tables were turned!
