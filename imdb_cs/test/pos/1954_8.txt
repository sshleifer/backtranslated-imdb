I'm not sure if I like the movie or not. I think it's creepy and totally strange. I think his performance was really good and one of his best, but I don't like the character at all. The performance of Keanu Reeves was really good and I really felt his character. I think the whole cast has done great performances as if the characters were real. I didn't like it, but I was really sorry for others (Keanu Reeves). I'd like to know if it was the original end that the movie was supposed to have, because it didn't end as I expected. I was disappointed at the end and I do not feel like the rest of the movie of justice did it. If you're on scary, weird and really different movies, go for this. If you like things that are normal, please stay away.
