I saw this movie myself when I was soon a teenager in my hometown of India, at a time when the only thing that fascinated me from girls became me tigers. I came home when I watched him, with a glazed gaze, and I wanted to be a block in a movie about Tigers. What movie and what moment it was! The theater I saw does not exist and went to the mall. I don't know how I would feel about it now after so many years and I don't want to spoil my childhood memory by finding this movie on DVD or something like that, and it's no longer interesting. From previous experience, I learned that childhood memory is often tainted when one travels on the roads that sometimes try to rediscover their pretentious past through films just to find their innocent innocence utterly useless and no longer welcome. And I don't want to throw away the memories of this movie in the wind. I don't have kids so I'm probably selfish in leaving this film in a sepia toned area of ​​my brain, I don't want it on a DVD. However, if you are early and want to remember later memories of adorable childhood, try to watch this movie (if you can ever). It will be really worth it.
