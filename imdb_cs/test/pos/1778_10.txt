A brutally straightforward story of murder and death penalty by the state. So painfully slow and accurate in describing the death penalty (from the preparation of the gallowa to the victim in his own pants before death) has the power to change his mind about the death penalty. The whole Decalog came from this story: the scriptwriter Dekalog was a helpless lawyer who tried unsuccessfully to defend himself and then accuse him.
