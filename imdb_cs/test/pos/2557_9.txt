Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), abbreviated as Ale, works in a car seat repair shop in what became known as the Iron Triangle, a deteriorating block of car blocks on junk and slender car dealers near Shea Stadium. Queens, New York. Customers here do not question whether parts come from stolen cars, or why they are able to get such big discounts, simply put money and hope everything is up and up. The guidebooks do not highlight these spectacular edges, but Iranian-American director Ramin Bahrani exhibits them at a live performance at the Chop Shop, India's powerful independent film, which last year won a lot of affection in Cannes, Berlin and Toronto. Building on his acclaimed "Man Push Cart", Bahrani spent one and a half years in a place that F. Scott Fitzgerald described as in the Great Gatsby as "Valley of Ash". For all his depictions of desolation, the Chop Shop is not a work of social criticism, but, like Pixot Pixe Hector Babenco, a moving study of character in which the survival of a young boy is bought at the cost of his innocence. Shot on site at Willets Point in Queens, Bahrani feels as if you were there, sweating in hot and humid summer in New York with all its noise and chaos. The film focuses on the charming 12-year-old Ale, who lives on the edge without any support from adults or any supervision other than her boss (Rob Sowulski), the owner of a real garage in the Iron Triangle. Polanco's performance is raw and somewhat ragged, yet he has earned his ovation at the premiere of Cannes, along with the hug of great Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami. <br /> <br /> Hardly a small room above the garage. with his 16-year-old sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales), who works by issuing food from the lunch car, but is like one of the interchangeable spare parts he deals with.

In this environment, Ale and Isi use all the means necessary to keep their heads above water, while their love for themselves remains constant and they still laugh and stand out from childhood that has never been theirs. As Barack Obama says in his book "Dreams of My Father", change can come later when their eyes stop laughing and have something inside. Meanwhile, But completing his income by selling sticks in crowded New York subways with his friend Carlos (Carlos Zapata) and pushing the bootleg DVD on the street corners, while Isi does tricks for truck drivers to save enough money to buy rusted $ 4500 van, in they hope to start their own business. Although Ale is a "good boy", he's not at the purse and ammunition in the Shea Stadium, an event Bahrani's camera observes without judgment. In the Chop Shop, Bahrani provided a convincing antidote to the successful stories of mourning invented by a Hollywood dream factory and gave us a film of stunning naturalism and respect for his characters, as in many ways to great Italian neo-realistic films. and recent Iranian works by Kiarostami, Panahi and others. While the characters are far from uncertain, Bahrani will make sure we notice a huge billboard at Shea Stadium that says, "Make your dreams come true," leaving us with a hint that Rumi's phrase "drum of execution beats this promise,"
