The film is really well made, which is great and passionately directed. You can say that every shot is thought out and executed to perfection. For cinema lovers, it's a great watch and above all, they should be able to appreciate the beauty and passion for the cinema they put in it. <br /> <br /> It's hard to place this movie under one label. It's not really a drama, it's not really a thriller and it's not really a comedy. Instead, it is rather a film with its own style that makes things its own way. It does not necessarily follow cinema rules and offers many different elements from many different genres together. But like the movie's main character, the movie gets kind of slow and boring in parts. The artistic style of directing tries to hide that the story is actually quite simple and it is more like the film relies only on its style and overall film atmosphere. This does not mean that the film is terrible or anything but it just prevents it from being a real absolute must see. In some parts of the movie it also seems to be trying to be too poetic and trying to let images talk too much for themselves. It's just a bit exaggerated, even though it still works beautiful for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Featuring a great camera and a unique storyline that makes it an original and great movie to watch. <br/> 7/10
