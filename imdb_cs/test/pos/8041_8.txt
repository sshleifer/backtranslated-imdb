Stunts sequences (as well as special effects) are brilliant in this movie. Michael Scherer must be one of the BEST Stunt Co-Coordinators of all time. The blast in the cafe is a wonderful combination of Stunts, Special Effects and Visual Effects. The director had the idea that the crew had managed to create the film. <br /> <br /> In addition; Donald Sutherland is one of his best performances in this movie .......
