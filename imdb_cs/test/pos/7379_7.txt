It was an interesting study in social sexuality, as well as the "dark interests" of man. Although I can't say the woman was a strong character - she was a bad choice for her, in my opinion - she was a rich kid in search of escape. In fact, she was a rebel and never grew up for her husband, a lawyer (Rickman). Obviously, he took her for his money and covered his sexual desires, which is a taboo. Rickman played his part on the tee, his flirting with a young man and the very subtle undertones of homosexuals. The young man was gay to the hilt! When Marilyn did, she thought she should tell her wife everything. He was also perfectly cast. All around him is written hustler. I'm not crazy to end because I knew what was happening. Overall, however, Rickman's action was great, Reedus was good, Walker was fine, but I had doubts. For a gay themed movie, it was average but not glaring. It is worth seeing if you don't have "Truly Madly Deeply" around.
