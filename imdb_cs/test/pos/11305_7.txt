My 5-year-old daughter is in the Barbie series. I had mixed feelings about it - I didn't want her to buy a full picture of Barbie-doll, and she realized that movies were a marketing trick to convince young girls to buy more dolls and make more money for Mattel. But this morning she asked me to watch this movie with her, and - it was a lazy Saturday morning and I had nothing else - I agreed. I don't know if the movies were made to help sell dolls that seem to lose their attractiveness a little from what I heard, or if dolls are on the movies (or rather a bit of them) but I have to admit - To my surprise, it wasn't bad. It's a fun and imaginative story full of magical places and people and unforgettable characters (Good and Evil. Basically, Annika ("played" Barbie) has to find a way to build a "wand of light" to reverse the bad the magic of wizard Wenlock, who, among other things, turned his sister into flying horses and her parents into stone, the animation here was pretty good - not Disney-caliber (if you think Disney is the standard to aspire to) but generally pretty good and while The film is obviously adapted to young girls rather than middle-aged men, I still found there were enough twists and turns to see how it all worked out, it is true that there were some holes in the story, or at least some logical inconsistencies but again we have to remember the target audience, which wouldn't really think such things, that's a decent family movie everywhere.
