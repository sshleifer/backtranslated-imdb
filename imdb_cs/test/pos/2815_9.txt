I miss cable vision and I no longer have "DirecTV". So to be a rural resident I have to wait for a DVD release. Being a blonde lover but not a blonde, of course, I don't just have "Barb Wire" but I have "Stripperella: The Complete First Season". I haven't found "VIP" or Stripperella second season yet. I have a DVD "Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding". I have problems with "Playboy" that Pamela Denise Anderson stood up with. I love Pamel! Nobody or anything that could make me feel guilty of taking Stripperella. But there are some elements that I don't like, but I live with them. But these are my personal peeves and I try not to let them ruin the fun of the show like this. Even I was taken aback by changing the style of animation, but I adapted. However, the amount of female nudity has decreased, and this is a great disappointment because one waits a lot in the series with this assumption. But then I adapted again. One of my favorite episodes of "Mork & Mindy" was when they met Robin Williams! So one of my favorite episodes of "Striperella" is when Pamela & Tommy visits the club and starts to compare! If there really is a "Season 2" I hope to find it because I have to complete my collection as complete. I recommend it to other admirers of the female form and lovers of blondes. (Hey! Shhh! "Blonde" and "blondes" are a female form for spelling "blonde"! Your software should know it!)
