Italian Soft X Exorcist Clone. Woman buy statue of crucified thief. Said thief comes alive and turns out to be a devil with a rape fantasy. Ivan Rassimov is a great devil. Mostly because of his gifts evil looks. And because he was never upstairs. Good on him. The actress at the head was doing a decent job. Her wide eyes innocence and the fact that she looked great naked helped. This one has a similar element of conspiracy to most Italian horror movies. Girls' parents are dirty rich and corrupt. Watch how to get details. Laura Gemser's wife, Gabriel Tinti, also appears to be a random shame. Part of it is basically called, but as cheap beer it did. Director's failure for his failure. It could be horror / sex classic.
