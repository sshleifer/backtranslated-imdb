Hair is one of my favorite movies of all time. Although I wasn't part of my generation, I watched this movie 9 times and I can't get along with a beautiful message of understanding, passion, beauty and love. This film is against the Vietnam War and shows how people should be united independently of color, origin, religion and class. I love the characters of Berger and Woof and I think Central Park of the 70th most beautiful place I've ever seen. By the way, I still have this music in my mind. This is the dawn of the Aquarius age. age Aquarius Aquarius! Aquarius! Harmony and Understanding Sympathy and Trust That Are Abundant No More Lies or Decisions Gold Live Dreams About Visions Mystical Crystal Revelation and True Liberation of the Mind Aquarius! Aquarius! ps: I'm surprised that the director of this film is the same director AMADEUS. I love both movies!
