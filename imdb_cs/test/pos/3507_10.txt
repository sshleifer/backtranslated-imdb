"Just before dawn" is one of the best films slasher.It is very realistic and atmospheric. It reminds me of the Tobe Hooper "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Deliverance." . "Just before dawn" is a beautiful photographed and soundtrack is very disturbing. I never <br /> <br /> liked slasher or gore movies in addition to this one.Very impressive and compelling movie (at least for me)
