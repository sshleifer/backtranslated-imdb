This secret / psychological-thriller is, I think, one of the best I've ever seen. All actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who moves from a nervous starfish to strange events that are part of a cool star. You will learn a lot about the real inner emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the film itself. The film is a fascinating film at the beginning and through the game, played with the actor. Also Mark Snow's music is perhaps the best score I've ever heard. You will not forget this movie!
