Gake no Ue no Ponyo is a beautifully animated movie and a relief from many heartless CGI movies being produced. Pastel and colored pencil backgrounds were a surprise after Sen on Chihiro no Kamikakushi (Spirited Away) and Hauru no Ugoku Shiro (Howl's Moving Castle) is so similar stylistically. The style worked well for the film and was done exceptionally well. Time and effort to revive is greatly appreciated because it gives the characters much more life, detail and care that makes the film much better. There are several great scenes throughout the movie that have lots of movement and action. The biggest thing for me to be the scene was Ponyo's sisters transforming into a massive wave like a fish while she runs on them. The story is simple but quite well written and played. The storyline remained focused on character relationships, and while it wasn't played as in Tonari no Totoro (my neighbor Totoro) it's still great. I felt that every character, unlike Spirited Away, who was so stuck with expressive characters that she could be stretched out in a series, had enough time on the screen. (Radish Spirit. There was another whole movie!) My only real movie problem was over. Her way, as formulated in the English version at least, it seems to be some great S≈çsuke test that turns out to be just the promising mother of Ponyos that she will love Ponyo. Although bringing more thoughts leads me to think that the translation doesn't have to be accurate enough to reflect the real meaning that the test is a promise and that it actually means. However, the film seemed to end abruptly. Besides, the movie was great and I highly recommend it.
