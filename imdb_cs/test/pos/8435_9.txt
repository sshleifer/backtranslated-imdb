Chinese Syndrome is a perfectly stimulated thriller and is not slow or boring as some people say. Transitions from one scene to another are great, and the tension created in the movie will keep you on the edge of your seat for two hours. Jack Lemmon is great, as always, the somewhat nervous plant operator and Jane Fonda will succeed in bringing some real emotions into the story. You can see this film as a political statement of that time, or just as an intelligently created thriller. Either way, it's definitely worth watching.
