As a mother of three and two years old, I love AristoCats. It's a movie that doesn't contain any double participants, no almost sworn words like hell or damn, no parents who are functional idiots, and no crotch or bloat jokes that are so widespread in those "best" movies for kids these days . . The story is sweet and interesting. Music is great. The love story is quite romantic. Kittens are lovely and different characters are unique and biased. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing. The characters are also well occupied. I love listening to the velvet voice of Eva Gabor and there are so many others who are familiar and well fit to the characters since childhood. It's really a movie about love, tolerance, good manners and loyalty. Who doesn't want their children exposed to these values? It's a movie that doesn't bother me to watch again and again, unlike Happy Feet, where I couldn't watch the whole thing, because it was so unpleasant. I wish manufacturing companies to move towards making films more like movies.
