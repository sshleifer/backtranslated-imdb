I saw this movie when I was much younger, but it captured me. I loved Orry and George's relationship very much. I was so in love with Orry and Madenline's love story. I'm a hopeless romantic, so it really happened to me. I especially liked it when he first met her. I wish he had more time with her and his child. So you know that in book three I was so hurt that he died. Actually, I didn't understand it because they had little time together. I loved Patrick in this movie. I bought all three books together and I can't stop watching them. My twelve-year-old son got stuck on it. He likes fighting in the war. I cry every time. I wish I could meet Patrick and Madeline in person! It was an amazing movie and cast!
