I remember watching this movie many years ago at VHS on the site of friends. At first I thought it would be a boring movie. But to my surprise, it ended up being one of the best movies I remember watching my time. <br /> <br /> He has a good story and the best of all has amazing Aussie cars and street races. I really liked Fox's car, which was probably a Dodge Charger. The painting that was done on this car was, in my opinion, really excellent:! :) <br /> <br /> There is also a black two-door deflated 57 Chev that comes into the movie later. In fact, I managed to get a copy of this movie on VHS last year in K-Mart here in Australia. I had plans to convert this movie to DVD myself, as I believe it's a movie worth converting. But a lot to my surprise this weekend when I went through a DVD movie bin I came across it on DVD. Of course I caught him when I could because it was the only copy there. Anyway, if you really want to see some classic street racing with real muscle cars, including a great storyline without rice burner in sight. Then this movie is for you !!!! <br /> <br /> Here are some additional information taken from the back of the DVD. He wins at all costs Fox is a young man who lives in a fast lane. He believes he's the fastest man on the road - but street races are illegal. If he does not accept his last challenge, he may lose his girlfriend ... if he accepts, he may lose his life. To live dangerously, to live fast and to win at any cost is their obsession. They don't come back, don't give up ... and don't ask for help.
