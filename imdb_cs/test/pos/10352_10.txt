When I saw it on TV, I was nervous ... what if it went wrong? Millions of families like mine who live with a human brain damaged, my father in my case, would be released. I watched it with my mother, and we both ended up crying, he was so accurate and he caught the feel of the family as well as the person who suffered a brain injury. The actors were amazing and I had no complaints, my moms told me she couldn't stop thinking about it. I hope many people have realized this program, what it is like to live with brain damage and what it's like for families. There should be more such programs, I was surprised how good it was and I was really emotionally shaken.
