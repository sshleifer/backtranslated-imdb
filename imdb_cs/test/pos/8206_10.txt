Wow! In my opinion, NET is an excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat-tech-thriller that allows you to feel good all over the world. When I first saw it, I felt good for days. When Angela (Sandra Bullock) went to Mexico, I thought, "That's a really nice place to go." Since Jack (Jermey Northam) and Ruth (Wendy Gazelle) started chasing her, I thought, "Don't let anything bad happen to her! Please!" I also made a few deep breaths to avoid shouting more than I did. On the bright side, if you ask me, the house was very luxurious and spacious. Finally, I can introduce this excellent techno thriller to the tip of the nails and bites, four stars.
