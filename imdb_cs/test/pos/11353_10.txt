This film was recommended to me as one of the best stories about love. And as a huge fan of love, I bought my tickets and sat down in the theater. After 90 minutes I left the theater with nothing but disappointment and a theme as the only positive thing about the film. I was horrified by the story itself that two people could make love, but they were afraid they would never act. I simply could not pass the language barrier and the cultural barrier. The second time I ran into it ... I was in a different mood, I had no more expectations ... and had more patience, a more relaxed mind to "see" the movie ... and once I opened my eyes I discovered love .. beauty of the film. I went beyond the language and the story of love and I saw playing (I never felt like acting for a moment!) And cinema. When I first heard the definition of what a movie was, I was told it should be a string of perfectly balanced photos (shots) and that is a film that would fit the description. Almost every shot has an idea and in combination with music ... and lighting effects ... the result is just a masterpiece! And a masterpiece is just something you need to have in your movie collection.
