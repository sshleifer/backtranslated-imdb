I almost stopped watching Hindu movies because of the average quality and stories. One exception to this is Ramgopal Verma movies. This is a nice movie with great star cast performance. It must see the film for those who are sick of watching silly dances and love stories. Adaptation of the story and characterization was exceptional. You should watch this movie for Nanu Patekar. based on the life of Mumbai cop Daya Naik this film deals with a more realistic way. The film immerses itself in the life of an ordinary man who, in addition to being a meeting specialist. I rate it as one of the best films of the year
