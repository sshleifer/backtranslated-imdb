Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been! I love watching him! I was 10 years old (1979) when I saw him for the first time. he is very hypnotic and mysterious and the voice is commanding and strong! he is very attractive, even at 65 he is absolutely stunning !!!! In my opinion, the greatest actor is ever seen! I adored him in "Dracula" (along with many other girls) and in "God created Woman", "House D", "Jason and Argonauts" and many others. I thought he was a genius !!!!!! I can't wait to see him in "good night and good luck"
