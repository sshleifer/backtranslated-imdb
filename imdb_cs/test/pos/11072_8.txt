I lived in this area (Hoboken and Jersey City) for about ten years. This film certainly captures the feeling of that time and place. The dialogue is very good, the music is right and the scenarios realistic. As another poster said, it looks almost like a documentary. I like the way these kids humanize, which would probably be born in Westchester, but fall into what the kids get into. It's just that the area is pretty rough. <br /> <br /> Exactly demonizing cops enough, but that can be expected. I'd say acting is good everywhere, too. It gives the viewer some sense of how this idioce is caused, and gets into a false state. Hopefully the new mayor of Newark is making progress.
