I felt deceived by the fact that I knew the whole story. While it might be a twist, this twist was so significant that I felt betrayed. I think he could use a better writer to better combine all the elements of the story. The writer could reveal more 'twists' throughout the film, rather than all at once at the end. In addition, I believe that the actors did very well with what they had, especially with Matt Damon, who was a little bit character in his nature, small jokes that were not egoistic or as a smooth criminal who always knew what he was doing. Other main characters were their own separate entities that just happened to talk to each other. The cohesiveness of the group in Ocean's eleven years was gone.
