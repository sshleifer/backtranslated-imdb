Larry (Billy Crystal) and Owen (Danny DeVito) have unpleasant lives in a truly pure spin on Hitchcock. When Larry tells Owen to calm himself by watching "Strangers on the train", Owen gets the idea that they should do cross-murder like in the movie. And as in the movie, Larry thinks it's a joke, but Owen is serious. <br /> <br /> As they came up with the idea of ​​"Throwing Mom off the train", I never know, but it's a cheerful movie. There's no boring moment. And the end was hoarse. Crystal and DeVito are at their best, and Anne Ramsey is just like here in "The Goonies". Modern classic.
