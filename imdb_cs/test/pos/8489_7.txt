"Ray" lives on Ray Dir-Taylor Hackford Cast-Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Regina King, Clifton Powell, Curtis Armstrong and Sharon Warren. Written by: Taylor Hackford and James L. White. Rating- *** <br /> <br /> "Hit on Jack Road, and won't come back? Nothing more, nothing more, nothing more, no more!" Who would have thought that this immortal line, which almost became a corrective mantra for broken relationships in popular culture, was conceived over a fight of lovers! Ray Charles was a genius. And if there was one thing he knew, inhaled and lived; it was music. So in a life that contained acute poverty, a desperate struggle against darkness, guilt, drugs, and painful affairs; Ray still found moments of inspiration, and words and notes formed their own shape to create instant eternal classics! There are some lives that deserve to be transformed into a silver screen. Ray Charles's life was one of them. Almost comes as a shock when you learn that this project had no studio support until it was finished! And this support probably came after the opening screenings, where Jamie Foxx's performance was praised and predicted as a certain Oscar winner in secret voices. Jamie Foxx as Ray almost convinces us it's really Ray Charles performing on the screen and not an actor for himself! From the crooked, all-knowing smile to the bent walking of a not so heavily handicapped man, but a man dancing over his demons, Foxx captures every essence of true Ray Charles. Ray was a complicated man. He never demanded sympathy and rarely did it. An interesting businessman who has secured his success at any cost, sometimes at the cost of losing his loved ones. He never apologized for his filandering trips and always claimed to love his family, which we believe he did. He liked sex; it was so simple! But under all, there also existed Ray, who was afraid of darkness. Imagine the horrors of a blind man who is afraid of darkness! His fear was due to his guilt. Ray was convinced he was the reason for his brother's death, and he had been trying to redeem his whole life. Ray was a maverick who united the gospel with jazz, an unheard of blasphemous practice in the 1950s. But his intentions were not inciting. He simply practiced the only way he knew he was approaching God! It's hard to capture such a living life as Ray, and that's where the film fails. We could never really get to Ray as a human. We only know him as much as we see him. His relationships, especially with Margie Hendricks (Regina King), are not examined in detail. And the scenario barely passes through Dell Bea (Kerry Washington), Ray's wife, who everyone knows is a rock by his side. And the biggest mistake of all is the hurrying, almost steep peak. It's as if the director suddenly realized he was in stock and calling for a parcel! However, 'Ray' is definitely recommended for Jamie Foxx's flawless performance and capable star ensemble. Song and age create a feeling of nostalgia and we get a real feeling that the film is made with sincerity.
