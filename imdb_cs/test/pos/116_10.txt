It is rather a subtle story that in the Indian household, as most decisions are taken by a man, not paying attention to the desire of a lady, for example, how a husband and wife sleep together, it will be a test for a husband to see if he can control his desires, not woman happy. And in such a scenario, women always have two options, either to accept all this and to take it into their lives, which is usually the case or not to accept and try to shape things to satisfy them, which is a film! Fire is a brilliantly guided story of the second option women choose, not sacrifice, serve no one else, rather a decision for their own good. The whole idea of ​​justifying lesbianism has not been accepted by the Indian audience, but if we look at the whole film from the angle of self-expression, then the whole debate does not arise.
