This movie begins as it ends and ends as it starts. In the middle is a collection of comedy, philosophy, music, observation, comments, mini stories, colors and much more. He looks at the world and our lives and tells the story of The Monkees from the perspective of the group members themselves. It also looks at television and film and makes visual commentary. It also shocks, with scenes of war and shows how we are just pawns in the big game. It says it all and much more, but if you do not look at it objectively, you will not see much more than the scenes that are linked together. It's the kind of movie that can never be bored because it's so smart.
