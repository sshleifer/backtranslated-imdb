I rented this movie for two reasons. The first of them was all that I read about him. I was definitely overwhelmed and could not agree with all the reviews I read. The second reason is that I know these people. I don't know Mark or Mike. He hasn't changed much since the years we knew. I know him as a "pupil" from a local Milwaukee radio station (WMSE). The way he is in this movie is really 100%. He once gave me the table he did. It was a little, about 15 "tall, which Metallica said. It was strange that she had only two legs. Sometimes it is an idea that counts, and Mike has always been thinking about others.
