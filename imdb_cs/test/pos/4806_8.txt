Andy Lau and Lau Ching-Wan are both brilliant in the thrilling thriller Johnny To, which places the greatest emphasis on shame. Think about it as Hong Kong's 'Heat', just better! All about film class; from performance to soundtrack, cinematography to script. The tone remains serious throughout the film, but the film has a nice line of black humor, friendship and romance in the heart. Sure, later it would be a little absurd, but it would be a hard-on-viewer who didn't find anything about love for this movie. Thank goodness, Hollywood still (not) re-made and destroyed the classics. Do yourself a favor and check out this movie!
