I've never seen an "American werewolf in London" but this movie was very fun. When I rented, I thought it was a horror movie, but it turned out to be rather a comedy with some horror aspects. I thought the transformation sequences were pretty done, but they worked wisely, the best scenes were those where the effects and lighting separated each other, nice. The transformations reminded me of many werewolf transformations in other films, but the werewolves themselves are very rough and not like a dog. Gore: I believe there is too much in this movie, which really breaks away from the horror when each picture has blood in it, and the violence is really hard. <br /> <br /> J.Hurst (8th year)
