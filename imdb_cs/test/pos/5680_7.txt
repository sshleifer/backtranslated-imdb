The basic plot of this film has been described in detail in several other notes, so I won't bother. First of all, I would like to commend the producer, actors, directors and crew for creating a beautifully engaging film on a thin, $ 1M budget. These people want to do something new and fun without spending a fortune. This is basically art for art. I know, I know, some of you decide it's not art, but something less and that's okay. I am glad that people like these will continue to spend time and effort on our behalf without expecting huge multimillion dollar payouts. <br /> <br /> Now to criticism. I feel that the presented scenario is somewhat credible. It's amazing when everything works, and the hero / heroine saves the day and everything is good that ends well. What gets me is a glaring manipulation of events so that blind happiness is more responsible than courage and strength. When the lee was attacked but wasn't seriously injured, somehow he washed himself in the mud next to the dead guide. Then he is miraculously his charged revolver still in his case and working (after some cleaning). Finally, when Lee is attacked on the mud and jumps into the water, croc did not kill her again. She ends up with a hand in his (her?) Mouth and manages to repeatedly pull the trigger, eventually blowing the croc's brain out (literally). I came to the conclusion that having Lee go hand to mouth with a step was just a way to end a movie with a person in triumph. Based on what I saw, the crocodile attack and continue to hold until the prey stops fighting. Croc revolves around and around to crumble and drown prey. This happened to the first three victims, but not Lee. She had teeth signs, but they weren't deep. I think the end would be better if croc won, frankly, to prove his mangrove dominance, his territory for millions of years. But then, how many of us would be upset or disappointed that the pretty girl didn't come out alive?
