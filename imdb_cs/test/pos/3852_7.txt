Conspiracy in a Nutshell - Duchess (Eva Gabor's voice) is a well-polished mother of three little kittens. When their owner, a rich elderly woman known as Madame Adelaide, realizes that her time is running out, she decides to write her will and leaves everything she has to her cats, who, after the cats pass, go to her butler Edgar. Edgar overhears it and is deeply offended by the idea that cats get everything in front of them, and the conspiracy to destroy the Duchess and her kittens; one night sipping sleeping pills and then letting them get stuck in the French countryside. From their element, the Duchess and her kittens merge with the street the intelligent stray cat known as Thomas O'Malley (the voice of Phil Harris who made the voice of the great bear Balloo in the Jungle book); after making a passage at the Duchess, unaware that she is a single mother, O'Malley decides to accompany them back home, with the Duchess really falling for O'Malley as the usual codependent family bond substitution develops; followed by chaos and chaos, culminating in a violent clash between O'Malley, his fraternal cats from the streets and Edgar. Also features British goose appearances, American Southern Dogs (what they did in France is someone to guess), a mouse that sounds a lot like a rabbit from "Alice In Wonderland" (he was actually voiced by the same guy who spoke Winnie the Pooh) and horse. Sometimes a slow but still enjoyable Disney business. Features a memorable "Everybody Wants to Be a Cat" musical piece sung by the late Scatman Crothers (better known to fans of the 1980s as the Voice of Jazz on Transformers). Of course, if it were done now, it would probably be a dark social commentary on the division of the class, which is the division between a well-behaved and well-nurtured Duchess and O'Malley Street.
