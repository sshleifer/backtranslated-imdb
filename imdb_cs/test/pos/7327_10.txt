Yes, it's "Flipper". But writer / director Alan Shapiro put together a gem version. The spectacular and underwater photography of veterans "Jaws" Bill Butler and the scary music of Joel McNeely and Crosby, Stills & Nash make this truly unforgettable family fun. Shapiro, whose last film was unlikely to be "The Crush", is again shown to be an extremely talented - and versatile - filmmaker. Rent it!
