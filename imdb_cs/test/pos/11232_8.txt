When Northfork made his debut at the Cannes Film Festival, many people didn't like it because they felt it was boring and too slow. Although I agree that it was slow (one of the slowest films of the year), it was by no means boring. As Roger Ebert said, "there was never a movie like Northfork." I usually disagree with Ebert, but once she speaks the truth. Although John Sayles' Sunshine State may have some of the same immediate themes, nothing I've ever seen or known about can be compared to the remarkable originality of Polish brothers Northfork. Northfork is the perfect example of how many times it is better to trek for a few minutes before going on a little house movie instead of Jack Black. The plot is not somehow jammed, cookie-cutter plot; it's so strikingly original. A small town in Montana called Northfork has a dam around it to be removed. Therefore, the whole city must be evacuated. However, some people do not want to leave. In a secondary plot, a young orphan (Duel Farnes) is very ill and bedridden; he is taken care of by Father Harlan (Nick Nolte). The boy imagines himself as a fallen angel, so to say who helps him in his illness. Although most of the movie is straightforward, some of them might give David Lynch a run for his money. There are strange strange patterns, weird, wooden, huge dog thing and symbolism that would be proud of Fellini. It's not as totally confusing as the Lynch movie, but it's still pretty strange. That's what makes Northfork so great: it's so ordinary and yet so simple and credible. Northfork has a magical feel to him: it's almost like you're watching something you're not entirely sure of what it is, but you feel entangled with it. As I said before, I agreed with Ebert how this film is unlike others. However, I do not agree when it says it is not "fun". He says it's just "fascinating." Maybe he just thought he should give him good reviews because everyone else is, but instead of how slow it was, I still thought it was very fun, something that many dramas can't do now. Northfork doesn't have to be the fastest movie or the most popular movie, but if you can get through it, you'll be very surprised how I was. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Rated PG-13 for Short Sexuality.
