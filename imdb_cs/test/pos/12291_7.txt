Leos Carax made three great movies: Boys Meet Girls, Mauvais Sang, Les Amants du Pont Neuf. In fact, these films weren't that big, but they have youth violence, the beauty of the juvenile wilderness. In these three movies, Carax was well aware of what cinema was, but he tried to create his own vision of art without thinking about everything he saw, but he used it and melted into his time. Pola X is a very different film because Carax did Les Amants du Pont Neuf, a $ 20 million monstruosity film that destroyed everything on the way. After such a movie you can't make another one at the same angle. So Leos Carax has to change and he did it. The film is not as beautiful as its first, it is more sensible, no more studio, no longer dreaming Paris, Carax has entered the last reality. It's not clean anymore, it's not a poetic character. Carax became romantic in German.
