I bought it in the budget department last week. I already had Halloween and Halloween II, and because I wanted to collect every horror movie, I chose it. After all, the first two were good. This movie is pretty intelligent to tell the truth. it seems to create the right atmosphere and has a nice "michael myers history". He uses the old site from the original, and the main character is the baby, which laurie strode babysat that fatal Halloween in 1978 ... <br /> <br /> The peak is also quite satisfying. Anyway, it's LOT better than H20, which is frankly absolute stupid.
