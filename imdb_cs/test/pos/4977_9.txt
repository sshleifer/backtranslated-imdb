This is a classic western. Okay, Glenn Ford, a lively hero, a former soldier, a man who wouldn't hold the gun again. Eventually, he must confront the evil country's baron, Edward G. Robinson, who owns most of the valleys and wants it all. Then there's Barbara Stanwyck, a real flock ruler. Edward G. Robinson's wife, who won't let anyone get in her way, doesn't even look like Edward Robinson. It's so bad that everyone else fades alongside their blind ambition and ruthlessness to rule the valley and everyone in it. The flash in her eye, seeing people face death, is disturbing. It's worth waiting. In the young Brian Keith and a few others you will have a drama that stands on your own. With the necessary stampedes, shoot-outs, backups and close-ups of hard riding cowboys and you got a hell of a western.
