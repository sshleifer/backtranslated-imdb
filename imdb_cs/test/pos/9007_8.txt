New voices scare me! Kuzco does not have to go through a Frickkin Academy to become Emperor again! It's the same thing over and over again, isn't it? This is a children's show, right? Yzma turns Kuzco into something stupid, like an animal. They learn a lesson. Everything is the same !!!!! David Spade and John Goodman never came back. Nothing changes because Disney doesn't do that. It's probably one of the most retarded shows ever! The first movie was so damn better! Raspberry is probably the only person I love. Kuzco is such a crybaby! Chronicle is retarded! And Yzma is retarded-ER (if it's just a word)! What I wanted to say is ... How could you, Disney ... why?
