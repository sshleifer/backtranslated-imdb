Good drama / comedy, with two good performances from Hunter & Hurt, but Albert Brooks steals every scene he is in. With a big screenplay, this movie is rising and giving everyone a chance to show off their acting talent. And although Joan Cusack is not in this, he has one, if not the funniest scene in the movie. The highlight of the film for me was Albert Brooks' speech about the devil. The only move is the fact that the places go a little slower. And I was completely interested in the role of Brooks, not so much in Hunter or Hurt. I give it 7 out of 10.
