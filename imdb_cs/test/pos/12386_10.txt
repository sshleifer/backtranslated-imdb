Okay, I'll say it. This movie made me laugh so hard it hurts. This statement may offend some of you who may think that this film is nothing but a waste of film. But what most people don't get is that this movie was supposed to be bad and cheerful. I think people really think a movie about a snowman killer should be a masterpiece? Just look at the "creepy" hologram on the film's cloak and find the answer. Instead, just like the original Jack Frost (which I thought was just as funny), this film turned out to be a subdivision of the journey into the depths of hardy dialogue, bad liners, and terrible special effects. And it's all for the audience to add laughter. It certainly worked for me. For example: Anne Tiler (to a husband who has problems): What bother you so darling? <br /> <br /> If this piece of dialogue is not laughing, then you have serious problems. Who would say these words in real life in their right minds? Of course, nobody, because that was ridiculous! All you have to do is view one movie of this movie with an open mind and low expectations, and hopefully you'll see what's damn funny about Jack Frost.
