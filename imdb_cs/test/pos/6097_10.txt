This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It is true love and friendship. The fact that your life has turned and done something good for someone else. Thomas Bo Larsen can play the same role he has done in many other films, but recently we saw him in other roles that he also does great. But what if he plays the same role he did in other films? is ideal for this role. Ulrich Thomsen has a great job. These two criminal "low-lifes" are best friends ever. They share everything and do everything for themselves no matter what the cost. When they find out that Peter's daughter is being abused, they put everything in their possession (things you can't stop if you don't have to do even more crimes) and take her to a better place. They do the best they can? these two men are not spiritual, but they have their hearts in the right place. All I can say is that Peter and Carsten are also my greatest heroes?
