Yes, sometimes "unconditional love" overcomes because it reflects - not how it rebounds - from one story element to another in the most conventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it wasn't until I watched the movie for the second time when I began to understand what I thought P.J. could do with this strange, unconventional film. Hogan. Perhaps the whole film is a metaphor for unconditional love that Grace (Kathy Bates) desires and describes in the later part of the film. Grace insists that unconditional love is just that, without condition and without qualification. And so with this idea I watched "unconditional love" again. I laughed a lot more than I did for the first time, I became more involved with characters, I began to understand the absurd occasional stories. Performances are often at the top, but no more than necessary to fit Hogan's strange and broken vision, a vision that has led me to tears, desires, and laughter blasts. Yes, Hogan demands a lot of his listeners. But for one I really loved my movie - unconditionally.
