The film is rather a mockumentary of corruption across the American system. The correlation of those who vote does not matter, so it is proven in machines that end in a comic voting in an oval office. Politicians are such a joke that we almost need a comic to represent us as we have been laughing for years. Bushism has become a way of life for the Americans and will be the only thing that will leave after leaving the office to anyone soon. Surprisingly, the only person of honesty is someone who is not even elected to the position and finally tells the truth. The story is very subtle and if you laugh at it, it doesn't happen. He leaves much to think about. Overall, I enjoyed it.
