I'm sorry, but "Star Wars Episode 1" made no hope of Natalie Portman's talent (and undeniable cuteness). She was totally unused as Queen Amidala, and when she was used, her makeup was frighteningly frightening. For "Anywhere But Here," she throws her god-terrible makeup and she behaves normally. And not only can it act well, but it looks good. I'm a little older than her (she is only 18 years old) and I have little or no chance to meet her, but hey, the boy has the right to dream, right? Although Susan Sarandon makes a good turn in this movie, the film belongs exclusively to Portman. I was the guardian of Portman from "Beautiful Girls" (where she was younger but equally cute). In the future, there are great things for her - I see it.
