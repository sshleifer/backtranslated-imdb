I haven't seen this fox show for a long time and it was worth the wait. Kids in the show have something I can relate to in every episode, and even my dad sits down and looks at her. It's a show that's not meant for all ages. It's like still standing, but to the next level. The things everyone says are things everyone says and the actions everyone does. It says things we all think about, but in a well-rounded way of presentation. The first time I saw the show I couldn't believe it was a fox, and that it was allowed to stay in the air after a few episodes, from friend Hilary's choice to Kenny's friend's choice, it's well worth the watch.
