This is a nice project that is not a movie, as the name suggests. Good performance of Nadia Dajani who re-enacts the role of Grace. I'm watching the re-enactment of what happens to Mike and Grace in New York. She leaves but wants to contact her. This project is his way to get in touch with her. <br /> <br /> I saw it on IFC. I heard it will be released on DVD. I like this trend for more independent projects. This is an example of a good project. <br /> <br /> I hope he finds her. <br /> <br /> Have a look and have fun.
