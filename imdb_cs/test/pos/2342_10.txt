I saw One Life Stand when it premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 2000 and was blown away. Built on the basis of micro budget, this black and white digital film is a very European film and, despite the limitations of DV, is a great success. The film works because it's in the Indian tradition - dealing with complex problems, but moving and relaxed touches of humor. The One Life Stand avoids falling into the trap of other realistic films in the UK, with ordinary working people being portrayed either as hopeless victims or as comedic stereotypes. Performances are strong, especially Maureen Carr as Trise's mother. I understand that the movie was recently released on DVD and I would definitely recommend it. The rating on this page is misleading, so I gave him a high score because the filmmaker, May Miles Thomas, apparently put her heart and soul into it and deserves better than 2.8 for her amazing success.
