I was not familiar with this film until I saw that she was included in the Top 20 Spaghetti Western list I recently met (after the marathon I made these last weeks of sub-works); it was therefore favorable that the film had to appear almost immediately on Italian television at night (for the first time I'm sure in a good number of years)! Unfortunately, the cable reception of the channel on which it was broadcast wasn't very big lately: I was filming a movie on VHS, but I decided not to keep it because of this factor; as it happened, the next day I watched a movie, found it available on DVD Region 2 from Italy (with an interview with incorrect script writer Ernesto Gastaldi) - and when I was biased enough, I decided to order it there and then even though I knew I wouldn't be on the DVD for some time, because I'd like to leave some time between watching a movie and the next! Brief: When I recently bought spaghetti westerns on an Italian DVD, I decided to order Sergio Sollima FACE TO FACE (1967) because I thought it was a bare bone thing; however, I have just learned that the disc actually contains a director interview (as I did with BIG GUNDOWN [1966], which I bought). It seemed wrong to me that Sollima would not bring a similar contribution to the DVD release of this film when he actually considered FACE TO FACE for his favorite work (according to the director's bio bio, part of the Blue Underground Region 1 disc, another Sollim Spaghetti Western - RUN, MAN , RUN [1968]); The trouble is, I loved THE BIG GUNDOWN so much that I watched it with the recording of FACE TO FACE over the record I owned by Italian TV! I ordered a DVD of that movie now - mainly because it's getting cheaper - but as I said with a second look at the POWER PRICE (although I can still look at Sollim's conversation when the disc arrives) ... <br / OK, get off the road: the film under review is a pretty unusual western spaghetti and a very interesting, truly ambitious one, which in this case transposes the JFK assassination case into the old west! Actually, it is a reminder of the stiff black-and-white thriller Anthony Mann's TALL TARGET (1951) - an attempt to assassinate the life of the then U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. It features one of the most popular Italian stars from this subgenre, Giuliano Gemma, in what is perhaps his most impressive western role (many of his other films tended to have light-bent). The supportive cast includes at least two other notable figures: Van Johnson (in one of his few and mainly notable Italian films) as US President killed in the post-Civil War Dallas and Fernando Rey as the head of the plot of the Southerners - who not only plot his assassination, but also comfortably maneuvers a new active American leader, Johnson's Vice President, blackmail! Benito Stefanelli also acts as a corrupt sheriff watching the whole of Gemma, and with whom he has devoted himself to a "duel in the dark" - with guns resting on the floor rather than in the appropriate cases and the only light in the room he provides the end of the cowboys' cigars! Ray Saunders is also involved, as Gemma's black sidekick, whose story is ultimately transformed into a character sentenced to extinction "Lee Harvey Oswald". Stelvio Massi is behind the film's world cinematography, who later cut his teeth as a director on the poliziotteschi line. similarly, Luis Enrique Bacalov adds another great "Euro-Cult" score - which is quite different from Ennio Morricone's style. Valerii's direction here may be as impressive as with other Spaghetti Westerns, but it is progressing efficiently (the final shootout is especially nice); the film is certainly one of the more underrated contributions in the subgenre and for those who are so inclined, the novelty of the plot itself should make it one of the ...
