Overall, he did a good movie. There were parts that made me blink, and there were parts I took my hands on, but I came up with something more than I went on. I think the film suffers from some serious excess ambition. Without spoiling it, let me say that the obvious references to the process of fire in Ramayana are beyond what this film represents. Ramayana is an epic. It's not a 200-page book that puts women in India. The film is about two girls married to a very distinctive Indian family. While the basic principles of "unwritten laws of family tradition" seem to be the foundation of conservative India, let me assure my reader that I (lived in Delhi for 12 years) found parts that didn't ring. I mean some things and some actions are very true, but some other things are just out of the mark. Especially today. Delhi is complicated. India is complicated. The director tries to simplify both. And it will fail quite unhappily. Why in English? Can you imagine a film about American Indians in English. Or French-speaking English. Seriously. Even the servant spoke fluently accented English (albeit with a hint of colloquialism in the "credibility" language). But chemistry among leaders is tangible. If you like it, it's a movie for you. I think it's the greatest saving grace - the development of a true story of real life. If this film was about Radha and Sita, then it would be from me. And in that he could make a subtle statement about them. But this movie goes there to say that is what India is and that is what is Indian company like. And in this respect he will succeed as well as fail. Just take everything you see with a pinch of salt. India's dark secrets are not revealed. Only two girls fell in love. Just as it happens everywhere else.
