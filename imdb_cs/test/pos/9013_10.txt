Lovers of original movies can really love this show if they stop complaining all the time. Emperor's new school brings some old jokes from the film, such as pulling the lever to Yzma's lab and Kuzco's suspension episode. But since it's a children's show, it's just a classic and it's in the right places. Although the style is much simpler, animations and characters keep their personalities very well and actually surprised me. Eartha Kitt makes an excellent voice for Yzma and J.P Manoux does a great job for Kuzco's voice instead of David Spade, who played Kuzco in the film. Great parcels, merry moments and amazing Kuzco look make this show a good observation. (Stop complaining about everything!)
