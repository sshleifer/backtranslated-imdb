I knew the premise of this film, and of course I couldn't miss a good sounding film, especially the director of "Tension Master", Mr. Alfred Hitchcock. Basically, tennis champion Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets an eccentric stranger, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train from Washington to New York. Bruno talks about a perfect murder, Guy hates his wife and Bruno hates his father so Bruno "suggests" to exchange murders. Obviously, Guy didn't take him seriously until Guy's wife Miriam Joyce Haines (Kasey Rogers (or Laura Elliott)) was found murdered in an amusement park. Of course, Guy is the main suspect, and Bruno is still "hitting" him, reminding him of their "plan" and giving him more things to help him kill the father he wants dead. This murder investigation and Bruno's pursuit threatens his tennis career, and his relationship with his daughter Sen. Morton (north of northwest is Leo G. Carroll), Anne (Roman Ruth). Bruno realizes that Guy won't do his murder, so he decided to put evidence in the crime scene to blame him, Guy's monogrammed cigarette lighter in the amusement park. After his tennis game, Guy and Anne (who apparently discovered the murderous "plan") race into the amusement park to stop Bruno, and they have a fight on the speed out-of-control carousel. Also starring Patricia Hitchcock (director's daughter) as Barbara Morton, Marion Lorne as Anthony, Jonathan Hale as Anthony, Howard St. John as Police Captain Turley and John Brown as prof. Collins, and Hitchcock's portrait is a man. boarding train carrying double bass. Some interesting dialogue and character interaction, some good tension moments, and of course an unforgettable carousel finale, a good classic movie. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Camera. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on the 100 largest pop culture icons, the film was number 32 for 100 years, 100 excitement. Very good!
