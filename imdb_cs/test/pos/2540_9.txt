in his CAA accounts, platinum card lunches in Hollywood, psychoanalysis, holidays in Provincetown he never took and free trips to Nicaragua, funded by Columbia Pictures. That sounds narcissistic, but Spalding Gray (perhaps due to his unusual personality) overwhelms the audience, laughs at himself (perhaps because he didn't take the Hollywood thing oh-so-seriously) and gets us to care. This monologue is not just about "Killing Fields" or "Swimming to Cambodia"; it is rather a pastiche of events as he sees them. Some of these lines are classic, as Gray meets with respectable CAA talent agents. The conference table is ... "full, tanned, healthy, fresh from drinking blue-green algae from Lake Oregon ... there are no drugs in Hollywood." It was formerly a tragedy occurred. Many of us lack his off-balance humor. 9/10.
