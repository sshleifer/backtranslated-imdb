This is a really great movie. It is full of love and humor and forces viewers to take care of the characters and participate in their journey. Michael Parness was able to put together a superb cast of top players, a smaller miracle for the first film. No doubt they were moved to help him tell this beautiful story. David Krumoltz carries a film with its undervalued intensity and honesty. Natasha Lyonne is unpredictable, irritated and yet absolutely loving as Grace. Also, a great Karen Black turn (great when I see her on the screen again) when Grace is crazy but a nice mother. There is a cutting joke throughout, allowing us to relieve laughter when faced with life pain. Acting is impeccable, cut tight, direction inspired, and music creates a mood scene. Due to today's Hollywood shock, full of big budgets, big names, car accidents and special effects, Max & Grace is a refreshing departure. Give yourself a gift and check out this movie.
