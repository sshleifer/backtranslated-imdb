I first saw this movie about 3 years ago. I was shocked at how stupid the FBI was to prevent such a tragedy. It was easy to prevent. This movie was just incredible. Now that I saw him after 9/11, I am horrified and I can say that it could have been easier to prevent because most people would like to know. This movie is 100% true <br /> <br /> In the final scene of the movie, when the first attack champion is taken to jail by helicopter and flies over the towers, he makes a note on the backbone cooling that laughed, when he said it. "Next time we bring them * BOTH * down." This was actually said by Ramzi Yousef after his arrest. This film reveals the shocking truth about how the first attacks were made under the FBI and NYPD noses. It shows how the first and fourth amendments are partly making the attacks. <br /> <br /> I watch this movie and know that both attacks could be prevented.
