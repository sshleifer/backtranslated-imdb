More and more French cinema proves to be the only one capable of facing Hollywood movies and spending large sums on money in their films. Nobody would be surprised if Bon Voyage was made in the US. Perfectly set in France, in the 1940s, when the Nazi invasion, technically impeccable, and with some of the most important French actors (Depardieu, Adjani, Ledoyen ...). Bon Voyage focuses on two parallel stories: the scientific and his disciple (Ledoyen), who tries to hide one of his discoveries (the kind of water that can function as an atomic bomb) from the Nazis; and a poor man in love with a famous actress (Adjani) who ends up in jail accused of a crime that is not committed to protect her. It seems that Bon Voyage was made in the old style, without unnecessary camera movements and effects. No big bends on the property. As I said before, when it comes to the production itself, they did a great job. But the main problem with this movie is about the script. Is it a spy movie? Romantic comedy? Spy Comedy? Intrigue Comedy? It's not clear. That makes Bon Voyage a little unbalanced. When you think you're watching a comedy, suddenly it turns into another story, more dramatic, slower ... I think they should focus on one of the arguments (on the plot conspiracy) and leave the romantic parts in the background. <br /> <br /> My measure: 6.5 / 10
