Ab Tak Chhappan is a fictional story surrounding the police department in Mumbai, India. Sadhu Agash is a hard-working, stubborn policeman who sets himself up as a simple dressed criminal team who makes a name for himself by killing dangerous criminals in staged police meetings instead of locking them in jail. Undoubtedly, his loyal officers listen to him, but a rift when one of his officers, Imtiaz, becomes a frustrated figure of Sadhu's high position and secretly competes with him for criminal murders and status. The new brother is also sent to brotherhood and Imtiaz is upset when Sadhu allows him to take the lead in his first case. Another change comes in the form of a new police commissioner who disagrees with Sadhu's tactics and all find themselves in internal politics. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see a well-controlled action thriller from India. Working with the camera is excellent, the story is well said and the tension is high when it is developing dramatically. Acting, pace and political falsity convinces the viewer to be a fly on the wall, witnessing blood, sweat and tears from a close and personal perspective, and events based on reality that is no doubt the reason we're not told at the beginning of the movie, Though it is likely that the director, Shimit Amin, has taken the liberty with the factual accounts. But Ab Tak Chhappan is an extremely polished piece of film.
