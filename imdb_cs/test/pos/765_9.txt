I heard about this movie, but I didn't see it until my daughter, who saw it on a flight to Australia, told me it was a great movie. I was wondering if Rupert Grint, far from Harry Potter, showed the promise you see in Potter's movies. I wasn't disappointed. He becomes a great actor who shows a series of driving lessons from a shy boy who has been beaten by an excessive obsessive mother, to a young man who is worthy of his own, and another, honored. It is clear that he is ready to take on much more complex roles in movies and on stage. But the jewel of this movie was Julie Walters. I saw her earlier in Potter, Billy Elliott and Calendar Girls and I loved her. In the driving lesson, as she makes the lines of poetry and Shakespeare, I was impressed by her timing, language control and body language. I hope it was make-up / costuming because it depicts an older woman with osteoporosis, although it is not mentioned in the film - as a nurse, I can say that she did it perfectly, portrayed a woman on the verge of old but clinging to a sparkling of the past she enjoyed. This is one of the best movies I've seen for a long time and I wish I saw it for the first time in the theater - but I doubt it ever played anywhere in Albuquerque. We miss so many of these films.
