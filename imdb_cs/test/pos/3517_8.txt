Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being a far less horrible horror adventure than I expected. Instead, director Jeff Lieberman conjures up a beautifully evocative and disturbing atmosphere for large sections of the film, building tension constantly until I was really sure what was going to happen, but hurt as spring waited for him. The lack of action in many parts gave him a very Deliverance mixed with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre a little ambiance, and when the action really kicks, its really shocking and dramatic without ever even having to be cruel. The characters are about par for this kind of movie, though more sympathetic than some, and a bad guy unforgettable freaky. Photos and tensions are the true winners in this film and keep it from being boring (as suggested). I strongly recommend this serious horror fan. Don't wait gore, expect a haunted fairy tale story with some amazing moments and a great dreamlike atmosphere.
