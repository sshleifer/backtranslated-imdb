Centurions is one of the best cartoons ever and needs to be put on TV and DVD, so people can have younger generations having such a good show that is much better than the garbage they have in the past 14 years. I have a petition online that is on the web at http: //www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition.html, which originally tried to get this show on five days a week but is now trying to get this show on DVD because the station she was targeting has poor public relations. We all have to convince the people who organize this show to put it on DVD so that future generations can see it. Also, since Hasbro Toys owns this line of toys, we could try to convince them to make it a live action movie, just like they did with Transformers and sometime this year G.I.Joe. We need good cartoons like this to come back and enjoy the younger generation. Please sign this petition so we can one day have a DVD of guys who are known to scream "Power Extreme!"
