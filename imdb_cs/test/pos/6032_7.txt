Being a self-admitted slasher addict means it's very rare that I get a chance to review many larger budgets movies with trusted casts. Except for James Mangold Identity's successful box office; There were no big name items because the Scream trio again gave Wes Craven the name back to the Hollywood map. That's why Mark Malone is the Last Stop? a mysterious thriller with glaring slasher overtones intrigued me immediately. With a good line-up, including Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow and an interesting soundtrack that will find space for Rose Garden in Lynn Anderson, I must admit that the initial characters were very positive for this claustrophobic element. To my best knowledge, there are only three other snowshoes that are tied to the snow, unless of course you consider Demon Possessed fit. The first slice and dice on the ice was Satan's Blade Dry Bone, then came the raw feast of Lisa Loring, who was Blizzard of Blood and a pleasant Shredder followed fourteen years later. During the extreme blizzard, state soldier Jason (Adam Beach) battles through the snow to reach a remote lodge in the Colorado Mountains. His job is to inform the guests that the road is closed and must remain at least one night until the road is dangerous. This report is not well with a suspect bunch that includes two trouble brothers (Callum Keith Rennie and Peter Flemming), a truck driver who really does not want to hang up (William S. Taylor), a pair of lovers of lovers (Winston Rekert and Amy Adamson) and Jason's ex-girlfriend Nancy (Rose McGowan). Motel owners (Jurgen Prochnow and P. Lynn Johnson) are not as excited about the news as they are offering their guests room and trying to calm the tense situation. Things turn to worse when Jason finds a crippled body and a bag of stolen money lying in the snow behind a cafe. Like the chapter of Agatha Christie's mystery, the air people begin to die in the hands of a masked attacker who seems willing to redeem the money. With so many lengthy characters to choose from and no chance to leave the scene, Jason must try to stop the maniac before he kills again? A good secret needs at least a few shady suspects, each of whom has a trusted motive, a distant place from which no one can escape, and a clever protagonist to help decipher the tracks. Fortunately, the last stop provides each of these essential ingredients in a thriller that has its same moments of brilliance and downright stupidity. The film begins great as dubious personalities clash in a claustrophobic environment that can keep tensions high during the run. Malone maintains an increased level of interest, because each character reveals his own reasons to attract some suspicion, and to be fair, the basic reversal is not the one you can easily estimate. In fact, I found myself again watching the movie to see if I could pick up on any hint I missed for the first time. Unfortunately, when a maniac is revealed as a superior psycho waving like a comic bad guy, The Last Stop loses a huge amount of credibility. Fortunately, everything is not lost when the unexpected and brilliantly arranged plot of the film's final plot rescues. The similarities can be drawn with excellent identity because these two lands are almost interchangeable. James Mangold's efforts must be better both, mainly due to the billing of John Cusack's star and still reliable Ray Liott. With that saying, Adam Beach has a good job at the forefront, while Jurgen Prochnow, Amy Adamson and Brilliant Callum Keith Rennie add some credible support. Rose McGowan has the same role in this role as if she were actually doing it day in and day out, and Winston Rekert started fantastically before going overboard with the film's peak. If you are a fan of the hard slasher who watches for some bloody murders, you will be disappointed. A psychopath wearing a balaclava appears only once, and the rest of the murders are off screen. But, as I said earlier, Malone's directorial talent means that tension is never too far from boiling and you can forgive a few shortcomings because of the triumph positives. Last stop worth looking for slasher addicts and movie fans alike. Yes, there are several negatives, but overall it is a solid example of the emerging talent of Hollywood. If you like Identity then be sure to try it?
