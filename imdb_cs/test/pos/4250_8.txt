"Putney Swope" is a unique, low-low-end gemstone from the late 1960s that would probably be forgotten in time if it wasn't for two things: Paul Thomas Anderson (who named Don Cheadle in "Boogie Nights", Buck Swope, after the hero of the same name) of this film) and a limited edition DVD. Watching "Putney Swope" is like listening to hardcore punk rock: it may not be meaningful (at least it wasn't for my first watch), but you have to respect the film for its passion and shamelessly rebellious message. I didn't understand a lot of things about "Putney Swope," but I liked it for the most part. The more I think about the film, the more it grows. The film is advertised as a parody on New York's Madison Avenue, which was known as a world-wide advertising city in the 1960s. Members of Generation X and Y may be lost on this concept, but fortunately "Mad Men" is on TV to provide us with this otherwise lost piece of American history. What you need to know before watching this movie is that these advertising agencies were mostly male, and even more white businesses. <br /> <br /> With this in mind, the film opens a meeting with the agency for advertising agencies. Members are predominantly white except Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson, who bears a mysterious resemblance to Dick Gregory in this film), an token of African-American on board. The board members are so accommodating and soulless that when their chairman dies before them, their only concern is who will be the chairman. Without removing the body from the boardroom, paper voting begins to elect the next chairman. Putney Swope is chosen by landslide, but not because other members think Swope is qualified. The vote for Swope was an unfortunate attempt to sabotage the chances of the other members to be elected chairman. With their plans failed, Swope takes charge and "sink (with) the ship", shooting all except one of the original members and hiring all color people in their place. After this point, the film became (for me) very strange and hard to trace. Indeed, maybe there was no conspiracy. The whole idea of ​​the film seems to be a "what if" scenario, with the result that the new "Truth and Soul" the company would be unconventional but still successful. The company ends up making so much money that members build a huge glass showcase to keep money in unexplained accounts. It could be because Swope does not trust the banks, even though this point does not even touch the film. It could also be metaphorical in some way, but who knows. Most of the movie takes place inside an advertising agency, with occasional scenes in the White House with a president who for some unknown reason is a dwarf. I think there was some political joke here, but I can't figure out what. Did the filmmakers say the president is a small, insignificant part of American life? Did they say that the last elected officials (Nixon at that time) were insignificant candidates? I don't know. I found that it was a little scary that a president playing a striking resemblance to future President Ronald Reagan. It's fun to make this connection 40 years after the movie was made. <br /> <br /> What this movie can do shows how consumers outside the ad agency responded to new ads. Of course, shots have a strange, witty appeal for their unconventional creativity, but do these ads convince people to buy the product? If so, how? The film pointed out that the new advertising campaign was successful through interaction with clients and calls from the White House. However, it would be revealing that average people would see average people because this demographic situation was always the most profitable for advertisers. Although the parody and political message that this film probably created, apparently did not test the time, this film still had many unique features. Arnold Johnson had a magnetic X factor to him that benefited him greatly in this film. Swope's harsh voice was actually director Robert Downey, Sára's voice, which was dubbed, sometimes wrong, but fit so well as an authoritative outsider. He hires and shoots workers at random, but earns respect for everyone, except for one of the employees, for revolutionizing the advertising agency and finding new ideas. The film's assumption was and still is incredibly risky, especially since the film was written and directed by a white man (Robert Downey, Sr.). However, this film is declining to become a victim of negative black stereotypes that would lead to the rise and fall of the blaxploitation genre years later. Although some of the sex scenes may be somewhat out of the way for some viewers, the main message is that a black owned and operated company can thrive through innovation and risk taking. Many people may not have a positive message from this movie, but I did. "Putney Swope" remains an overlooked movie from the strange era and Downey, Sr. comeback) has never been recognized as the director he deserved. However, if you find a DVD of this movie, buy it and watch it. If it's on Netflix, ditto. It is a film that can sometimes be confusing, but it is worth watching its tastes, ambitions and its nonconformist even by today's film standards.
