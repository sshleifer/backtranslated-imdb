When Alfred Hitchcock did STRANGERS ON TRAIN, it was a precursor to most of the film that was publicly published that he was back on top of his form. From 1946 to 1950 his films were not box office successes, and his contractual arrangements with David O. Selznick ended because of it. In fact, he made some really good movies in this period, such as NOTORIOUS, SPELLBOUND, UNDER LAW, ROPE and (my opinion) STAGESTRUCK. While NOTORIOUS AND SPELLBOUND liked them, the audience was turned off by Hitch's attempts to experiment: his use of Salvator Dali's dream sequence in SPELLBOUND was acceptable, as was the setting among psychiatrists. But an experiment with long shots in the ROPE confused public (making ignore the merits of that film), and the willingness of Hitch to have an audience confused with the lies stated by the lead character in the memory was disliked - far more disliked then that deserves to be - in STAGESTRUCK. The bad timing thing for UNDER CAPRICORN (it was released as well as its star scandal Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosallini broke out) seemed to be a failure (which wasn't). PARADINE CASE was another failure - and one that actually had little. With STRANGERS ON TRAIN, Hitchcock avoided the special tricks he was interested in in recent films. Instead, he focused on his favorite themes of shared guilt and misconceptions. Based on Patricia Highsmith's novel, the story was about how Guy Haines, a professional tennis player, meets his fan - Bruno Anthony, a playboy - who travels on a cross-country train at the same time as an athlete. Bruno is talkative and fawn, and Guy sees him as one of the typical fans he has met ... if he is a little eccentric, saying he wants to talk about the first rocket in space. But Bruno knows all about Guy's personal problems. He is married to a promiscuous young woman named Miriam, and is in love with Anne Morton, the senator's daughter. Bruno knows Miriam will not divorce her successful celebrity husband. Bruno mentions how he can sympathize - he hates his stepfather who constantly criticizes him. Then Bruno mentions (cuffed) that he has about two men - technically alien - exchanging himself and then committing two perfect, unsolvable crimes instead of guessing them. Guy listens to the idea - and agrees it's an interesting idea. The train reaches Guy's goal, and his last comment is as confirmation of the idea. He just doesn't realize that "eccentric" Bruno is a sociopath, and believes Guy just agreed to kill both enemies! It's actually an amazingly simple storyline. Of course, Bruno kills Miriam, but fully expects Guy to live in accordance with the murder agreement and kill his stepfather. Guy is terrified - and worse, he finds himself a suspect from the police department. When Bruno, to encourage Guy, mentioned that he has a lighter (a train hood) and can put him in the murder scene, Guy finds himself in a deeper problem - how to avoid the police and how to control (if possible) crazy Bruno ? Hitch has always planned the footage of his film carefully, so from the beginning we see both our "heroes" from their feet towards their fateful encounter on the train with others. There are constant contacts in the film that show how both men are drawn into orbit. It's like the fate that connects them together. Yet they both have their own personalities - and Hitch, with a typical twist, makes crazy Bruno actually a more attractive figure. His scheme may be bad (if he succeeds, he kills two people and will have Guy's contract, no matter what), but he has a chance of life. One suspects that once Guy had, but the failure of his marriage, along with his now-dated socially prominent wife, made him more cautious and boring than he did. The cast is also good. Apparently Robert Walker had his best role in this film (only a year before his death). It was far from the home-boy next door to SINCE YOU WYWA or THE CLOCK. His stunning character also looked quite elegant in stories in several scenes. As Guy Farley Granger acts as a cousin of his co-murderer in ROPE, especially as the circumstances make him increasingly suspicious of the authorities (as his earlier role made his nervous behavior increasingly suspected of Jimmy Stewart). As for the ladies, Kasie Rogers is properly sluttish as Miriam - allowing viewers to be ready for her demise (in the famous sequence of shot in the reflection of her glasses) so that in fact they are cheering Bruno in his act of evil. Patricia Hitchcock appears to be Anna's younger sister (Ruth Roman), who bears closely resembling Miriam, and accidentally sets off Bruno at a social occasion. He plays this rare role well. Ruth Roman properly supports Granger, but her role is limiting because she is in the background and somewhat low. Other supporting artists, Leo G. Caroll as Senator, Marion Lorne (usually comedian) as Bruno's dotty mother, and Norma Varden as the unexpected recipient of violence from Walker are shown to the best benefits - all at the master's hand.
