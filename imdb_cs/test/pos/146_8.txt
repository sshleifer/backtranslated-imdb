Beloved and devoted priest from a small volunteer town for a medical experiment that fails and turns him into a vampire. Physical and psychological changes lead to his affair with his childhood friend's wife, who is repressed and tired of her secular life. A one-time priest falls deeper into despair and corruption. When things get worse, they try to keep what's left of his humanity ... <br /> <br /> A vampire movie should really be extinct because of the bad efforts of Twilight and Underworld franchisees, but the director. Inserts new blood into a vampire story, by putting simple things into perspective. These vampires have reflections and no fangs, but they still feed and die the same. Making the priest's main protagonist really opens up a can of worms for questioning. The priest primarily feeds himself to improve himself, but when his unmarried wife meets his friends, bodily instincts set in. What makes this film intensely erotic is that when a couple first agrees, they are experiencing something they have never before, forbidden passion, which makes the script all sensual. Chan-Wook adds much-needed humor to the movie, but it's only done in the last third of the movie. We see that the daughter lifted her mother in a chair in front of everyone, and when she realizes her own strength, she simply lays it down and continues. Cheerful. and the final act would not be in the film, nor three Stooges as a couple fighting for survival / death. CGI is fine and fantastic and the scenes with them jumping from building to building are so charming, you can watch ballet. The vampire genre feels fresh and lively after this, but more importantly, it has its eroticism and intensity that most vampire films are missing these days. It is violent, but I would not expect anything else from the director concerned. A really interesting story with fantastic characters and beautiful cinematography.
