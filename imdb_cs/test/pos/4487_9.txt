During the Sci-Fi TZ Marathon on January 31, 1999, this episode was the last to be broadcast in the 20th century in my time zone (Eastern). It was New Year's Eve, and when the clown starts to sing, "We're here because we're here because we're here because we're here ..." Old Lang Syne. Chance? We'll never know. I love this story for little touches: A teardrop for a ballerina, rumor rumors and a hit ending in the head. This and the Carney Santa TZ art are the only ones that relate to Christmas. My five best personal episodes, five characters each ...: 1. The Hunt 2. After Hours 3. The Hitchhiker 4. Lonely 5. Little Girl Lost
