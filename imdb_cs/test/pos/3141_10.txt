However, one of the most poetic narrative films ever made is a difficult movie that is immediately enjoyed. I love this movie, but I recommend seeing some of the other John Ford westerns before I look at it. When I first saw it, I was 18 years old and I didn't see too many other westerns and I hated it. I thought it was incredibly boring. I waited for something to happen. It took me several years to love this picture. First, I fell in love with Western in general - traditions, characters, landscapes, ways of speaking, etc. - and that made me realize when I saw WAGONMASTER again that there was a lot going on. I was also a more experienced viewer at the time, and I learned how to evaluate the visual narration and listen to what every picture tells me. WAGONMASTER is a very visual movie of one of the most visual directors working near the top of his career. The film is a celebration of the way of life and its theme is more emotional and intrinsic than the other western westerns. In fact, it is not as accurate as he says he has much less external action than the other Western ones. (Other Western people have external action and inner emotions.) It's pretty beautifully placed their Mormon pioneers in the context of nature. There are many shots of animals and children - not for any surface, narrative purpose, but to illustrate this idea. That's why the film can be called a poem. It is not a surface story (which hardly exists) almost as much as an emotional idea, and this idea gets through composition, editing, sound and music. In fact, it could be argued that it is a purer form of filmmaking, because images directly express the emotional idea of ​​a film, rather than having to serve a "story" first. Give this movie a chance, and allow it to exist on its own terms, not the demands of other westerns or other movies.
