The gem of a silent era cartoon --- was rediscovered by CARTOON NETWORK and was probably broadcast for the first time in decades, if at all. What makes it so fun are the diverse portraits ... Douglas Fairbanks is attacked by giant mosquitoes; Will Hays visit a visit as "Chief" of Static Studios; as well as appearances by Chaplin, Keaton, and William S. Hart. The image of a chewing gum that decimates the boots of the population (the idea of ​​money for Felix's boss near the clerk's decline) cannot be described - it must be seen. Great cultural gem.
