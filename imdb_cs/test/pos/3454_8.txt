I rented this obscure aussie relic a few years ago to point to a friend's place and it was an instant success. A classic tale of an oz wizard with an Australian twist with a billiards game for 70 years. Company stuff here, but later, "Mad Max" star Bruce Spence is a beautifully undervalued surfie / scarecrow and there are some wonderful comic bends Gary Wadell and Robin Ramsay as the deliciously 70s camp fairy godfather / father character. former Daddy cool frontman Ross Wilson on the title track. In a similar vein to the later aussie comedy, such as "Priscilla queen of the pouert".
