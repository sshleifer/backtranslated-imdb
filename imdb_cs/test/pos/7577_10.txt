I never remember that I taught Sarah, Plain and Tall at school, but when my son told me and said they were watching the movie in class, I wanted to see it too. I borrowed a library video and watched it as a family. It was an amazing story. But I did not know a few months ago that there are continuations. I've finished these weeks. I discovered one little oops: in the second movie, Skylark, Jacob recalls when he was a kid, and tells Sarah "my brothers and sisters and I would dream ...". In the Winter End, there are no "brothers and sisters" in conversations between Jacob and his father. But it's a very small oops, and I only caught it while watching the trilogy, the second time. Great movie, must see for good healthy family browsing.
