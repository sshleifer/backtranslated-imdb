Crossfire remains one of the best Hollywood news movies because, unlike the remarkably intended Gentleman's Agreement, which beat theaters a few months ago, he decided to send his message through an excellent noir thriller, rather than an outraged star that says: It's because I'm Jewish, right? "It's much easier to get a message that hate is like a loaded weapon when real bodies are more than metaphorical. Somewhat shamefully, the brief idea on the Warner DVD didn't mention that novelist Richard Brooks fired the film through the transition from homophobic murder to anti-Semitic, but it's interesting noting that while the victim is killed mainly because He is Jewish, there is no doubt in the performance of Sam Levene that the character is actually also a homosexual?

The one-night-long film has a great look full of dark black black shadows and shadows that were born the same as the style economy (shortening the lighting time and allowing director Edward Dmytryk more time to work with the actors). excellent cast to get the most out of the best scenario: carefree but quietly charismatic Robert Mitchum, detective Robert Young Maigret, hiker Gloria Grahame and tormented Paul Kelly as her admirable liar admirer, a man trying to tell stories other people try ties. But the lasting impression is the outstanding performance of Robert Ryan as a guy who could do with a good departure alone doing everything in his power to help a badly accused man to the death row. A big surprise hit in 1946, as a reward, with Dmytryk and producer Adrian Scott found themselves investigated by the HUAC, which itself had a considerable tendency to focus on Jews. So much for cruising?
