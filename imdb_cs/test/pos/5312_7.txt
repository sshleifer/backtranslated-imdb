The title derives from a change of teenage prisoner in a correctional facility doing on the front of his school book on government, titled "The United States;" he added: "(his name)." Many characterizations in this film work well - scenes between Leland (Ryan Gosling) and Becky (Jena Malone), Pearl (Don Cheadle) and Father Fitzgerald (Spacey) as well as with Leland, Becky and Sister Julie (Michelle Williams), among many others. The central thread of this film - the foundation on which everything hangs - is Leland's character and motives. He is a somewhat shy, passive, dear high school student who courageously meets Becky, who we think is an alternative school because of past history of drug problems. In the Becky family she has a sister, Julie, who is just finishing high school and getting ready for college; Julie's girlfriend, Julie's age (and whose parents have recently died) also lives with them. Leland lives with his mother; his father (Kevin Spacey) and his mother were long divorced and his father is a famous novelist. Leland is very receptive. The young boy in the Sixth Sense saw dead people; Leland sees a lover of teens and acknowledges that a few years later they divorce that pain will follow the present happiness experience of many. But for reasons that are never explicitly expressed, his prescient gift seems to work sometimes, for some people, some relationships and not for others. Parts of the film feel a bit like a derived blanket - borrowing from "American Beauty", "Sixth Sense", "Graduate", and perhaps some others I haven't done. acknowledge. That wouldn't be bad if only Leland's character worked. I think Gosling did a great job in Leland, but the script and story put restrictions. Would such an attentive, meditative young man ever be murderous? Even for altruistic reasons? Nothing gives any reason in the film. I am a retired therapist with many experiences with families and teenagers; while many of the reactions shown in film work - this part, this most basic element certainly does not. And there is at least one other element that, in my experience, would not fall into a real situation. life, though it is not so critical. The reason for the differences between sisters, Becky and Juliet, is never said, but that's fine. Once two siblings begin to occupy different roles (one good girl, the other a problem), roles can begin to drive each other into extreme positions. For the troubled, Becky, is that something "I have to do to be loved here - give up on me and become Julia?" And the pressure to live in being an all-good, parent-friendly child is no less intense for Julie. So why would she break up with her friend with a long-time friend and whose parents have so clearly approved? Don Cheadle was a good teacher of Leland; all others were good in their parts. 98% of the scenes were good. It lacked a key slip in understanding human nature. <br /> <br /> Good meeting; wrong story and psychology; worth seeing; there is no total loss.
