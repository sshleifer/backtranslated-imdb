I was slowly collecting movies available on Catherine Deneuve and Francois Truffaut. Both the actress and the director made some stinking things in her time - fortunately Mississipi Mermaid is not one of them. Beside "The Soft Skin", looking at Deneuve's sister (late Francois Dorleac), it would have to be my favorite movie, Truffaut. In addition to directing, Truffaut wrote the script. Something that always hits me about Truffaut is his almost childish innocence in introducing the story - one could almost call it naivety. At the end of the film, where Belmondo returns to an apartment in Lyon, is the scene. with remnants of prey. He rings the bell and Deneuve answers himself negligent. By the time Belmondo needs to get to his room from the street, Deneuve is changing into a dress, dressing up the best pair of stockings and shoes, then lying on the bed pretending to be asleep. It's a scene that could almost come from the baby's mind - but that's Truffaut for you. Watching Catherine Deneuve in her late 1960s movies is really sensual pleasure. It's so beautifully beautiful that it's almost painful when we look. By the way, for those fans, there are a couple of topless scenes from her in this movie - a really sinful pleasure. <br /> <br /> I disagree with previous posters. I don't see anything about "Hitchcockian" at all. As for the "look" - I love the look of older film warehouses used in the 1960s. The films of this period certainly add a unique look. <br /> <br /> We highly recommend Deneuve and Truffaut fans ......
