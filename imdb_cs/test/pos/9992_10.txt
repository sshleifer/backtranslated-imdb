I will split my ratings into the following 5 categories, each containing a maximum of 100% (if perfect). ________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> Visual pleasure: [100%] This is a visually very enjoyable video. I had a great time to watch it. The golf scenes are very well shot and the dramatic effects on the green have been quite amazing. I also liked to see old wooden golf clubs and a bag. Director's work: [70%] Bill Paxton is more connected with acting but this film shows he has talent. She did a decent job. Acting: [90%] Shia LeBeouf was very good in her role as Francis Ouimet (this guy can work well). The rest of the cast was also good. <br /> <br /> Entertainment: [100%] I enjoyed every minute. It was tremendously fun. <br /> <br /> Scenario: [91%] Based on a real story, the film is much more special. It was interesting from the start and loved every scene to the very end. <br /> <br /> __________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> My advice: I sure MUST watch all sports lovers, especially Golf (you all will love it). Anyone looking for a nice movie and hating Sports can watch it. <br /> <br /> _____ <br /> 10/10
