where do we head from here? this is the primary issue of this film. And do not be mistaken, mainly "ETC.", The efforts of director John Jansen of 2003, asks more questions than answers, but nothing as engaging or as powerful as this. Most of the film plays as a regular conversation between you and your college students, and I'm sure you will know many of the main characters' questions from your own drunken debauchery evenings. however, one of the many beauty of this film is that we rarely gave an answer. Questions are raised ?? everything from secular to deep? but jansen will lead his audience skillfully to question and answer these questions, with little or no help from the characters. Page 1 <br /> <br/> opens with an increasingly complex and beautifully arranged nonlinear segmentation that takes us into the lead characters. We meet them in the morning of April 8, 1994? den kurt cobain committed suicide. And it's cobain's death and a trip to his wake two days later in Seattle, which serves as the background of the film. When exploring the life, music and death of cobain, characters try - with varying degrees of success - to understand and cope with their own lives. <br /> <br /> There are some aspects of the movie that are what you can expect from a low-budget independent film: performance ranges from definitely average to excellent, with the strongest performances of Jessica Scott (Holly) and Noel Wood (Daniel ); some of these dialogues are somewhat stiff, but they never get completely unrealized; And there are some minor sound problems, especially when we get on the road, which sometimes makes it difficult to watch the action on the screen. but despite its "mainly ETC" deficiencies. is solid, deeply influencing a piece of cinema. amidst the moments of scary engagement, laughter and loud humor and intimate confusion, jansen weaves together all the characters together, illuminating their own struggles while making them available and engaging for us. and because we see reflections of ourselves in one or more of these characters, we can identify with the questions and problems they face, and we are able to look back and remember where we were on that day in 1994, when for many people the world has changed. while jansen takes credit for writing, editing, and directing the film, his photo must also be given kudos. With an incredible eye and amazing capability to capture and drag us into each of the worlds of the world, Jansen managed to make a shot after the shot that stuck with me long after the credits were returned. And no review of this movie would be complete without a nod to the amazing soundtrack. the music in this film is used to an amazing effect; sometimes they gently underline the action, sometimes in the spotlight, but never get in the way or get worse in kitschy music video. the soundtrack plays the same as the biggest hits, even though I suspect that the label would probably not sit well with the director. <br /> <br /> The new release of the Double DVD Archive offers some deleted scenes, trailers, music videos and documentaries. Deleted scenes offer some insight into making a movie through alternative opening and closing sequences, and it's definitely a delight to have a rare and beautiful video called Raining Kind. the cobain documentary is fine if it is slightly worse for wear and, of course, more extensive documents are available for hardcore fans. Noticeably absent is the director's comment, and I can't help but wonder if jansen is planning to reload it at some point with the tidbit attached. just say that next time I'm looking for a strong job from a talented filmmaker, I suggest you get aboard.
