I had a great time watching Femina get rid of a few wounds back, somewhat hungry. For most of the movie his pretty two hander, show games and the weird relationship of crazy doctor Philipe Leroy and stunning Dagmar Lassander. Previously, I saw her in several Fulci films that die of terrible deaths, but here's a young hip and beautiful. The movie is quite predictable and certainly mild on the exploitation front, but fun all the time because of its amazing kitsch feel. File design, music, lighting and cinematography are classic Italian styles at the end of the 1960s, a surreal holiday for the eyes and ears, and although the general nature of the plot is not too difficult to predict, there are more than unusual events and remarkably bizarre sights. and sounds to keep things interesting. Both lines are pretty good and repeats that Dagmar Lassander is really, really fine. The music played by Stelvo Cipriani is also perfectly suited to paintings. Director Pierro Schivazappa came here with a pretty cool, but it's not perfect. While it is very tempting, there is little substance and the use elements are as mild as possible. I think it gives a little charm and innocence, but I can't help thinking that the subject could do with more sleaze, more threats that sorta thing, especially because its pretty easy to figure out what happens. This is a suspicion a little unnecessary for stronger exploitation by fans and certainly not for people who want sex or a lot of nudity. It is rather a light, fun pop art affair, nice but irrelevant, like a bubble bath. Especially recommended for those who like the 60s, Dagmar Lassander or sweet sets.
