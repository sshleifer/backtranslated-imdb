I started watching this very tense one because I heard so many things about it. I read somewhere that it was a drama about child abuse and rated PG-13 for violence. Another critic said that it was a fantastic and nostalgic adventure of children (and I thought it was also for the kids who would watch). Now I've seen it so many times and I still don't know what category to give. Sometimes it is extremely funny, but terribly sad and depressing. For a pleasant relationship and adventure, I would like to recommend this film to all the young people I know, but I am afraid that the dark atmosphere is not suitable for children. Because of the perfect performance and the magic of the movie I have to say: Watch it, especially kids! The last thing I have to say is that I hate the writer for letting poor Bobby not see his family again after he escaped from the King (who didn't even return to terrorize the remaining Mary and Mikey). It is very good that this film does not have a perfect happy ending that everyone will be happy - and I did not expect it - but this solution made me very, very sad!
