I saw a trailer and read some reviews and I had little expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a bit off-beat, everyone in the making of this film withdrew a nice movie good for a lot of laughter. Writing and jokes are much more literate than I expected. Better yet, they come with aplomb unknown actors who do a good job, all of them. The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long is from "Ed" and the new Apple Computer Advertising. He just came to his own as an actor in "Ed," and he was excellent here. It's natural in front of the camera. Lewis Black is a social commentator who doesn't take any strikes. He is on "The Daily Show" at Comedy Central about once every two weeks, but he really shines in HBO "Red, White and Screwed". I catch it regularly in the uncensored comedy channel XM Radio. Give Black an idea and let him improvise. It doesn't matter if his screams and lines are written or improvised. He is invaluable and brings his thoughts to the middle class anxiety. One thing about Black's birth, his hand gestures are not the comics. Looks like he's having a conversation with you, and I think it's unknowingly more effective.
