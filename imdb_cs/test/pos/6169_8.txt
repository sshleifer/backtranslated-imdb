Being advertised as the most expensive film ever made in the Czech Republic, it will automatically convince you that it will be more than glorified and clich√© (for fear of budget). However, with a budget of 8 million and half of the film in English, it was not a very big budget, a high-risk movie. What we have is a great epic story focused on the friendship of two people, younger Karl and older Francis. As pilots in the Czech Air Force, when the Germans attacked before the start of World War II, they flee the country to England to join the RAF. Their friendship becomes the tense love of the same woman. But there is a bond of friendship that goes beyond mere friendship. Their friendship is an elegant metaphor for the attitude of Czech people and their country. Remember, they weren't winners, they beat the Germans just to be attacked by the Russians. Funny, exciting, interesting, beautiful, sad and illuminating this movie is one of my favorite war movies. Most of all, I like the way the British make fun of a way that is amazingly loving and gives an amazing look at how the British army fought against World War II. Forget about America's recent efforts (Peal Harbor, Saving Private Ryan, that's the best World War II movie for a long time.
