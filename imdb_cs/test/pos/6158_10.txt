Along with minor bugs, this film is a masterpiece and definitely the best war movie I've ever seen. It's not one of the best movies I've ever seen in all genres. Maybe I wrote it for No Man's Land before, but now I think it's better. It's very sad at the end, and I almost screamed after two shocking scenes that came within 5 minutes near the film's final. Karel's performance as the main character was fascinating, although he should be a newcomer to his age. This film thinks a lot about you, makes you cry (or at least brings you closer to it) and makes you hate any war and political BS. The shots of the prison hospital make the film even tastier. One of the minor shortcomings of the film are the non-British accents of allegedly British people. Most of the British people on the screen were actually British, but how do those who are to be British and speak with a foreign accent? It really didn't fit into this delightful movie. But it's almost the only mistake I noticed. The effects could also be a little better, but then we all remember many films from one particular country that have a vast FX and nothing else. In short, this film is a total masterpiece and every individual should see it. If you want to travel to Czechoslovakia in the 1940s, and if you want to see a huge amount of emotion at once, this movie is for you. If you don't want to do this, this movie will want to do you.
