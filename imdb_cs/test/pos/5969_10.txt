Reading Comments I am impressed by the apparent effect this wonderful movie has on viewers. But how can you watch this film and not mention that the refined dialogue was a gentle and courageous reproach to the authorities "in control" of the then USSR history in the USSR? They were not souls only at the time and place of the action that was revealed. These questions, superficially asked, are nude provocative when they are pointing to here and now. Who are the real "coworkers"? I admire that the writer stayed out of prison. I read somewhere that great stress can be a catalyst for making great art. This film is a masterpiece of misdirection, apparently heading for one path, while asking viewers to "look over their shoulders, what I'm talking about." What courage.
