Almost 25 years have passed since I saw this film. I would regard this film as a classic of all time in a dramatic category. Anthony Queen gives one of the most beautiful performances ever. He'll take you from laughter to tears in minutes. This film represents a wonderful picture of how humanity changed after II. World War. How much of this generation and the coming have lost their innocence. It took me a long time to find this movie called "25th Hour". This type of movie is not money, but it is definitely a treasure for them. I am very surprised why this media film is not used in a broader sense so that more people can enjoy this image.
