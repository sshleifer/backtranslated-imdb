One of the main aspects of "Malenkaya Vera" (called "Little Vera" in English) is that it was the first film from the Soviet Union that featured a sexual scene, though short. The title is important: Vera is the Russian word for "faith" that identifies that Vera punk (Natalya Negoda) has little faith in the Soviet system. And as the film shows, there is not much faith in it. The opening scene shows the bleak industrial city of Zhdanov, almost hell on earth. When Vera's lover Sergei (Andrey Sokolov) moves with his family, it leads to unexpected events. As in many Russian films, people's names describe their characters. For example, there's Viktor (remember that "winner" means winner). All in all, it is a good view of the Soviet Union when it collapsed - and we see why it collapsed. Really good.
