This movie is about people. This movie has remained as my favorite short film for years. <br /> <br /> Isn't that the simplest thing that makes life so interesting ?! We humans are so soft, compassionate, funny, caring for one moment - we invent the most beautiful and amazing machines that kill as many people as possible. In our short lives, we will destroy our world, ourselves and often, our own lives before we spend the rest of our lives trying to fix what we have destroyed. Sometimes there is nothing to fix! This movie can entertain, educate, and even help us realize what's wrong in our lives! Life is short and can be shorter! The end is too optimistic I'm afraid. I love Richard Condie's mind and what he's doing is happening to him! <br /> <br /> Enjoy <br /> <br /> H.K.
