Abbott and Costello have a talent in the lucky children's version of "Jack and Beanstalk". Using sepia tone and color, music and choreography, song and dance, crossing over players from one role to another, plus various other aspects of this very fine film make it obvious that the techniques and styles used for "Guide to the Guide" \ t playing. And it works well for our intrepid duo. There are some other things that make this movie as a gift for me ... Buddy Baer, ​​Max Baer Jr of "Beverly Hillbillies" Uncle, Look Like a Cop and Fig Pat Patello, Brother Lou, who participated in the script writing . These things help make this movie fun. But it's on the side. I think the choreography is wrong. But cute melodies and backing vocals help distract attention from somewhat sloppy dance numbers. Some players, a couple in love (prince and princess), are not very good at their business. But these things are a small price you should pay for an otherwise very pleasant walk on the yellow brick ... er, I think ... get on the beanstalk.
