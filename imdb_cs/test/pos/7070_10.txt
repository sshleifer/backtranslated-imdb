Yes. Watch this movie if you like brave movies. This is perhaps the best Mexican picture since Midaq Alley just because of the excellent cast, outrageous direction and noble soundtrack. Many people didn't like Cronic, they think it's very aggressive, but they didn't understand that it was just a representation with the hyper-realism of Mexican society, but so similar to all the Third World families. I hope Benjamin Cann and Bruno Bichir (who gives another example of his size as an actor in this film) will soon be reunited with the new film. Just remember how Los Olvidados (Luis Buuel) was misunderstood when it was released, but now we consider it one of the best films of all time. Get ready and watch this movie.
