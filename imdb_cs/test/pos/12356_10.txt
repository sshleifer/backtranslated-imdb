Yeah, I think this movie is a little boring compared to some of the other movies by Pam Grier. The story is too familiar, the dialogue stilted and some of the actors are not very good. But it's worth a look at the lengthy stretch near the end of the movie, where we see Mrs. Grier in a sexy blue neoprene jacket, with a half-open zipper. Yeah, it seems to be a frivolous point to discuss the actress from the talent of Pam Grier, but she also becomes an extremely beautiful woman, and during the day she had a body that wouldn't end. It's nice to see he's exposed in a tight suit. Rent a DVD and then tell me I'm wrong. You can't, can you? That's because you know I'm right! :-) And yes, I really did 10 just for wetsuit scenes! ;-)
