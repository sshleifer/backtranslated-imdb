It's fun to watch young James Cagney do his thing. He plays a cheap guy who takes his job very seriously, stepping on the fingers of a group of crooked politicians. He is offered to the world, but maintains his integrity. It's beaten and built, but that's a problem. We never know if he's really in danger. It is said to be in place, but it seems to have a blanche to move and do what it has to do. Sometimes he is so cocky that he doesn't protect himself too much. His allies are in the police department, but everything else is corrupt. Of course it will endure (almost too well to be true) and we attract it. The problem is the lack of permanent tension. It would be much better if he had to clear his name. He never falls into the depths even when his wife is rejected. It's still fun with the kind of bad guys. Look at me looking at Cagney doing his tough guy.
