Burt Kennedy both wrote and directed this western taken from the novel. Kennedy was a well-known good writer and director, mostly western. Robert Mitchum was a star for over 20 years when he did it. This role was like many others he has already done, and one can see why he has been such a big star for so many years. <br /> <br /> Easily filled this role as a well-used glove. The title title is played by Robert Walker Jr. (his father the gentle actor Robert Walker - died tragically at age 32 --- his mother is a famous actress Jennifer Jones). Robert was a mild builder, and even if he had only a few films. (He was in Rita Hayworth's latest movie. <br /> <br /> ROAD TO SALINAS --- in the same year and was very good). He looked very similar to his father, but he seemed to lack the fathers' charm. He did just a few more movies. He still lives and wishes him good luck. Most of his scenes are with another Hollywood son. John Carradine is son David, who still makes movies. they made a nice team. You always have a feminine character in westerns and usually a performer is a ballroom. (today they are called hookers), Angie Dickinson is exploring this role. also featured are western stalwarts, John Anderson and Jack Kelly. This was a movie in Old Tucson) outside of Tucaon Az,. & scenery is beautiful. Typical for older western games, there are not too many events, there is some good humor and the usual ending of filming. <br /> <br /> Fast 89 minutes. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** (of 10) 84 points (of 100) IMDb 7 (of 10)
