Watching this movie caused quite an emotional response. That's what all of today's documents are all about. It is refreshing to watch something so personal, honest and real. Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions, and publications are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed. It is a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. This movie goes very carefully and very successfully. You would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple doesn't meet society's expectations would produce pessimism ... but no. On the contrary: it was good for me. I feel like I know more about marriage now ... about women. Be sure to check it out, it will challenge you - exactly what a good documentary should be made.
