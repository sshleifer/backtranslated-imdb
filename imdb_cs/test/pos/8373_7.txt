The only reason Duke Is Tops, one of several "racing films" made in times of segregation, is worth mentioning today, because it made the film debut of a 21-year-old singer named Lena Horne. She plays Ethel Andrews, a singer who has to leave her production advisor Duke Davis (Ralph Cooper) to grow into great time. But Davis has to pretend he took the money for his services before her, so she doesn't like it. He then joins Dr. Dorand (Lawrence Criner) for a series of medicine in the south. Meanwhile, in New York City, her new producers bombed a great time because they made her the whole show instead of simply specials acting. Davis finds out from the radio and offers his services as a producer and leader of the band to bring his sets of other special acts, many of which make one of the few or just movie shows here, for their chance at a large time with Ethel next to him. Guess what happens? While the storyline is the type you saw in a thousand other musical films during this time, the fact that it was created for a particular audience is one of the more fascinating features I've seen during this month of Black History. Mrs. Horne's singing is on a good display and it is interesting to see her as young as her professional career becomes full. Among other support players, Lillian Randolph, Annie in my favorite movie, It's the Amazing Life, and Amanda Randolph's Sister, which I just saw in The Black Network, as a woman with sciatica who complains that he's not healed afterwards, is an unlikely, IMDb. what the doctor's medicine took before Duke explains it's for the feet! And as a longtime resident of Louisiana, I would like to take note of two players from this film: Joel Fluellen of Monroe as a tonic customer and Marie Bryant of New Orleans as a sexy dancer who appears near the musical peak. Just for Lena Horne herself, the Duke Tops is at least once.
