If you are in alternative realities, you are thinking about what is real and what is fantasy, it is a thriller that will catch you on the edge and that will argue you. Try to get a copy and see for yourself! I recently watched it at the L.A. and that was by far the best in the group I saw. It helped that it was actually something unlike the others that were screened. It is very well controlled and the production value is top. I would compare it to Jacob's ladder by assuring you of the real reality of the world in which we are. You should definitely try to chase this movie and if it's a screening at any festivals in your area, try Look at it.
