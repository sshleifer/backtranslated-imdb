This short film (40 minutes), based on William Faulkner's short story, will take us back to Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one about eighteen and one about eight, are looking for bird eggs (of course a huge collector's item for boys in the south around this time). Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and older brother, Pete, decides to enter. He gives his little brother, William and his heads, who wants to show more emotions and tenderness. Well, Willie has none of this if Pete can be a soldier. It leads to Memphis, showing its stubbornness and determination when it gets to better adults on the way. After finding a Memphis enrollment center, asking to see his brother, he pulled a knife on the lieutenant and injured him in the process. We showed the devotion and love of the little brother (Jonathan Furr). It delivers perfect performance as a stubborn, heavily saturated boy in the finer times of past days. The film tries and mostly succeeds in how brothers can show devotion and the importance of family ties in their youth. When both brothers meet briefly, the film brings a Qatari shout because fraternal love surrounds us. This film is like a cold bottle of water. Maybe Dasani or Aquafina, good, clean water with a tasty mineral packet, but not pure natural spring water like Evian. But it still extinguishes your thirst and you don't doubt its purity and quenching effects. It is more mill run and less expensive than some, but gets the job done, leaving one refreshed and detoxified afterwards. 7/10
