PEOPLE ARE STUPID. You should not rejoice when Paris kills in the head with a pipe! What is Paris for you? What if you were you? Wouldn't you want people to cheer for your death! Anyway, it was really bloody, which I liked and it was great when Elish's finger was cut off. It's a way for house wax 2: Ressurction or something. Paris was a great acting in the chase scene.Elisha and Chad Chemistry is great, they deserve Oscar. Lol.K bye.
