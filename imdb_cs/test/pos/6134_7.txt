Yeah, I watched this mini series with Mom and Dad as a kid. It was one of the few mini-series that could be followed by my nine-year-old mind. I remember it was very well done, and did not necessarily have a typical crap mini series. It was more or less an original concept that really caught your attention. I would recommend this miniseries to anyone who is a fan of history and conspiracy. Although most twists in this film are either spelled out or predictable, it is still worth the time. I did not check whether it is possible via netflix. I imagine not. They should play on channel history or something.
