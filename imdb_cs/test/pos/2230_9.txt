I can't understand why this 1971 Hollywood production is currently only available through an Australian video store, but this is the unfortunate ambiguity of this classic Peter Sellers (Leonard Maltin's film guide continues to provide him with the same BOMB review they gave in the 1970s). With so many stealers scene on display, Sellers is going through what may possibly be his most hilarious role. He all begins with his discovery of a patient who expired at 11:15 AM, but Sellers say the corpse is still alive due to the fact that the new day it won't start until noon! The last straw for the defending hospital commissioner comes in this room, the mark MUST NOT DISTURB still on the door; as soon as he leaves the room (handkerchief holds his nose), there is a brief interview with the doctor - DOCTOR: "We can't save them all! The man was at least 85! COMMISSION:" How old was he when he died, 63? "Harold Gould plays an awkward surgeon who closes his eyes as the knife leans in, Richard Lenz (whose reporter of" pompous ass "in" Shootist "was introduced by John Wayne at the back) plays a patient who reveals a scam (he just came for x-ray) Also, in the cast on screen (and supplying some super country-flavored music) is Keith Allison, a former guitarist for Paul Revere and Raiders., who also worked with Michael Nesmith on a few Monkees recordings (and co-wrote "Aunt's Urban Trial" with Nesmith on 1968's "Birds, Bees, and Monkeys"). including a topless sequence with the Uschi Digard near the end, also a scene with actress Kathleen Freeman (who wants to use Green Marks to finance her operation), which gets locked by Sellers in her office, she will never be seen again (in full version she will return to her office to find that she wrote in capital letters on the wall) UNFAIR PRICK "; his answer?" You are wrong for the price! ").
