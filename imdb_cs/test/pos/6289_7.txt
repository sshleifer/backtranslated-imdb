This is the only Paula Shore movie you should ever see. O.K., it's the only one I've ever seen, and I think I made a good decision. Normally, I am shore shore a little tired, but in this movie is very funny. In fact, the script is pretty funny and Shore won't beat the other actors with it ... what do you call it? Crazy? By the way, it's a witty, eventually forgotten movie. -Frink-3
