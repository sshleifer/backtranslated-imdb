American expatriate Jules Dassin awards the award-winning French gangster movie. The plot includes Tony Stephanois, hoodlum just out of jail, who takes his band of thieves to $ 240 million gem robbery. Unfortunately, the relationship of his ex-wife with the notorious gangster Grutter, the Italian cracker Cesar with a weakness for women, and the mistakes of his own friend Jo make the successful robbery turn into a bloody race against Grutter's time. Joo's hostage son for money in a typical "crime never pays" tragedy. "Rififi" in the title is explained in a song that means slang for basically violence and sex, and the full title, "Du rififi chez les hommes" means roughly "Some naughty in the house of men", which is largely a place where fatal mistakes take place. Leave it to the gangster movie to put most of the emphasis on the wrong steps on women, but this time Jo's wife gets the last laugh (if you could call it laughter) when she predicts "All of you just kill everyone else." The characters are not the most sympathetic and women are mostly weak, but Dassin still builds a very well-formed stretch film when they pull out a robbery that requires maximum peace, hides goods and tries to survive. what basically becomes a cat and a mouse. In the mix, some amazing photos and subtle attention to detail in editing, leading to stimulation and visual experience that overrides the otherwise generic chart. It is not only easy to understand why this is happening as a classic, it is also easy to understand why it is among the top 250 on the IMDb: it is exciting, visually gorgeous, full of sex and violence, and claims the classy attitude of the gangsters we make enthusiasts so much.
