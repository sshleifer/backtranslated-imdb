I'm definitely not a player, but a few people in my family and my friend. I reluctantly decided to find out what it was with "fantasy". I saw Dorkness Rising and I thought it was HILARIOUS! It's a slapstick but insincere to those who play the role of playing games. Also, and most importantly, people who have never played before, enjoy and do not feel omitted or lost and try to understand the plot. The acting was great and the field shots were believable. This makes me see other films of this production company. I can't wait to see this group's future! Three cheers - great!
