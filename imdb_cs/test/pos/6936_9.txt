OK, I got a DVD last week and finally got into the posting of my reviews, but I certainly liked this sequel in many ways. Zombie Bloodbath 2: Rage of the Undead. OK. This one movie on a quick clip, has some really good gore effects and some really well made the atmosphere and style. I'd actually go for a record as he says it can be one of the most stylish movies that I bought. Most of the time, I'm pretty angry at DV movies for being boring and looking like soap operas. Even a movie like Bone Sickness, which I like, has incredible stretches of DULL. Not this movie. It never stops long enough for you to breath away. Although I didn't say I liked it better than the first movie, I will say that the films have certainly improved through the film over the course of two years. This one has better gore, inevitable zombie feeding scenes, scumbag characters, and several returning actors (though their roles are different) mainly Jerry Angell as a pretty good psychopath with a mullet killer from hell. The shots are more ambitious this time, just like the script, because you can say that Sheets is trying to pull out a lot more than in the first movie. Some of them work and some don't, but I must say that at least he didn't try to make a bigger version of the first movie. This time he did not mention the power plant with chemical spill, just about Satanism and occultism, which revives the undead. So I'm telling Mr Sheets for trying something else with this. I give this movie two bloody thumbs!
