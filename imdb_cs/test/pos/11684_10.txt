The Spheeris debut must be one of the best musical documents of all time. And as far as I know, it's also the only one that focuses on L. Punk Explosion from the early 1980s. It's all: not only great, great bands like Black Flag, Fear, X, Germs, whose names don't mean much to you today, but whose influence on today's alternative rock music can't be overstated, but also the media promoters, and especially the punk audience - all portrayed in a way that makes you laugh, shakes and gasps with wonder at the energy, anger and rage that these young people have put into their music. Where is it today? The 1980s may have sucked up a lot of time when they camped on mainstream music, but the underground was swinging. If you need proof for this, follow the performance of Fear in the Decline. Unbeatable. Great movie! How come it's not available on vid, LD or DVD? P.S. Subsequent decrease of Pt. II is also cheerful
