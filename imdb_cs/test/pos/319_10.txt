My favorite movie of all time. That was a defective work of Coppola and seeing the documentary "Heart of Darkness" made him even more convincing. At this point, Coppola was the king of Hollywood after he made the "Godfather" and "GodfatherII" and developed the ego necessary to even try to make a film like "Apocalypse Now". Through absolute arrogance he went with the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz. And like Willard, he didn't know what to do when he got there. It is such a masterpiece of American cinematography, beautifully photographed and the river is the perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. I most like the "Apocalypse Now" that it does not provide any answers or conclusions. As a result, thanks to this openness, they annoy some viewers who like their movies to be much clearer. This film resists categorization. Some call it a war film that is not at all, it is rather a personal study of man. The best pic about Vietnam is, in my opinion, a "platoon" and if the viewer tries to reformulate the Vietnam War, they first turn to answers. Coppola should be commended for taking over the bureaucracy of the war, which she is giving her very effective presentation at a meeting with Gen.Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and Playmate Review. The sharp insolence of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable figure, and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classic. It is an almost psychedelic voyage to the very surrealistic end which makes it a film that is not accessible to all. Very challenging to follow, but rewarding as well. I could offer my explanation on every scene, but that would be totally useless. This film is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate satisfaction. <br /> <br /> A little footnote, if your first viewer is Apocalypse Now, check out the original version first, the 'Redux' version is I think it's more designed for a hardcore fan and is more curious than 'new' and improved 'movie version
