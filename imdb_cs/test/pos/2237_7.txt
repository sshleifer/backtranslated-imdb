I captured this movie late at night on TV and I was expecting a low-priced campy "masterpiece", I was surprised by a pretty decent movie. Angelina Jolie's unique acting skills (or I say their lack?) Makes her perfect as an android, and other actors, though terribly average, aren't terrible at the very least. There is a conspiracy; A pretty convoluted plot on it, involving a plot and a length couple (one person, one android) will go to watch their illegal romance, with a "big brother" -type character and an android killer thrown into the mix. Also production and sets were much better than I expected. I haven't seen the original Cyborg, so I can't compare it to another; This movie is without Blade Runner, but as a late night, futuristic guilt of pleasure, it's worth a watch.
