In 2006, I attended a screening of "Fierce People". I hesitate to call him a "premiere" of any kind since it was filmed in the spring of 2004 and had its world premiere in Tribeca in 2005. This year, several festivals played. Relaxation seemed imminent, then disappeared. Gay. He disappeared. Or so did the film public. Rumors of theatrical or DVD releases have appeared now and then, but everything turned out to be unfounded. Then the screening was announced. Maybe we can call it "repremiere"? Surely it was as if I witnessed a buried treasure. And what a treasure it was. I suppose it would be possible to characterize "Fierce People" as an age drama. But it also has elements of comedy and tragedy, as well as secrets. And a little farce handball in. In short, real life. This makes it impossible for a dove to enter the indie category as opposed to a Hollywood movie. But its high production values, great budget feel and star cast stars seem to interfere with the indie label. Let's call it a hybrid. And maybe that's why it's "lost". This defies categorization. Meet Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin), 15, whose father is absent. Finn never knew him. But he sees him and hears him through a collection of South American home movies. Dad is a renowned anthropologist who made a name for himself and founded a business with Yanomani, the "Fierce People" who live to kill and behave well. All their activities are based on these two "tasks" and Finn is interested. Mom Liz (Diane Lane) is also somewhat absent. Although physically present, it is lost in the world of cocaine and alcohol. So Finn becomes an adult in his little lonely world with his film reels. One summer, Mommy decides to drag Finn with her into the New Jersey wilderness. A masseuse, mother, took care of a wealthy client, Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland, in a performance tour with a force) and invited her to a prolonged house call on his palace. Osborne's "tribe" includes an assortment of eccentric rich children, servants and village idiots, among whom Finn finds himself part of his own anthropological study. Will his experience with dad films help him survive life as a visitor to this tribe? Will it be accepted? Or will he be considered an outsider, simultaneously struggling with his own identity as a teenager? These are fairy tales and I think it would be if it wasn't for the dark underbelly that director Griffin Dunne and writer Dirk Wittenborn infiltrated into this wonderful story. With Anton Yelchin's voice, Finn must learn to go back to being a teenager who has never had a chance to be, to be a mother's mother, to allow a newly sober mother to be his mother and to learn accountability to adulthood as it should be all the time. Yet he needs this transformation in a dangerous, dark world where he plays with the foolishness of this broken family. This is primarily a story movie and Griffin Dunne has so much stressed in the opening film. He bought the rights to the Wittenborn novel, even though it was written, and his own screenplay, Wittenborn, comes to life in the hands of Master Dunn in a way that is miraculous. This is also largely a movie, and Sutherland has never been better. His stellar bend Osborne stunned those around me and will probably also amaze you. The character of Diane Lane eventually exposes so many personalities that it is hard to imagine another actor taking it so well. It's breathtaking. But more than anything, the film "Fierce People" by Anton Yelchin. He has a long resume as a child actor, but precious little as a teenager. Other than the little known "House D" (also a gem), he is best known as Byrd on TV "Huff." In January, he will be seen in "Alpha Dog" (also sitting on the shelf since 2004, a film I saw this year at Sundance and in which "heart and soul" is). His performance goes far beyond what one would expect from someone so young, and there is nothing less than spectacular. This complicated, unpredictable movie has remained out of sight for a long time. "Fierce People" is a treasure full of light and shadow, comedy and tragedy, joy and pathos, but especially wonder.
