The ultimate brave movie. The elements of Bogie, Welles & Sinatra let you sweat and be happy. In comparison, it truly abolishes the proverb of apple cart to see recent films, such as "The Oceans Eleven (remake)" reviewed in such high respect-especially in Europe. Films like Rififi must be shown, spoken and kept alive to remind younger (pathetic) critics of what a real classic Noir is. <br /> <br /> The criterion should be appreciated in their flawless and elegant transmission.
