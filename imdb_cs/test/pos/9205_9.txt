I read the comments on Las Vegas and agree with some of them, it's not a TV for brain surgery, but then I was once again under the impression that television is mainly for escape, especially with what's going on in today's world. Let's face it, the Vegas show (it's not a reality-based program) will not act on reality because Vegas is a pure fantasy to me! It is a place where we can go and to a large extent do what we want when we want (with respect to the funds of course!). Therefore, the fact that Las Vegas is nice, sexy and clich√© with characters that reflect everything that seems to be in my eyes. If you don't like it, don't watch we have a million channels for! We come to the third episode here in the UK and I know I'll be doing beeline to watch it again. I just hope it's not canceled, something that seems to be happening a lot with most shows that come to the UK that are half decent! (Firefly and Jake 2.0 anyone? !!). <br /> <br /> It's harmless, great looking fun and every time I look at it, I want to go back to the real thing :)
