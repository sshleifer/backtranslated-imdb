Maybe I'm biased because the F-16 is my favorite fighter plane - though the F-14 is probably second or third - but I liked this movie. The sequel (Iron Eagle II and III) does not measure acting and plotting, but the first - along with Top Gun - have excellent flying and music, along with sensible charts and gaming. II and III clearly have much less "flight budget", but their main disadvantage is conspiracy and action. I believe that the relative fame and popularity of Iron Eagle compared to Top Gun is almost entirely a reflection of Jason Gedrick's fame and popularity compared to Tom Cruise. Another plus (for me) is Shawnee Smith's too short appearance. 7/10
