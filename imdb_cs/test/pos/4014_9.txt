These days, rarely come a baby show that does not include 1) a preteen / teen pop star that is just as fun as watching the paint dry 2) include a plot to find the perfect date with another guy / girl each time 3) revolves around an irregular roar and unintelligible humor. Approximately 95% of the shows on Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network fit in with these criteria. To put it simply, all lack good behavior, originality and good storytelling. It is as if manufacturers and writers thought children were not smart enough to understand the character's development and plot detail. They couldn't be more ignorant. Surely children have a good laugh and erratic behavior (if it is done at conservative level and done right), but as they also want to enjoy the story, see drama and see people who are attacked. They don't want to see people living in a flawless world where they get everything they want. They know that this world is not fun and games, they know it is not perfect. Everyone has problems and we all have to learn to work around them. This show revolves around this kind of thing. Alex Mack is an average teenage girl who seems to have everything she goes for her brilliant sister, Annie. Her mom works in an office, but sometimes she is a parent at home. Her dad, George, is a top scientist at the plant, a chemical corporation that employs most of the city in which they live, Paradise Valley. Alex is unpopular and will be picked up by most of her peers. Her only friend is Ray (but she gets more friends as the series goes). On the first day of Jr. High, Alex goes home not too happy about school, but a truck delivering chemicals from the factory crashes into a fire hydrant that tries to avoid running it, dumping strange chemicals known as GC-161, where a chemical mixture with water covering Alex in it. Soon after, he begins to develop strange powers, such as morphing into a puddle, shooting lasers from his hand, and moving things with her mind. She also shines constantly when she gets nervous (though we never see much of it later). In addition to his sister Annie and friend Ray, Alex decided to keep these forces secret from everyone, even his parents for fear of being kidnapped by a plant whose corrupt owner, Danielle Atron, has a security head, Vince, looking for a mysterious GC161 baby . Each episode then deals with Alex, who is trying to live a normal life as a child while learning to live with his strange powers. The series may seem like girls, but it's not like that. As a boy, I enjoyed watching this show because of its amazing effects and drama. Producers have successfully added some sci-fi elements with teen drama elements. In fact, some episodes were silent and a little scary. An unjustified race manager, Atron and Vince, makes good adversaries for the series, because writers really regard them as a threat, and every time they appear on the screen they give you a terrible feeling. He also added a clever move to David, a truck driver who spilled GC-161, like Vince's damping assistant in pursuit of a comedic effect, but you also love him to the end. It was interesting to see how little Alex was trying to live like a normal child, but he was trying to improve his strength. Sometimes you forget that they are children who are fighting a giant adult institution because you are drawn into the story. The show does a good job on children by showing Alex that she can have super powers, but she is still a child and must be careful. Even some episode you find yourself embarrassed by Alex's disasters. My favorite episode, where Alex wants to never be born, proves most of these elements. As I said, manufacturers never hesitated to add in some laughter whether they came from Ray's one ship or George's special habits, or David was trying to be a nice guy. Of course you will come across sloping moments and an entire episode that has nothing to do with the show's series, but what a good series not? Everything in a great show. 9/10
