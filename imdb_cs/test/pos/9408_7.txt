In 1974, teenager Martha Moxley (Maggie Grace) moves to the high quality area of ​​Belle Haven, Greenwich, Connecticut. At the Night of the Madness, the eve of Halloween, she was murdered in the courtyard of her house and her murder remained unsolved. Twenty-two years later, writer Mark Fuhrman (Christopher Meloni), who is a former LA detective who has fallen into shame for a perjury in O.J. Simpson's trial and moved to Idaho, decides to investigate the case with his partner Stephen Weeks (Andrew Mitchell) for the purpose of writing the book. The locals curl up and do not accept them, but with the support of Detective Steve Carroll (Robert Forster), who was responsible for investigations in the 1970s, they discovered criminals and the power and power to cover the murder. "Greenwich Murder" is a good TV movie, with a real story of a 15-year-old murder committed by a wealthy teenager whose mother was Kennedy. A strong and wealthy family has used their influence to cover the murder for more than twenty years. However, the snoopy detective and the condemned perjurer in shame were able to tell how an abominable crime was committed. The screenplay shows Mark's investigation and Martha's last days in parallel, but there is a lack of emotion in the dramatization. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
