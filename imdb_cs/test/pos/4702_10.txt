Oh so beautiful, oh so tearful and so intestinal. It does everything so shallow, so pale, compared to the insignificant. Sister Helen is not a real saint. She is a real man - defective, raw and blunt but passionate and with a heart of gold. Interestingly, this handful of miserable, unhappy people have found meaning and laughter. What I loved most is how the documentary depicts the polarity of human nature.
