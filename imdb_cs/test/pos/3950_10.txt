I can't get it out of my brain. It's definitely completely different than what's out there. I've seen a lot of movies during the holidays and while some are fine nothing really shaken my world as BlindSpot did. There is just something that is cool about the actors and the way they put the movie together. It's like there is a really scary thing mixed with some pretty f **** ing hilarious black humor. Franco is great, but the older rough buddy steals the show in several scenes, like when a child goes to the grave. I think some politically proofreading won't appreciate the atmosphere (they won't bring your grandmother), but it's absolutely amazing. The best thing is the kaliedescope style. There are some really serious things mixed up with super interesting shots on the road. The movie really makes you sad and frightened in parts, but it also rotates your head on what's going on and how it's made. WTF is in the world? Sooo many critics are freaking out about all these supposedly revolutionary breakthrough movies and when you see them, they are boring and predictable and not all. I don't get it because there are many other better options. Blind Spot is really a bit brilliant because it gives you the excitement and chills and the main upcoming star power, but it does it in a way that is completely fresh and absolutely absolutely advised.
