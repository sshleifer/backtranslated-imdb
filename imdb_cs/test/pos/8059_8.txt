After World War II, an even worse crime in Phenix City, Alabama, exacerbated by money from an army base just across the river in Georgia, made it worse. Gambling, prostitution, shark loans and the like have helped organized crime in the city. Soon it was too bad and violent to tolerate it. This film is based on the true story of this struggle. According to the standards of the fifties it was a shocking expression. Although a low budget, the same small budget helped realism requiring on-the-spot shooting. Very daring movie. Richard Kiley was amazing as always, and John McIntire stolid. Why this good movie isn't on video is a real puzzle!
