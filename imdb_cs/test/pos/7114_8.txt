This is another versatile fun filled fright fest. \ TMany people want to compare it with House Of Frankenstein.Even, even if it has a similar cast and same director it can stand on their own. (It seems that Erle C Kenton has conducted most of the 1940s Universal Horror Movies). Recap: Baron Latos Appears in Dr. Eidlemann looking for a "cure" for his vampirism.Larry Talbot (who somehow survived the House of Frankenstein) also appears on the door of good doctors looking for a cure for his suffering. After an unsuccessful suicide attempt, Talbot and Dr. Frankenstein find a monster. To make things difficult just before biting dust, Dracula infects a good doctor with his blood. The doctor becomes a bloodthirsty maniac at certain times. Where it leads to something you have to see for yourself. Carradine actually gives a very good performance as Dracula. He is not chewing the scenery as he will be in later roles. It's hard to suppress giggles when they appear in a top hat, even if the cloak / cloak is traditional, but the hat must go. Where does the hat go when it turns into a bat ...? Onslow Stevens gives an excellent picture of the doctor. He is torn between his basic kindness and growing blood lust, which is now given to. This is a very underrated feat. Chaney brings Wolf even more life in his fourth performance in this role. The monster doesn't have much time to do it. end (some footage of Ghost Of Frankenstein is used). At least in House Of Frankenstein he was up and around a bit. Yes, it adheres to a basic universal pattern complete with an angry mob village running amok with torches. But this is not a bad way to spend an hour and ten minutes. It gets low 8.
