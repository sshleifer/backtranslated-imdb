The reviews for RENDITION generally were not favorable, so I waited to move to the local discount theater. The film tells the story of an American-Egyptian scientist, Anwar El-Ibrahimi, who is torn from an international flight and after an interrogation that links him to a recent terrorist event in an unnamed African-American country. It's not as bad as I was afraid, it's an interesting and provocative record in the "ripped-up" genre of a thriller. The film finally asks hard questions about American methods of curiosity of information from political prisoners: Does the previously impenetrable line (openly) employ the torture of suspected terrorists by what our country should do? Brings useful information to help save lives? If so, at what price? What monsters do we create when innocent people are captured and tortured? What kind of monster did we do to sanction torture? It's always disappointing when a film with such provocative material is sloppy with some details that make good movies great. For example, I would like to empathize with the wife of Anwar, who is exploring the whole film, but the only recognizable personality she gives is her advanced pregnancy. RENDITION also seems to assume that Arab women who do not go along with their fathers' marriages are just asking for trouble, and there is a badly designed notebook that keeps another of the main characters in the film, which explains all the details too comfortably. information that his love interest becomes an urgent need at the moment. I laughed loudly when the moment was to be filled with fear. The film features a good central performance by Jake Gyllenhaal and strong (but too short) performances by Hollywood veterans Meryl Streep and Alan Arkin, as well as the impressive Omar Atwally turnovers like Anwar El-Ibrahimi and the actors Moa Khouas, Zineb Oukach and Yigal Naor, who I would like to see in future films that have nothing to do with terrorism. Good luck to them. The five RENDITION stories follow nicely together until the filmmakers start a slight but effective twist that ultimately refers to the never-ending cycle of the massacre that the violent attacks of terror have spawned.
