River's Edge is more than just a murder story. It is an accusation of a wave of apathy that has plagued youth pockets for decades. Our main characters are a group of what my high school would call "stoners". One of them simply decided to strangle his girlfriend because she was obviously nervous to "talk to him". This dangerous young man, played by Daniel Roebuck, has an intensity that scares you. He took the other children in the group to show them his girlfriend's body, and strangely enough, no one appeared. The balance of film interrupts the desperate circumstances in which these people live, and how guilt is ultimately able to penetrate these apathetic children. his characters. We clearly see the dangers that such uncontrolled apathy brings and only have the desire to get drunk or tall. We have shown that these children have a dysfunctional home life, and perhaps it is to explain their horrible behavior. But could they only be unstable houses that lead to this type of destructive life? Crispin Glover is his usual retired man. After the murder, he travels through the city in a state of complete paranoia. He tries to sympathize with why his friend must have committed a crime, but he has not clearly understood what a young man could do. Dennis Hopper plays an older man. Although he is certainly a rebellious figure, he cannot relate to the apathy and anger of the younger generation. Witness that his confused reaction, as Roebuck describes how his girlfriend killed him, felt. As Hopper's wild character, he knows that this young man should not walk on the ground. <br /> <br /> What do you think of these children? Well, actually no way to stand up. Some are less despicable than others, but you cannot help or hate them or are sorry. Twenty years later, there is still an apathy alive and well in many young people out there. When will these children be lost? What is so many of them want to act anti-social? This movie and the questions it poses about teenagers will stay with you for a while. That is a fact. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Hound.
