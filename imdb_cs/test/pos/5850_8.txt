This multi-level thriller was careful. It is worrying and informative to see how perverse human behavior can be. It is also instructive what past wounds can motivate contemporary behavior. No one but Sandra Bullock's partner is very likable. But everyone is believable. Sandra did a great job. Her character, Cassie, comes to life with pain and fear and defenses. She is a survivor and so her life experience finally brings her a healing moment. I really enjoyed this movie. Tom Landers
