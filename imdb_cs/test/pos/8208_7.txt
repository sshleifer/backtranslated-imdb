Following my friend's advice, I made this movie. I am very fond of computers in general - why the 1995 identity theft movie could not be left invisible. I had some bad echoes about it, but in the end I wasn't so disappointed: the story, though classic, was a bit interesting and had to be really new in the days of the theaters. I was glad I was surprised to find that, contrary to what we usually see, computer-implemented actions are realistic because they use Windows 3.x and normal computers. The narration is a median and does not bother the viewer. The end is typically American. The performance of the actors is global, Sandra Bullock usually bothered me with her way of acting, but this time she seems to be in control. I would recommend the movie.
