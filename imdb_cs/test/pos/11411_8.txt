The film is about a girl who doesn't go to fire just because she's sitting that night. Nothing special, is it? Until ... The phone rings. Until ... The phone rings again. And again ... And again. These are not some stupid prank calls. That's real. If you want to see how the girl reacts, just watch the movie. <br /> <br /> A great atmosphere full of scary sounds. The young Camilla Belle, who was given a lead role, performed very well. I see in her some great potential to become a good actress. This is more than a decent thriller, I have no idea why it is so underestimated. In my opinion, this film deserves more than just 4/10. 24% of all voters rated the film with 1. Get serious, people. You can't get a better thriller for that title.
