I really think this movie deserves some Oscars! I really don't care what people can say about this movie ... because it's a really good game from Samuel L. Jackson and especially from Christina Ricci !! I am a big fan of her, since I saw her in Addams Family ... I tried to watch all the things she does, and that's absolutely one of the best parts she has played !! I love her look (though people say she's not pretty ... I think she's ... and I love her eyes) !! The film is about many things ... people say it's religious ... people say it's about racism ... people say it's about drugs ... people say it's about nymphoma ... well ... maybe it's a little of it all !! But what I really feel is that this movie has a high level of eye opening for what the blues is ... what it means ... and mainly comes from: life ... heart ... pain ... sorrow ... and above all ... spontaneous feelings !! I hope you see it ... if you're such a person who likes a movie not only from pictures or a story that tells ... this is a good movie ... see how Christina Ricci performs so horny! It's a fox!
