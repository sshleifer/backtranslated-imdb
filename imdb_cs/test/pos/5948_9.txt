Two new OSS 117 films have a kind of humor that is both intelligent and clumsy, which I find extremely fun. She really reminds me of the classic Pink Panther movies with almost as good a leading man as Peter Sellers in Jean Dujardin. And unlike Steve Martin's utterly devastating Clouseau, Dujardin is quite brilliant. Comments on films that are anti-Semitic are obviously a case of total lack of humor and thus of understanding. <br /> <br /> Whether you like it or hate this movie, it really comes down to what kind of humor you have. I can't wait to continue!
