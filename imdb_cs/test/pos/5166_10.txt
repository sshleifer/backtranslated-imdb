This is an excellent movie and I would like to get it on DVD for people to buy. It's hard to keep trying to catch him on TV. How do you not know when one of the stations decides to broadcast. Can anyone tell me what a file company is doing to write to them and see if they will publish it to the public? Yesterday I caught only the last hour and a half and I saw it only once last year. My sisters and I are looking for him in every store that sells videos. John Denver is an excellent singer and actor and the storyline is great. They put out a few older movies and I think it's great, but there are enough of them not to be interpreted, and I think if we could contact producers and express our demands, we could get some of them on DVD.
