I know that this film had a rather rough ride from critics, but I have to say that I really enjoyed it. The real star is fantastic Dylan Moran. He can never be cheerful and convincing in all his various disguises. He also succeeds in radiating a sweet spell that runs counter to his hideous pratfalls. Special mention must also be made of Michael Gambon, who plays for laughter with a brilliantly accurate yet comedy Dublin accent. The only weak link is Caine, who, although obviously having a lot of laughter, makes it the least interesting and likeable character. It probably won't play so well abroad, but it's well worth watching all the same.
