This is undoubtedly the most beautiful and amazing document I've ever seen! The images displayed are absolutely breathtaking and stunning. Moreover, it is an amazing learning experience. I'm not one for educational documents, but this catches you and won't let you go to the end. You'll be so addicted and amazed at what you're watching, forgetting to watch TV at home! This series is available to buy on DVD and I HIGHLY recommend picking this! With this evil and death in this world, this documentary series gives us proof that life is beautiful and worth saving.
