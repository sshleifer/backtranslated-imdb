Follow directly from the last episode of the previous series Yes Minister. Jim Hacker now finds himself inside number 10 of Downing Street as Prime Minister of the UK, instead of government minister and member of the government now heads Her Majesty's government. All this after Sir Humphrey Appleby, after some scheming maneuver after the previous prime minister, resigned at the end of Yes Minister. Sir Humphrey Appleby is now Chief of the Civil Service. <br /> <br /> I thought this series was better than the first series, or even though it didn't take so long until the first series unfortunately.
