From all the seasons and episodes of THE THE TWILIGHT ZONE, after seeing all the wonderful thoughts that radiate thoughts, it is at its height. That is right. This story, this called HUNT peaks a great number of the best screenplays on TV History. It is true that there are no interplanetary space flights, no unexplained cracks in time. There is no live nightmare, no sudden changes in settings. There seems to be nothing unusual for our protagonist. The main character, played by veteran actor Arthur Hunnicut, comes out of the cabin in the hills, accompanied by his faithful dog, to hunt raccoons. Because raccoon is mostly nocturnal animal hunting, moonlight is. A man and a dog will soon meet a big raccoon who spews a dog on his back and tries to drown a dog in a pond. The man jumps to help his dog. There is a kind of almost black-out, after which the couple are seen ashore, lying, almost sleeping as positions. Calling Your Dog By Name, (Rip, I Think) An Old Man Goes Home. When he comes, he finds a woman who cries and does not respond to her conversation. He also observes visitors who come and go to his house, pay respect and give words to comfort his wife. It still seemed to be confused at the strange reception and marches around the Cabin. on a long walk on the road where he notices that he didn't remember the long fence in these parts. He finally comes to a fairly big guy, dressed in clothing similar to his overalls, hat, work shirts. They are at the gate that leads to an area where plenty of smoke is rising. The Gate Goalkeeper is enthusiastic about his convincing pitch in an effort to get the man to enter. Rip sounds discontented. The gate man tells the old man that he can enter, but the dog would have to stay outside and offer him an observation of the animal. The man will have none of this and the two will continue down the path. <br /> <br /> After a little more hiking they come to the second entrance, where the gate guard recognizes the man and greets him. When the old man reports what happened on the road, he told him how the guy at the second gate tried to separate the man and the dog, and added, "Without dogs allowed, it must be hell of a place!" The second guard said he was right! "That's right!" Our family lost our first dog, Lady-Mixed Lab, in October 1981. About 6 months later, how lucky it would be, wife (Deanna) and I, along with our 2 daughters (Jennifer 9 and Michelle 6), watched this episode on TV, WGN TV, Channel 9 Chicago. It all made perfect sense for us at the time. We are sure that anyone who has this relationship with a family dog ​​agrees. The episode still brings the watery eyes to this now 60 year old writer.
