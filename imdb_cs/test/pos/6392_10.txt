My wife and kids have been and still are the best comedy series on TV ever made. I really enjoyed it and everyone at U.k was still watching the recaps.The Wayans bros. he should somehow show up in a comedy series somehow. My wife and children were comedies that the whole family could watch, and you wouldn't get it too often. Is there nothing we can do to make it happen again? do something to show that comedy again! Damon Wayans should return! I really want Damon Wayans to play or do another comedy like this, of course, with the help of the whole Wayan family. I was really sad when it ended and I hope they will come in the future. , great stuff! Your really, DezMo
