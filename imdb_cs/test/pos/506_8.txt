Blade is a dark, grim but distinctive vampire film and is one of the best. A little gore, but nothing so bad. Wesley snipes played a strong role as he removes vampires. It's not really buffy because it's too tame, but Blade brings a decent plot and it's the kind of movie you'd like to watch on a dark stormy night .... that's in the best view! <br /> 87%
