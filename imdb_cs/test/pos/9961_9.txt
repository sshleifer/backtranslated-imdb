The merchant from Venice is a fantastic movie. It's absolutely true to Shakespeare's original game. If you've seen Jeremy Irons in Casanova and liked his performance, it's a movie for you! If you've seen Joseph Fiennes at Shakespeare in Love and enjoyed his performance, it's a movie for you! If you've seen Al Pacina at Donnie Brasco and liked his performance, it's a movie for you! It's a very nice movie, and if you've studied Shakespeare like me, it's a great movie to see! The only problem with this movie is that you can't let the little ones see it because it has a bit of nudity in it. But besides, it's a really good movie !!
