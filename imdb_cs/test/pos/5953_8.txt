Jean Dujardin gets Connery's mannerisms down: adjusting the cufflinks while entering the club while all the women admire him, steadfast straightening and smoothing the tie, stumbling, motionless. It's mysterious and you'll find out how much Bond in the 1960s was Connery's work and not actually the character of Ian Fleming. Film cinematography nods to these early films, the film comes mainly from Russia with love and mainly Thunderball. The main joke is how the chauvinist hero is not only in terms of sexism, but also nationalism and colonialism, and how he puts his nose when he is sent to Egypt. It's not perfect - about 20 minutes in it seems to be one joke movie and the pieces it reminds of one spoofs of the day, of which there were plenty. Men of Morcecambe and Wise's The Intelligence Men had suspicious men in Fez who watched their heroes too, and that was a bit back. Unlike Sellers' Clouseau or Borat Baron Cohen Dujardin, he does not give his character such a level of reality or true pathos - he is too busy perfecting his Connery Mannerism. It's not enough with credits or a great song, and there's no funny or serious villain like Dr Mike Myers' Evil or Ricardo Montalban's Naked Gun nemesis, for the hero to go against. But the scene where OSS117 wakes up in Cairo in the morning made me laugh out loud in three quarters of an empty movie theater and the whole thing looks amazing, and you never get a chance to see Kid Brother on screen and women are an ace pancake, really hot. It's a Bond spoof without falling into a mad scientist / Ken Adam sets or funny gadgets routines. Recommended.
