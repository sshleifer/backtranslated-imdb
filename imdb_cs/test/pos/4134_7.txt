I have to say it. Gary Busey saved this movie. If it wasn't for his subtle acting talent, this movie would be under par. I recommend a movie, but hardly. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with film is its wide disregard for historical, geographical and physical accuracy. For example, why is Lubbock green and hilly? How come Buddy's producer Petty ignored? Where are daily trips to Clovis, New Mexico? Why is Nashville considered a racist hate camp to destroy Holly's sound? Why was Buddy's two-weekly courtship with Mary considered complex, taboo, racial mixed stereotype? Why are Buddy tiles as light as feathers? Finally, why are Crickets being portrayed as having trouble making roadblocks for Holly's talent? These inaccuracies should be shown on their faces for all the films that claim to be "The Holly Holly Story." However, Busey will make sure that the person whose death ultimately led to this day, when the music died.
