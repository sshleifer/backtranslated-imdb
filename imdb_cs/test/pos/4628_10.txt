It was ravishing. I couldn't turn away. As the film rolled, I began to feel it was powerful and confronted, but I didn't know how much it would have. The film gives a look at what is unfortunately a daily life for many school children. Some of us live outside this environment and walk and don't know what's going on. <br /> <br /> Parents need to see this movie separately just to see what their kids are going through. Often a parent rejects his children as trivial, but unfortunately they are massive to college. And unfortunately, problems can escalate into tragedy. He must definitely see everyone.
