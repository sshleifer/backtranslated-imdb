I saw it at Friday's BendFilm festival amidst the dissatisfied crowd who was not helped by the bad decision of the event planners who chose a totally inappropriate short film that preceded the film. And it really threw the audience when Modern Love came after the light, moody short (the name I forgot). <br /> <br /> People !!! It was really stupid to mix this short with Modern Love - which is a serious dramatic film. Film film. So viewers get a show that's comedy and then ... Modern Love. Hmmmm. Modern love, despite my reservations (weird ending, a little too tangential) needed a short film that was commensurate with its weirdness, so my advice to programmers next year is to pay more attention to show planning. People watching Modern Love really didn't know what hit them - they were led along the way and that's not their fault. Modern love has some outstanding performances that play well against the tangential meanders of film - a film that seems to have been "thought out loud" by the creator, rather than executed in the normal way when a movie is written and filmed . Too bad an audience was poorly informed. Wrong location, bad short movie, bad attitude of well-intentioned programmers who, despite good efforts, need to see many more movies and travel to other festivals.
