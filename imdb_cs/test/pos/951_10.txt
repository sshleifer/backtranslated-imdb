if at not see Vijay in "Ghillli", "Gilly" or "Ghillie". look at that. Wow. its devastating hilarious. I don't know if Dharani (the brilliant director) was serious or not. There are tons of hot guys in this one, watch out for someone who calls Velu "Maacha". The one with brilliant braids, devastatingly hot. His teeth are also brilliant. Vijay Rocks. Trisha cries every 5 seconds. It's very deep. Watch it, you won't regret it. There are some great laughs in this. If you don't speak Tamil, learn it. Then you get all the inner jokes. It is one for the whole family, except perhaps the violent bits. I've seen this movie about eleven times ... and I'm counting. <br /> <br /> Wow!
