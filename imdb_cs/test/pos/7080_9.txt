"One True Thing" is a very quiet movie that opened in the fall of 1998 to glowing reviews, but a slight cashier. This tells the crippled story of Ellen (Renee Zellweger), a workaholic who is forced to return home to take care of her terminally ill mother (Meryl Streep) so that her father (William Hurt) can run her academic department. These terms are general only. The power of "One True Thing" lies in the way actors elevated their characters over Hollywood clich√©s. Streep is Kate, a perfect housewife whose ability to illuminate the room with her charm is evident in her opening scenes at Costume Party celebrating Hurt's birthday. But Ellen has never been close to her mother, and since she graduated from Harvard University, she has a certain will about her - Ellen almost thinks her mother is a simplistic airhead. On the other hand, he admires his father who shares a special passion: Writing. Ellen writes for an aggressive New York business and is almost broken heart when her last piece is destroyed by Hurt, who seems to be a very lonely character. When Kate gets into a situation where she is sick, Ellen's perspective is changing, and she is approaching her mother and more distant to her father. Hurt still makes excuses not to be there when the family needs him the most, and Ellen assumes he has an affair. Meanwhile, she gave up her desk at work to spend time with craft activities with her mother's "cult" group and also learned that her mother was not as weak as she had first thought. Too Much, "One True Thing" is a masterpiece in the character studio. Streep again in a beautiful performance, this time working at a subtle level that begins slowly, but ends in a brilliant speech on the promises of marriage. Streep earned her eleventh Oscar nomination for this performance. Pain is also convincing as a father who has a secret that is not revealed until the final moments. It's Renee Zellweger who steals this movie. Forget "Chicago", "Cold Mountain", "Bridget Jones's Diary" or anything you've seen her do and rent this movie. It's remarkable. Zellweger works in the bitter grudge of his character with the understanding of her parents and manages a realistic depiction of a young woman who struggles to keep her lips while she screams inside.
