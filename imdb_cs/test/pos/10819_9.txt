First, the word of caution. The DVD box describes this film as a comedy. I don't think it would be the intention of someone to be linked to a film other than some marketing morons. While in places it is light and a little funny, it is NOT a comedy and if you expect to be disappointed. I've never heard of this movie and I had no expectations at all. other. Since the other two DVDs I picked up were very disappointing, I was happy to see this movie. Playing, writing and direction were excellent. The story itself captivated me, because you usually don't see the films of the last month of France before the 1940 Nazi takeover. Along the way, there are plots involving selfish and weak actress played very well by Isabelle Adjani - who looks amazing after all those years. He kills a former lover and then finds a bad sap to get in the fall. This sap escapes from prison and finds her - with another lover - a high government official and a weasel played by Gerard Depardieu. In addition, there is a subplot about a Jewish physicist trying to smuggle deuterium out of the country, and eventually it becomes the main plot. The story has a lot of nice twists, a light sense of humor (without being a comedy) and some real thrilling moments. Together they will create a nice package that will surely please.
