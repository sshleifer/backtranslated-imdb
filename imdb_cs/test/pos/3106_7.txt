On their way to a country house to hear a new play that theatrical producers, his secretary and playwright, read, they ended up in the mud. They get to a nearby house just to end up in a playwright fianc√© house. If you cannot estimate that murder and chaos will take place, then you have not paid attention. This is a good entry into the old dark house genre. Not only does it have a good mystery, but also some very funny that roam in it. The cast is excellent and more than willing to have fun with what is good material. I'd like to say it's one of the best genres. It was supposed to be, but for me something happened on the way that reduced my rating to just seven out of ten. I can't tell you what it is, but definitely the same. Perhaps its meaning that I knew where it went almost from the beginning, or maybe something else, I'm not sure what, but there was something I couldn't shake that I liked this movie, even when i wanted to love it. It just missed being great and somehow fell short. That said I was doing SEGGEST YOU SEE IT. After all, it is a very funny movie that is full of fun, even if it is missing great.
