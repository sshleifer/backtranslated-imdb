My family is watching this movie over and over again. Even our 3-year-old loves. I like "goodness" in the movie. Giving a foreigner a chance ... to show good will to one apparently need some unconditional acceptance. The film gives a sense of goodwill and victory. Another aspect of the film that makes it so attractive is the personality of the Velveta siblings. Bird lover. Lover of mistakes. Boy Lover! Very cute and happy movie. But there is one thing that is unpleasant about it. So Mrs Brown often makes Mr Brown stupid or unreasonable. Sometimes he learns about it all, and he is ugly he is not. Too bad it's a nice story. However, we will continue to enjoy this wonderful, old movie!
