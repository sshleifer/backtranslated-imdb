LIGHTS OF NEW YORK was the first "feature-length" feature film that appeared in a sharp 57-minute directing directed by Bryan Foy (the famous vaudeville family). The story has two barbers' dopey (Cullen Landis, Eugene Palette) craving for a "big city life" and joining gangsters and divine booze. One of the guys is framed for murdering a cop, but at the last minute he's in a gun (Gladys Brockwell). Much of the story takes place in The Night Hawk's nightclub, which is run by a swindler named Hawk (Wheeler Oakman) who has his eye on the pretty chorine (Helene Costello) who is a girlfriend of Landis. Costello gets a short dance and we hear Harry Downing (to resemble Ted Lewis) sing "U Dawning" in his best Al Jolson style. Acting ranges from good (Palette and Brockwell)) to horrible (Oakman), a few actors are running their lines, but then sticking to the scene, as mentioned elsewhere, it was supposed to be short 2- reel and was made on a cord budget. Surprisingly well, all voices are clearly registered and there is a neat film touch in the silhouette of death. The film was a boxing smash, though it was shown as a silent film where theaters were not. New Sound Technology Cable No one expected this small movie to reach an unbelievable $ 1.3 million, which shortly costello and landis, and Palette was definitely a long-time star actor. Co-stars include Mary Carr as a mother, Robert Elliott as a detective, Eddie Kane as a street policeman and Tom Dugan as a robber.
