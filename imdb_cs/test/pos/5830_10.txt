I admit that I almost gave up watching TV shows. Why? Because most of them involve doctors, judges, or some girl / boy who can predict murder by sitting on the toilet. But I have to say that I was wrong when I watched the first Oz episode, one of the most prominent shows on TV until now. Oz is a show about maximum safe prison and shows episodes in the life of every cell - a friend inside a prison and their frustration. At this show I like that she has the courage to show real life in prison without unpleasant characters, stereotypes and unrealistic dialogues. Even if the characters in the show are not supposed to be heroes, they quickly joined them and their lives. Sure, this show is a lot of violence and some disturbing notions of rape and drug use, but that's the reason for this show; Imagine how brutal and frustrating life in prison can be ... damn, you can't show life in jail as a "clean environment" with "sympathetic characters", right? Oz is perfect in every way, the actors do a great job, and the whole hour of the show is really really fast. The only thing I didn't like about this show was the last season of the show, I think it was too strange and brutal and the final wasn't satisfying. But overall, Oz is still my favorite TV show, overcoming sopranos and millions of CSI and dr. A brilliant show that has balls to show what other shows are taking away from us; realism.
