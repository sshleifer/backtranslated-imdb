This documentary is the most hypnotic movie I've seen in a long time. I had to have it all day. The selected material, which is part of the piece flow, develops well and develops three characters that cannot be forgotten. The different layers of these people peel off and create a strangely moving film about perseverance, loyalty, and determination. These characters are surprisingly fascinating and the film is unforgettable.
