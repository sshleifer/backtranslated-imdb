'Hitch' is a nice surprise: a romantic comedy that actually has romance and comedy. Most romantic comedies range from mediocre to horrible because they're neither funny nor romantic. 'Hitch' takes actors like Will Smith, Kevin James and Eva Mendes into a fun, easy way that actually laughed at me and yes, a little "aww how sweet!" Meet Alex Hitchens (Will Smith), aka Hitch. It's a self-appointed 'Date Doctor'; helps hopeless guys like Albert (Kevin James) win boys like Allegra (Amber Valletta). Unfortunately, Hitch has to deal with Sarah (Eva Mendes), holding a gossip about breaking a data doctor ... <br /> <br /> 'Hitch' is actually quite funny, and it even makes the standard slapstick scene work simply because The cast is so energetic and clearly entertains. I have to wonder why Will Smith didn't do more movies like this. His sharp, quick fire is perfect for this genre and his chemistry with Mendes and James is amazing. James is a real discovery; I've never seen his 'King of Queens' show, but he's funny and honest and proves once again that fat white men can't dance hip-hop (Smith's reactions to his experiments are fun). Mendes is hot and bouncing (not so, geez) as Smith's perfect match, and Amber Valletta is sweet as Allegra. 'Hitch' is not perfect; it is too long a time and things are coming to an end too (although it is redeemed with a happy ending with a funny dance). But it is a great addition to the romantic comedies that keep throwing theaters.
