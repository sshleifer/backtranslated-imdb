Every Saturday morning at 11 am I watched Superstars. At that time, all the biggest events took place at this exhibition. The Sunday morning's challenge was also decent, but all things happened at this show. Wrestlers would do all their conversations with Mean Gene on a platform next to a live crowd or talk to the screen themselves in front of the background that promoted them. The matches were usually squashes, but sometimes you would see 2 middle karters square off in the main event. There were also interviews that usually resulted in violence, creating a dispute. These segments ranged from Pipers Pit, The Body Shop, The Flower Shop, The Snake Pit, The Love Love Show, The Funeral Parlor, and The Barber Shop. I don't remember any titles changing in this show. This usually happened when paying for views and in the Saturday nights main event.
