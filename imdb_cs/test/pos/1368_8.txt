Man, I can't believe I'm getting very cruel and negative comments on this movie. Okay, it's definitely not a sophisticated movie art work. But it's a lot of fun fun fun. For beginners, the titular supernatural killer, headed by a pumpkin, must be one of the most ridiculously stupid and incomprehensible things that have ever hit the camera; it looks like something you would see in the fourth carnival box. Secondly, the moderate gore is ridiculously false and unconvincing, with a clear highlight when this annoying, anxious, ultra-conservative woman gets an electric shock toaster. Then there is always a welcome presence of always beautiful Linnea Quigley, which is remarkably presented with a nice, long, totally gratuitous shower that continues for two minutes. Surprisingly, we also have performances of deceased schlock pictures of legend John Carradine as an evil warrior and Cameron Mitchell as a horror TV show host. In addition, screaming queens Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith have fleeting portraits. Leading Child Actor Ryan Latshaw designs all the spells and acting abilities of a moldy old tree stump. Pretty brunette Rachel Carter jumps up and reveals her cute breasts. Cruddy special effects are definitely less than special. The score is appropriately overloaded. Yet this film overall has certainly an appealing hockey attraction, which in turn makes this honey a real delectably cheesy hoot to watch.
