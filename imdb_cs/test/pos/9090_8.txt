Flatliners has all the elements of the good movie Joel Schumacher - intelligent, youthful characters, stunning cinematography, breathtaking stories and outstanding performances. It's escapist fun, but it's doing very well and resonating with a positive spiritual message despite a disturbing precedent. Schumacher has a talent for spotting talented young actors, and all five of the main players have gone to bigger things here (see cast list). Their believable performances help increase this film above average. Kiefer Sutherland shines in his egoist student role. The camera really stimulates the right side of the brain, which is what I love on Schumacher; its use of light and location creates images that are held. There is a disturbing nightmare that disturbs you when you watch a movie and haunts you when you go to bed. It reminded me of The Lost Boys. It is a movie that has an amazing premise - curious students want to find out what's dead and follow it successfully into a scary, grasping story of redemption. One of the best Schumachers; highly recommended.
