A Girl Scout with Young Trails leads the great side of the pioneers along the BIG TRAIL to the West, with Indian attacks, natural disasters, and romantic complications that are part of the adventure. Raoul Walsh THE BIG TRAIL is an amazing movie, just as fun as over seven decades ago. With a very good acting performance and excellent production values, he will be known as the first Western Western epic. instantly impresses with the natural charm and masculine authority that heroes bring; Silence controls the film with attributes that would ever make it a huge star. Marguerite Churchill is as charming as the beautiful southern belle, which is slowly warming to the Duke's attention. The dialect of the El Brendel dialect is great fun when a Swedish immigrant troubles with a foolish mule and mother-in-law; his appearance in the scene signals the viewer laughter. It looks like Tyrone Power Sr., huge and repulsive, looks like a human grizzly bear, he's a wonderful villain. Slick cardsharp Ian Keith is a sophisticated badman. (His famous physical resemblance to John Gilbert is very evident here.) Silent film actor Tully Marshall is impressive as a noble old mountain man who helps drive a train car. Korpulent Russ Powell, as a friendly fur hunter, gives his voice a talent for making nonsensical sounds easy to use. Sharp-eyed film mavens notices Ward Bond as one of the Missouri settlers. Many modern viewers will be surprised that THE BIG TRAIL was shot in an early widescreen process called Grandeur. More than just his name, the picture looks amazing, with Walsh showing the mastery of new technology. Fills the screen, every part of it, with actions. Notice during the crowd scenes how busy they are doing real work that adds so much to the verisimility of these sequences. Walsh deserves great credit for being one of the first directors to use a wide screen. In addition, the film is blessedly freed from the back projection photo that spoils so many older films. It should also be pointed out that it is natural that the soundtrack sounds a bit primitive; the talks were still in the cradle. That Walsh was able to use the microphone at all, with most of the scenes shot from the door, is more kudos for him. Big TRAIL wasn't a cash register success. In 1930, William Haines' comedy was a big money creator and the public sought a prize other than intelligent Westerns. Most cast slipped into the unknown, including Wayne. It would not be until 1939 when John Ford rescued him in STAGECOACH, that John Wayne legend would begin in earnest. And despite its spectacular and wide-ranging vistas, it would be another 25 years for a wide screen to take Hollywood, mostly in response to the economic threat of television.
