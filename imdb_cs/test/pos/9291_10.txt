When you think of a brilliant Australian comedy, you don't think of a Skit show (Even though I'm quite partial to a piece of the 80's and 90's Full Frontal) or even sitcoms - you think of SATIRE! Something we Australians really know how to do well. (For example: Front Line, Micallef Program) We know how to get pi $$, and The Chaser War on Everything is a classic example of how to do it and how to do it really well. I've been a big fan of Chris Taylor and Craig Reucassela for a long time. I remember listening to them on the Triple J. Afternoon Show, and they were two of the funniest comedians around. Although I was sad when they left Triple J, I was thrilled to find out what they were investing so much time to leave, leave. (They did CNNNN and Triple J at the same time, so I thought this was something much bigger) And what a wonderful HILARIOUS show Chaser is. Biting political and social satire on it is best. I'm also glad to say that he recently got a much better time lapse than Friday night and was moved on Wednesday night right after Spicks and Specks. THANK YOU ABC !! Finally, I don't have a tape! :)
