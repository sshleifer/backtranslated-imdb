This is the last episode we deserve. At the end of last season, things remained in a "mood", which was hardly the wrap that this realistic series deserved. Although it wasn't a happy show, this series was always one that made you think (a rare thing on TV), and that's no exception. "Is death justified by reasoning?" "Are morals a reflection of society, or is society shaped by the morale that few people choose?" "What is death and can it exist?" All these questions, and more, are presented each week by writers of this show, and that is their final work. Gentle play, great writing, great camera, brilliant cut, clean direction. If you've seen the show and missed it when it first ran, then hold onto the copy in some way. If you've never followed the show when it ran, then it will stand on its own, but it can be hard going to try to keep up with who all the characters are and what they mention in their colorful past. For those of us who have been an avid viewer of the series in the last two seasons, it's very satisfying to watch.
