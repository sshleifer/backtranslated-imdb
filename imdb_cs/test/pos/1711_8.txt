If (as I just said in CARD), Keaton follows the tradition of a comic book that runs counter to the law, this Langdon Short (the last released before TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP) was based on another comic trick - he is married to a handy husband, and trying to get away for some secret two-timing dating. Laurel and Hardy did it in several movies, as did Fields and Chaplin. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with it - why do these characters always marry such ugly women? And there is an interesting sociological problem - why don't you find a female comic with female counterparts? I can't remember anything but the parody of Carol Burnett, where two angry members of two couples find they prefer someone to come back as well as they get (a kind of self-masochism but also assurance, that they are not married to a namby-pamba type). As for the fact that comedians marry pupils, I suppose they can imagine that they deserve what they deserve. Or yes? Ollie really deserves a woman who throws pots and dishes at him? Yeah, he went to the convent at SONS DESERT, who destroyed her plans, but wanted to get some private time - nothing indicates that he and Stan cheated on their wives. In fact, Mae Busch is busted because she lied to her when Stan collapsed and told his wife the truth. Here at the beginning Harry's wife (Alice Ward) spoke to her mother about keeping him under strict control. We see Harry in his work (that is Saturday morning and work ends at noon for the rest of the weekend - that was before the idea of ​​a five-day week, 40 hours a week of industrial work). He works in a foundry where he hits a red hot metal in shape (an earlier Langdon joke - it's a small, lightweight man, not a muscular type that would swing a hammer). He just misses his tram trying to give man light. He calls home to explain things to them and gets a decent member's bowl in two minutes late. On the way home, Harry meets his friend Steve (Vernon Dent), who met two nice, sweet girls who would like to have a date. Harry hesitates, but agrees to talk to the girl (he agrees to pay for hot-dogs for foursome - he has a 1926 silver half dollar in his pocket). But his plans seem derailed when his wife discovers her hidden "cache" of coins. He keeps him hidden under the carpet of the living room and finds it on the edge of the carpet. But his wife spies on him and confiscates everything. He later hears him talking to himself and scolding her. In contempt he gives him a dime and says he can treat his date on soda. But Harry has a second coin cache and dresses for the date - and goes out. He and Dent seem to be late, and Dent blames Harry, but Harry tries to explain to him: he produces two prostitutes. They get into a quarrel when Dent (wisely) says they are not the type of girls he would call "nice". Eventually the girls appear and the date begins. Soon, however, Harry is hiding in his seat when his wife rides in his roadster, and boyfriends turn around - angry at their two opponents. The short work works well and is fun and gives a better idea of ​​the personality that Harry Langdon has developed in his short star spirit as a comic master. He is constantly being put on others. He lacks a tram because some strangers are still asking for smoke and light, and eventually his stranger gets to his feet. Dear girl, who is Harry's date, she has a small dog who is chasing him. He rests between two cars that both start to leave and end up wrapped around the pole. It certainly proves that Langdon settled on the ground when he made his features. If only he could keep the complex whole out of these three first features.
