This film tells the stories of a few couples who are coping with life after World War II. Through many moving accounts, the audience learns how war has changed people, while their human spirit has continued to triumph. My favorite scene is where a young service man who has returned home as a double amputator (after losing both hands to his elbow) is sure he wouldn't be good for his pet who you want to marry him. His girlfriend just said she would help him with things he wouldn't be able to do, but that they would be fine with each other. This man, who is immersed in this true love, hugs his fianc√©e in tears. The scene where a service man asked for a bank loan is also the highlight. When initially rejected as "high risk", the higher ranking official exceeds that "you have fought for our country and kept us safe - that is good enough for me. Your loan is approved!" "Best Years of Our Lives" won 6 Oscars, including a special statuette for a disabled actor who showed us that life continues and will continue to be worth living, even with a severe handicap. This movie is a pleasure to watch over and over again. Real Classics! Highly recommended!
