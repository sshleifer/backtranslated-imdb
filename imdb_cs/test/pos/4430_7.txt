I rented this movie because it was a documentary and highly rated. Rather, it is a study of a Bastard son who is trying to find out who his biological father is than anything about architecture. More than anything else, the basic theme of the movie is that we have an eccentric, praised, maybe genius architect who has little regard for anything or anyone outside the profession. The film's tragedy is a broken family that has left. His mum-mum hit more than despised fans than irresponsible women who can only have negative results on their children. Nathaniel, the film's producer and son of Louis Khan, came across as quite stable and curious, if not bitter. Of course, the people they interviewed were more interested in talking about Ludwig Khan's buildings than his personal problems, but I found that the mix of topics was interesting. As for his buildings, I found that they are like abstract art - strange, non-practical and usually just appreciated by so-called critics.
