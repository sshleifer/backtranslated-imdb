Shooting and editing a movie is exceptional for a given period of time. Eisenstein builds on every scene of the film lead to a sailor rebellion and city massacre. Just as the film is the highlight of the film, it is also an example of socialist realism. 1925 The Soviet government actively used art, including film, as a means of spreading the message of revolution. Eisensteins' depiction of the rebellion on the Potempkin battleship offers the viewer insight into the message of the Soviet elite. Marxist theory and the perspectives of class struggle are demonstrated as sailors who represent oppressed workers and officers who represent the elite of society. Much of the film demonstrates the Communist Party's message and how the film was used as a tool of propaganda.
