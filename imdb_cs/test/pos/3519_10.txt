Just before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills after your spine every time you look at it! This movie has a lot of tension, great acting, very good work with the camera (nice work of Mr. Lieberman!), Which makes a very well done slasher! Although low on gore for the 80s, it still has an effect on you after it is over. The initial kill (machete over the crotch) looked so real! And the fist to death of my mouth stunned me! Overall I give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars! If you're looking for a gore-fest, don't look here. But if you want your back down, look at this. There are 6 deaths and you don't see one of them, but do you mean to think "how was she killed?" The stranded topic reminded me in 1977 of Hills Have Eyes, which followed the same concept, but in the desert with cannabis. But still slasher fans, give this forgotten gem, I promise you, you will be satisfied!
