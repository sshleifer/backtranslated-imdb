"Eighteen" (2004) tells the story of Pip Anders, a depressing and extremely cynical young man who is stolen from his broken upper / middle class and lives on the streets of Vancouver. On his 18th birthday, he receives a cassette and a player from his recently-deceased grandfather, relating to his monuments of his own 18th birthday, spent serving with the British army in France, trying to help a fatally injured comrade avoid capture by the occupying. The Germans. As Pip listens to the tape (Ian McKellen gave the voice of his grandfather), we see the scenes he describes as flashbacks, alternating with everyday scenes of Pip's life, as well as more recent flashbacks filling the dark secret why Pip went home and finds it impossible to trust everyone who is nice to him. Ambitious second film by writer / director Richard Bell ("Two Brothers"), with a polished look, great photo, well-developed non-stereotypical characters (with homosexuals and equals treated equally) and laudable effort in emotionally and physically demanding roles from some talented new actors (especially Paul Anthony as Pip and Brendan Fletcher as his grandfather at 18). There is also a notable turn of Alan Cummings as a priest who tried to help Pip, and a small supporting role played by Theo Gill ("Queer Like Folk"). A comprehensive story - in the director's own words in his commentary on the DVD - is designed to move the "faith of emotion" that pushes Pip to its breaking point, and it certainly does. My only criticism is that the overall effect is too "schmaltzy" or artificial for viewers to truly identify, most of the support dialogue (and end) too fictitious and predictable, and the direction needed to sharpen the sloppy overclocking of some scene. I recommend, 7 stars out of 10, including extra points for a remarkable effort.
