I did it too. When I first saw the band, I immediately released them without listening to music. One day I bought a CD out of sheer curiosity and fell in love with it. So I bought the video. Keep your lunch kids, it's not going to be nice! the video was great - a great opportunity to hear music, see some of the promo videos and meet the band ... though I still don't know how they can cope with masks all the time! a necessity for all fans of the band and fans of alternative music in general
