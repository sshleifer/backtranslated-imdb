I like many others who saw it as a child and I loved it and scared me to adulthood, I tried to find this movie and even once I was looking for it to be able to play on TV again because it was originally played on the US . Does anyone know where to buy this movie or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me? Does anyone also know if there's a chance he'll be playing on TV again? Maybe all of us fans should write a station in the hope of returning it. I don't think they would have promoted this movie in the past because no one knows about it, people only know Stepford's wives and Stepford's husband's films. No one is familiar with the fact that there is a children's version. Maybe they should also do this because they seem to do that much lately with lots of my favorite old thriller / horror flicks. If anyone has any input, please, please, write me with information. Thanks Taira tcampo23@aol.com
