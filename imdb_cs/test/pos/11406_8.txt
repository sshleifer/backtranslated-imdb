People say this movie is a "typical teen horror movie" ... but it's a horror movie with a teen girl in it .. what do you expect! It's a good movie, I counted 3 real shouts in the audience while the movie was on and it was a very nervous scary movie. I wasn't bored in the movie at any time, and I was even at the edge of my seat in one place. All that was a little bad was that it was a little slow in getting into the real story, but it all led to why it was where it was and why it happened. The behavior was good, the scenery was good and the story was good too, I hope to see "When it's a strange call 2" in a few months! A good movie!
