An extremely entertaining comedy will set off for John Travolta's great performance. His interpretation of the Archangel is like shabby, feminine, overweight, ladies. And she certainly has a fascinating effect on the women she meets on her way to Chicago. John Hurt is a very low key in his role as a major reporter for the Chicago Tabloid owner, Bob Hoskins. Angie MacDowell plays a role much as she did her role in "Four Weddings and Funeral." Maureen Stapleton is elegant in portrait. Her commentary, "Michael doesn't have fools," is just one of many unforgettable moments. Bob Hoskins is the only leading player not to join, a little off the wall. Especially you are there to see Michael marrying a bull, fascinating waitresses and dancers in a Western-style restaurant and fully demonstrating that he is a complete free soul. It's an unforgettable comedy that is worth more than one viewing.
