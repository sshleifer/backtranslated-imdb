This is a solid underrated little thriller that has excitement-lots, with a cool story, Sandra Bullock is amazing!. All the characters are great and I was surprised how unpredictable it was because there were only a few predictable moments, plus Sandra Bullock is just amazing in this!. Jeremy Northam played an amazing villain, and I know what Bullock's character is, 'cause I'm something of a kind of man (barely ever going out), and it's pretty well done and written for the most part. . In my opinion, this should be higher than 5.5 plus Denis Miller was surprisingly better than expected in his small role. The scene where Northam terrorizes Bullock on his ship was pretty exciting, and it was one of my favorite moments, and I also liked the carnival chase scene, and I also liked the ending because it was pretty good even though I did that Northam was defeated too fast. There are also plenty of other scenes with a good chase, and it is also clever at times too, plus there are quite a few shocking moments anyway, This is a solid underrated little thriller that has the excitement and a lot, with a cool story, Sandra Bullock is amazing, warmly I recommend this!. The direction is great! Irwin Winkler is doing great! working with a great camera, adding a good atmosphere, good angles and keeping the movie at a very fast pace. Acting is fantastic! Sandra Bullock is amazing as always and she is amazing, she is extremely likeable, hard as nails but still very vulnerable, and I could feel for her because, as I said, I am something like Angela, I hardly ever go out, I really do enjoyed her work in this movie! (Bullock rules !!!!!!!). Jeremy Northam is excellent as a villain, he was sneaky, unpredictable and menacing, he was great. Dennis Miller is surprisingly fine and uncomfortable in his little role, and has managed to bring some comical relief. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall I highly recommend this!. *** 1/2 of 5
