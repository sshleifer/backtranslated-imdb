I heard about "playing" and "Dungeons and Dragons" before, but I had the idea that it could be like what I saw in "Gamers: Dorkness Rising." These guys are so fun and fun to watch. In particular, a guy playing "bard" or "minstrel" or anything has a gift for physical comedy and timing. There is so much background of humor and energy in some scenes that you really think at least some of them have been improvised there on the scene. Special effects had to be processed a bit, but I saw it at last year's congress, and that's one of the things they said they were going to rework and improve, so it's probably bad!
