I was charmed by the debut of Niami. I hope to see more of his work soon. I was fortunate enough to capture the film during his short NYC run, which struck me as a worthy successor to such a central 80's as desperate for Susan and After Hours, but with a fine European whimsey making it fresh and fun . A strong set of cast playing mostly against the type was a pleasure. And I thought that the intricate inter-threaded plots were fine. Sandra Bernhard puts her best performance from the King of Comedy, while Peter Stormare is cheerful, and Ling Bai touches. You see it.
