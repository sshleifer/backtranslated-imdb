The "North & South" television mini-series is until the '80s, what "Rich Man, Poor Man" (the first ever mini-TV series) was until the 1970s. It's a wonderful adaptation of the first classic trilogy novel by John Jakes. The story itself covers two decades that led to the election of President Abraham Lincoln and the impending declaration of civil war - north versus south. Intertwined stories develop around the Hazard families ("North" in the title) and Mains and their two central characters George and Orry who form a friendship while embarking on their West Point training in 1842. "North & South "is a beautiful historical timeline and, as I get older (and wiser!), I am very interested to learn about conflicting attitudes to such controversial aspects, such as" slavery "and" abolitionists ", and how these attitudes came about. The series also speaks of some great evolution of characterization as we meet friends and enemies in the lives of George and Orry, as well as women who stole their hearts as young men. This aspect of the story also reveals a romantic story that is set to the stormy background of the American Civil War. "North and South", along with "Rich Man, Poor Man" is overshadowed by 1977's "Roots" as the largest mini-series of all time. However, it comes close to second / third and also shares the same kind of timeline and themes as "roots". But don't get away, even if it's just to see great scenery, costumes and a brilliant all-star cast including Gene Kelly, Johnny Cash, Elizabeth Taylor, James Stewart, Olivia De Havilland, Lesley-Anne Down et al. The series is beautifully crafted and tied to real historical events, and it is a pity that Emmy and the Golden Globes did not honor much more actors and actresses for their portrayals. Patrick Swayze and James Read, two virtual unknown actors at the time, are turning into impressive performances like Orry Main and George Hazard. However, this is Kirstie Alley's riveting performance as George 'Abolitionist' sister Virgilia, who steals the show many times. In addition, Terri Garber, David Carradine and Philip Casnoff as Elkanah Bent are excellent villains of this piece that you just love to hate. <br /> <br /> "North & South" Books 1 and 2 are now available on two DVD sets.
