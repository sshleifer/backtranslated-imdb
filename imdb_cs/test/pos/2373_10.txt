I love these movies. Blood, revenge, lots of action, very dark, cheese and more. But this doesn't give the genre you might expect. When I first saw Kite Birds and Ichi The Killer, I enjoyed watching you, but why not? Dead or Alive: The final is a decent anime and its not hardcore and don't expect nudity in this movie. Nor was the drama that good. Well, I don't want to spoil the movie or the plot. But I felt that Dead or Alive: Final was a little stupid. So, no more. I do not recommend this movie to everyone but I recommend it for people who love a decent and well-managed anime.
