I always felt that Mrs. Merkerson never got a role to match her abilities. She knew millions as lieutenant of law and order, she was seen in many theatrical releases, always in a supporting role. Lackawanna Blues HBO is changing and allowing this talented actress to shine like Nanny, a successful businesswoman in a world that is changing from segregation to integration. But the story is about a diverse range of characters he and his adoptive son meet at a guesthouse in Lackawanna, New York, a suburb of Buffalo. -American community of the 1950s and 1960s from Atlanta Sweet Auburn to Harlem, New York. However, the angle of segregation and integration is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of people at Nanny. The story revolves around Nanny's relationships with all kinds of people that some of the best actors in the industry play (I didn't say black actors deliberately - this set is a staggering amount of talent that is black, except for Jimmy Smits) Of course, I recommend this movie as fun and colorful view of last day.
