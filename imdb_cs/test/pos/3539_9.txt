When I read another note about this amazing piece of TV drama, I was forced to balance things a little. If you like murder, be signature and serial, and your cops be British, and shout a lot, and gore be bloody and have a religious angle then it hits every button. It's not enough "gov'ing to scream at Sweeney's rare heights, but otherwise highly rated. Ken Stott is excellent as a "cop on the edge" and guest stars are also well occupied, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended. (In response to earlier comments, although I agree that "red" wouldn't "routinely" turn away from a stroke and run, he was just witnessing his brother being arrested for murder, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't see the boy in motion. .)
