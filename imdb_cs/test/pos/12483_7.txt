This movie is so lovingly that you want to be a part of it forever. The blinkers are straight, but not without malice, the goods are transparent and the criminals hardly exist. Even "cabaret" is so naive that it makes you dream with nostalgia compared to anything available on TV. Blier is fine if it's a little double-sided. Louis Jouvet is perfect, you just can't have better copper. She has the best line: "My dad cleansed the dirt of other people and I do the same". Susy Delair is unbearable, but I think some of it is songs, a wardrobe and a hairstyle. Simone Renant, on the other hand, makes a great femme fatale if she is a little quiet. I didn't realize it could be a lesbian as an IMDb user dbdumonteil and others rightly suggest.
