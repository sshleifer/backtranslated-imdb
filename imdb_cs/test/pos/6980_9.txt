I have seen the director's version and can be nothing but content. Great acting performance (especially Cole Hauser, I was sad because of the little space for Claudia Black), subtle visual effects and photography in a totally believable plot (with respect to the genre) without many logical holes, really unpredictable twists, building. characters. These are the biggest benefits of the movie. Combined with style - some may consider this film a B-grade effort, but I wouldn't agree with that. The whole thing is really very original and stylish. And while I'm not a fan of Vin Diesel, Riddick's hard part suited him. I can't wait for the Chronicles of Riddick, it's really cool that this movie will continue ... <br /> <br /> 9/10 if you ask me
