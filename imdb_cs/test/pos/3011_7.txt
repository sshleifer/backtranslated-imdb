I had no expectations when I started watching this movie. How I was surprised! This is a great, beautiful, twisted movie that will give your mind a good job! It's not easy. If you only like police academy style, no-brain movies, it's not for you. The cell is a deep, comprehensive film with the influences of films like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with lots of completely new ideas. A wonderful, twisted environment, good gameplay and a convincing story make it one of the best movies I've seen for a long time! Be open and you will love it!
