eXistenZ was a good movie, at first I was wondering what was going on, organic "pods" made of mutant reptiles that linked you and the other players with the surreal virtual reality over the umbilical cord. But once he gets his pretty good movie, with a few big open-ended twists and a good aspect of weridness throughout the movie, it's too much to see how unsure of what's coming next. br /> <br /> Security workers drop metal detectors; they have bone weapons!
