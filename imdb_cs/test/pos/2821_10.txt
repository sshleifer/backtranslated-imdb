I shot this movie. I'm very proud of the film. It was a great experience to appear on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who has a vision and was able to capture the film exactly as we imagined it in the film. The kits are amazing and well designed for every character. John York and his team built sets that fit not only the characters, but also worked well in making the film, allowing us to move smoothly across the walls and from one set to the next. Each character has an amazing arc, which is a great story. I feel that all the actors have done excellent performances. I disagree with some other remarks that say that the negotiations were not good. Watch it and decide for yourself.
