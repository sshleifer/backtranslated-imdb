The book is better than the film mainly thanks to the writer Ondatje's prose. Before I saw this movie, someone who saw it told me that the love described in this movie is not real. After seeing this film, I can see how her forgiveness of the unbelievers in this regard could disturb other moviegoers. Frankly, some of the intense expressions of love were ridiculous and seem to be on the edge of a parody. But in the end everyone should realize that this is a great message of art. It is not specifically about love at all, it uses "love" to dialectically reveal human divisions or any boundaries of countries that help to war and hate. It is a misunderstanding and a blind follow of things that are supposed to separate us. The critical scene for the real theme of this film is when a hero or antihero plea for help for his stuck lover in the desert is ignored and neglected for the reasons shown in that scene. This film is also about hope and forgiveness, hope embodied in the interracial relationship between Binoche's recuperative character and Indian minesweeper (reflected in the Sikh buddy-mate relationship with his white coworker who ends up dying absurdly) and the forgiveness symbolized in Caravaggio's character is the first Hunting and then forcing what he thinks will be a hero confession for his war "crimes" (treachery of the country). I think the movie could be even better than it is. I do not know whether a more realistic picture of the circumstances of love would be even more obvious or not, but I agree that this film is not about realistic romantic love, because people behind it Artwork or film in the early scene mean that the final lovers will meet for the first time. The hero talks about how a new car, a broken car, a fast car, etc. (I'm paraphrase), still just a car, no matter what adjective you built it. It answers, but parental love, platonic love, romantic love, etc. They are very different kinds of love. This is irony because this film is really about one love that people should want, which is love (or for) peace (not materialistic things that are usually the real reasons for wars that are embodied in what most of us want , such as cars). Otherwise, we may be trapped to die in a cave in a vast desert with old mural art / swimmers' drawings, suggesting that the sea and the life-supporting waters that once existed have disappeared. Oscar, because these great messages were not specifically about his portrayal of romantic love, the prizes tend to go like this, the relationship between hero and heroine was necessary for the audience to get inside, unfortunately this view of love may be outdated at the age of divorce and so many singles who can't seem to meet on so many levels, so ridiculous versions of the myth of Love are hard to get in, even in dreams that film love has always been, especially in good old Hollywood. 7 out of 10 movies worth seeing, no matter what.
