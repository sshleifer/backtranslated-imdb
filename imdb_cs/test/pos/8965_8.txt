... with one act. Charlie Wilson, congressman, real character. During the 1990s, when communism on the USSR, the walls of Berlin and the war with Afghanistan (with the Soviets) broke through. He did it, one denial for money, and everything went down. He should be remembered, so here he is. His memorial. Back to the movie. Funny, dramatic, snob, political or just boring. Incidentally, it is a clever film about political life, about world governance and above all about the world. Lessons for every policy, a critical view of countries that support wars with money, weapons and words. Lesson Learned - World is not a nice place to live
