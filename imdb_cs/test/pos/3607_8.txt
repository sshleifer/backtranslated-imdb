Captain Corelli's mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's better films. As a title character, she changes the subtle performance. This is a romantic set against the background of a worn torn island. John Hurt's character gives his daughter, played Penelope Cruz beautifully, some sincere advice about love. This film is not mistaken for being completely predictable. This film also allows Cruz to turn to the show as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. Once the movie warms up behind the opening sequence, this movie focuses on you. Nicolas Cage did not disappoint again.
