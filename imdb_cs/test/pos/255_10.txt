In the 18th MS Team there are two promising romantics from different sides of the conflict. Aina, an officer of Zeon, and Shiro, a new pilot of the Federal Forces, meet in battle in space, during 12 episode series (and one "movie") in which two discuss their love of each other while trying to cope with war that surrounds them. It features Romeo and Juliet and unrivaled animation. By far one of the best hit American Shores. Suit Up!
