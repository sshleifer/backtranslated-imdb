Motorama viewers should already be interested in other offbeat movies in the desert, such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (which are more or less in the desert). He also models some of the bizarre humors (and especially the eccentric tracks of the characters) of the comedy Josef Minion "After Hours". In a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, Gus (played well by Christopher Christopher Michael), a clever 10 year old boy in cash in his piggy bank, steals a Mustang, and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents. It starts as a way of salvation (which is evident in the scenes with John Diehl), but as soon as he becomes addicted to a scratch game called Motorama, he becomes easily tempted by temptation and loses his childish innocence. He travels from one crazy fictional state to another way to get Motorama cards out of participating petrol stations, just to explain the MOTORAMA price and get a $ 500 million cash prize. Along the way, he meets dozens of strange characters like Flea, who plays a big strung busboy, Meatloaf, who plays a crazy cyclist, and Mary Woronov and Sandy Baron (regular Seinfeld) as two violent hijackers. The DVD recorder can be very deceptive, as well as previous attempts to sell this film on a non-cultural market first with brands comparing it to Alone and Thelma & Louise. The latest name is a love story with a slogan that suggests that the movie is about Jordan Michael Christopher on an adventure where he meets a girl of his dreams ... which, despite the size of her DVD cover, is just 1 second portrait of Drew Barrymore as a fantasy girl that Gus dreams of. Why didn't they just trade for what it was? I thought it might seem absolutely bizarre at first glance, it's a well-designed story. <br /> <br /> Motorama is a great material for fans of b-grade strange comedies. This was quite an interesting story, especially thanks to the strength of his lead actor - Jordan Michael Christopher (who unfortunately has several other screen credits) - and a clever metaphor of conspiracy. Hopefully, releasing it on DVD will make it easier to find cult fans.
