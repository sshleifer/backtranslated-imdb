"Nobi" or "Fires On the Plain" is a film that is so excellent on so many levels that not enough good things can be said about it. I'm only sorry that I didn't see this 1959 movie before. Being a film purist, I tend to look at films for their artistic merits based on dialogue, acting, photography, and even effort to stay faithful to costume. Finally, I want to know if the film is "true" to reveal the human condition to think of me without oppressing me with what the director wants me to think. <br /> <br /> "Plays on the Plane" A great movie because it artistically handles a portrait filled with realistic human reactions to the dying fires of a great historical disaster. Ichikawa's film is a condemnation of war at all levels - how should any good war film be. War is frightening, bloody, destructive. It is also murderous to the psyche. But what is essential for "Fires on the Plane" is his selfless look at Japanese soldiers. It shows them that it will slowly collapse under the weight of the superior American firepower and their country's inability to wage their own war. Fatalistic code encouraging death before surrender is at the heart of this madness. I was amazed to see such a sincere and brutally close look at the bitter fruit of the Japanese military disaster that was done just 14 years after the end. what the Japanese call the "Great Pacific War." Ichikawa, reveals what the Germans called "war life", a difficult situation for a common soldier. Ichikawa's film is interesting because even today, Japan has its own fanaticism of war. , his conquering the conquered peoples, the racism of his war against the Chinese, and the war crimes that included cannibalism of soldiers and officers practiced not only against each other, but against Allied prisoners of war. Ichikawa produces a strong representation of victimization of soldiers by combining bad political decisions and cultural pressures. This sharp exploration is skillfully done by portraying condemned soldiers as human beings who, at different times, show fear, brilliantly. a laconic humor, a dialogue enriched with his sparseness, and a conspiracy whose complexity is neglected by a grim, wilderness setting. Ichikawa's portrait is a ragged and painful tapestry of slaughtered men. Tubercular Tamura, played as woebegone and the subtle soul of Eiji Funakoshi, is a good soldier who cannot leave his humanity, though he is as frightened and lost as his comrades. Before going to a hospital that rejects him as too healthy, Tamura gets a hand grenade from a superior who acknowledges the hopelessness of his situation and recommends Tamura to kill himself. Why Tamura is a hopelessly ill - delivered and militarily incapacitated unit was not ordered to surrender at the beginning of the movie. Ichikawa makes it clear that the war is over and everyone is just waiting for death. When Tamura leaves her unit for her hopeless search for physical and spiritual salvation, she sees her comrades unnecessarily digging refuge. They look like corpses that look up from their own mass grave. Later we look at how the overworked medical staff of the hospital is leaving dying patients for a versatile American artillery fire. Poor patients crawling out of their huts in a futile attempt to survive look like pathetic, serpentine creatures that stretch from omnipotent power. You know they won't survive. Ichikawa makes it clear that the only thing worse than the defeated army is the one that has lost its honor by abandoning its humanity and its comrades. As Tamura falls through the jungles of Leyte, we encounter a noble, dying and exploitative. Cannibalism keeps its ugly head when soldiers start to eat rather than surrender to American "beef beef". When men talk about surrender, propaganda, as Americans kill prisoners, is opposed to the secular - a soldier who reveals that approaching Americans feed on and take care of prisoners because, unlike Japanese, respect brave soldiers who are forced to surrender. They are Japanese who intend to die for the Emperor long after the resistance has lost all importance. Those willing to fight will be killed. It's a war count. After shooting a murderous and cannibalistic comrade, whom he had previously offered his own body as food, fatalistic Tamura's careless surrender seems to be a deliberate form of suicide. His death is a solitary picture. Has Ichikawa tried to tell us about the inner conflict of an ordinary soldier who wants to live, but who is still trapped in his nation's suicidal cultural codes? If someone watches this movie closely, he or she will see that absolutism and fanaticism are the enemy. Americans are portrayed as technologically advanced people who are willing to use this technology in the form of a relentless military force - a lesson that has transformed Japan's postwar society. Ichikawa's film is not so shallow that it accuses America. Ichikawa accuses the sedimentary layers of Japan's destructive policies that created war, and then continued when everything was lost. Ichikawa does not mention nuclear weapons that fell on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. He doesn't. The slow destruction of the Imperial Japanese Army in the Philippines reveals the seeds of Japanese immolation.
