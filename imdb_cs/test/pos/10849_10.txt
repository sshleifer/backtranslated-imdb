When I rented this movie, I was half expecting it to be a low budget, less a Indy movie, but I thought I'd try. I started to watch Part 1 and couldn't pull myself to the end of 3 hours. It was by far one of my favorite movies of all time. From writing to directing to performances, I laughed, cried and sang until the Nan Astley ritual of innocence to adulthood. Rachael Stirling is phenomenal in this film. I have never heard of her before, but now I remember forever the vulnerability and strength I felt in her performance. She, Keeley Hawes and Jodhi May are incredible because they lead you through the emotional disturbances they most feel when dealing with an alternative form of sexuality. The fact that the film takes place in the 1890s not only educates the audience about homosexuality in this period, but also makes a statement about our society today. You have to see this movie and, probably like me, you'll make a trip to the store to add it to your collection.
