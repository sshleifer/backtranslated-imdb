I agree with Aussie's comments for the most part. However, there id seem to be quite a decent plot if unoriginal. Christina (Kelli McCarty) inherits a country estate that intends to open a mountain lodge. She gets reacquainted with Chip (Bobby Johnston) whom she knew when she grew up there. The story gets stronger when James (Paul Logan) comes up with his new stripper friend, Shene (Devinn Lane) because Christina has been a friend of James Stripper in recent years. To add interest to the film Sophia Linn (Monique Parent) romance novelist appears as a guest at the cottage, as well as Eric (Sebastien Guy) and Linda (Flower), a few lawyers from the city. James seduces a local building law inspector for Christine's job as one of his dirty tricks to shut her down. So the question is, "How far will James go to sabotage and succeed?" Watch Devinn Lane here and in "Beauty Betrayed". It seems to be moving from the heavy core to the "R" world. Another notable is Samantha McConnell, playing the role of "bait," clearly the most outrageous character name in the movies!
