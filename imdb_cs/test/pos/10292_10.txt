This sad romance is unpredictable because the director decides to break her narrative and offer insights into the characters. There are lots of flashbacks, re-filming the same scene. But it would be an extraordinary cinema moment to see all the fragments see the result! And it would be worth it because it's just one of the best French movies ever made for me! <br /> <br /> Has everything: <br /> <br /> Cast: Monica Bellucci's first steps and Vincent Cassel! Such a presence and such voices, even for the deaf! It's symbolic to fall in love with this movie! Directed by: his camera is bright, lively, plays with orchards or can be mysterious with a long detail "à la David Lynch". Cinematography: light is beautiful, between gold and rust like their love! Never seen before Paris: It's Parisian time more accurately, composed of many districts! Huge Search Here! It looks like Gotham City, modern and old at the same time! Music: Not a big orchestra, but in a perfect tune with frames. And the song of Charles Aznour made me discover this great singer! <br /> <br /> Ah, ?? story! As I said, this is a love story, but rather tragic: To say that love can be nothing for nothing that does not mean that all people are happy or are not guaranteed for a sweet end, it is great because this message is not often said! Love is a passion that is derived from Latin "pain". You can suffer a lot when you are in love! For why…, endless waiting, lack of courage, indecision. And when you can calm down, destiny, fate, god (?), the devil (?) can stab you in the back just because you arrive too early or too late, and above all because love means 2 in the world of billions! A lot of things can happen and as many stories can be written! What is love? I personally lived for a few moments like this: in a car with a precious one. Her mobile rings and you know it's her "special friend" she kisses goodbye (and not to you, even when we're always together). So you want to go out of this car to keep them together, not hear sweet but harsh words, but you can't, because just the amazing hard rain has just begun! I found that this film captures those moments of tragedy like no one else!
