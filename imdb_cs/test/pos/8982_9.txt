Mike Nichols at best. I wasn't a fan of "Closer", so it's refreshing to see him again upstairs with this comedy in the darkest conditions. A single slip in the tone could destroy this convincing image, but Nichols and his very strong A-sheet cast never made a bad trace of a deeply erroneous but convincing congressman in this biopsy. Philip Seymour Hoffman and the usual is scintillating and brilliant - here is the damaged but very clever CIA manipulator, and that is in exchanges between Hanks and Hoffman, where comedy is rising. Rarely does film humor laugh out loud and clever too ... This is from time to time with a biting satirical edge that makes you laugh and weep on the state of the world (often at the same time). Another significant plus is the length of the image. The film is based on George Crile's thick book of the same title. The temptation for screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (his claim to fame is "The West Wing") must have been a thick film, but what we get is a breathtaking 90-minute great story with extensive consequences. This film deserves to be seen and recognized for finding an extraordinary balance between the darkest dark theme and lightness touch it is a sparkling witty scenario - though it strikes an obvious connection between helping that Herring and Wilson provide and the ultimate consequences (9/11).
