Almost no information about this movie or its air data is available. After a continuous and exhaustive search I found out that DVD is available for 3.99! - Release date February 28, 2006. Try yahoo / DVD and video. To obtain this information, I will continue to say that it is a well-made film with a true and fascinating story about a mysterious carpenter who builds a very unusual staircase in the church. It's a chance to see William L. Peterson before C.S.I. he turned him into a star. Just as Barbara Hershey is honored in the story - does anyone remember Barbara Hershey's Seagull remember? I have to keep writing to send it. I thank former commentators for recommending this somewhat obscure TV movie, which, of course, leaves a lasting impression on many of them.
