Henry Thomas and Robin Tunny are some of the most valuable artists in the industry. It is beyond me why they have not received more recognition than they have. This film is a perfect example of how boundless their abilities are. Behavior of the lives of people who might be referred to as a little strange is their specialty, and if these characters aren't special, I'm in a loss to find someone who is. The story is humorous, romantic, dramatic, complicated and tragic. I hated the end, but if I didn't, I wouldn't like the story as a whole. So go there.
