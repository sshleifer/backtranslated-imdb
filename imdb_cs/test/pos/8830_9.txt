I first heard about this show in 2005, first online and then watching (and of course buying) a typically gorgeous BBC book. Then I got a DVD; did not disappoint! I had hoped for years that someone would do a science fiction program with an emphasis on the excitement of discoveries rather than extraterrestrials, fights with laser weapons, and other Hollywood tricks! Thank you, Joe Ahearne (also for your doctor who works, and the ultraviolet - mini-series, not the same name crap)! What made me write it now (2 years later) was that I saw SUNSHINE last night. And what seemed to be in the same family as SPACE ODYSSEY (about 2/3 of the way) Freddy Krueger meets 2010! That was when SPACE ODYSSEY really acted as a positive example of how to make a science fiction film; more science, less fiction! ODYSSEY (similar to SUNSHINE) also dealt with the shortcomings of astronauts (Zoe's unsuccessful EVA, Ivan's talent for Venus, sleep control missions) and the sheer danger of exploring new planets with unknown dangers (a deadly spike on Mars). Perhaps I would pay it if I saw it in a theater (I-Max, someone?). And above all, not only did the jaws look beautiful, but the figures were pretty. I found their interplay more realistic than the historical history of SUNSHINE Icarus 2 (Icarus; a silly name for a solar mission - has anyone read the mythology of Icarus?). Sometimes it takes a no-so-good movie to force one to re-watch a better movie. As an astronaut chair, I would trade every day at Icarus to sit on Pegasus every day. In all righteousness, however, SUNSHINE images are quite overwhelming, yet they are unforgettable. That's why I was so strongly rooted to succeed as a sci-fi film. While this review is almost a review of SUNSHINE, I hope it is read for what it should be; a strong support for the BBC's mobile phone, which will succeed where most large budgets, inflated movie glasses, fail. THE ODYSSEY SPACE (a.k.a. VOYAGE TO PLANETS here in the States) encourages a taste for solid, science fiction and brings banquet. I also loved the pseudo-documentary approach. When it comes to time lag / light speed, it is talked about when paying attention. Where SUNSHINE melts, ODYSSEY keeps its cold. If you are considering going to movies for another SUNSHINE dose, stay in; instead, make a real SPACE ODYSSEY!
