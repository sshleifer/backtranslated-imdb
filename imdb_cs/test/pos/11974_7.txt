I consider myself a fan of Dean Koontz; when I read a lot of his novels and everyone liked them, but unfortunately I never got to read Watchers, so I have no choice but to rate this film on my own merits, rather than comparing it to a book I didn't . read. I went to expect something horrible and when I didn't get a great horror movie exactly; I believe it's a fan of the book that evaluates it because, as a movie in its own right, Watchers is a fun and somewhat original little horror movie. Apparently, the story takes some influence from the Predator and begins with an explosion in a research lab. It's not long before a rancher is killed by a strange beast, and a friend of a dead man's daughter took the ultra-intelligent runaway dog. The secret government agency is soon on the way because murders continue. The boy is still fascinated by the intelligence of the dog, but somehow he is bound to murder and the agency is soon on his tail. The film's script was originally written by Paul Haggis. later denied her. I do not know why? writing here is not nearly as ridiculous as its hit 2004 Crash! The main reason why this movie works is undoubtedly a dog who, in addition to being rather cute, is also the best actor in the film. Corey Haim, the hot success of The Lost Boys' success is a human leader and in fact has a fairly good dog chemistry, though it's a bit ridiculous to see him talk most of the way through the movie. The plot is intricate and as such the film is more than a bit messy; but the ridiculous thing all pulls it out in more unpleasant moments. Michael Ironside also appears in the film and does well as "bad police" government agents. Of course, a monster is one of the most interesting things about the film, and the way it kills is always fun and bloody; although unfortunately we do not see much, and when we do it, it is rather disappointing - apparently the filmmakers saw Bigfoot and Hendersons! Yet this is the kind of film that can be easily enjoyed despite the numerous problems and I would recommend to any discreet spectator the horrors of the 1980s.
