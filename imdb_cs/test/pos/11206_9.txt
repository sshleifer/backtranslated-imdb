When you look at Distant, you know you're not looking at a French movie, there's a little sex and it's mostly elliptical and people don't talk too much, there's a few lines scattered here and there, and a few important talks just to give you a sense of what's happening. Nor does it look like an American, there are no car chases or shots or violence unless you consider killing a mouse as a blood act or a daily tension that would be caused by a muted disaster. The relatively long-term medium-term footage can sometimes remind you of a "contemplative" Asian cinema, but it just reminds you that the director does not do the radical minimalism of some Taiwanese filmmakers, but then it is not a Taiwanese film, it's a Turkish film. I don't know what that means, nor do I know if it means anything. The film does not have its own line, and yet the few lines that are somewhat long shot shots and often moderate tensions are gradually building a sense of what is happening, a sense of "conspiracy" for the lack of a better word that you grow. At the end of the film, you may feel that you will miss two cousins ​​who have a lot of things in common but are different from each other.
