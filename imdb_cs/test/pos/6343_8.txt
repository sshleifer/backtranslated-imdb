I had my reservations about watching the Return to Lonesome Dove after I saw and enjoyed the original so much. Without Tommy Lee Jones repeating his role as Woodrow Call or Anjelica Huston as Clara, I figured it wouldn't seem quite authentic. After seeing 'return', I can honestly say it is a worthy successor. The actors are really doing a show with Jon Voight, Rick Schroder and Oliver Reed. I admit that the story doesn't have to be as exciting as the first one, but "return" definitely has its share of excitement and captures the romance of the old West by having just a few more movies. Anyone who still has reservations can be sure that The Return to Lonesome Dove will succeed in capturing the "feeling" of the original and will not disappoint. Do yourself a favor and look, Ol 'Gus would be proud!
