Frightening in places, even though the effects have left something to be desired if you don't have poor eyesight or fear darkness. Most actors, however, were convincing and most of the effects were well done. I thought the creature looked a little too much like a man in a gorilla suit for my idea. It reminded me of an original pink panther film.
