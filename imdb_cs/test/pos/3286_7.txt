Wesley Eure is young inventor Brian Foster who invented a new security device for criminals in the form of a robotic dog, the titular "C.H.O.M.P.S." (This means Canine HOMe Protection System). C.H.O.M.P.S., modeled on Brian's real Rascal, can do anything; it has increased speed, strength, x-ray vision and the like. It's just what rescues his boss Ralph Norton's (Conrad Bain) security company. Slimy Gibbs racer (Jim Backus) naturally wishes to try to get into the secrets. This is something that's too hard to resist. There's a lot of grotesque (Chuck McCann and Red Buttons play a great pair of dull idiots), a positive attitude, an engaging cast, and a pretty good laugh to make one entertain. The disco-style energy is repeated, but it is undeniably catchy; The story is straightforward and dogs are absolutely delightful. In one flattering but laterally slim touch, there is another dog in the film (named "Monster"), whose thoughts we actually hear; his dialogue and the performer who make the voice are invaluable. In fact, he even uses some mild profanity and his last words end the film on a positively intestinal busting last note. material with all the praise they can gather. Larry Bishop, Hermione Baddeley, Robert Q. Lewis, and Regis Toomey also co-star. "Scooby-Doo", "Smurfs" and so on, "CHOMPS" is pleasantly silly. I know it left me with a smile on my face. <br/> 7/10
