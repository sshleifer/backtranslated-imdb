Meatballs work in interviews like no other film. Especially in the summer. Whether it's a song about CITs (counselors in training) or a cut-downs or inspirational Rudy rabbit or it just doesn't matter speech ... it appears! Poor Mickey / Morty, who knows where the next one will wake up!?! Such a great seventies shot and a cultural icon for my generation of those who understand that non-PC is really funny, no matter who you are! Wheels and Spaz are popular as well as hot dog eating a contest with the famous line "what ..? No mustard?" How many times did I repeat this line and was the only one who laughed! Thanks to writers, actors and directors! Applause, applause!
