The King of Queens is a comic genius. Kevin James, who plays Doug Heffernan's IPS, is extremely entertaining, Leah Remini, who plays Doug's wife Carrie, is incredibly hot (No. 19 on the hottest list of 102 Stuff journals) and very fun. The real magic of the show However, there are scenes with Jerry Stiller, they are the most fun in the show. Jerry, a comic genius, plays Carrie's father Arthur Spooner, who lives in Doug's and Carrie's cool basement. I have to admit that I have never seen this show until this year 2006. Whenever I swapped it before, I never seemed funny, but when I canceled Friends, Still Standing and Yes Dear, I needed some new comedy. Actually giving the King of Queens a chance I found it was absolutely fantastic. So funny that I downloaded the first 7 seasons and watched 8-hour blocks every season. I urge someone who hasn't seen this treasure to check it out. You won't be disappointed.
