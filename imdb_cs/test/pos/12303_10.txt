Writers and directors, depending on the nature of their craft, stand back from action in their work to show the view of characters and situations. Here, Huston and Joyce retreated to a larger frame to show us the ultimate view of what it means to be human. As long as this is not the end, it seems that the film is not about anything, about the typical circumstances that fill everyday life. It is only until the end of the final scene that we realize that it is everything. This final scene cannot be watched without compassion and compassion, and other fellow citizens.
