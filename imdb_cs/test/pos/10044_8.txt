George Armstrong Custer is known through history as a clumsy general who led his rage to their death in the Battle of Little Big Horn. "They died with their shoes," paints another image of General Custer. In this film he is portrayed as a flamboyant soldier whose mistakes and offenses are mostly ue his love of adventure. Errol Flynn plays George Armstrong Custer, whom we meet for the first time as a confident recruit at West Point. Custer quickly differs from other cadets as a poor student who always seems to be in trouble. It seems that Custer does not mind at all, and seems to be fooled, because they don't really know how to get into such difficulties. Despite his bad position, he eventualy graduates and becomes an officer in the United States Army. Despite the mistake, Custer receives support in position. Before this can be corrected, he leads the Union regiment into battle against the Confederates. His campaign is successful and Custer becomes an unlikely national hero. Custer returns to his hometown, marries his mistress Libby, played by Olivia De Havilland. Libby is a very supportive, understanding woman who steadfastly remains at his side and follows him into the border as she takes over the 7th Cavalry Regiment. Custer becomes a man of honor who tries to keep peace with Native Americans. To prove his intentions, he enters a covenant with Crazy Horse, the leader of Sioux. When this treaty is threatened by a conspiracy to spread false rumors of gold found in the Black Hills, Custer sacrifices his own life and the lives of men under his command to prevent the defeat of thousands of innocent settlers. Errol Flynn dominates every scene in which he appears. She successfully portrays Custer as gorgeous, arrogant, romantic and funny depending on the mood of the scene. The depiction of Libby Bacon Custer as the love of his life allows us to see his tender, softer side. The chemistry between DeHavilland and Flynn, who acted together in several other films, is so smooth and the viewer feels they are playing themselves and not parts of Custer and his wife. Other actors portray their characters that truly enhance Flynn and De Havilland. Anthony Quinn as Crazy Horse, Sidney Greenstreet as General Winfield Scott, Arthur Kennedy as Edward Sharp is one of the other actors whose roles have made this movie fun. <br /> <br /> Reviewed by this 4-star movie. Although it is not historically accurate, it is very fun. The film has a little bit of everything. He has adventure, comedy and romance, so he appeals to a wide range of viewers. The cast of the characters is excellent and the actors give credible performances that make you forget that it is largely based on fiction instead of reality. In particular, the reviewer was pleased that the Native Americans did not prove to be evil, but showed them that they wanted to protect their sacred land. <br /> <br />
