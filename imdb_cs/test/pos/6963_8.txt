Gorgeous, yet deadly Alexandra (the stunningly beautiful blonde beauty of Stacie Randall, who looks absolutely smashing in tight black leather gear) must find a magical amulet so that her evil demon master Faust can move into our dimension. It is on the fearless, harsh policeman Jonathan Graves (sympathetic Peter Liapis) to stop her. Meanwhile, the two pitifully indecent "comic reliefs" of the gnome dwarfs are running in Los Angeles. Experienced veteran schlock exploitative expert Jim Wynorski connects supremely inan tale at a brisk pace and remotely takes none of this stupidity seriously. Cast fights silly material: adorable Barbara Alyn Woods as sassy, ​​attractive police captain Kate, Raquel Krelle as tart, sexy hooker Jeanine, Bobby Di Cicco as hobo Graves, exciting partner Scotty, Peggy Trentini as tempting museum curator Monica and Ace Maska as a cheerful Dr. Rochelle. Mark Stevi is a cruel cookie cutter, a fun lowbrow sense of unjustifiable humor, Chuck Cirino bouncing a cornball score, two dwarfs guys sporting an obvious cheap Halloween Halloween Halloween, plain cinematography Bash, no tension or gratuitous female nudity talk about, and cheap (less than ) special effects all further enhance the overall delicacy of this first-class Velveeta slice. An entertaining thoughtless piece of lovingly crappy wood.
