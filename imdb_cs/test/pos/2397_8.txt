I was very impressed with what Eddie Monroe was able to achieve in terms of his overall influence on me. I say this because I know that this independent film had a limited budget / resources, but despite this, it is a convincing and well-created piece of work. Useful from start to finish with a few relatively unknown actors I can't help but believe in the coming years will make a big noise in industry, Eddie Monroe couldn't keep my interest and my emotional dance. It is a well-written story with a surprising end despite my efforts not to be taken from the patrol. <br /> <br /> Many of the casts named for this film are titles that you can focus on in the future. Someone told me that Paul Regina recently went through, and if that's true, it's a real tragedy because his stoic performance in Eddie Monroe is remarkable. Kudos to Fred Carpenter, who really pulled out the winner with this!
