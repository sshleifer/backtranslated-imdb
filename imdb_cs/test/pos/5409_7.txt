Kinks warned against media heroes. Outside movies, most heroes are also "ordinary people". Society requires a role to play, but what happens when it extends to a parent-child relationship? Are some parents trying to improve through their children and not the other way around? How do you provide a role model but not a role? A brilliant swimmer who hates swimming; a great musician who won't play. Unusual, funny (despite the "serious" problems), very good multidimensional behavior of everyone. Emotional tension is complemented by plenty of conspiracy. Cellulite heroes never feel any pain. I don't remember being disappointed in Sigourney Weaver (I even liked "The Village"!).
