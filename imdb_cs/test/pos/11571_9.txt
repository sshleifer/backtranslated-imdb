It is now 2005 and 15+ years from this cartoon first aired. In about 10 years, I watched it seriously or attentively. Now that I'm an adult at the age of thirty, I can look back with a serious eye when I look at the episodes again. <br /> <br /> The concept is partly a tribute to the classic Looney Tunes, but also the show itself. There are several episodes that are structured like old cartoons. For example, there is a singer who attacks Buster and so he tries to get revenge on this singer concert-exactly like the old Bugs Bunny cartoon. The following cartoon is similar to Looney Tunes, just in another era. When you look at the old Looney Tunes, they did a lot of things just like Tiny Toons. Old Looney Tunes has done a lot of social commentary and parody. There were personalities. There were a lot of jokes from a period that was frantic, slang and dialogue. The comedy was unreal and miserable. You can tell it exactly for Tiny Toons. The comedy style is "spiritually" the same. Certainly a return to a classic that was not done well (if at all) in the decades before the show. We recognize cultural references in Tiny Toons and we can throw our eyes when something we don't like appears. But the reason we don't think Looney Tunes is spoiled is because we weren't alive in the 1940s. Also Looney Tunes was original at the time, but today cartoons are over and over again. So it is easy to see Tiny Toons in unfair light because of our exposure to current events and our excessive exposure to cartoons in general. Certainly there are differences in many ways - the timing, delivery and of course the duration of the exhibitions. These are two different styles from two different periods that are performed under two very different circumstances - Looney Tunes are made for adults in theaters and Tiny Toons are designed for children watching TV. Even so, they did a good job of making the original show with original gags and still pay homage and patterning after the comedy styles of the old Looney tunes. <br /> <br /> Because Tiny Toons had a lot more time to play, they had some real moments of great animated inspiration. Just look at episodes like 1 minute to 3, episode Baby Plucky WC. For example, one of the best exchanges of comedic dialogues that have ever been animated is at ThirteenSomething when Babs and Buster are on a split-screen phone, hoping each one will fail. Misunderstanding is spectacular. Notably, character development in this episode and in several others (usually those written by Deanna Oliver or Sherri Stoner) is quite good. Female characters have been taken seriously as celebrities and developed, unusual reasoning on the contrary is usually true for the cartoons of that time. This was the first modern cartoon that had a lot of both pop culture-referential and self-reference humor. That was the way before his time. Tiny Toons really opened the door for writers to make comic freedoms that are so common in cartoons today, instead of having boring old crap we endured as 80's kids. Yes, I loved Transformers and Thundercats, but Tiny Toons was totally out of it. It was the breath of fresh air. Bakshi's new adventures of the mighty mouse could have been a forerunner, but Tiny Toons made this surreal style of comic cartoon a real success. As a child, I totally missed some jokes. For example, one episode is a tribute to Marx Brothers that I completely ignored as a teenager. Now I have a newly found respect for it. There are so many inspired gags I have never noticed that they are truly brilliant. It's a kind of comedy that makes me think of Looney Tunes and Family Guy. I have NEVER noticed the kind of comedy as a child. I've been thinking about most of the episodes I've been watching recently. You'd notice these things if you really watched the show. Unlike the other reviewers I know here, they are unfairly judged, I've seen all the episodes and thought about them thoroughly, exposed both as a child and as an adult. terrible amount of care with voice. I'm not just talking about the main characters, but the side figures were also very good and creative. But back to the main characters, some of the main characters were brilliant. Tress MacNeille, in my opinion, had the best performance in this cartoon. She hasn't been the same since. Rob Paulsen also did some incredible things here, too. This is all that doesn't make the show have any bad episodes. It had a lot. He also had many average. But it was certainly a lot of really funny episodes. Especially back when it first aired, it was actually funny to watch. From 10 I gave a show of 8.5 - and kudos for pushing the envelope and breaking the door leading to a new era of cartoons.
