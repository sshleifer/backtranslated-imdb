An unusual film that begins with the classic assumption of a hooligan who marries a girl who loves him to escape from the ground. But turning soon turns the story upside down. Most movies hit the right buttons: the story evolves smoothly, acting is solid (Sienna Miller's draw is priceless, he can really act!), Chemistry between the two leads the work, and rolling American rural ghosts and unpredictable side characters really makes a good time. The mood that starts as light and romantic turns from time to time into something darker and downright eery. Occasionally the pace slows down just a little more than we want, but don't let it stop watching this unusual little movie enjoyment. Alexandre Montin, Paris
