For me, North and South (I & II Books) is the ultimate TV series of the 1980s. Just spotting all those look portraits was very funny. Gene Kelly, James Stewart, Elisabeth Taylor, Olivia De Havilland, Robert Mitchum, even Johnny CashÂ¡ No series is coming to this success. Did you ever see someone who looks like Lincoln? Dick Smith's prosthetics have made Hal Holbrock even more powerful. Made costumes, jaws of dying places, everything. Clearly, there are excellent and clear television series today (Desperate Housewives, Lost, 24), but North and South have been and still are of a kind. Don't miss it. Just a look of David Carradin from the final villain (you can call him just a violent husband) is worth seeing. Maybe some of the characters and situations are too stereotypical, but I admit it, but the positive aspects clearly cast a shadow over them. I'm so glad she is finally available on DVD in Spain.
