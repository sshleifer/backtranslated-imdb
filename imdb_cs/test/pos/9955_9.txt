one of my favorite lines in Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> ie * We are not finished with you with a long shot *, so not only Shylock does not get his pound of flesh, neither 3,000 or 6,000 or 36,000 (each of the 6 parts was a ducat); destroyed by forfeiting all his possessions. and his daughter had long since left him. Revenge is the food that is best served cold. but Shylock's revenge attempt fails completely. I think this game was and is popular because it satisfies the wishes we have for justice. But the harsh reality is that the world is absorbed in injustice and most stand. a few big names go to jail, gang dogs lose their lawn to "good guys," but in fact it's mostly the opposite. but not in this game. the long outbursts of racism and anti-Semitism forget that it might well have been some other social outcast group that will be coming. from a villain. The merchant from Venice is my third favorite work of Shakespeare, 1 and 2 are Hamlet and Macbeth. this staging provides excellent moral storytelling. it's worth watching scenes with suitors themselves. also the resentment of the new husbands who twisted and minimized the fact that they let the rings slip so easily that they swore they would keep forever. In real life, this trick is the thing the husbands use shyly to remind themselves of their better half, which promises to mean something, and not be horrified. For this game it is much deeper than just a comedy / dramatic aspect. it is about loyalty, devotion and love. <br /> <br /> It's worth looking again and again.
