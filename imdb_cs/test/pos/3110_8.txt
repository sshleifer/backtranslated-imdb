I recently saw this movie again (after 25 years). In the original, there is a scene in the airplane bathroom during the landing between Jacqueline Bisset's character and Michael Brandon's character. The rented version did not have this scene in it. I imagined it? Or is this part of the "cleaning" of films where some are changed to exclude parts that some people think are not "fit"? I love this movie - it's just like a friendship between a friend and I and we've been friends for 25 years and we've seen it together. Her husband thought it was us. Thank you, Joan
