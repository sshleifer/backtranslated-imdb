I didn't know much about this movie going into it, but I found out that Kane was a wrestler who wasn't exactly excited about me, but hey, he liked "Santa's Slay" and that he had a wrestler in it, so what the hell. The story begins very strangely and promising, but after a while it becomes much more than your typical teen terror slasher flick, though the setting has helped some. A bunch of criminal young people is rounded up and taken to an old hotel that used to be a luxury palace, but now it is a dump to clean it and prepare it as a homeless shelter. The driver is a man with a prosthetic arm who is a veteran of the opening scene of this film, where he meets this great galoot who just killed his partner and blinded another woman. Teens, all of them are punk smart-asses, all of course saying they have to do some real work, but they're part of some unique co-ed work program, yep, what a great idea that is of course. Few people suspect that there is someone lurking in a hotel that in their own way will save the taxpayers of this state some money. Of course, he's the guy who likes to collect eyeballs, and he has a lot of collection. There won't be much that horror fans haven't seen yet, but there's some brutal scenes and enough gore to satisfy a tough fan. Setting up an old hotel is an ideal place for slasher flick too, and there are little partial stories like finding an alleged safe full of money and finding babes because this co-ed work crew is evenly closed. Most teens deserve to work well. It's not great but much better than Silent Hill, or when it's a strange call, and maybe better than some other crap I wouldn't bother to see. 7 out of 10.
