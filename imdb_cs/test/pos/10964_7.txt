The film career of independent film legend John Cassavets is in many ways a polar opposite of someone like Alfred Hitchcock, the director of the studio. Where Hitchcock was infamous with his actors as cattle, Cassavetes tried to improvise with them. Where every element in Hitchcock's image is perfectly composed, Cassavetes was less concerned about how the scene was figuratively composed than in how she felt or what emotionally transmitted. Hitchcock's stories were always the stories of the first story, with a human element embedded in the background. Cassavetes has put human experiences at the forefront of his films. If some things logically make no sense, that is the case. This can be seen from his first 1959 film Shadows, filmed with a 16mm handheld camera, on a shoe chain budget of approximately $ 40,000, in Manhattan, with a Cassavetes repertoire gaming company, and offered as an improvisation film . The story is quite simple because it follows the lives of three black siblings Manhattanit - Benny (Ben Carruthers) - Trumpeter and No Bill, Hugh (Hugh Hurd) - Loved Singer and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni) - Younger Sister Both. The three main arches of the film deal with Hugh's failures as a nightclub and his friendship with his manager Rupert (Rupert Cross); Benny's burying in Manhattan with his two non-account friends; and Lelia is lovelife- first with a white boy Tony (Anthony Ray), who doesn't realize that Lelia has a race on her skin, even after her sleep; then with the hard and right Davey (Davey Jones), who may be a misogynist. Nothing happens in the first arc, except that Hugh gets into the pontificate of how degraded he feels sings in low-class nightclubs, and an opening show for girls' nudes. He dreams that it will be big in New York or even Paris, but it can be said that he is the kind of person who will continue to deceive his modest skill. at best, marginal talent. Rupert's encouragement gives us insight into how destructive friendships work. But this is the least important of the three arcs. While this film is generally better than, say, Martin Scorsese's first film, ten years later, Who's That Knocking in My Doorway - Another Story of Failed Novels and Frustrated New Yorkers Has No Brilliant Moments - Acting-Wise or Cinematographic - That movie has. It is also not naturalistic, for naturalism in art it is very difficult to achieve, especially in the film, although in the 1950s the exterior of the Manhattan era is a gem to revive. While Shadows can be a truly important movie in terms of the history of the independent movie circuit, it is definitely not going to see a big movie anywhere. Parts are preaching, poorly behaved, scenes ending willy-nilly, almost like sketches, and sometimes cut off seemingly in the middle. All in all, it is a very sloppy job - especially a horrible jazz score that is often out of sync with the rest of the film because Cassavetes has proven to be a good actor as a director, at least in his first film. The only reason everyone should see Shadows is that Cassavetes eventually improved with later movies, giving a clue to his later work style. The National Film Register has rightly declared this film worthy of preserving "culturally significant". All this is in line with the creed of art that Cassavetes has long promoted, as this quote suggests: "I've never seen an exploding helicopter. I've never seen anyone go and throw someone away. So why should I make movies about them? But I saw people destroy in the smallest way. I saw people withdraw. I saw people hiding behind political ideas, doping, sexual revolution, fascism, hypocrisy, and I did all these things myself. So I understand them. What we say is so fine. It's subtlety. We have problems, terrible problems, but our problems are human problems. The fact that this film is "culturally significant" is true, but this truth is not synonymous with its "artistic meaning". It is in the difference between these two definitions, where great art really benefits.
