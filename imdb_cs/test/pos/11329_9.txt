For those who like their films full of exploding planets and extreme violence, it's definitely not visible. In fact, there is very little conspiracy (or at least very little, which could not be summarized in a few seconds: A meets B. Mr. A falls on Mrs. B and has an affair with her. A and B then fall in love and miracles) (largely) whether they should be alone. This is the Cantonese Visconti. The story is none, but what you do is a succession of gorgeous images and annoyingly trivial music that convey the slow passage of the central characters' emotions. There is also the opportunity to see one of the most beautiful women in the world in a row of stunningly elegant clothes. It is worth seeing for my money alone. How could this woman ever be an action hero? Looks like she got off the Vogue site.
