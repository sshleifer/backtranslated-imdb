We saw this film in Toronto last year at the Film Festival. It was a really touching experience. I have heard of the Truth and Reconcilliation process, but as others have said, he did not know much about the details of this process. This film demonstrated the process and growth that can occur when people are able to face their past, understand the events of others, and sadly sad. Archbishop Tutu and others involved in the development of the T&R process deserve credit for understanding human emotions. The vision of this film gave me hope for a human race. If we succeed in T & R, we might not have to destroy. People will look at T and R as the first step from human adolescence to adulthood. Of course, there were shortcomings as a film. I didn't notice any major problems in acting, directing or writing - but for the first time in years I was completely lost in the movie, so I might not have noticed. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. The audience in Toronto would not give up the next stage, we had so many questions and comments for the stars and the director. Tom Hooper, Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor went out on the sidewalk to continue the conversation. People only came to shake hands and thank them for the film. That pushed us all.
