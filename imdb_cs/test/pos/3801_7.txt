(Some spoilers included :) <br /> <br /> Although many commentators have called this movie unreal, this term is wrong here. Quote from Encyclopedia Britannica, surrealistic means: <br /> <br /> "Fantastic or rambling imagination": You don't have to explain in an unimaginable way how many clumsy ten-year-old boys look for their wealth in the Red Mustang Driver's Seat could be fantastic: those curious could read James Kincaid; but if you asked him how rambling he was behind the wheel of a sports car, he would definitely protest, "NO!" What fantasies and discrepancies film offerings usually appear in the first fifteen minutes. Then we get more iterations of the same, in an increasingly cruel and more delicate way that is far from consistent and soon to be predictable. Not that it was literally credible on the other hand - but it was unfair to taxame Motoram mainly by this mistake, any credible suspension of disbelief, which has since fallen sharply down to the typical values ​​of a filmmaker and viewer. "Lost Sheets" became a blockbuster. "Hallucination": How do we know what a hallucination is when it's part of one person not knowing we have one? In any case, some people know that they have "hallucinogenic drugs" - but if Motorama shows the result, then I am embarrassed why someone will take them more than once. There is of course an occasional bad trip. The film must be one of those puns and all. "Juxtaposition of Words That Was Surprising": How many times can a ten-year-old scare you by saying "Oh, my God!" when he likes something or "damn!" if not? These two interventions are for this course with this script. Sadly, any sense of unreality in what goes through dialogue could reveal a naive person in terms of expression patterns of a growing American generation in direct proportion. "A world completely defined and depicted, but has no rational meaning:" Motorama's world really makes no sense, but it is perhaps as completely defined as a drawing in a primary school newspaper. " Many guest stars in the cast have all the roles even less intelligent than our little hero who shouts, "Damn!" in the blink of an eyelash, but he needs a few seconds to come up with a lamestine of lies. And even * his * character, although appearing in almost every scene, has no significant development. Here is a lack of reward for every viewer who sympathizes, how do I have to want to know him better and understand where he comes from. He vaguely feels a much better story and a protagonist trying to get out. "Fully recognizable, realistic paintings are removed from their normal context and rebuilt in an ambiguous, paradoxical or shocking framework." No, we see a sequence of stereotyped and increasingly dilapidated billboards, gas stations, greasy restaurants with spoonfuls, cheap hotels and their low life habits along rural highways, exactly where they are stereotypically. <br /> <br /> "Very Responsible for Maintaining ... Traditional Emphasis on Content. There is little content in Motorama, moment-to-moment. <br /> <br /> Summary: Image British millionaires dressed like clowns or Pirates en route to a luxurious costume party, sitting calmly and quietly as the cautious drivers of their Rolls-Royces like fragile skiffs across the turbulent sea of ​​desperate humanity, the Chinese who push them through the windows and splatter the glass with blood. those who are now rusting, and white pianos immersed in spirits, a worn-out boy and a sick woman, to whom she holds on as a mother-figure who becomes a girlfriend who falls asleep on the grass, wanders into this detritus. The Lord, the "white and shiny" day of 1945 - a brilliant flash on a horizon that is not a rising sun, when he found his wife dead, first Believes that he has witnessed her soul rising to heaven, later explaining only a little less innocently, "today I have learned a new word: an atomic bomb. It's like God taking a photo. Now there are only two examples of film surrealism, surrealism, whose irony fades so much that it invades its own name: the Sun Empire. If you are looking for surreal, please don't miss. Unfortunately, no matter how hard he steps on the accelerator pedal to race his car through the desert and beyond the desert, no scenes so beautifully strange, rich, subtle or gorgeous waiting for the poor little brother of Motoram in his quest. None of the above necessarily represents this film. Although I am somewhat disappointed, I cannot reject it, given the seriousness of another genre that proves it - one was influenced by surrealism, but also by expressionism, existentialism and pessimism of Franz Kafka amid all-powerful power structures. Let's try the size: Absurd Theater. As for the EB article on this style, I am amazed at how, to the extent that the Absurd Theater is a valid art style, the above objections to Motorama will disappear as a cloud of smoke. I am tempted to quote the whole text as an identification support. The Absurd Theater is trying to show "that the human situation is basically absurd, without purpose ... humanity is felt hopelessly" After Gus immediately achieved his goal to get rid of the depressive life in the family between bickering parents, he was pointless until he passed the shimmering "Motorama" billboard and decided to win the lottery he promised. As others have revealed, this ambition proves illusory: although the game "never expires", the sponsoring corporation does not intend anyone to ever win, and has ways to deceive, confuse and leave each of the contenders rewarded. Like others, he is finally disappointed in his dream. Therefore, "absurdist playwrights have removed most of the logical structure of traditional theater. There are few dramatic actions as is commonly understood; the characters perform, their busyness serves to underline the fact that nothing will change their existence." "Timeless, Circular Quality Appears." The language in the absurdistic game is full of ... repetition ... repetition of the obvious until it sounds like nonsense. "Under the occasional" dazzling comic surface "we find the" basic message of metaphysical anxiety. " a play, his unbreakable language, a conspiratorial device in which he shows a bleak future and / or returns to an earlier moment and takes another, but bleak, change - so much so while the surrealist admirer would do better with some Spielberg movies, a motorama admirer as it really is, she should find fellow-travelers - not instead , but in addition - in Beckett, Ionesco and Genet, Br /> <br /> But you can't stop here completely. After his disillusionment with the game, Gus returns to "Phil" (ie, Love), the first nurse he met, and one person who treated him fairly, though he also cursed him - in a gas station ad "Be full-filled! Under Phil, he learns the life waiting for his cars. We can see that the absurd playwright Beckett called his most famous play "Waiting for Godot" and that Godot should read "God." God is also one of Phil's interests. the indirect result of his previous encounter with Gus, Phil is badly crippled and goes in cast with his hands straight horizontally In the last scene Gus, now Phil's protector, says he wants to hear the music, we hear nothing but we see Phil crouching at the end outstretched arms, Gus nodded closer, and Gus answers, the end. <br /> <br /> Finally, to the author I am currently reading, the Anglican theologian William Stringfellow. recognized as an architect or non-commissioned officer of liberation theology, which is more Roman Catholic than the Anglican movement, perhaps it should be. Police brutality and corporate greed are clichés in cinematography and literature, including Motorama, but Stringfellow supports and illuminates such feelings with compelling orders from scripture, tradition, and reason. His most important work is to expose the earthly activity of those fallen angels referred to by the Bible as principality and power. The Principality, written by Stringfellow, is behind all of our popular three I: Images, Institutions and Ideologies. All this praises our worship by making false promises. The deeper the image, institution, or ideology with which one becomes, the more his own personality becomes "exhausted" and becomes a slave. Promising power, control, and immortality inexorably bring helplessness, chaos, and death. As essentially fallen, losers cannot do anything more. Yet people will be enchanted by such "dominion over the earth" promised by God in the book of Genesis, while in fact none of us controls the image, institution or ideology that inevitably was based on its own hegemony and self-preservation. They take over their own lives. "Dominion" becomes a wrong translation: a more accurate rendering of Hebrew would be "stewardship". But this is an argument alongside a more fundamental problem: Most of us neglect that God has transferred this power to Adam * before the fall. We have no reason to believe that we, his descendants, still apply it: on the contrary, it should be clear that demonic forces have stolen it. We could add two observations of CS Lewis First, that "conquering nature by man" is merely an illusion, and a ruse to cover the fact that man talks about conquering some men with others with nature as a tool; and secondly, contrary to popular belief, Satan is no charlie kind of good. Initially, he can rejoice in pleasure, but he is very sloppy with them and pulls them from any human firmly into his throne, perhaps leaving his prey sitting in front of the fire, regretting that he apologizes himself and boasts resentment. > <br /> Now that we use these observations for Motoram, they seem to mirror themselves in Gus' experience. It is, if not nice, at least a nice little boy before he becomes a victim of Motorama. The first signs of advertising are glamorous. The longer it goes on, and the deeper it travels to the sponsoring corporation headquarters, the more they become worn out. He is lonely, with no one else playing the game. The dealer's cards have either fallen into wreckage or are occupied by zombies. The people he meets on the road are getting uglier, deceptive, and hostile. (The fact that the principality corresponds to a common dictator does not mean that they can respect each other). Gus's humanity is infused from him when he becomes not only totally self-centered and ignoring the needs of others, but partly blinded ... mutilated ... prematurely aging and infantile in the literal sense of language. Finally, his dear Mustang takes him in an accident and must continue the ruins of a dead man. Finally, when he did everything he thought he expected, he presented the principality in his proud tower to win his prize. The use of biblical power to be confused by those who have built such monuments to their own vanity, their agents avoid, disappoint, insult, and eventually throw it from the top floor. It falls long and hard, lands, eventually in the water. In other words, in classical symbolism, on DIES. He encountered the inevitable bad end of anyone who put his faith in such a cheater. But this fate turns out to be merely a warning look into a changeable future. He repents and returns to Phil, and when he sees him performs the first generous, selfless act we've seen from him for almost an hour and a half: noting that Phil is now disabled and barely able to insert a hose into the gas tank, \ t "Can I help you with that?" Then, seeing the sign “wanted help,” he decided to ask for a job explaining to the motorist with whom he was tracking that he was counting on getting there, because it didn't look too bad. Of course, this work is understandable and can surprise or even outrage the "cult classics" who see totally different points in the film. Motorama is not exactly my cup of tea, at least I am convinced that it is hardly the worst movie ever made.
