I must say that I thought that Greek would be really ridiculous and stupid. Since I am part of the association, I did not want Greek organizations to look bad .... <br /> <br /> but I think Greek is cheerful. Yes, they have a stereotypical guild and fraternity, but it is not a mockery but just a cute humor. All characters are pretty sympathetic minus Rebecca Logan (I just can't stand), Casey and Rusty have good chemistry like brother and sister. Then there's Cappie. Who doesn't love a guy like Cappie haha ​​His character brings so much show. Rusty's roommate, Dale played Clark Duke, is also cheerful. It's definitely fun to look so tuned for season 2. I can't wait to come back!
