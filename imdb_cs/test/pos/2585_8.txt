I and my roommate have free pre-screening tickets, I think you'd call Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. I waited for something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily exaggerated, etc. But the film is much more. It's a story of two people helping each other. It is not exaggerated, and the film is done in a careful balance so that it does not disappoint you or tells it useless. It's together really good and doesn't take it too seriously. That's her beauty. If she tried to take it seriously, it would not succeed, but instead would be carried through humor (some unintentional) and some surprisingly good conduct by Ricci. Although Timberlake is unfortunately failing in his role, the film is good enough to put it on the side. Definitely I would recommend this movie, if not for any other reason than the fact that it's something else. experience.
