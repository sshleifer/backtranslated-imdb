If you love drive-in cheeze since the early 70s you will just love this one. \ TWow would you go wrong with the low budget movie of bloodshed in mad asylum? You can't! Crazy people and sharp objects are always a fun combination. The film looks like it was filmed inside someone's house for about $ 320.65. For me, just ads for fun watching this type of thing. Gore is a little milder compared to the others of this ilk, but there is enough to make us bloodthirsty sickos (like me) happy. The characters are fun enough to make each slide quite enjoyable. There is never a boring moment from start to finish. Mind melting peak at the end, which is simply incredible. I liked it so much that right after the end of the credits I watched it a second time. It's absolutely necessary to see for yourself all respecting the drive-in horror matrix. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10 on Drive-in-Freak-O-Meter ... required viewing <br /> <br /> Yes, I love you .. I love you ... now take your Thorazine and put your clothes back ... please .... 8)
