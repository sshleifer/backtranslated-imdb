Sometimes you are late at night when you fly through stations, get bored of your mind and want some light and fluffy romantic comedy that won't bipolar. And this movie fits exactly into billing. Sure, the storyline was taken away from the 1930s ... writing as schmaltzy as the legendary poetry of the Hallmark Greeting Card, and one-dimensional characters played a cast that was ripped straight out of Central Casting - but it was CUTE, and that's exactly what what I needed last night. Lauren Holly and Costas Mandylor have great chemistry together - I liked it at "Picket Fences", and I'm glad they still have it 10 years later. Costas Mandylor, at the age of 41, is still perhaps one of the most beautiful men who can boast screens because ol 'Rudy Valentino kicked a bucket 80 years ago. RRROWRR! Bonus points for casting the funny man who used to be in roller skates at this cartoon lady show. I always thought there was something right from the Hepburn-Grant comedy. BRAVO! Some people will probably say it was the most interesting movie he ever made, and I'd probably agree - but come on! He's on the Hallmark channel. What did you expect? Just sit down, relax, eat some sesame sticks and watch a sweet little movie with two cute people and shoot down a bottle of Zinfandel. Believe me, you will love and accept schmaltz much more, and then you can go to sleep dreaming of Costas Mandylor swimming in a sea of ​​tempered chocolates feeding petit fours with mint fresh chocolate glaze. YUMMO! (PS. I now have a desire for petit fours. THANK YOU LOT, HALLMARK!) <br /> <br /> I really wish the evil girl was cast with Rachel Ray, and maybe that nasty food nerd Alton Brown announcer instead of a haunted dude with beard Van Dyk. Shudder! That would make me night. But hey, look at "Just Desserts".
