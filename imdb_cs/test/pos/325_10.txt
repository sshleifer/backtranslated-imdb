This movie is absolute gold. If you haven't seen it, do it. Mani Ratnam once again overcomes himself. This film also introduced me to Nandita Das, although they all shine in this movie. I'm sorry I never found a copy with the subtitles for the lyrics. We are led from the jungle of northern Sri Lanka to the quiet beaches of South India, as well as from the horror of war to the ultimate conquest of love for the human heart. Beautiful, subtle, witty, with some hidden surprises waiting for the viewer, this film is worth seeing again and the story of The Umbrella is doing as well as we look at the scene from the drawing. in the book. Charming. Bach.
