In order to pull out work like this Rififi coat (eg Scores and his opines), one has to have steel nerves. This obviously requires and commands. Jules Dassin is a master. I was on the edge of my seat. He deserves to be better known, even though it wasn't at the time of his release in 1954, as the director is supposed to be included in hypocritical Hollywood of his day. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who doesn't have the pleasure of seeing him. I can't give him enough stars.
