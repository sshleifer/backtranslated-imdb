When I first saw this movie, I was just a little boy and I fell in love with it, it's not like movies anymore, I just watched it a little older and I still love it. Humor is perfect and fits really well in the film, all gags are kind of childish, but adults will also laugh and it is very rare in children's film. Animation is amazing and watch hand drawn animation is a real breath of fresh air for all the computer animations we see today. Backgrounds are stunning and coloring is amazing. they are really pretty sexy. The song is fun to listen to too and some just really want you to want to cry or get up and dance, its also fun to watch the visual humor go along with them. Voice Gaming is unquestionable, though most voice games are high, but an interesting thing has appeared and one of the songs from this movie has slowed down to show the real voices behind them and its really a little fun to watch. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in a shop or somewhere to rent, I say, check out that it's really worth seeing and it's a perfect family movie of its absolutely amazing words can't express this movie.
