May contain spoilers !!! By no means, the shape or form of this film break horror film forms. Not so long. But it adds a spooky atmosphere, enough characters and gore. The story is simple and never bothering to bend any more than it needs. A bunch of children is killed in a mining accident in the early 19th century. Since then, they have been chasing and killing the residence of their sleepy little town PA in the mountains. Simple: they want revenge on a man who caused their death years and years ago. Naturally, his big, big, big grandson is in town and it's a real prick. Along with her mother and her two daughters inherit the old house after the husband's death. The eldest daughter is a rebellious, unpleasant ... typical teen. The younger is curious, clearly visible and comes into contact with the ghost child. The most amazing part of this movie is the utter ruthlessness of the children, and their victim is stuck after the victim. Excellent acting performance. It was so scary! I think the kids from the corn swing are one thing ... but this has outperformed some of those (like the scary kids). Worht and look. I bought it before I saw it and I wasn't unhappy. But I'm a horror fan.
