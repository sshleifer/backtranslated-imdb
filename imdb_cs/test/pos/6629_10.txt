Being a huge Bergman fan, I had to look for literally years to find this movie (at a price less than $ 60 I think) and finally bought it a few weeks ago. The basic premise of Bergmans films is the relationship between characters and how they deal with experienced situations. So this film is the same, but it is different because the setting is much different from most of Bergman's movies I've seen. It is set in war and heroes are trapped in the middle. br /> <br /> It's exciting from start to finish and once again proves that Liv Ullman is one of the best 20th century actresses. You must see.
