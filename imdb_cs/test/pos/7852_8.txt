This is a good movie, I won't go into any details because other user comments do a good job of caring for it. However, I do not agree with the statement that this is the best work of Eastwood. This is not only a very defensible position based on the volume of strong films he has directed and played. I would like to point out that it is interesting that two of the actresses who starred in this film, Pattye Mattick and Peggy Drier, never appeared again in another movie or TV show, despite good performances. My curiosity interests me what happened to these two actresses?
