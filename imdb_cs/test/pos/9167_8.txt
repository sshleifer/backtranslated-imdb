I think the basic idea of ​​every movie is to have fun or inform. If you want information that you look at real life movies and historical movies. Sometimes they are the same. The other side of the coin is to have fun. Did I Hitch? Yes. Well, the formula is standard. The boy meets the girl or in this case the boys meet with the girls. They get out together and then come back together. However, as it happened in this movie it was refreshing. I especially liked the bar scene with Hitch and Sara. Allegra Albert romance was a pleasure to watch decompose, most men REAL is shy when it comes to wooing the woman of her dreams and I had Hitch advice I'd probably got my wife into the altar in the middle of time. that this movie was played safely and good had some other laughs. I tend to disagree that there is so much laughter that you can pack yourself in a romantic comedy without turning it into a farce. In addition to relationships, they have serious moments. All in all, I found Hitch quite entertaining, the actors did a good job (I watch them in other movies) and Hitch is a movie that I'm very happy to have in my DVD collection.
