This movie is almost unknown, but it's very good. In a solitary Danish town, there are two old sisters who remember far younger when they had to refuse happiness because of strict Puritan education. Lonely, then alive in dignified austerity, until Babette, who flies from Paris, is afraid of the horror of war, she will come. In a few moments, she would be able to turn the goodness and love she had received when she arrived. A good lottery prize allows her to organize a great banquet according to the best French gastronomy rules. All quarters (all fanatic puritans) are invited. They accept but promise not to show any signs of joy or enjoyment because it would be a sin. The seductive power of delicious food they eat is seduced by the sensuality of French gastronomy. The banquet ends in a very felt, though quiet, happiness. Love between people has awakened. The miracle of the rise of human kindness began with the pleasure of meaning. The film is surprisingly good, but it's not for all tastes. Nothing happens during most of the movie, everything is so quiet and so calm that in many minutes you can only see the life of the city's inhabitants. But as the film evolves, it becomes more expensive when Babette wins the lottery award (after 30min of the film), the show begins. The author is able to show us with great direction how Babette is preparing a banquet, mixing all the ingredients with the most beautiful (Love), all in a quiet, delicious way, with perfect knowledge of photography and acting. Then, as the banquet fits, the quality in showing us how the mood of all the eaters is changing for the sake of eating, with only the first shots, with impressively filmed scenes behind it, is simply overwhelming. In addition, the tact with colors and photos is also great, with almost every scene in the film being like an image, so it's working on it. If you are able to admire a good cinema and realize that sometimes something that tells you is more important than what is said, it is your film. If you like good food and just love good gastronomy, you'll probably feel amused because most of the film's feelings will be known to you. Oscar deserved. The only problem is his slowness in setting the story, but I can forgive him (I hope everyone)
