Roy Anderssons "Du Levande" is not entirely original because it is against Andersson's previous film "Sånger från andra våningen". But the film has an aura of absolute originality. Some movie-making conventions are still discarded: most actors don't look like you'd expect in a movie, and shots take a long time. Most of the time the camera doesn't move, but people move around it. The shots start from somewhere and the scenery is built many times in amazing proportions. Sebald comes to mind in literature with the same technique. Since the time spent in each shot is really high in many scenes. There is a story and it is not - it is left to the viewer to build in his own mind. This movie is positive. It is decided that we do not see it all in the negative sense and at the same time do not pass social injustice. One of the messages I got from this was that perhaps all failures and accidents are not fatal. Great movie.
