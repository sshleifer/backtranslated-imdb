If you suffer from a historical perspective, this movie is really fun. It's action, adventure and romance, and one of the premier game matches of the era with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland starring. As can be seen on this album, the image does not come with purists seeking 100% accuracy in telling stories. To achieve this, it is only necessary to postpone the book of history and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. I know, I know, it's hard to do when you consider Custer's last stand in Little Big Horn and it's important in the history of the Civil War post in America. So I think the picture is an unresolved problem, no matter how you look at it. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of things to consider, even if it's two hours plus running time. Custer's arrival at West Point is probably the first head scraper to pick up as he does in full military mode. Sharp's practical joke (Arthur Kennedy), who put him in the headquarters of Major, would probably both get in trouble. Ironically, a lot of scenes in this military comedy movie play, like Custer's first encounter with Libby Bacon, and subsequent meetings that include Callie's tea reader (Hattie McDaniel). I hadn't noticed it in other movies before, but McDaniel reminded me of a lot of another favorite actor from my forties, Mantan Moreland. So much that in one scene it seemed like it could be Moreland, who buried it in his clothes. With that in mind, the owl scene was also hooves. As for Flynn, it is interesting to note that a year earlier, he portrayed J.E.B. Stuart opposite Ronald Reagan displayed General Custer in the "Santa Fe Tour", both fighting for the attention of no one other than Olivia de Havilland. In that movie, Reagan gave none of the arrogance and pomp to the character of Custer that history remembers, while in Flynn's portrayal here it is more than obvious. But that is close to Richard Mulligan, who took over a military hero in the "Little Big Man" in 1970. Let's say one was somewhat over the top. The better the picture for me was the way Custer steadfastly maintained his reputation and did not touch the risky business of the business. This and his loyalty to the men he led in battle, along with the discipline he developed during the story. The most annoying thing was that the last confrontation with Sharp's rival rival was just before the ride to the Upper Upper Corner, where he claimed that hell or fame was entirely dependent on the person's view. A similar note could give us the best insight into Custer's character when he said, "You take fame with you when it's time to go."
