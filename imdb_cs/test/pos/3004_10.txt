If I could, I'd give the TV series 10 plus. The writers were "smack on" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real. You could say that of the two main actresses Mrs. Toussaint and Mrs. Potts, that their relationship on and off camera was genuine. It wasn't just the end when you hear the familiar words "Cut" at the end of "Take". The show was thinking a lot about my life, for example, historical fights, tragedies and triumphs, relationships, everyday situations, every household has the same situation no matter who the members are, it just came up with the fact that it's a great family show that at the end of each episode you can just sit on your couch in the living room and say "now what I've learned from this particular episode". I have to say that I've been recording most of the episodes and watching them over and over again. /> <br /> Now you know why I gave him 10+ !!
