The intention is the same, terrorize, disturb lives, destroy property and kill Americans!

Norman Lloyd. Along the way, they also meet the very sinister Otto Kruger, who played the leader of the Nazi sabotage circuit, but disguised as a distinguished model citizen, where Barry was looking for him as a saboteur Fry, who would take him to his trust just to hand over the local law enforcement agency. He escapes, meets a kind blind gentleman and his niece, enters Priscilla Lane. From there, Barry and Pat travel to Soda City Cal. The route ends in the seat of the unlikely New York Socialite. It gets hard when the bad guys kidnap Pat of Barry and follow her with ruthless abandonment. The highlight of the film is the famous Statue of Liberty scene, which is excerpted in many compilations.
