This is a rough film, and it moves inexorably. However, it is absolutely unique among war films that it focuses exclusively on civilian experience, the loss of humanity that ordinary people will undergo during the war. Two young, married musicians undergo a slow, whipping process of degradation in the hands of both sides of the civil war. The film is completely devoid of sentiment and offers a bleak vision of the modern world. With brave, intense performances by Liv Ullmann (never better) and Max von Sydow (alike). For my money, the most indelible film Bergman has ever created.
