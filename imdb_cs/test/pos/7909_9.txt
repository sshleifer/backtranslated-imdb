This 1955 show of producers of musical Peter Pan with Mary Martin has the advantage of showing most of the original Broadway cast, including Kathleen Nolan as Wendy, who was a more natural actress than the girl they hired for the 1960s color games. It's a pity that most people will no longer sit in black and white because in many ways this earlier production - which is not even shown in IMDb records when you put "Peter Pan" in the search engine! - is better than the cutesier version most people have watched. I got the original on the disk and then worked on it to make it look better and digitally. Now that I have given the color version of the 1960s, it looks like a cricket in comparison. I believe that Mary Martin in itself undoubtedly favored this original 1955 b / w Producent Showcase TV version. <br /> <br /> As an added drive I also showed the original ads and the introductory promo. How far are the 1950s today - so innocent time compared to today. I miss it.
