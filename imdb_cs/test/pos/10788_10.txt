Obviously, Talk Radio is probably the best known of Stone's movies, but don't be discouraged, this film is ripe for discovery, I resist anyone who doesn't want to abduct it. Along with Eric Bogosian's best performance in the 1980s, it remains Stone's best moment for me (along with JFK). Stone does not seem to say much about it today and did not make director commentaries on DVD like all his films. Stone has nothing to be ashamed of, most directors would have killed to buy a movie. The studio's claustrophobia is intense and Champlain's views are very important today. "Legalization of all drugs" speech is powerful and you can find yourself agreeing with it. In my opinion, the film is about freedom of speech and how sometimes people don't like hearing things they disagree with. Listeners are very persuasive, even disturbing, with the spine running cold when a crazy man calls Champlain and said he has to rape again because the city is crazy, it is totally shocking. Of course, Champlain does not represent any kind of favor by ridicule him. Champlain (or I should say Bogosian) is fearless in the film and performance, absolutely fascinating, the shame of th @ Bogosians another big role was the villain in Under Siege 2 (dear God!) One scene of th @ no ring true was when Barry's boss Dan ( Alec Baldwin) gets him to calm down, Barry doesn't seem to be the person who closes and does, as he was told, it seemed a little fancy and clich√©. Too formal, it is true, because Stone is trying to make the film more cinematic and to allow the viewer to see the beginnings of Champlains, but that doesn't work completely. <br /> <br /> It's a brilliantly cinematic film with extreme close-ups, deep focus, extremely fast editing of a fantastic 360 set that is used for the ultimate breathtaking monologue. He must see the cinema, it is rare because it was ignored @ time, but now he receives attention again that it so richly deserves. Classical th @ should be studied by generations of film students. 10 out of 10 for inventive use of "Bad To The Bone" before T2, brilliant cast support including John C Mcginley (Dr Cox of Scrubs) as Sleazy Stu, Leslie Hope (24) as Champlains Girlfriend, John Pankow and Alec Baldwin as suits and Micheal Wincott, who plays three roles (a very underrated actor), tension between listeners and Champlain who is very heartbreaking @ times and of course kudos to the stars Bogosian and Stone for such a fantastic piece of cinema. Enjoy!
