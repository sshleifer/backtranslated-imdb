When I saw LAUREN BACALL doing the CACTUS FLOWER on Broadway, I never dreamed that one day I would see an actress as INGRID BERGMAN playing the role of Bacall on the screen. But here Ingrid really left her hair for some good comedy moments when the dental nurse pretended to be WALTER MATTHAU's wife to continue with the fib GOLDIE HAWN told him. It's a story played for laughter from start to finish, good humorous things that never run out of dry humor and wit throughout its run. There are a lot of single-row or gags that are above the usual comedy that people hear on television - the lines are true because they fit so well with characters and their motives. Daffy girl who is considering (at the outset) committing suicide over her unfortunate affair with Matthau, GOLDIE HAWN (fresh from her days as a star on TV "laughter in") makes a silly blonde role to perfection. Easily understand why she won that supporting actress Oscar. Ingrid is surprisingly charming in the rare role of comedy, though there are times when it seems to be just a little matronly for the part. In any case, it is a surprising choice to play a nurse who is freezing in the office but is considerably warmer off duty. When Goldie's neighbor, Igor, Rick Lenz admires, and suits her in this final scene. Matthau plays a character who has become his business in all of Neil Simon's roles, which he had - a dear cad who found his own confusion when telling lies after a lie. It is a kind of ribbed tickling comedy that will laugh out loud on some of the fun lines that Abe Burrows and IAL Diamant have managed to eliminate together on the basis of a French farce.
