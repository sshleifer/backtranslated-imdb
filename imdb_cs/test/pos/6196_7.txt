Elegantly written, well done, intense and exciting. This show lives in the real world, not as fantastic as "24", (and I'm a huge fan of 24, by the way). He has credible characters and in many ways is much smarter than most in this genre. He tries to present both sides of Islam. So far I have watched the first 4 episodes and found the story more balanced. Terrorists are more complex and not one-dimensional. As a result of this balance, terrorists are becoming more frightening than typical villains are portrayed in film and television. Last but not least, the hero is truly heroic without being cartoon. I recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of 24 and the like.
