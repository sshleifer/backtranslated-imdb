The one who cast the film was a genius, every character in it is perfect for their part, and they all do a great job in their parts. This is a good view of what life was before the Civil War and during the Civil War, the difference between rich, average white and black. The story gives you some insight into the real problems of the era and the difficulties that have been in everyday life these days. The storyline is convincing, and the drama keeps your attention through the whole movie. There are characters you fall in love with, the characters you hate, and you are emotionally involved. As my wife and I loved her, and we'll watch her several times in a few years, I'm sure.
