This film, which appeared at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and gained a bit of fame, seems to be another modern and profound school drama. It is a lot of adolescents going through a revealing and desperate day at school. Everything circling around suicide - shown at the very beginning to some degree - is at 14:37. The characters are connected in some way. What shifts them is described by short interviews, strictly taken in b / w. The characters are well written, acting is interesting (especially Teresa Palmer as Melody and Frank Sweet as Marcus are discoveries). Stick to the techniques of the movies. That really impressed me. They are seldom cuts, most of the time the camera follows one of the protagonists like Gus van Sants. Some scenes are presented more often than once, but always from a different perspective (here: character). This certainly evokes a slowly evolving but grabbing atmosphere that will literally pull you in. Colors are brilliant, somewhat incredible due to the hard conspiracy - but that is nothing less than clever contrast, disturbing "everything is fine". The use of lighting is sufficient all the time, which underlines the real mood of the characters. Finally, there are decent music locations. 2:37 in some way itches you from the beginning. It is not a compromise, nor does it serve laughter. Rather, it connects what psychologists would define as terrorist moments. This film basically focuses on emotional clutches. There is no one to handle any neurosis, even the tiny portions shown (eg Teachers) appear to be in a state of failure. And that's what keeps this movie from being really good. His summary of penetrating tragedies is unrealistic to his bones. No: friendship, love, smile, true, passion. There is: fake, humiliation, despair, illness and beating. It's like being really hit in the face, but after the first hour you're insensitive. This movie keeps beating you until it shows something quite instructive at the end. For being sensitive and brilliant: 9. For being technically innovative and original: 9. For being unidirectional: 3. <br /> <br /> Creates body 7 of 10.
