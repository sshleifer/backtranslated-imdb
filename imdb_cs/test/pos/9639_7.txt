Good shots from ships and aircraft of World War I complement this outstanding war drama on the Adriatic. Walter Huston is excellent as a commanding officer who knows his place and his place has no room for personal feelings. The safety of a ship and mission must always be paramount. Robert Montgomery is a lieutenant who has not yet mastered the role a leader must play in battle. He makes bad decisions, threatens the submarine and its crew, but eventually becomes a "real man" after being killed by the court and released from the Navy. Robert Young plays junior junior and Jimmy Durante as a cook. Parallel to the war drama, the war love triangle between Montgomery and Madge Evans, who plays Huston's daughter and the wife of a tragically injured aviator, is equally important. Recommended.
