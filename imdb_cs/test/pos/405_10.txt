Note: After writing this review, I see that this record is really about the TV series and not the original movie. My fault. I thought IMDb for a database for movies, not TV shows. But since most people will look for this film under BAGDAD CAFE and not outside ROSENHEIM, which is strange that the name is this movie on IMDb, I'll leave this comment here. Maybe I missed something, but when I read the other reviews, it seemed to be just a review of the CBS series - which had to be freely based on this movie. I haven't seen a TV series and maybe I like it or not, but one thing I'm sure is is that it's very different from this movie. This film is not at all like a TV show and Whoopie Goldberg has no other famous Hollywood stars in it (other than Jack Palance, who was very charming in his role). This is a very sweet movie that thinks it's "out of the box". It's not at all like a Hollywood formula movie, which is probably why (what is a nice word for idiots?) Who choose to sell movies or have not decided to sell this market. First of all, this movie captured my heart and imagination from get-go. From music (which is only part of the time, so you really can't call it a musical) to a movie for a really great story. German or Bavarian woman (very pretty and pretty plump) gets into conflict with another German or Bavarian man traveling around the California desert with parts and parts of it - taking off in the car and leaving to wear on a deserted and desert highway Outside in the middle of nowhere. Finds the little and dilapidated but enchanting Bagdad Cafe, in Baghdad, California, and checks it. The rest of the story is magical. I don't want to try to describe this movie because I want you to enjoy every surprise. Warning: If you are a racist or have something against big women, this movie will not please you, the main romantic lead is a big woman and the brown and red skin characters have a big role and are included as a "part of the mix" without any racism. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10 for orginality, fun and absolute splendor.
