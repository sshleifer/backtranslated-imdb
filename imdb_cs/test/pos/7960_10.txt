A photographer in the small town of Gunsan in South Korea learns that he has a terminal illness but makes it less serious to his family and friends. We have never found the nature of the disease, but the main focus of Hur Jin-ho's first Christmas in August is not his illness. It is the grace in which it leads its life - its ability to accept what life has in store, without remorse. Unfortunately, it was the last film shot by Yoo Young-kil before his death and the film is dedicated to his memory. Photographer, Jung-won, plays Han Suk-kyu, Korea's favorite star. A handsome man in his thirties with infectious laughter is so warm and full of vitality that it's hard to imagine him approaching the end of life. Jung-won owns a small photographic workshop and lives at home with his Deaf father (Goo Shin) and a sister (Oh Ji-hye) who teaches his father how to play movies on a VCR and write instructions for him to take over his work. his business if he died. As Jung-won goes for day-to-day work to get your affairs right, Dar-im (Shim Eun-ha), a meter reader, comes to his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargement. He suddenly and impatiently treats her with contempt, later apologizing and becoming a regular customer. Without an apparent expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops in increasing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their basis of being, the place they come from. To protect Dar-im from suffering, Jung-won does not tell her that she has only a short time to live, but it does not make it easier for her. Inevitably, his growing absence from business causes him to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where he throws himself through the store window. Although the decision of Jung-won to reject his illness from Dar-im is open to the question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or excuse for a character to "live life to the fullest". playing. One of the most touching sequences in the movie is when an older woman returns to her studio to take a commemorative photograph of herself. Jung-won made sure that the image was the exact one because he knew he would soon take his own picture of the memory. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never moves to a melodrama to comment. The point is to enjoy fun moments: cycling, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, thoughtfulness and thoughtfulness and feeling good about what life has to offer. It's a love story where love means having to say you're sorry. Although there were many films about the process of dying, Christmas in August drives the genre in a new direction and in this process offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition. This film of death is undoubtedly an experience of supreme joy.
