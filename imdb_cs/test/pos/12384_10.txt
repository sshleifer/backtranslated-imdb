Seriously, I don't really get a reason why people argue here. The idea of ​​a snowman killer who is causing havoc on a tropical island paradise is quite absurd. The good news is that the producers realized it and made it a comedy in the spirit of the Darkness Army. Especially in the second half of the film, when a small killer attacks snowballs, I laughed. For example, one of the small sneakers in the blender (la Gremlins 1) and mix. After that, it morphs back into the snowball and screams with a high oblique voice "That was fun!". Bottom Line - An incredible movie, rent it.
