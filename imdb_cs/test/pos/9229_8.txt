I wasn't even born when this series was released in the US. It took another decade before the British television networks kept it. In fact, I was fortunate enough to have seen the first episode in which Lone Ranger was one of those who came across the ambush and killed. TLR was the only one to survive. Although he was wounded, he was rescued by handing over Indians named Tonto. I believe he took the mask to hide his true identity for fear of retaliation. Instead, it became more recognizable. Dunno, if he had him in his sleep. This was Saturday's show. Welcoming the overtures of William Tel's overture was a dash to television, food still in hand. Although it very quickly became repetitive, predictable hokum. No one has ever exposed him. No one has ever laid out a blow, no one fired him. He was a little too good, and little camp in his clothes for most children. Poor Tonto, on the other hand, became his aunt Sally. He was always annoying and tied up and kidnapped, and so on. And what else did The Lone Ranger call? The "King of Savvy" was the general consensus where I lived. It seemed like "great know-all" in the Indian language. But it sounded like something else, as if Mr. Silverheels had a speech disorder. 'Kemosabe'; what the hell? Later, a less well-traded duo called "Range Rider" and "Dick West" won my voice. This featured a naked-faced Jock Mahoney who got defeat-quite quite thoroughly in every episode and was completely less camp, less super, and more believable. <br /> <br /> Still; even today I can't hear William's prelude without waiting a hoof gallop and a hearty Hi-Oh Silver. Devine daftness.
