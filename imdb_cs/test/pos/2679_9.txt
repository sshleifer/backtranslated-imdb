I just started watching this show. His broadcasting in Ireland is currently on the Irish television station RTE1 at 12:30 pm in the afternoon (as of July 26, 2006). This program literally made me laugh and can't brag about being on most of the sitcom (except the "The Office" with Ricky Gervais in it). Today's episode TKoQ (July 26, 2006) was where Carrie started a new job and invites his friends home and leaves. to make coffee and Doug wants Carrie to have no "outside" friends, so he picks up his peak and shows off his "belly hair". and licks the plates when he goes to dinner! But another funny episode was the second week when the old fella (carrying Dad) won the Bingo and the episode squeezed me with laughter, especially when they came out and got a spare fridge and Carries's father stood there looking at her and thinking it was novelty. So I don't know how long it is supposed to run on Irish TV or what phase (year) we are on, but I hope it's not going to end soon because I'm really enjoying it. To sum up, there is some great writing, some great characters and comedy gaming (specifically Carrie, Father Doug and Carries), some great punchlines and delivered well - a little sauce and nearby to tag (send kids out of the room!) but I think this US Sitcom is a winner and very funny.
