Cowboys and Indians are a great movie. Writing, playing, directing couldn't be better. That was a story that was begging, and this group of talented individuals and teams did a great job. Stories like this are not pleasant, but serve to remind people of social injustices around the world. I hope that when this film is seen, attitudes and prejudices change. A film that can do it is a rare thing. Andrew Berzins is an outstanding writer, and his talent and expertise in this area came in this film. <br /> <br /> Thank you for telling this story !!! Ruby
