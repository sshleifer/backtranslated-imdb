In truth, this is not really a "movie" as much as an extended final episode; I mean, you haven't followed the TV series (homicide: street life), I think you'd have a hard time after the movie. That is, "Murder: The Movie" is still a great watch. I think it says a lot about television production that every member who has thrown himself has returned, much after years of absence, to redraw his characters and make an incredible program. The film brings the sense of "family", not only between characters, but also between actors. It's all very bitter, knowing that it will be the LAST time that we will all see together under the name HOMICIDE. Story-wise, I found this movie somewhat absent. Giardello's candidacy seems to be particularly successful, and I felt his shooting could be dealt with within the parameters of his regular position, like Leiutenant. Also Det. Bayliss's extreme plot, which remained hanging at the end of the series, is finally resolved, but I, for one, NEVER felt it should be; I liked the fact that I stayed with the secret (let's remember that the first case of the first episode also did not solve the whole series!). As a fan of the DEVOTED TV series, I can love this movie and the fact that it even got over H: LOTS was canceled, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wouldn't have the slightest exposure to this series. Now that they have released it on DVD ...
