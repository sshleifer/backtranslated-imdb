When I was in the States, I was about 7 or 8, I always woke up just to watch it, along with a number of other cartoons like HootKloot, The Road Runner Show, The Pink Panther. But this was perhaps one of the most memorable and entertaining animated works, and today I consider it funny, never forgetting episodes like the one where two aardvarks fought for a can of chocolate ant? or the one where the aardvark tries to get to the island, where all the ants are, and my personal favorite, the one where the ant, the aardvark and the dog end up in the hospital, which would later be the basis of a similar Looney Toon cartoon with Sylvester, Tweety and Bulldog. This is one of the most memorable cartoons where someone would like to come back, I would. Excellent series.
