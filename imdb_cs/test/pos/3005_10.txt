This show was not just a great human drama, but in this country it portrayed racism in a raw, far too lively life. When one show can be so funny and entertaining and yet so offensive and educated at the same time, it is television in its highest form. Acting was phenomenal. Writing was exceptional. Not only has the show shown racial relationships in a straightforward way that seems to be incomparable to any other TV series, but its ability to portray this subject as it existed in the 1960s, along with its existence at the beginning of the 21st century, demonstrates powerfully how we have changed and, unfortunately, many more ways we do not have.
