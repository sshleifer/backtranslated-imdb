if I watched this movie when I hit the rock bottom, I would probably plunge into the deepest depression of my life, and maybe I was desperate enough to try it, the only thing in the real world when you plunder millions of dollars from unsuspecting individuals, all does not come to roses (unless you are an investment banker or an affiliate government), so how does it matter? I was rejected from school after school, and this sting, so this is a brilliant theme for the film, and when you put in an imaginary letting yourself watch this movie without using real world implications, it can really touch someone in that situation and give them know they are not alone. the exaggerated soliloquy completely tears the established education system as we know it. Indeed, all I can say is that when I am in college now, looking back at where I was and watching this movie, I can really appreciate it in a way that I would never be able to do otherwise. it's preteen and dying yes, but it's an emotional and uplifting fantasy about freedom and I can't think of a better way to end my night.
