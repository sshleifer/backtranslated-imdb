See Les Amants Reguliers immediately calling for a comparison with Bertolucci's film 'The Dreamers', in my opinion the best 1968 film about a student rebellion in Paris. In fact, director Philippe Garrel does not seem to be comparing with his much more famous colleague, sharing the main actor and even a direct replica of his eyes in the older movie of Bertolucci. And yet, LAR is a different movie and interesting. The story also seems familiar. The film starts with long "emoutes" scenes from 1968, perhaps the best so far. The film is created in black and white and the perspective of a static camera on one side or the second barricade resembles Eisenstein. Then, as in The Dreamers, the action moves in a Parisian apartment where heroes of a defeated uprising are doing art, smoking drugs, dreaming and falling on each other. There is no direct social commentary, no real explanation of the rebellion background. The film focuses on the psychology of characters and the love story between the main characters. It's like a premonition of the transition process to a 1968-generation facility, but not all participants can adapt or survive. The film is more about characters than about events. And it's just for the style he'll remember. Black and white cinema is unforgettable not only in revolutionary scenes, but also in looking at character development. Many sequences are reinforced by a technique that is derived from the films of silent films, with long shots accompanied by piano melodies. The effect is excellent. However, the length of the film is hardly justified, it lasts more than three hours and I doubt it would be just two hours, which would be a mistake - in fact, I believe it is the opposite. Without increasing the depth and subtlety of Bertolucci's film LAR, he looks at one of the most important years in the history of France and the world in the 20th century.
