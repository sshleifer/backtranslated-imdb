The philosophical, meditative tone of this film makes it kind of. I would give him 10 stars for that. But what was said, what struck me with a special force, was what I take, perhaps incorrectly, for his artistic direction. Many of the interior shots have a rich blend of color blends that seem to be based on the very underrated Munsell Color Model and complementary compositions. This seems to make the film unrealistic for contemporary eyes, but for me it is very beautiful as aesthetic work itself. I think this film is truly unique to this quality, and if for another reason it doesn't get a full, careful, digital recovery. Fox, are you listening?
