The concept of marital loyalty shown in the film seems obsolete today, but it is the observance of the main characters that make this story so tragic. It is this term that ennobles them and allows them to excel so that, as they refer to their respective spouses, they "are not like them". As Tony Leung said in the movie, love just happens. There is no need for a reasonable explanation of how this is happening, it just does. Despite the fact that they did not want to fall to the level of their husbands, it happened. Fidelity, social mores, and the timing of all conspirators against this relationship coming to fruition. Just in love is not nearly enough. I was out of luck that I was sitting next to a young couple (still in the university from the conversation snippets that they kindly shared with me throughout the film, and the uninitiated pain of lost love and missed opportunities). Their gross inability to spend subtlety and deeper emotions has made me realize how much such a film, like Wong Kar Wei's other work, is wasted on a local audience.
