Driving a dangerous winding road on a lonely road at night, teenager Cliff (Jay R. Ferguson) has a car accident with friends Lauren (Christine Taylor), Alex (Kim Murphy) and Eric (Christopher Masterson). While they spent a cold night in the woods around the fire, they were killing time telling spiritual stories. In "The Honeymoon", a pair of Rick (Ron Livingston) and Valerie (Jennifer MacDonald) travels in their RV to Las Vegas in their honeymoon. Rick marries a representative to visit Clayton Caverns at night, but stranger Cole (Hawthorne James) advises them to leave the place because dangerous creatures are attacking the full moon. In "People Can Lick Too", on the eve of her twelfth birthday, Amanda (Alex McKenna) tells her internet girlfriend Jessica she is home alone. Jessica is actually a psychopath. In "The Locket", cyclist Scott (Glenn Quinn) crosses the ground on his motorcycle. When he has a problem with his engine, he finds an isolated house where the beautiful mute Heather Wallace (Jacinda Barrett) lives with her father. When the man returns from his flock, Scott discovers the truth about Heather. "Camp Stories" presents three good horror stories, with monsters, psychopaths and ghosts, and a surprising step at the end. The weakest segment is "Hook", with Eddie and Jenny, but the other stories are great. The plot point is totally unexpected and gives a great conclusion to this above-average horror movie. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Brazul: "Contos da Meia-Noite" ("Midnight Tales")
