Vasily Pichul is a 1988 Little Vera film that is a prominent feature of modern Russian film. Pichula's brutal drama is a significant departure from images of disinfected idealism promoted in Soviet times (as in Aleksandr's circus). The current Ukrainian environment further intensifies the effect, first by the immediacy of the film on its time period, the second by utilizing not only the national environment that seeks identity instead of the Soviet system, but also a nation different from the Russian idiom. Vera, the title and protagonist of the film, is a rebellious teenage girl with a "dysfunctional" family, including a hard-drinking father and a pregnant mother. She rejects her wannabe Andrei, Vera begins a destructive (and especially sexual) relationship with a college student named Sergei. Despite the parents' resistance to lazy Sergei and despite Sergei's abusive contempt for his parents, he returns to their cramped apartment. Tensions escalate until Vera's father gets drunk stabbing Sergei. Vera has to decide whether to remain loyal to her unbearable family by witnessing her father's self-defense or continuing to support and defend the secluded Sergei. Little Vera, unbearable in almost every imaginable way, masterfully captures and communicates the inevitable emptiness that has remained in social life after the fall of communism. The sexual aggression of the film (this was the first film that showed explicit sex) combined with the relentless presentation of social reality (a significant difference from the socialist realism required by Stalin) effectively confronted the conditions of former Soviet life. However, the most interesting was the public reception. While many wrote hate mail to the director and star, the film was wildly popular. Here is the double edge of "film as a social critique": if done correctly, the film will be annoying to the audience. Because there is no simple solution, some viewers hate film and filmmakers for "raising" the problem. Many films come to mind as somewhat comparable in this regard: Larry Clark's children, Harmony Korine's Gummo, even a popular movie is such as John Hughes's Breakfast Club. I recommend this movie to the audience, for whom the prospect of nearly two hours of unbearable domestic conflict and social miasm is not too daunting. The film is absolutely beautiful and incredibly demanding. Despite the difficulties in watching a movie, some moments in it are deeply beautiful. Of course, the socio-historical and cultural significance of the film cannot be overlooked and in fact acts as an even more assertive reason for watching this film.
