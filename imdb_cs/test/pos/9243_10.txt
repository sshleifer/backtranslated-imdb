A fascinating look behind the scenes about how really good a movie can be made if producers, directors and cast simply "refuse to stop." These guys have encountered serious obstacles during the two years of the project (a tiny budget, trouble with the script and with the screenwriter), so the finished product was not what was first introduced, but probably turned out to be more interesting than the film to show that punk The mentality "just do it" ... with or without any support, money, or help ... figure it out in flight and do what you want to do. I really liked this documentary and I know that viewers will see and learn things they didn't know before. This movie is really "of its kind ... it's hard to classify because it has pieces of" sci fi "and" tension "and also" how to make a movie ". It can go wrong and how to overcome it. Ed Ivey, who knows how to make a good film on a string because they are creative and know how to build props, dolly, staging, lighting with what they can clean up ... pretty amazing stuff.
