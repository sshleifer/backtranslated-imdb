How many reviews will I have to write about this movie before I do it right? Tom Conway fully inherits the Falcon cloak from his real brother George Sanders with this item. Made in beautiful double-breasted suits with simple button dress and swimsuit in beautiful 110% -liter wagons with huge fender skirts and suicide doors that come underarm, Conway travels from New York to Miami, a formula for industrial diamonds falling into the wrong hands. His "client" is beautiful, virgin Louisa Briganza, who has beautiful hair but lets you just kiss her for the first two months. Along the way he leads to the kind of colorful line of characters he could only provide film B. His sidekick in this trip is perhaps best among the Falcon sidekicks Edward Brophy as Goldie Locke who has some really funny lines. It runs into the sinister dish of Doris Blanding, the type of 40 you know. Her cohort is Benny played by Steve Brodie who, twenty years later, was a Presley punching bag in two Paramount King movies. Both work for cold fish and yachting-cap-wearing Kenneth Sutton, ready to do what it takes to get a formula when cruising his yacht to Brazil. This record, delayed by the worst policemen chasing the falcon, still rules. Forget about 120 minutes of melodramas, give me 1 hour of Falcon every day. I have a wife and two children - who has the time for a two-hour film? Shake the dry martini and forget your trouble with this big Falcon movie. But if you didn't print it from a local TV in Toronto like I did 17 years ago, you're lucky.
