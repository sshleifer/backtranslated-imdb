Todd Sheets created one of the biggest films LOW BUDGET Zombie EVER. The story is great, gore is great, psychos are bad! However, the film is faulty with its small dialogue and slow displaying at times. Despite this, ZB2 delivers what every Zombie movie, gore, good chart, should be a quick adventure to macarbe. If only MR sheets got a 100k budget, this film would make EVERY zombie movie even almighty Dawn of the Dead. But as time goes by, it gets better and when it gets more money it fits in your pocket. So this man this modern day genius to craft his vision better. Just remember that Zombie Bloodbath 2 was just one of his big stepping stones when on top of Gore Mountain
