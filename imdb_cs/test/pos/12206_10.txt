The surface was amazing, I don't know how much Monday I survived at school just thinking about a new surface episode. I loved it, sometimes I had to call home and tell my mom to ignore it for me. I was pretty upset when I heard it was canceled. So they can have their new Tina fay comedy (you couldn't pay me to watch it, I think when I saw the ads scare me). I will miss my Monday night surface repair, though I am my sister kidding. though, kidnapped looks good and, they still have L & O: SVU (I think I still have to check) (I wrote only 2 lines above because they said I needed ten lines).
