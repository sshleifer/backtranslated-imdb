There were many people who tried to make a film that was identical to the story, Heart of Darkness. Some movies were based on Heart of Darkness, like Apocalypse Now. In 1993, director Nicholas Roeg made a film that was just like a book. The heart of darkness is a film almost identical to the book. This movie is full of action and adventure. The heart of darkness is about a sailor's journey named Marlow, who sails on the Congo River to meet the super powerful ivory trader, Mr. Kurz. The heart of darkness, the film, has the same exact beginning and setting as a book. It takes place on a ship in the River Thames, and Marlow tells the story of four other men on the ship called Nellie. The whole film is a memory of Marlow's journey to see Mr. Kurtz on the Congo River. Marlow works for a Belgian company that trades ivory along the Congo River. He tells about his account at the company office and about all the maps he saw in the office. Marlow embarks on a steamship to Africa. He arrives at the Central Station, where he receives orders from the CEO. The General Manager tells Marlow about Mr. Kurtz and the ivory shop. Marlow soon discovers that the general manager does not like Kurtz because he is afraid that Kurtz will replace him. Marlow waits at the central station for several months because his ship has been destroyed and repaired. Marlow sees harsh treatment and enslavement in Africa while at Central Station. When the ship was finally repaired, Marlow, another African character named Mfumu, and other crew members set off for Marlow's steamer for Mr. Kurtz. Along the Congo River, they are attacked by African natives in the wild. As Marlow's garrison is attacked by African natives, they end up shooting and killing Mfum. When Marlow finally arrives at Kurtz Station, he meets a Russian who explains Kurtz's power and fame. Marlow is then led to Kurtz's home. There he sees many maps and pictures that Kurtz painted. Finally, Kurtz enters the room and begins to tell Marlow about everything he did in Africa and talks about his lover. Marlow soon discovers that Kurtz is powerful because the Africans will welcome him as a god. Marlow is angry at the cruelty and enslavement she sees in Africa. After Marlow finally meets Kurtz, Kurtz begins to die. While Kurtz was on the dead bed, he called Marlow into his room. Kurtz's life begins to flicker before his eyes, and his last words were "Horror, Horror." When Marlow returns to Europe to see Kurtz's fianc√©, Marlow tells her that Kurtz's last words were her name to hide the darkness in Kurtz's life. The heart of darkness was well done and formed into an adventure film. I recommend anyone to watch this movie because it's full of action and mystery. The movie is sometimes slow, but it's really interesting. The heart of darkness really expands your mind and teaches you a lot about how to interpret different scenes.
