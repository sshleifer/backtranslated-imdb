My friend took me to show this movie in Hollywood and it was amazing! It's a film noir with amazing acting, great script, great music, the whole thing was very good and fun. I don't know if this is getting a release in theaters, but that would be a great date movie or a fun movie for rent if you see a blockbuster. This is the kind of movie I love, low budget, but great style and imagination. I hope Alexandra Holden gets more big parts than she has in this, she is fantastic.
