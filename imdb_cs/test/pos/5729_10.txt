Ladies and gentlemen: The show begins with this documentary film. It is divided into three chapters, each of which is arranged chronologically. The first presents classical physics and references to Einstein. Second study in depth quantum physics and enters String theory. The last reveals the theory of everything ... The complex terms used here are introduced in a very simple way, with everyday objects; even if you have to trust them without controlling yourself - unless you're a scientist - (and even if you're a scientist !!) The film is not a masterpiece of his fairy tale technique or the way it is made; What is really import is a story, and what a story!
