When, oh, when someone like Anchor Bay or Blue Underground will release this on a widescreen DVD ??? Le Orme, which I only know about my rare / vintage video collection habit, is a film in my collection that I would not only sit but actually enjoy watching. The fact that Klaus Kinski is on top, but only in small parts of the film, means little to me. (Although a few comments expressed disappointment in his somewhat limited time screen.) I can't say it's a good horror movie, a good secret, a sci-fi epic or something like that. This is simply inconceivable in the "genre" sense of things. It's more like a confusing, frightening (though not particularly violent or bloody) dream, filled with great visual images and secrets. It is based on visuals and emotions, much like the Bava "Lisa and the Devil". Both films are beautiful in almost every sense, but almost impossible to describe logically; both occur in such a dreamlike atmosphere. Don't be discouraged from the Force Video synopsis on the back cover. This is infinitely more complex and interesting than that. Although the Force Video 1986 (the only one I know about in the US) is cropped to tape, it's still great in this format. Releasing it remastered and / or letterboxed would be wonderful (hint, hint ... DVD company).
