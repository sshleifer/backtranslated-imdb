I say remember where and when you saw this show because I believe that when Fox gives the Talk Show the chance that Spike will be there with Conan for a few years because Conan is incredibly funny and seems grateful for his own show which brings humor . The most fun pieces Spike has ever had are The Idiot Paparatzi and Comedy For Stoners. In short, this show is more fun in 25 minutes than SNL per hour, so I hope the Talk Show gets the attention it deserves, like half an hour, more money and a band.
