John Landis really outperformed himself when he directed Michael Jackson THRILLER as a short film. Of course, it's scaly, dialogue is terrible and everything seems too cheesy, but it's perfect, with no points. Michael and his date are at the cinema to see the latest horror. . When it all gets a bit too graphic for the date, it leaves. Michael follows. On their way home they decide to make a shortcut through the local cemetery. It starts there. The real thriller dance is amazing. It's full of those Jackson's movement signs, as well as some unforgettable zombie movements. He doesn't seem to hurry at all, not too long. The whole thing looks like a movie and it's actually rather scary. Of course, it's one of the most famous music videos of all time, and it's probably the biggest music video ever made. <br /> <br /> Overall: Watch it seriously. The 13 minutes will be one of the best you've ever seen on screen. (5/5)
