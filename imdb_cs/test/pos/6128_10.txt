Of course, my 10/10 rating only applies if you are willing to get completely and totally earned *. Because you know only John Waters can do it. In "Pink Flamingos" (his directorial debut), he portrays two families locked in battle to see who can be the dumbest alive. What divinely does great at the end answers to the question. But except that the film is basically an excuse for people's shock beyond what someone usually imagines. You better have a very strong stomach to watch this movie. Even some of these lines are rather overwhelming. <br /> <br /> * Otherwise avoid this movie as if you were using the Ebola virus!
