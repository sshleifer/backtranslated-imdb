This film is undoubtedly one of the greatest monuments in the history of cinema. By seeing this film, we can only see back that world cinema in the fifties had such a purely humanistic dramaturgy, such a strong and adequate use of the sound image and almost religious admiration of ethical decisions in human life. The cinema was not just one form of art. It was much higher than ordinary life and gave many people hope for life after the tragic war. It is said that even Picasso was moved and shouted that such a work of art could only appear once every 100 years! The audience that time was also different. I read that after seeing Kurosawa's "Ikir (Live)" in his first release, the young couple said quietly, "It's a good movie, isn't it?" I think contemporary cinema, even if it is technically advanced and opened to a new narrative perspective, has lost the most prominent --- reliance on the audience. . In this regard, "Letyat zhuravli" in the pantheon of classics of all time, such as "City light", "Ikiru" and "La Strada".
