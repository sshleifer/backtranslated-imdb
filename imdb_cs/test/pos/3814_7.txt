I saw it before 'bubba ho-tep' at the fantasy festival in Montreal. all about it is either tilting the hat on (or completely copying) tim burton. I liked it even though it is extremely derivative. what impressed me most was the quality of the visual due to the obvious shoe budget. design design and props were inventive and original, though the script was definitely not.
