It is very true that this film defies the convention by not plotting a conspiracy for the viewer. While some may have the problem of having to invent it themselves, I embrace "Uzumaki" for his grudge. There is a PLOT, it's just that it may not be immediately accessible to a lazy viewer. It is a film that calls for numerous interpretations, just as it does great art - but this film is also very entertaining, making it a rare film experience. It's both provocative and fun.
