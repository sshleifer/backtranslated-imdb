It is certainly an experience and a common experience. The use of color is fascinating and sometimes frustrating. LOT of what's happening on the screen is incredibly difficult to discern. Your gaze is either obscured by a sudden bizarre change in color and tone, characters in the way, and random cuts to the sky. The sound is very scary and welcome. It really helps the nihilistic and hopeless tone that this film stinks. As for what Begotten is about, "rape of the environment and rebirth" seems to me to be very accurate. But I wouldn't spend a lot of time focusing on meaning, it's virtually unimportant. It is clear that the director does not want to explain anything. It simply presents it as it is and if you want to look for the meaning that is yours. Watching Begotten is definitely not a walk in the park, but I've been open since the opening. It's really like watching the worst nightmare. What we see is sometimes unpleasant and very unpleasant, but there is a surrealistic dreaming beauty. If you're an art house / experimental fan and you haven't seen Begotten yet, make it a priority. I doubt you ever forget it. I know not.
