Unfortunately, this original blend of action and laughter is preserved from cinema fans because it nestles in Columbia tombs for eternity. Too bad because it may be Jack Starrett's strongest movie and it presents a humorous screenplay by young Terrence Malick and a fully featured performance of his two leading Stacey Keach and Frederic Forrest who turn to life for crime to get money to open up the seafood restaurant. Many standout scenes include questioning the bath and electric razor, and an intense shootout in an abandoned building as it's torn demolition balls!
