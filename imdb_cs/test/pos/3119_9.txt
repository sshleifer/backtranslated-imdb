Most of us kids growing up in the 40s or 50s were Western enthusiasts, but this was the one that escaped me until they saw the Movies for Men channel today. I loved the story of the film, the cinema, as well as the excellent cast of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. starring along with ever more reliable Ward Bond. This film seems to have been the inspiration for the later TV series "The Train Train", which again featured Bond when the wagon train chief headed west. Johnson steals the film with his riding skills and it's nice to see an actor doing his own stunts like Ben in this movie. Other notable include beautiful Joanne Dru as Denver and an early non-speaking role for James Arness, who later became famous for his Marshal Matt Dillon role in 'Gunsmoke'. If you like movies of this genre, you can't like it.
