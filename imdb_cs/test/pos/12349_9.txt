Actually, I first saw One Dark Night in a theater and wrote a review of a movie for my high school newspaper. I loved it then and I still love it. The plot revolves around two people. One woman first learns that her father has telekenisis after his death. She then has feelings about her father's strange powers and his death. Buried, Mauseleum plays a host for the second principal, a high school girl who does whatever she can to get into a group of girls who just want to bother her and dare to stay on the mauseleum all night to join her group. They will return at night to scare her and find fear for herself. The cast is led by Meg Tilly with supporting roles Adam West and one of my personal favorites Elizabeth Daily aka E.G. Daily. Check out this, if you like 80 movies and cheesy horror movies, you won't be dissatisfied.
