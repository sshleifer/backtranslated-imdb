My brother hooked me on Carlin in the 1970s. I've always loved his observational humor. That is, look at everyday things and find humor in it, such as the question: "Have you ever tried to throw away the old trash can? You can't do it! making prefect sense with discussion. However, during the 1990s his things were less funny, and more angry. He seemed to do that by holding a mirror in the face of society and saying, "Look!" At this point, his shows were less comedy shows, and more gripe sessions, but in all respects he always made tremendous sense. He really thought. Here was Carlin old and new. you could have got old by getting older and then slamming the world down again. I did it again. This was his best ever since "Jammin" in New York, and how his shows last. <br /> <br /> I think what 'Shootist' was John Wayne , or 'Prairie Home Companion' to Robert Altman, 'That's Bad for Ya' is George Carlin. Farewell with a real big icon. Love him or you hate him, I think he will remember him.
