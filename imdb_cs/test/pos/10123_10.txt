Cuba Gooding, Jr. in 2003 he will win an Oscar for Best Actor. And Ed Harris wins BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR. What a beautiful and annoying film is, but be sure to take a tissue box, because if you don't get this film, you have icy water in your veins. It was 1976. The setup was in South Carolina and the Civil Rights Act was about ten years old. We have a white football coach and teacher Ed Harris. Then there is a black retarded, frightened but pleasant colleague, Kuba Gooding, whose greatest assets, including radio, are stored in a shopping cart, which is also used as his bike. Ed Harris takes a lot of interest in a colleague for the reason he explained much later in the film. He gives the nickname "Radio" to Cuba, followed by an absolutely riveting, enthralling, touching exploration of the human soul. The film is nothing but a masterpiece.
