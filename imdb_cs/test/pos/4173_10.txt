"Head" can be considered as two ways. Either it is a dazzling, stunning collage of music, old movie clips, psychedelia and comedy-style comedy. The truth probably lies somewhere in between. It is also one of the best films of all time. 'The Monkees' - Davy Jones, Peter Tork, Mickey Dolenz and Mike Nesmith - just finished their series and wanted to make a movie. In collaboration with writer Jack Nicholson and director Bob Rafelson, they created "Head". It begins at the opening ceremony of the San Francisco Bridge, where Monkees Castle crashes. Mickey jumps over the rail and throws hundreds of feet into the water. Mermaids will save him to the accompaniment of the wonderful composition of Jerry Goffin and Carole King called "Porpoise Song" and the visuals that make the Stargate '2001' final look like phrases. Now you will either turn off in confused disgust or be completely biased. Bizarre events unfold; Mickey uses a tank to destroy the Coca-Cola machine in the middle of the desert; the whole Italian army surrenders to him; the band is hired to play playing dandruff in Victor's mature hair for television commercial; an overweight waitress offends a group and describes them as "God's gift to the eight-year-old"; birthday surprise for Mike goes wrong; the group is sucked into the vacuum cleaner, and to cover it all, they are expelled inside the giant glass tank. You either hate it or you will love it. I found that it was a refreshing change from the mindless pop musicals of "Let's to show right". The songs are also good; 'Daddy's Song' is a great choreography by Toni Basil (later appearing in Rafelson's 'Easy Rider') and boasts beautiful cuts when Davy's dress changes color at lightning speed. "As We Go Along" is a beautiful number of Goffin & King whose accompanying images carry a strong environmental message. Frank Zappa, Annette Funicello are just two of the visiting stars to emerge. Did Victor Mature screenplay before he agreed, one miracle? But it is cheerful. So insane that there just has to be a real genius, 'Head' is a little '60's gem and one is worth it over and over again. Shame about not finding an audience at the time. If only 'Spiceworld' was like this!
