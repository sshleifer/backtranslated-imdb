Well, unlike most people ... I went to this movie and expected it wouldn't be so good and it turned out to be an amazing movie. Pretty cool plot I like the idea, but what really made this movie was actors. They all did incredible work and were pretty cool to see that fish burning and dillon working together. It's a movie you're thinking right now, you'll be able to predict what's going to happen, but it's not quite the impact you predicted. I don't want to give anything about the story, so I'm used to ... but I suggest giving it a chance. If you saw the movie Money Train and enjoyed it you would love this movie. Maybe Lawrence Fishburn touches them on gold?
