Five Flats, Nelson (Kiefer Sutherland), David Labraccio (Kevin Bacon), Rachel Mannus (Julia Roberts), Joe Hurley (William Baldwin) and Randy Steckle (Oliver Platt) Decide try to experiment; dies exactly 5 minutes (it's the maximum time anyone can do before the risk of brain damage). Almost everyone is doing this experiment, Randy is a lonely exception, but they are beginning to have unwelcome visitors; David sees a little black girl shouting at him with gross insults, Joe sees all the women he had sex with (and who was filming them) and asked him why from the television screen, Rachel relives her father's suicide and Nelson faces a little boy with murderous intentions. Why are they here? And how do they get rid of them? Set in a hallucinated city and into the Gothic Med School, this tense and exciting film is quite an experience, both for the story and for the characters starring Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, Oliver Platt, Kevin Bacon and William Baldwin. The director is Joel Schumacher, who has already worked with Sutherland in "Lost Boys" and this second collaboration is even better than the first one. And it must be for psychological-thriller-horror buds and metaphor lovers (this story is about forgiveness and correction of past mistakes), this is one of the smaller classics from the 80s that still holds today as is the mention of Rebecca Gayheart in 'Scream 2' or the episode Tru Calling, which used the premise of the film. Flatliners: 9/10.
