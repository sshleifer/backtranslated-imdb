This movie hasn't seen me in a few years. It came to Disney Channel in the morning. I stayed there to watch, and I found it even more fun than the first time. The story, scenery and characters are as good as they are. I know that if someone takes the time to see this movie, they'll find it worth a second time. It's very memorable in more ways than one. I would recommend this movie to anyone because it is both fun and educational for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> s
