One of our favorite family favorites. When we need laughter ... we just gave it and laughed as if it were the first time we saw it. This film has good, clean family humor. Pauly Shore is brilliant! With no plans for Thanksgiving, Crawl (Shore) is invited to spend a holiday with a conservative coed, Becca. Crawl, who is a big city boy, has to adapt to the life of the farm if he is to fall in love with Becca. But Crawl isn't the only one learning new things. Crawl teaches Becca and her parents to be more open about their feelings and acceptance of others. This is fun for viewers of all ages.
