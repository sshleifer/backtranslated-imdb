WARNING: SPOILER !!!! That was my son's review of a movie he wanted me to write for him. He wrote it, I swear. With Malcolm in Middle Frankie Muniz, and Nickelodeon's Amanda Bynes, they go to show business. They team up for actor Paul Giamatti. He stole an essay about Jason Shepherd on Big Fat Liar. Jason (Frankie Muniz) and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) have to go to L.A. Jason's dad doesn't believe he wrote the essay. So every time they see each other, Jason asks Wolf (Paul Giamatti) to call Jason's father because he wants his BACK !!! Wolf doesn't make a movie, but the company's president does it. At the end of the family and Kaylee see the movie, Made by Wolf Pictures and based on a true story written by Jason Shepherd.
