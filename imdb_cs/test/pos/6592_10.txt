This is an excellent criminal thriller, and with a great cast too. The best and most popular actors of the Spanish language in the last few decades, Victoria Abril and Federico Luppi, have teamed up in one of the better thrillers of Spanish language criminals 2004-5. The film begins with a focus on thirty something Ernesto (Ernesto Alterio), an elegant, attractive and slick thief who has learned from his childhood friend Gitana, and recently from Manco, an old, experienced cheater. Manco introduces Ernest Federicom (Federico Luppi), also to an elegant but much smarter and more experienced methodical thief - best in his class. Federico's only known weakness is Pilar (Victoria Abril), his former mistress and partner. He suddenly appears and suggests a wonderful farewell to his former lover, a large-scale crime that will ultimately require the assistance of Ernest, Manca and Gitan, among others. <br /> <br /> The script is full of twists and surprises, especially towards the end of the movie. One criticism about the movie I have heard a lot is that there are too many conspiracies at the end, but I disagree. The film catches the audience so much that all the unexpected events are not too many. In fact, this is what makes the film excellent. I warmly recommend.
