All right, Anatomy is not a rediscovery of the Horrormovie-genre, but it's good. Good actors (first Potente and FÃ¼hrmann) and some nice ideas pleased me. Maybe I wouldn't be so positive if it wasn't a German movie, but who cares. It's good to see familiar faces in a good, exciting story, with some gorey and good jokes in it. You all complain about dubbing: I didn't see the dubbed version (of course), but I believe it's not easy for you to watch dubbed movies. We (Germans) are used to watching such movies, so it's not a big deal. But try to watch in German with subtitles. Actors are really good!
