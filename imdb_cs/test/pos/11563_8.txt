Wide unknown strange little western colors with colors (probably the same material used in "Johnny Guitar", I think "Trucolor" or something that makes blood drops look like shining rubies), almost surreal scenes with twisted actions and characters. Something else, far from masterpieces, but more attention should be paid to this little gem in Western encyclopaedias.
