It's a movie with a theatrical message mixed with some clever moments. Films such as these are stretching places of great actors, they like to throw the ball into open pieces like these. An angel who is not what we see in old books and churches is quite a nice change. This is reflected in the work of Kevin Smith, Dogma, almost in the same grotesque vein. <br /> <br /> - = 0) Watch this movie on a good day after you put everything on it. is trying to be complicated that we forget the simple movements of movies like this? Maybe one of the funniest pieces I've seen in a while, I stumbled upon this one on VHS in the basket because someone basement was flooded this summer, and I grabbed a couple of tapes. <br /> <br /> in a basket or on a silver screen, a mild comedy like this is fun, you just don't have to tell everyone in a hip-hop club that you like or swank political parties. Just keep it to yourself and I bet a lot of people borrow it from time to time.
