Yes Barney is nonsense now, but when I was a kid, it made perfect sense. <br /> <br /> I didn't get smarter, but I enjoyed it. As a child I was mocking because no one could tell my name, so I changed it. Since I was 4, I went by the name of Tina from barney because I could relate to being from another culture. I'm 17 and barney is a huge part of my life. ... my name came out of it .... I can't Dis show I grew up no matter how silly it seems now. <br /> <br /> I don't care if I blocked I have nothing more to say. they should not do at least 10 lines because some people don't have much to say. Well done
