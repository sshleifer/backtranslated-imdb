I can't hate the show. When the old (and better) TV set had to hit the bricks, the channel was reformatted and new shows entered. The "Show Attack" is a replacement for the Screen Savers, with 3 co-founders. They were Kevin Rose, Kevin Pereira and Sarah Lane. Brendan Moran also came to be co-hosted, but mostly showed off recordings for the show. Kevin Rose decided to leave the show, and finally there was a contest to see who would be the third guest, but it didn't go off for a reason. Finally (I just learned from this very IMDb messageboard) Sarah Lane and Brendan Moran moved on because (hey, that's what I read) both got married. That was a great secret for me! Now there is a new woman co-host, not-as-hot (my opinion) Olivia Munn. She hides something in the tops she wears while Sarah Lane has a perfect body and has no fear of showing it. <br /> <br /> AHEM! Sorry. <br /> <br /> The "Show Attack" deals with everything young people want to know about. It's music, movies, comics, internet and television. This is a great show. If you don't want to bother cleaning or wasting your time watching MTV, you can get everything you want on AOTS. Some segments and pieces they do are funny. They have regular guests and contributors in the industry, as well as guests ranging from insignificant Internet stars to real big names. to be, I still found the "show attack" to be entertaining, even with its latest lineup.
