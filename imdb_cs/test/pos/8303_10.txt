I think it's a great, classic monster movie for the family. Mole, what machine! A tall creature with a beak, flying green lizards, a Ranthorincus / mayas, or anything else with them, and people from the apes with whom they speak telepathically. The battle of men in rubber suits fighting for a doll for breakfast umm! wonderful! Class, what else can I say? How would they make a remake of it in 2002?
