I didn't plan to leave the review, but when I saw some of the other horrible reviews for this movie, I had to say something. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give away the end or anything, but I'm giving away important points in this review so you need to be aware of that. Short (no-spoiler) version of my review - Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis both kick ass in this movie, and it's a lot of fun. Watch it. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my favorite times. Geena Davis is perfect as an action hero, torn between her existing home life and her mother, and the memories that resurrected her earlier life as a CIA Assassin. Her performance is great because she perfectly plays both aspects of this rather complex character. The performance of Samuel L. Jackson is, as always, also excellent, as a private investigator hired by Geena Davis to look at her forgotten past. He's doing a great job of playing an unwitting sidekick to Geena Davis's tough character. Some of the lines he says in this film are the best he ever used in every movie he was in. Seriously, if you haven't seen it, do it. It's a fantastic story with lots of unexpected twists and turns, and it's very well managed and acted.
