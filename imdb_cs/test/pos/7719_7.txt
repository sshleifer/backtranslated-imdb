First of all, my commentary is a commentary on the first commentator (in addition to the film) and his unfortunate film rating. I think his perspective shows why he is extra and the director is a director. The film was a sweet, sufficient acting performance, an experience of looking at it from a busy work week. It wasn't "The Hours", or "The Matrix", or even "The Color Purple". Most movies won't be. But it wasn't a crap that would "guilty ..." lead you to believe. I'm sorry guy, just my 2 cents. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, it was ultimately a very gay confirmation (+ # 1). He showed a world full of diverse and less than perfect people - you know just like our (+ # 2)! This opened the door to one culture without excluding other cultures (+ # 3). And I like music (+ # 4).
