Injured Tonto stood alone to protect three innocent lives. A malevolent woman who has conquered a deadly plot. Racial tension. Intelligent Indians. These are the things we rarely saw on TV series, but this movie adds them to the mix. Although it is certainly Lone Ranger, the formula is mixed exactly so that those who are tired of this series may still enjoy it. Certainly recommended for all fans.
