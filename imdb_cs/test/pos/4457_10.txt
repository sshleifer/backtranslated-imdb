The name "Lucio Fulci" conveys images of graphic death and mutilation in the mind of fans. With films like "Zombi 2", "City of Living Dead", "The Beyond" and "The New York Ripper", Fulci has a reputation as one of the most original directors in history. Although many of his later films certainly justify his reputation until the release of "Zombi 2" in 1979 Fulcius' films did not contain anywhere near the amount of blood and guts he knows for, in fact they were for most part gore free, instead. relying on more traditional shocks and disturbing images to work. "Don't Torture Duckling" barely contains any gore but ranks as its best. "Don't Torture Duckling" takes place in a small Sicilian town where superstition rules instead of logic. The townspeople are very distrustful of outsiders, as well as something else, often avoiding them. After a series of child murders, though many people descend on the city, including Andrea Martelli (Thomas Milan), who is trying to uncover the truth about murders while they continue to become. This is a remarkable film. It's very well done with an excellent cast full of many Italian cinema favorites. It also includes a solid score as well as many creative camera motion courtesy or Lucio Fulci. But the real "Don't Torture and Duckling" draw is a disturbing nature of the film. Young children, about twelve, are depicted by mocking retarded people, visiting prostitutes and harassed by the sex of an older woman. It also contains some very biting comments from the middle class and the Catholic Church. It's for reasons like this that "Don't Torture and Duckling" was blacklisted all over Europe when it was first released and never been exhibited in the United States. Yet, "Don't Torture Duckling" stands as a monumental achievement in the giallo cinema as well as Lucio Fulci's best work. I really can't recommend it, check it out.
