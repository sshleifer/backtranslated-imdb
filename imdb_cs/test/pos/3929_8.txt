While the HOUSE OF WAX will never be confused with Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or HALLOWEEN, it will try and eventually be successful in being a good addition to a quality horror movie. There is enough tension and plenty of implied gore here to please the young audience today and there is also enough explicit gore to please some purists of yesterday. Overall, it's pretty well done a movie that should do well on DVD. Six children on the way to a football match stuck in the DELIVERANCE environment, and what follows, seems to have been. he pulled out the discarded sequel to Deilverance and the hicks of the hicks seem to taunt the group. In the end, the group has to break up and half of them go to a barren city to get some car workshops. The other half of the group remains in the camp, creating the other half of the film. The wax house has many powers. The first is that she is blessed with a very sympathetic cast. Paris Hilton is fine in her role, but she's far from the point of contact. Chad Michael Murray, Elisabeth Cuthbert and Brian Van Holt are three very charismatic actors, and their presence in the film adds some panic, credibility and some enthusiasm. I've never heard of Chad Michael Murray, just that it was a pin-up type of teenage heart. But he has a presence on it. He infiltrates him immaterial, which seems to be reflected in his performance. He is immediately sympathetic and has a strong character. I enjoyed his performance much more than I thought, and when he was on the screen, the movie flowed. The question now is: "Is this film a good horror movie?" And the answer is loud YES. As I mentioned above, it's not in the same class of NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET or LAST HOUSE ON LEFT, or even RING, but it's quite tense, quite graphic and there are some very imaginative scenes of death. This is not the HOUSE OF WAX your parents told you about. Vincent Price is nowhere to be seen, and when you begin to see the fingers that are cut off and the hot wax covering the coma bodies, you realize that this film is a bit marginal. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see an uncut director X rated version. I bet there's something somewhere more violent than this. Whatever it is, it's a very good entry into the horror genre and it's head and shoulders over weak movies like I know what you did last summer and dark water and a few more. Certainly worth a look. <br /> <br /> 8/10
