The second species from Ramin Bahrani is Chop Shop, a rare breed. It is an American film that tells a story not usually found in American film, the story of a minority living in poverty. It is a work of simple beauty. Shot on site in Queens, New York in the shade of Shea Stadium, Chop Shop is a neo-realism to the core. Featuring the cast of non-actors, it has more in common with Vittorio De Sica's classic Bicycle thieves than anything he did in the United States. There is no score or soundtrack, all music and sounds are diagetic. Watching a great foreign film take us to another world because it's so unusual to see. However this other world is not a post-world war Rome or Istanbul or New Delhi, it is modern New York City. Bahrani tells the story of Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), better known as Ale. He is a 12-year-old Latin American child without parents or family units who would take care of him. He lives in a small room upstairs in a garage where he also works. He shares the same bed with his teenage sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales). Neither of them did a second degree. But even though she is young, she's hard and mature. He acts as the head of a small family. He picks up his sister with work and he does whatever he can to earn money when he doesn't work in a chops shop. He sells a bootleg DVD on the streets and candy in meters. He searches for scrap auto parts and sells them to many car shops lining the street where he lives. Alejandro is a broken heart when he teaches his sister's working night as a prostitute. He himself is not interested in observing the law. Stealing starts, first car parts and later wallets. Like Antonio, the desperate protagonist of bicycle thieves, we can't blame But for being a thief. It's just survival. But and Isamar save in the hope of buying food vending machine for $ 4,500. He sees the van as a way out and there is a lot of optimism. However, as is usually the case with neo-realism, we know that it will only lead to disappointment. Polanco's thrilling performance is what gives Chop Shop the legitimacy. Here is a twelve-year-old character who must be credibly independent and vulnerable to the naive. Whether driving cars to the store, selling movies and Snickers bars or playing with their sister in their filthy room, it's authentic. The Chop Shop is a sober reminder that not all American children grow up in a country of opportunity. But Ale's lifestyle is what many middle-class Americans consider a "third world". They are aware of poverty and deprivation in foreign countries, while drinking coffee and reading the New York Times on Sunday morning, but sticking to it on their own streets. Once you look at the Chop Shop, you will think differently than kids walking on the candy in the subway. <br /> <br /> more reviews at www.mediasickness.com
