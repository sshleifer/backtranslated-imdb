"Five characters looking for an end" must be clearly one of the most intelligent and better episodes of the Twilight Zone ever created because it is an abstract idea and a thoughtful plan where characters have to look for identity and end up in surprise. . You have a military major, a dancer, a bag, a clown and a hobo who all wake up together at the bottom of the wall and no one knows how they got there and don't know who they are. So the episode starts with a very interesting drama and tension from the start, so it is the soul seeking the interest of viewers who want to know the characters of true identity and background. In addition, the episode even adds more intrigue to placing different types of characters with different perspectives and lifestyles with one goal that is common to escape and to find identity and peace that is very convincing for the viewer. Until the end, I do not want to spoil those who have not seen the surprise of the fall! Prove that many times you will want to stay where you are away in your small protected world and be far from the world of other people, as you will see characters that people in another form love in a different way. A really great and cleverly made surprise that makes the viewer an unexpected and cruel fate that sometimes occurs in search and search.
