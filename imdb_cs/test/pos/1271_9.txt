British director Chrstopher Nolan now has a career in America and a reputation for making both popular and critically acclaimed films; but this little movie was where he started. And he certainly showed his talent, with his striking black-and-white cinematography and achronological narration that predestined his later 'Momento', though less extreme. Thematically and mechanically, the story reminded me of David Mamet's "House of Games", but the film still feels fresh and sharp until the last turn of the end, whose taste was expected, but whose sharpness is unexpectedly excellent. In contrast, acting is not entirely in the same class - the film has a stylized quality and perhaps more than the director intended. But it is still a great debut, at the same time claustrophobic and charming.
