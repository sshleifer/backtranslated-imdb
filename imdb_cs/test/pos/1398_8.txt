Screamers is an Italian fantasy film (L'Isola degli Uomini Pesce), which was bought by Roger Corman and released through his New World Pictures. Of course, Corman must carve the initials on him by having one of his footmen (Dan T. Miller) direct, which will give some more gore footage before it is published in the states. L'Isola degli Uomini Pesce is a very fun story about the island of Dr. Moreau. It is 1891 and Claudio Cassinelli is a wreck on a mysterious island with a few newly escaped convicts. Claudio comes with star Barbara Bach and Richard Johnson. Johnson plays sad Edmund Rackham: a man who is able to manipulate scientist Joseph Cotton to turn the local indigenous people into an amphibious deep-sea diving creature (they look like a cross between a black lagoon creature and one of The Humanoids From the Deep). ), the conviction of cotton that mutations are created for the highest scientific and humanitarian motives. When Rackham discovered the lost city of Atlantis, he uses an amphibious creature to plunder his treasures. Sexy Barbara Bach plays a cotton daughter who has a psychic connection with these mutations. In one memorable scene, Bach takes midnight swim with these mutants wearing only a thin white cotton dress that leaves little imagination. Claudio discovers that one of the convicts with whom he befriended has turned into a gills and then all hell is released. Recorded at the same time and in the same place as Zombi 2, Richard Johnson didn't do You don't even have to change suits between movies. The house where the experiments are conducted is the same house that Johnson uses to conduct experiments in Zombi. 2. Talk about economic filming! Another footage includes a few bloody executions (a way to go Roger!), and a ridiculously bad Cameron Mitchell who does the best pirate imitation. Only a parrot is missing.
