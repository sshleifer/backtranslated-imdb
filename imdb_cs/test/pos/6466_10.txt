This is one of the best performances of Cassavetes. The entire cast is excellent, as is the subversively undervalued direction of Martin Ritt. The anger, anxiety and despair of the city's work battles is beautifully said in a way that is neither disturbing nor elevated. In a way, it is dated to its time, but in many ways it is enthusiastically timeless.
