I loved this movie! It was amazingly touching and funny. Finally, here's a story about a group of people struggling with some challenges, running around a bit, and then deciding to be alone and end up happy; When was the last time you saw it in the movie? Characters dealing with the fluency of life, love and sexuality face real problems (albeit in often absurd situations, such as a group trip of men and explicit reactionary relationships) and manage to learn and grow without preaching, darkly desperate, or too unrealistic. You will love and care for characters who are far from hollow stereotypes, portraying real people with just a touch of truth for their wannabe labels. Good Roma for Saturday afternoon, and the only movie I've ever seen where sexual fluency ends happily, and no one is forced to be anything he doesn't want to be. Much better than kissing Jessica Stein, a good choice if you're tired of watching gay movies that have some painful lesson and bitter lesson. Or maybe you're like a good British guy? James Purefoy looks as always and Tom Hollander is deliciously entertaining. So go, watch, enjoy; you will not regret!
