This film is important for those of us who are interested in Western history because they use authentic techniques in their work. <br /> <br /> Car scenes are particularly authentic; as far as I know, it only contains scenes that were ever filmed and illustrate river crossing techniques in bluffing. Horses and mules must be lowered to the surface of the river and the wagons dropped with ropes and pulleys. The scene is that I could watch it over and over again just to get a feel for the transition ... and early travelers did it over and over again when crossing the country. Melodrama aside, this image is as authentic in dress and style as it comes and is worth watching alone.
