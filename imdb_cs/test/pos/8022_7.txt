I have to say I wasn't expecting this movie, but it wasn't bad at all. Of course, Aidan Quinn's performance was most striking. I would never expect to see this good actor as an action hero. The great thing about it is that it really builds its character (Annibal). It wasn't like Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis did it, he was sensitive and modest. For example, he's really upset when he kills someone. I also noticed that some cliches had avoided. When Annibal gets his training, you would easily expect to be a rebel and act like any average American in such a situation, ask what's going on, and refuse to cooperate. But Annibal is a professional naval officer, not giving up and trying not to lose his courage, which he does quite well, except for a short break on Christmas Eve, which I think is very realistic. I'm glad Aidan Quinn got this opportunity to show him another side (actually two because he also plays the bad guy), even though the film wasn't that successful.
