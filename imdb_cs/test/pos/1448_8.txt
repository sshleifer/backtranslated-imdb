Frank Sinatra took on this role, chewing it with the rest of the scenery, and - threw it in the way. TMWTGA is a stage, the end is rubbing, some scenes need a little more cutting, but that's all. It's great fun from start to finish, and when you look at it, you realize that Sinatra, the long-dead MOR crooner, had drug addicts, card game gangster, and the entire American urban hustle and bustle thing in his blood - he didn't learn it from acting coach. There are all kinds of overhead touches to keep you entertained, and a (non-dated) soundtrack brews all the way. Marathon card game beat Goodfellas, Sopranos, etc. Forty years! Wasn't it a faithful book? What movie is it? And I can't imagine remembering it if Brando was released; the cool Turkish scenes would be embarrassing instead of nervous, convincing, and moving with Sinatra. No one else mentioned the confused, lazy, cynical cop - absolutely in place! And Eleanor Parker would drop me on a slap.
