"The Dresser" is a small but absolutely amazing movie, with Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay acting brilliantly. As the little film attracted enough attention in the world to win five major Oscar nominations in 1983, it is a mystery to me, but it is nice to know that the Academy can once and for all be exposed to good taste (of course, they awarded that year to conditions of giftedness ‚Äù- after all, they do not want to be accused of showing TOO a lot of taste). Albert Finney is a drunken Shakespearean actor in the production of "King Lear"; Tom Courtenay is a man who works twice behind his back to keep this actor from the lights. It is both cheerful and tense when we see Courtenay's figure showering Finney with attention and affection, just to see that his efforts are totally undervalued and rejected, even to the very bitter end. Finney and Courtenay work wonders together, and although Finney gets the most beautiful moments (he does do lecturing Shakespeare after all), Courtenay's heart and movie soul. <br /> <br /> Level: A
