I think all the reviewers have really captured this film. I've seen it many times, but I still feel a sense of joy and warmth just as I did for the first time. My emotional reaction to this film never looks like. The last scene certainly brings me to tears, but also the scene between Perks and The Children on his birthday. And as for the gentleman. Something else is happening with this character. Generous provider and problem solving. He knows everything about everything and has connections everywhere. He is the perfect father who leads us to safety. I do not know how the film does it, but it touches something very deep English deep inside, which has long been based on our everyday experience, yet we all recognize and desire again.
