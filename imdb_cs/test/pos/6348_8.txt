Let me first say that I am a huge fan of the original Lonesome Dove series and the book from which it was founded. I postponed the observation of this sequel for a better part of 10 years because of the bad reviews I heard about him. If Tommy Lee Jones didn't play the captain, I called that I didn't see it. If Larry McMurtry didn't care, why should I care? How wrong I was. This is in many ways worthy of the continuation of Lonesome Dove, perhaps even more than the dark mood of Laredo. Story, play, production, cinematography are top. Of course the script is not as colorful as Lonesome Dove, but it has moments. And to my surprise, there are pieces of Lonesome Done in this series; The relationship between July and Clara, completely released in the prequel, is brought up almost identical to the book, which is a very welcome surprise. The story is not all a rose, it is also a surprise. The biggest surprise is Jonathan's interpretation of Capt. Although not a direct copy of Tommy Lee Jones, his faithful and unique is his credit. The bet is fantastic across the board and I don't think Rick Schroeder does a better job than in this series. Oliver Reed practically steals the show, is great in a role that gives you the care of his character as much as when you hate him. bad criticism, especially the fact that the DVD is so affordable (I have a 2-disc set for $ 10.99, you'll probably find it cheaper). In any case, it is not disappointing that the dead man's corridor fell (well, it was for me). And MCMurtry did this!
