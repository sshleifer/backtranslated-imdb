'Apocalypse Now Redux', Francis Ford Coppola's opus is probably the most beautiful war movie I've ever seen. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is a Vietnamese soldier deployed to head a very dangerous and highly classified mission to Cambodia to "collapse" Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a highly regarded and highly acclaimed soldier, seemed to go completely crazy and out of the army, set up his own small company and helped the cult following of the soldiers. Escorting him to the Cambodian River is a handful of navy men and they meet some interesting people along the way (the most famous of them being Kilgore Robert Duvalla, Colonel Colonel with a few screws loose) and some terrifying situations. 'Apocalypse' is a less historic war film than philosophical and psychological studies. It's more 'Full Metal Jacket' than 'Platoon'. The runtime of 'Apocalypse' is over three hours, but the movie is so beautiful and convincing that when the movie came to an end, I was really surprised at how much time had passed. Beautiful cinema, however, is surely what made me the most. After seeing this film, I believe Coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in film history. The 'Godfather' films were all colored in almost sepia tone, and the shadows created a Baroque composition. With 'Apocalypse', there is an incredible use of natural light, and shadows, especially in scenes with Brando and Sheen, almost become a living character, they are so penetrating and effective. Another wonderful scene was when Cpt. Willard and Jay Hicks (Frederic Forrest) were in the jungle looking for mangoes and hit a tiger. The enormity of the surrounding leaves themselves (leaves as large as the house) made the characters almost Lilliputian, but the scene was incredible. While everything else was almost dimmed, the leaves were incredibly bright green, a particularly striking effect. Another really small positive moment in the film was the great scene where the Duvall and Helicopter helicopters attacked a small village while playing Wagner. This could be a very dramatic basic soundtrack to the scene, but instead Coppola transforms the song into a real part of the scene, saying Duvall says he likes to play it when they're about to frighten them. ". <br /> <br /> Performances in 'Apocalypse' are first-class. Much has been made of the amount of money Brando has earned for the film, and the many problems it has caused. The relatively short amount of screen time Sheen is absolutely exceptional - is it the first time I've seen him really in the movie - and Duvall is a lot of fun looking like Kilgore loony. 'Apocalypse Now' is a movie that is now so popular in pop culture (best known from several film lines: "I love the scent of napalm in the morning" and al.) But I didn't know enough about it that there were a lot of surprises they had experienced, I haven't seen the original cut of "Apocalypse Now" so I can't compare it to this newer cut, but that's a movie that should be more experienced. 8/10 <br /> <br /> --Very
