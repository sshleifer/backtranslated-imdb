This is a classic case of a superb movie that the American public only watches because Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenneger doesn't have the lead man - Adrian Quinn has a better double performance, that's true, you've heard the dual performance in this movie, than any of those who have ever withdrawn into their careers! Anyway, now to review ... The assignment is loosely based on the story of Carlos Jackal, a 1970s radical who terrorized Europe for years before French agents finally arrested her. In this adaptation, an American naval officer (Adrian Quinn) is on vacation in Israel when he is detained by Mossad (Isreal's crack intelligence agency / counter-terrorism agency) and has been questioned for the fact that he looks just like a jackal is one of those the most distinctive parts of the film, but believe me that it does not detract from the great value of this film). When it is discovered that Mr. Ramirez is not a jackal, he is employed by a hard CIA agent named Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, who routinely, but tremendously, with his usual mysterious ruling government authority). He has spent his life hunting jackals, and a series of actions that follow will appeal to anyone looking at this film - it is full of great acting, without all the usual action movie clich√©s and one-chamber films and a great plot that will surprise someone. The three leading men - Quinn, Sutherland, and Kingsley - carry this film much further than his modest budget would allow anyone else to fill shoes. Also, the way to the director and his staff, camera angles and cinematography are excellent, especially in action scenes. The task is better than anyone who could ever expect it, its a shame that the movie at the box office was pretty bad, otherwise we could see the sequel to this amazing espionage thriller. 9/10 stars, this reviewer HIGHLY recommends to all potential viewers!
