Bring Back The A-team was an hour-long special featured on Channel 4 in the UK last year, hosted by moderator and comedian Justin Lee Collins, who tried to track down and reunite the A-Team team. , first time on TV. That was something nobody ever tried. Well, not anyone I know is. Justin makes a great moderator and his eccentric personality and humorous joking shone throughout this program. The attempts he has made in getting members to cast are always so funny, but he was also very persistent and eager to accomplish this task, too, which is due to him that I would say. Remember it's great on TV - whether it's a show like this or a Night Night project with its co-organizer Alan Carr. With Dirk Benedict there were appearances and interviews - Faceman himself, Dwight Schultz - aka Howling Mad Murdock, Marla Heasley, who played Tawnia Baker, Jack Ging aka General 'Bull' Full Bright, A-team creator , Stephen J Cannell and the great man himself, Mr. T aka BA Baracus. They were simply fascinating to watch and hear what they were saying about a program that became a global hit in the 1980s, when they remember and experience good and bad moments of the show: both behind the scenes and behind the scenes. Unfortunately, no George Peppard, but of course he's in heaven, of course, and strangely enough, not Melinda, who played Amy. I just didn't understand why she didn't show up at the show. Okay, she was after 3 seasons or whatever, but she was the first and original member of the A-team - just to be replaced by Marla Tawnia and it would be great to see and hear her side to A Team Story, besides other cast members. All in all, Bring Back The-Team was a great documentary style show. Maybe it could be more widespread, which could be a six-part documentary. However, it was a great effort on the part of JLC.
