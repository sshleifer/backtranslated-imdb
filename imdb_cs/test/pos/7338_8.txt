"Gymnast" develops in short shots and short scenes, revealing his characters and messages over time. The replacement cut is accompanied by a beautiful, simple score. This intimate approach is amazing for the feeling that you are on the path of discovering as much as characters. Replacement access is also a drawback; There are several scenes that are confusing because they don't have enough contexts. There are some characters' decisions that seemed to be more flipping than I was watching the interviews that were in the bonus materials. I'm glad I did, because the actors' descriptions of their motivations gave me a much better understanding of the film overall. <br /> <br /> In addition to the story itself, it was amazing to see women as comfortable and strong in their own bodies. Shooting was very tasteful; very factual. One feels that he sees a love story and a life story unfolds, not a voyeur sleaze movie. The physicality of athletes - their reality - is a great contrast to the sometimes ethereal nature of the plot. It's not a movie I will have to see again in the foreseeable future, because the storyline is simple but its delivery is strong enough to stay with me for a long time.
