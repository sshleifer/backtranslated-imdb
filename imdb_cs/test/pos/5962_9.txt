One of Starevich's oldest films, made in France, is perhaps his only political satire. The story of the Frog who wanted the King reflects his name as a group of "crusaders" who believe that democracy has retreated, so they demand from Jupiter to rule their land. When he sends a stump, the frogs ask for another king and say that the stump is just "political wood". This time Jupiter sends a hungry stork, whose frog-eyed frogs engulf the city's inhabitants. As the original "crocodile" is about to slip off the stork's beak, he speaks with his moral word: "Leave yourself alone." This film contains several beautiful crowd scenes of dozens of puppet frogs. Starewicz deceives viewers to believe that everyone is moving at once by holding the background in motion and animating only about six frogs at a time. Slightly sinister dialogue and lighting problems in several places reduce the quality of repetitive inspections, but it is important to monitor its historical significance in Starewicz's life. His feelings towards the government immediately following his escape from Russia are probably expressed in this film. In addition, the technical achievements of animation so many characters at once in the stop-motion movie is overwhelming.
