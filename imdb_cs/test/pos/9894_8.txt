Peter Falk shines as a 90-year-old Morris Applebaum, a patriarch who decided it was time to "try out" after holding the final blow out bash. His three children, Lauran San Giacomo, David Paymer and Judge Reinhold, are informed by a letter and arrive at the doorstep to deal with their eccentric father. There is a great father / daughter chemistry with Laura San Giacomo, whose character happens to undergo the most growth from suffering. It is a well-rounded example of your average, dysfunctional family and their memories, pain, growth and ignorance / tolerance of others' lives. The music score is one that you will like and one liner is well timed and cheerful. Even though I found a real "Checking Out" party, the rest of the movie will make you laugh, cry and leave the theater with a smile on your face. Go through the "Big Fat Greek Wedding" .... "Big Fat Jewish Suicide" has come.
