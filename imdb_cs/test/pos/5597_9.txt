This movie is probably the best Hal Hartley. The theme, unusual originality, is being worked on (that is usual with Hal Hartley) with great humor. This characteristic is not the only quality of this film: the composition of fussy frame (everything is parallel, to the smallest detail), the angles of shooting, the lighting that gives these blurry images a supernatural dimension (Jesus' descent could not be shot in a conventional way), false poser â€œActing, are the qualities that make this biblical re-reading done in the form of apocalyptic delirium necessary.
