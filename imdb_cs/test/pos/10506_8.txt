This movie will undoubtedly not go well with some because most of the horror is mental. But it has something for almost everyone, including a few really cool alien scenes. The film uses extensive extraterrestrial acceptable mythology while showing a bit more intelligence about some aspects of kidnapping myths than you would expect from a movie. Jillian McWhirter is excellent at what must have been an exhausting feat.
