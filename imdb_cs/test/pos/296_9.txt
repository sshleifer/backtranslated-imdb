I've seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and I never enjoy it just because it's perfect. And also has the best film music ever and the best supporting roles he has ever written for the film. I think you only have to love Robert Duval, Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen and Lauerence Fishburn in this film, but especially Duval. I can't believe Kramer vs. Kramer won the Oscar instead of this amazing war movie. So this is my conclusion if you take the director of the greatest film in the world (The Godfather) and the best of the Hollywood actors you can succeed. Now I have to reverse something to read this preview, so read it down to the last line. This movie rules !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
