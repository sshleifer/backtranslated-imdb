I saw this film when he was released to smaller cinemas in the UK 50 years ago; and memory remains from the great musical score and tragedy of the story. I recently saw it on video. The soundtrack was bad and the image was grainy; but it's one of the two movies I saw the next day, the other is Gladiator. The musical theme is intensely tragic and from the beginning one knows that it announces failure or death. Surely one of George Sanders' best performances; as a man working on the black market he returned for what he lost in the war, but nemesis is waiting; Patricia Roco plays a refugee from Eastern Europe who ate with despair. She attracts her, selflessly wants to help her, and then falls in love with her, but she is too proud and hurt to receive help. Their love will destroy him and inevitably the girl and the doctor (Herbert Marshall), who brought the nemesis. The story is about the complex intertwining fates where the secondary characters are not who they seem to be. It is a film that criticizes critics and fights at the box office; But for an adolescent who has seen it, and a retiree who has seen it again, it is one of the greatest films (considering his age), whose story is more like an opera.
