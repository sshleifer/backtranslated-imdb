Two people living in the same complex will find their partners with each other. Also, as they try and get together, they embark on an emotional path that is designed to solve? Following our previous success with Happy Together and Chungking Express, Wong Kar Wai gives us this rather old-fashioned and amazing story of reborn passion, desire and unrequited love. Maybe in the mood for love there is no taste for everyone. It wanders rather lazily at 98mins: not too long for a movie, but it seems longer because not much is really happening. But this lazy feeling hides a relatively tight film. Most of the story is cleverly woven around a series of game roles where characters act on supposed scenarios between their respective husbands, trying to figure out how the matter started. I say cunning because of course it makes it difficult for the audience (and characters) to say "in the role" and what's right. If it all sounds more arty and self-confident, it's because it is. It's incomprehensible. And he has perfected two of Hong Kong's best, Maggie Cheung and Leung Chui Wai, with excellent support from Ping Lam Siu and Rebecca Pan. It is also a virtuoso performance by Wong Kar Wai, who treats the audience with sensory and sensual overload. Joining Christopher Doyle (who later deployed his fresh style to the hero) and Pin Bing Lee (whose beautifully underrated style can be seen in Springtime in a small town) was a cinematic genius. It has all the brave beauty of Doyle without honestly, Athena-poster cheesiness his work on the hero. Music, as always with Wong, is prominent. Since Nat King Cole sings in Spanish, to the haunted strings of the main theme, it perfectly matches the eclectic beauty of the paintings. <br /> <br /> All in all, a top-notch movie, whether it's land, acting, cinematography, or soundtrack. Like Wim Wenders Wings of Desire, this is a beautiful, old-fashioned love story lost and recovered. And watch out for the hotel room Tony Leung 2046, which featured Wong's recent movie of the same name.
