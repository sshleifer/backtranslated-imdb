I've always heard of this great mini-series, but this week I saw it for the first time in July 2007. I see why so many young actors started their careers. The story is interesting and gives a wonderful look into the pre-war and civil war period. I took care of the characters and how their lives evolved during this period. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me find out how people thought during the 19th century. Many historical facts have been cast into the story and it has been interesting to see how historical books come to life. Costumes and sets were wonderful! I enjoyed watching both parts I and II thoroughly. Part III is disappointing.
