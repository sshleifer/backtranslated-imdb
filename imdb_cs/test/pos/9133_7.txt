When I finally caught up with this "masterpiece", it occurred to me that it must have been so clever today. It is French, art, insufficiently played to the point of suffering, and finally it is negative. But from the perspective of 37 years in the future, it is just a bit unnecessary, arrogant and unsatisfactory. Others have summed up the story, but I don't think anyone would point out a dramatic mistake in the heart of this movie: the main characters, Corey and Vogel, really don't deserve what they get. They play a square within their code, never hurt anyone who has not asked for it, and show great courage and initiative. In particular, Corey is the victim of his former gangland friend, who stole the girl and repeatedly tries to kill him, apparently precisely because (Corey) dared to "borrow" several thousand francs. These are the guys who should be for a break! Instead, things get much worse than actually needed, in the story's logic. It could be argued that this is the whole thing: that real villains will never be caught; that they agree with the police as needed, sell out their friends and always go to the top. But it is not even shown. Corey's old gangster friend didn't show up with the police. Nor is he enthusiastic about his victory. In fact, after materialization several times when it is needed, there is nowhere to be seen, so the dramatic tension (his feud with Corey) is completely unresolved! However, I would say that this film is worth seeing its beautiful photo, its slow, deliberate pace, its great corpse showing, its elaborate heist sequence, and its encapsulation of art-film style 1960s.
