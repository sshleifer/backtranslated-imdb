Great British director Christopher Nolan (Momento, Insomnia), director of this special film about a struggling writer obsessed with the following people. First it turns out to be harmless, but soon it becomes dangerous after the game takes a step further after meeting a like-minded man who shows him how to break and enter. Both men soon find themselves in a strange world that includes mafia and prostitution. Jeremy Theobald plays the writer and Alex Haw's like-minded friend. Both are great performances. This low-budget movie was filmed as a guerrilla style without permission for all places and no big stars, but it has what many huge budget movies it has, which is a clever script and creative direction. Impressive debut of one of today's best directors. Good things!
