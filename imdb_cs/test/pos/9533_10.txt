Edith Nesbitt's best book has been edited into a truly spectacular movie, I love it. The film itself has wonderful cinematography and perfect implementation of the subject. The end is enough to keep you in tears as it is so beautifully done. Lionel has directed some really great movies, such as the amazing Mr. Blunden, but this is his best film as a mile director. The costumes were absolutely beautiful, that was the beauty of the landscape, and helped the bright and comfortable script. However, it's the quality of acting that keeps this movie together because it's not shorter than incredible. Dinah Sheridan is properly honest as a mother, a much needed character character, and Bernard Cribbins was jolly like Perks. In fact, I preferred Perks in the movie because it's not so funny in the book. The kids were perfect. Gary Warren and Sally Thomsett both gave lively performances, but it's a glamorous portrayal of Jenny Agutter Bobbie who was most interested in me. Another special mention is the wonderful music of Johnny Douglas, the title music reminded me of Charlie Chaplin's Smile. In conclusion, I think it's a funny and charming masterpiece that is better than a book. 10/10. Bethany Cox.
