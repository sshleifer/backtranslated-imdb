Hugh Hudson (Chariots of Fire), a beautifully acclaimed director, creates a story that brings the whole of John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, and Tarzan to the apes to life with respect and dignity and a range not yet apparent in Tarzan's films. Christopher Lambert debuts in the role of the young Lord, raised in the wild by female gorilla after his parents die in Africa. Later, he returned to what was a strange world to him, class and privilege, feeling absolutely in place. As soon as he learns what happened to the apes that resurrected him, and their world realizes they must return. A sad but winning story told against the backdrop of fantastic views. This is one of those movies that is needed for every Cinemaphile collection.
