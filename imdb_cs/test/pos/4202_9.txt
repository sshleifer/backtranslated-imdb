A very good 1939 film where John Garfield plays another boxer who becomes a victim when everyone thinks he has committed a murder. The trouble is, the murderer and Garfield's girl, Ann Sheridan, has killed in a short but good performance while trying to escape the police. A crooked lawyer convinces Garfield to flee New York, who lands in Arizona and meets the Dead End children. They were sent there by a financial program to help them avoid other problems. Of course, Garfield will find a new love interest, but he must cover up his identity as everyone. He thinks he wasn't just a murderer, but was a car accident victim. May Robson is fabulous because of a grandmother who runs to a teenage place. Claude Rains is also effective in the role of a detective who suspects Garfield is still alive and haunts him when a picture rips him out in Arizona. The film really deals with Garfield's relationship with boys. While the end is good, you want to see Garfield return to N.Y. to claim his innocence.
