When the CHINESE SYNDROME was released, a lot of right-wing pro-nuke critics and supporters pushed the film out, especially since its three leading stars were known for their liberal politics and overt distrust of nuclear power. But it took only two weeks and an almost catastrophic accident on Three Mile Island closed down the critics. Fonda and Douglas are members of LA who are witnessing the potentially nasty crash of the Ventana nuclear power plant. Douglas film event through soundproof glass plant; but the TV station will not broadcast the footage because it fears a massive trial. So it is up to Fonda and Douglas to get to the truth, despite the massive attempt of the plant owners to cover up the accident. But the conscientious shift manager (Jack Lemmon) revealed some deficiencies in the pump support structure. He believes these defects were the cause of the accident and that, even if the repairs were not carried out, the next accident could be apocalyptic. But he cannot trust anyone who works with him with his story. The result is a horrific climax that pulls various political, technological and human rights stories together in one disturbing package. Although it is probably quite politically liberal in nature, CHINA SYNDROME, well-managed and co-authored by James Bridges (The PAPER CHASE), is also basically a message about the intrinsic dangers of technology and nuclear energy. Nuclear energy cannot be basically safe because people NEVER can be perfect. That's the movie he says; and in a very fun and exciting way he says it brilliantly.
