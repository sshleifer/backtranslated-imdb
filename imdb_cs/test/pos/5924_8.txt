1. watched 10/10/2009 - 8 out of 10 (Dir - Billy Wilder): A spectacular view of Lindbergh's famous flight by James Stewart as Lindbergh and director Billy Wilder. There is not really a lot of background in this story, but it's fine because Wilder makes the event really remarkable because it comes directly from Lindbergh's perspective because he used his book as the basis of the film. This early flying film must also be one of the best about the act itself. Stewart talks and thinks about himself during the flight giving you so much insight into what Lindbergh has gone through in this 33 hour solo flight across the Atlantic. And he did the whole flight without sleeping all night - which is amazing! There is a bit of backstory about how he bought the plane and got funding, and some flashbacks about his life during the flight, but the movie is mostly about the flight. The story is also beautifully made and photographed and it is a pleasure to watch over his age. I appreciate the fact that they haven't cast a lot of fluff and let the story say it alone. Good work. This is a classic movie that should be seen by all.
