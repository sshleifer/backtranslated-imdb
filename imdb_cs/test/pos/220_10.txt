After reading all these reviews, I am very surprised to find that no one has ever noticed that this show was based on the fact that I read NBC Police Show "M Squad" starring Lee Marvin in 1957 to 1960 reviews that compare it to "Dragnet" and some of Quinn Martin's police officers show, but if you look at the M Squad, you'll see it was based on it. In the late 1958 episodes of M Squad onwards, you see Lee Marvin who plays Lieutenant Detective Frank Ballinger to get out of his car and then shoot himself on, and he shoots back, the start of the police unit is basically the same (including Jazz Music) and then Lee Marvin tells what's going on (Im Lieutenant Detective Frank Ballinger, M Squad, Special Department of Chicago Police) and in Police Squad Leslie Neilsen does the same (Im Detective Lieutenant Frank Drebin, Police Unit, Special Department of Police Department) and so on, in one from the episodes of M Squad there is also a character of Johnny Shoeshine and in the episode M Squad called "More Deadly" there is a police unit episode "The Gift of the Broken" which is the same story!
