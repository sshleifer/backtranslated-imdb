For the first time I saw "Death in Venice" in 1971 about 15 years ago, I found it deeply moving and often thinking about it. I watched it again a few days ago and realized that it was close to the highlights of the great cinemas. Hardly any dialogue attracts the viewer with beautiful cinematography, fine acting and above all Mahler's music, without which the film simply cannot exist. "Death in Venice" is a stunning Luchino Visconti adaptation of the Thomas Mann short story about the famous composer (in the novella he was a writer but making him a composer in the film was a great idea that works admirably) Gustav von Aschenbach (loosely founded to Gustav Mahler) who travels to Venice in the summer of 1911 to recover from personal losses and professional failures. His quest for beauty and perfection seems complete when he sees a boy with incredible divine beauty. Ashenbach (Dirk Bogard) follows the boy everywhere he never approached him. The boy, Tadzio, was one of the very rare creatures who possess a mysterious and incomprehensible power that captivates you, enchants you, conquers you, and makes you your prisoner. Ashenbach became one of the prisoners of the magical spell Tadzia. He became addicted to him; he fell in love with him. Was it a blessing or a curse for him? I think both of them. He died of an unattainable, impossible, but beautiful love that the object itself was perfection. The last picture that Ashenbach captured was the image of a boy's silhouette surrounded by the sea and golden sunlight. Nothing could be compared to the beauty and charm of the scene and take death with you to the grave that one can only dream of. If he could, Ashenbach would probably say, "I was able to witness one of the faces of perfection, I could not bear it, but I was chosen to know that it exists in this world, and now I can die in peace because An unforgettable music, Gustav Mahler's haunted adagietto his fifth symphony found perfect use in a perfect movie. Reflecting all the emotions of the main character - sobbing, craving, asking for hope and summarizing the idea that once you are blessed to come to beauty, you are doomed to death. I can come up with hundreds of films that use classical music to perfection, but nothing is ever compared to "death in Venice." I dare say that Mahler's music is his main character - it would change and change depending on what's happening on the screen. It sounded triumphant when Ashenbach returned to Venice for what he thought would be his luck, but turned to his death. It sounded gloomy when he first entered Venice from the sea. You hear so many different feelings in it - tenderness and adoration, confusion and self-resentment, worship and melancholy, but always - LOVE, which gives the purest happiness and breaks the heart (literally). The film for the viewer is similar to what the boy was for an aging composer / writer / artist. We are enchanted and captivated by her strength and beauty, just as Achenbach was the mysterious magic of a boy.
