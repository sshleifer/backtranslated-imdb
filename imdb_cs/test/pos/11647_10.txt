Dead Man Walking, absolutely brilliant, in tears to the end! You can't watch this movie and think about the questions it raises; how you can justify killing (whether it be murder or death penalty) and to what extent forgiveness (not just spiritual) is possible. Don't look at this movie when you're down! But WATCH IT!
