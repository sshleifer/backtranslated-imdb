Buddy Holly Story opens on a yellow neon moon on the roof of the ice rink in Lubbock, Texas in 1956. As credits begin, the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot, to the roller stadium, past concessions, and through the ice rink to a small stage where the little band does their audible checks. It's a tracking shot of Welles and Scorcese would both appreciate. It interrupts Buddy Holly's face as she looks down at the intense concentration as she grabs the headphones and talks to the man who puts the band on the radio. Young Gary Busey plays Buddy Holly and his performance is crucial. He must somehow show the passion Holly needed for her music to film. This is a rock and roll story without lines of coke chasing heroin shots and a fifth of whiskey. It's not about a man with a few women to choose between a sexual scandal, abandoned by a lustful tragedy. This is a film about a nice Texas boy who respected his parents and went to church and had the same girlfriend for 5 years and fell in love with rock and roll. Busey finds that spark and burns, his passion is clear and infectious. In fact, he plays the guitar in the movie and sings, it's not overly with Holly's recordings. Busey was a young boy in Hollywood in the seventies, a struggling actor as well as a more fighting rock musician. So, he gives great performance, because although he is not Buddy Holly, he is in a similar situation. His first song is the old classic Les Paul, "Mockingbird Hill" and he has the country to stuff it. Another kid is calling for some bop, and against his two band friends (in fact Crickets were 3 guys, but down-sized work fine for the movie's limited story) leads them to screaming into "Rocking with Ollie Vee". Children love it and parents hate it. The DJ on the rolling tapes records it and is later released in New York without Buddy Holly knowing it was ever recorded. This leads to the funniest scene in a movie filled with funny moments. An upset Buffalo disc jockey calls Buddy home. The DJ played "It's gonna be a day" for 12 hours and goes to 24. The police are banging on the barricated door of the station. Holly is confused, but he's quite excited when the dust settles down. He tells the boys and begins their meteoric rise. Dan Stroud as a drummer and Charles Martin Smith as a bassist have a perfect finish for the band and have good chemistry. There are problems, but not an exaggerated drama that is found in most rock (all?) Biopics. The movie isn't manipulating you too. Your emotions are rising, but they are not manipulated. When Crickets enters the Apollo stadium in Harlem, the first white band to ever play there, she bursts into the electrically charged "Oh Boy" and wins the audience, my loving ass with rock and roll choking and crying. Next, Busey and the boys make "It's so easy" to sound funkier and more soulful than I would believe possible. Anyone who even has a cursory knowledge of Buddy Holly's story will know where this movie will end. Holly died too young in a plane crash with Richie Valens and Big Bopper. As the audience knows, the film is so well written, directed and lovingly that we will almost forget it. The film is not about his death, it's about his life and his place in rock and roll history. The film ends with his latest performance and it is a good fifteen minutes Busey swinging the obsessed spirit of Buddy Holly. I was glad to hear him say it was "Not Fade Away", my favorite song. The film freezes before the end of the crash crash credits, but I barely noticed. I kept thinking about how good the last song was.
