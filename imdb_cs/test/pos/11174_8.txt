Lucasarts withdrew another beauty from a seemingly bottomless bag of great games. If further proof is required to control this game genre, then it is it. Before playing the game, it was a little worried how the writers would stick to the gags after the first two games. Worries were widespread that it would be a little skinny. <br /> <br /> Play the game and see how quickly these fears disappear. From the introductory video with Guybrush in the boat dodgem (!), After the final stage in the carnival, the jokes continue. I was a great fan of the first two games and the other Lucasarts works (Day of The Tentacle, Sam & Max, etc.) And that doesn't break the quality. You won't be disappointed. (Well, I wasn't.)
