The title of the movie seems to be sufficient given the personality of the lead character, Fans. He is an older man living in the late autumn of his life, but a frolic about being a joyful boy who has just entered the spring meadow. The fragility of old age and the warning signs of death are all illusions for him. His wife supports this idea as she watches, "The fan is laughing at funerals and death." In other words, death is not something that Fanda takes too seriously; it has more important things than worrying about what is already inevitable. Life, however, and the pursuit of a living life to its fullest, is a philosophy that governs Fanda's existence. He is not the only one to exist, but he must live every day and every moment, for tomorrow is not guaranteed. The movie seems to give a strong comment on life as if it wasn't tomorrow, let alone death. Too many people take life too seriously and as a result the real life part of life is missing. For example, Fanda's wife; he is so concerned about preparing for death, not in any religiously conspiring way, but in too practical, even lifeless, forgetting how to smile, laugh and just have fun. Her humanity seemed to have turned into a zombie auto-pilot mode. On the contrary, Fan is perhaps too stupid and absent for his own good. She needs a man like his wife, Emilie, to help him cope. The fan has the invincible spirit of a child as a child trapped in an older man's body. He is introduced as an adventurous type; he pretends to be that he is not human to gain, he is losing money, he is actually lying and he is always good at laughing. Deep, but he's a kind and tender old man who wants to be subordinate to his overly pragmatic woman. Both of them set themselves up pretty well, though neither of them recognizes the binary quality of their relationship until they metaphorically hit death: meaning, their divorce. During this scene, Fanda realizes the reality of death and what it means when it is separated from its only love. His wife is emotionally reminiscent of all her shortcomings, yet she is tenderly attracted to continue to love him despite his crazy behavior. At the moment she forgave him, Fanda is aware of his selfish behavior that leads to his wife being captured and has made an internal commitment to be happy. Ironically, when this commitment happens, it becomes what his wife later calls a "living corpse". Life-blood drips in it as it becomes more like her? Zombies go through day-to-day moves. He seems to no longer live but exists. For example, he gives up his zany pranks, does not spray money, stops smoking due to his wife (not his health), and overall, only makes up for what she wants him. In short, it is changing because it wants it to be happy. The binary quality of their relationship is beginning to disappear. Realizing that her husband is not who he was is the part of Emilie who lacks the old Fan. She misses her husband's vigilance and the struggles they had, because it was in those moments when they actually lived, not just existed. <br /> <br /> I believe the creators tried to get through a specific message. that true and loving relationships will not always be easy or comfortable, but often they will sacrifice and persist in order to awaken seemingly bad times. The possibility of death at any moment is what reminds people to live every moment. Life is often taken for granted, but when it is threatened by death, whether it is a literal or figurative person awake from his ungrateful polite, and wakes up to live life to the full. It is as if they are afraid they will never live again, so they will enjoy it the best. The fan and Emilie married 44 years on the road, but it wasn't until they were both threatened with the possibility of separating death, which began to show its true colors. How old the principle is: "Love does not know its own depth until an hour of separation." They both begin to see what's most important in life, and these are the people they meet on the way. More importantly, the intimate relationships they do with their significant others.
