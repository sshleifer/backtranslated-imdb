This short film was nominated for the Academy, lost to Anna and Bella. Not since Dr. Strangel's nuclear war is so cheerful! Condie takes the situation and turns it on her ear, and then makes it spin for good measurement. There are visual gags in Condie's work, and I've always seen something I missed when I looked at it. The world's greatest animation, worth seeing and many other shorts. Recommended.
