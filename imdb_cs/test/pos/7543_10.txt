There are other films about boarding schools and antics students and staff, but "Belles of St. Trinian" rises above them all! The land was thoroughly summarized in other posters, so I won't cover the same place. I just want to say it's a shame it's finally on DVD but in a format that can't be used in the US! :-( <br /> <br /> Enjoy, fans in New Zealand and Australia! And if someone who has it has a move in such things, PLEASE, help get it on Region 1! notified via email when (if I don't say "if") is released on DVD in the United States?
