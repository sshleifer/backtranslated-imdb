* CONNECTED POSSIBLE SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> A friend told me to look at this series, and I'm glad I took her words for her. <br /> <br /> I read the synopsis on the DVD cover and I was immediately impressed. The main protagonist is a Muslim? It's not the first in any way! It's about an FBI agent who is under a deep cover to get into a potential sleeping cell in LA; and get it - he's a practicing Muslim. At first, I was a bit skeptical, half expecting that some hero or adversary might squeeze out stupid, gratuitous and thoughtless fanatics than what was happening. But then I watched the first three episodes and thought: Okay, that's good. It was not until episode four ("Scholar") when I was well and really overwhelmed. I would like to praise the great writing and also the excellent performances of the actors. I just love how complex each of these characters is - it's not two-dimensional cardboard cutouts. Michael Ealy is delivering amazing and believable performance as a Muslim FBI agent, Darwyn Al-Sayeed, treading a fine line between being a good Muslim and being a man with disabilities. Oded Fehr gives Farik an interesting depth to his character - Farik is not a typical Middle Eastern stereotype, but someone who truly believes in his thing and does not see himself as a fanatic, but a man willing to take any extreme action to justify his beliefs. It is very charismatic and authoritative. However, I would say that it was Alex Nesic's performance, which clearly left me in the "Scholar". His depiction of his character's emotional struggle was amazing - torn between the gently spoken words of a Muslim scholar who encouraged him to return to a non-aggressive way because it is the only acceptable way in God's eye and Farik's beliefs to believe otherwise. I look forward to seeing another show like this, and not some ridiculously one octane series. It's smart and open.
