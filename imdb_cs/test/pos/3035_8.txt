I saw Conraca at night when I couldn't sleep, and I was never so happy to have insomnia! This story of a young white teacher who occupies the position of a teacher of poor black children on the island of Carolina is a great advertisement for teaching and for simple help. Set in the early 1960s with civil rights issues, Vietnam and the US. all that came with the 1960s is that it is forgotten that the Peace Corps and many young people went to help the unhealthy people. Conrack, with his open style of teaching, is interested in these children as people, and encourages honest interaction in his life. a class that scares the power that it is. The biggest part was that Jon Voight said they had 20 years of reunion and 18 of these children became teachers! Its enough to make you think we as people can have a chance to survive on their own, maybe, hopefully.
