(Note: I saw that I sold DEAD at Glasgow International Film Festival on January 20, 2009.) I Sell the Dead is a comedy about jet black horror that takes place in late medieval times, and stars Dominic Monaghan (Lost, Lord Rings), Ron Pearlman (Hellboy), Larry Fessenden (Session 9) and Angus Scrimm (Phantasm). The film opens with the grave of thieves Willie Grimes (Fessenden), still indignant and relentless, dragged into the guillotine and executed. His apprentice and criminal partner, Arthur Blake (Monaghan), is locked in the tower and awaits his turn when Father Duffy (Perlman), a whiskey priest who has an unhealthy interest in occult, pays him a visit with the obvious intention of recording Blake's last confession. However, it soon turns out that Duffy's main concern lies in the more ... Blake's exploitation is on the other side. Most of the conspiracy here is told in the form of a flashback, because Monaghan leads Duffy with stories of his mysterious career. Initially Grimes and Blake begin as simple sages who work with cracked bodies. Quint (Scrimm), a ruthless, corrupt anatomist who uses extortion as a lever over our two heroes, and takes some unhealthy pleasures in his work. The couple has their first run-in with the undead when Quint sends them on a mission to a bleak moon heath one night to get a corpse that has been mysteriously buried at an intersection, apparently some ancient habit. But there is something else about this corpse. This one was wrapped in cloves of garlic ... and buried with a nail over his heart ... After a terrifying meeting, not only does a plan to get rid of the shocking doctor's machinations, but also reveal the secret subculture of occultists who pay good money for corpses, and even better money for the undead lifes. This leads our intrepid duo into a hidden underworld of "ghoul hunting" where they are not only headed with vampires, monsters and zombies (and another paranormal entity for which I am not surprised). but also rival ghoul hunters in the form of inbred and murderous Murphy clan. I went to I Sell the Dead, who was expecting a low-budget, low-budget cooler. I wasn't ready for incredible imagination, dizzying humor, good acting performance, great dialogue, a strong atmosphere and a complete personality, making I Sell the Dead a strong predecessor to my horror movie of the year. With the exception of a few rough edges, the production values ​​are really fantastic for such a low budget - it looks like it was about $ 20 million, and I was surprised when the director told the audience that it was made for substantially less than half of it (though he was reluctant to give exact figures how the film was still sold to distributors). "Appearance" and the tone of the film is a visual comic somewhere between Tim Burton and Hammer Horror, with intelligent little Creepshow drawing inserts. The plot is wonderfully unreal, but the idea of ​​a hidden underworld running in parallel with everyday life, which the general people either cannot or does not want to believe, is one that actually makes good sense in the film. Playing as you would expect from this cast is up. The characters are surprisingly well-complemented, especially Grimes and Blake, and all actors bring sharply sketched lines with the right number of dead-finger languages ​​to make the dialogue cheerful and realistic. Angus Scrimm also turns into a rather short but unforgettable role as a gently threatening anatomist for the violinist Doctor Quinn. Conclusion - I loved it. It's been a long time since I've been such a funny movie. I'm trying to say something bad about it. Mark your words, this is one of those cult movies like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm, which people will still discover and fall in love with in 20, 30, 40 years.
