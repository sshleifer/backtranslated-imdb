VHS - I watched it over and over and LOVED every minute enough to order a DVD that I wanted the movie to last longer. I never care about what other people think I prefer to remember, and I totally disagree with negative comments and won't let others spoil my movie experience. Make up your own mind and don't let others put you down! I have all the BBC Jane Austen series, but this is my FAVORITES. I see that in 2007, the new Northanger Abbey will be released, which I will buy when it comes out, but it will not stop me from watching the Northanger Abbey of the 1980s.
