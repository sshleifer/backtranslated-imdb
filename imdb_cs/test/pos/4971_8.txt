This is a great Italian shark movie probably not a full action type shark movie, but it has a great story about a Native American in the form of a shark killer who attacks a small beach community. the movie has real scenes of real sharks and some not but as they did it is quite a good cast are not that brilliant playing in this shark movie but it shows better playing in some other films of the Italian shark such as (eg cruel jaws, last shark) they show some bad performances, but most Italian shark films are good, which means that these voices are the best Italian best shark ever, some scenes in this movie show violence / gore, which makes this movie good best movie for all shark-movie-fans.
