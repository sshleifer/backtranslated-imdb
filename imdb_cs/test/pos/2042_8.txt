Almost no cinema experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor. Geena Davis is a housekeeper who suffers from amnesia. It's even on PTA! But then the car accident wakes up the woman she used to be, and it's HOT! Samuel L. Jackson is cheerful as a low rented private eye trying to help Davis find her past, just to find herself in the way over her head. Davis also has a few funny lines, and the interaction between her and Jackson works surprisingly well. Look at Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lechter and David Moorse, who finally gets rid of his television picture St. Elsewhere. The film is directed by Davis's husband, who seems to have built almost the entire film around her, but it works. I'll pull this DVD out and watch it often. I still love the makeup scene. Is Geena hot or what?
