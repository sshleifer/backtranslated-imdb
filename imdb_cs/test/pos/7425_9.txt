Real comedy. The dialogue is fast and very funny. Eleanor Parker at his physical peak. Flynn as the only Flynn can be a "glamorous hobo" .. though now for his prime. You'll be surprised by Flynn's timing. The scenes between him Tucker, Parker and "Cudddles" Sakal are cheerful. Just based on the clothes he wears. The most attractive Parker, this movie is worth a look. The romance of this 40th movie will not be lost to those who tend to watch movies from Hollywood's golden past.
