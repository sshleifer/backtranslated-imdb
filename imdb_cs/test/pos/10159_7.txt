I hate to admit it, but I do not consider it one of the best but riveting, Hitchcock climate thrillers. In the remake of Hitchock's 1934 movie of the same title, Dr. Ben McKenna James Stewart ?? a man who knows too much - and his wife Jo McKenna (Doris Day) are on vacation in Morocco with their son Hank (Christopher Oslen), where there is a mistake of identity and captured on the homicide plot of the murder. The conspirators go to extreme lengths to prevent them from interfering with their conspiracy: the kidnapping of their beloved Hank. It seemed surprising to me that Doris Day, which I usually associate with the Rock Hudson comedies, was cast in the Hitchcock movie. As I watched him, I soon realized that it was more of a family film compared to other Hitchcock works (eg Psycho) and that she had the singing ability needed to lose "Que Sera Sera" she did beautifully. She was well cast as herself and James Stewart had chemistry, which helped make the couple believable. <br /> <br /> In comparison to the other big director's works, I think it's not that good, but it's still an extremely fun family thriller / mystery. There is also an added bonus of Que Sera, who has proved to be a hit for Doris Day. Well controlled, well behaved. Fine film.
