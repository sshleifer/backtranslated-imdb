GRANNY IS THE BEST FILM EVER Ganny is the best movie I've ever seen. The plot was like nothing ever seen or done before these people are truly blessed with talent no joke I love this movie. I have to buy it, but I can't find it in any place. it's a dream for me to go and meet the actors and try and make grandma 2.i rented GRANNY on the Broadway video and kept it for a week longer than i should have and asked them if i could buy them said no big disappointment And even a bigger week after returning I wanted to go and rent it again, but to come to find out the Broadway video was out of business. If someone has a movie or knows where to buy it, please write to iloverot@aol.com
