It's a hell to pay when you cross Nami Matsushima (Meiko Kaji), a female Scorpion and a dangerous group of criminals (including their sadistic pimp head and his equally repulsive lady), running a prostitute ring with an iron fist. Hell has no fury like Scorpion and a determined detective, Gondo (Mikio Narita), who is trying to get revenge for handcuffing his hand and doing everything he needs (and this involves intimidating anyone who might know her place stay) to catch Nami. Nami finds allies in Yuki (Yayoi Watanabe), a pedestrian who gives her a temporary refuge. Yuki has a retarded brother who has suffered a brain injury during work, and has to take care of him (... in a disturbing revelation when it comes to incest, he also provides his sexual needs!). work in the streets! Meanwhile, Nami is headed for a nasty neighbor once she finds her own place (she works as a sewer), and he threatens to turn her into authorities (.. Nami was escaped by a convicted person who fled the subway from the cops) if he does not do sexual favor. His wife releases a kettle of boiling water all over her face and body, resulting in death, and the prostitution clan seeks Nami to pay a debt that has lost a very important member of his organization. That's when Katsu (Reisen Lee), a pimp lover and confidant, realizes that the one responsible for losing his loyal member is her former prisoner, Scorpion. Katsu cheated her with a liquid injection drug, put it in a bird cage (!) And Katsu adorns her with a trap. Last but not least, Nami's anger watches the prostitute die outside her cell, a victim of a forced late abortion that was bled to death. Nami will look for a scalpel that clutched in her hand (out of the operating room) and breaks out of the cage and prey on every clan member responsible for the hooker death. A number of scalpel murders give Gond an opportunity to catch Nami, and he catches her in an underground drain beneath the city, but can she catch or kill her? Especially if Yuki comes to help? Believe me when I say there was no compelling binding director Shunya Ito or his film team because FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION: BEAST STABLE is yet another perverted, derailed and ultra-violent entry into a very entertaining series . It features fine production values ​​and a visually stylistic talent to capture all the madness in imaginative ways. Ito pulls you (... or me) into a twisted drama that always exists when Nami Matsushima is on screen. When you have stretching credits, where your anti-heroine flees overcrowded city streets with a man tied to her, the viewer needs to know what's going on! The incestuous sub-fence is just bizarre (.. and it is shot in a soft-core way with a retarded brother jumping his disgusted, cold sister with dead eyes staring ahead!), And the whole sequence of abortion is quite hard to sit by. But the miscarriage angle, as worrying, provides motivation for Nami's vengeance… despite Nami's imperfect ways and her criminal nature, you'd rather see how they take these crete than the other way around. Interesting angle with Detective Gond. Gondo is willing to break the rules, and he becomes the force of nature towards anyone who stands in the way of his capture of his mortal enemy. His fate at the end, visiting another enemy of Nami, in an isolated cell while she looks at, perfectly encapsulates what makes these movies so ridiculous, but so fun. The scalpel murders are scenes from the backdrop, in different places, the shoulder blades protrude from the flesh, leaving Nami scenes of crime that are very strained to erase the entire clan to commemorate the fallen victim of unfortunate circumstances. While the film is essentially a comic book adventure, there is a sadness that penetrates, and few characters disappear without flaws. I imagine that many will leave this mockery, as the unrealistic FORAL PRESONER SCORPION: BEAST STABLE is (specifically how Nami can escape again and again, to fulfill her goals of revenge, to repay everyone who has hurt her), but I am at it looked like a violent action caricature, much like the 80's, and I enjoyed what it was. As always, this movie features some beautiful Asian actresses and some colorful heavies. Almost always reserved / quiet, but cold, staring down at her enemies with violent intent, Meiko Kaji is fine (in more directions than one) and Reisen Lee as her enemy looking at her eyes runs away with by painting as a perfectly realized contemptuously exploitable enemy worthy of psychic suffering (... when they are both in prison, Nami's ways of torture are sweet). My favorite scene has nothing to do with the storyline, but it's so badly wrong, the features of the dog who discovered Gonde's torn-off arm, walked down the street and finally found a resting place to chew on her!
