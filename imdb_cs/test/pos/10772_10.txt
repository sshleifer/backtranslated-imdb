When it comes to movies, I don't easily distinguish between bullshit, bullshit and masterpieces. I believe this film is an absolute masterpiece and it's hard to entertain me for more than 90 minutes. This movie ran SLOWER than Mystic River and Harry Potter 3 teamed up and I still managed to stay riveted to my place. For me, it was a passion that Eric Bogosian put into his performance. It is extremely difficult to detach such a piece and to have a positive effect on it. Bogosian probably nailed one of the most difficult performances of one man in a modern cinema. Until the end of the film, I had no respect for Bogosian. The whole monologue of minutes before the inexorable climax was a turning point, that was the key that turned me around. This man hit a point so low he knew he could never recover from it. Corporate boys congratulated him on the show. His blistering prose was also made by the sweetest prophet in Cavalcade. I realized that personal integrity and hypocrisy have no radio radio in the world, even in the corporate world. Stone may have pushed some uber-liberal agenda, but it was a real film and production activity that captivated me. Oliver Stone is a minor mood master. The last third of the film probably had the best lighting and cinematography I saw in every movie. Stone skillfully makes DJ booth feel like a five-seven-cell in the nineteenth century prison. Visually, Bogosian's only friend seems to be a black foam that absorbs routine vitriol. He speaks and doesn't say. It is a sad metaphor with regard to the way he treats people who gave him his success. Stone and Bogosian have carved a stunning film of a man who is imprisoned in a prison of walls and in prison. This man is limited to his own will and can never escape him. A scene that made me realize that it was when he was reluctant to his ex-wife. He preferred his own prison instead of the world. Every story has a conflict and it has become the simplest of all conflicts: man versus himself. 'Talk Radio' represents this conflict in an intelligent, gripping and refined way. There are no hidden messages in this movie, and any viewer should expect developments to happen. I just leaned back and let my mind grab this movie and I loved it. He's not gambling, invisible and never gets his credit. Hopefully this will remain because the jewels deserve to be found and then hidden again. It's a jewel because I found it in a discount DVD at my local Wal-Mart store. For $ 5.50 it cost half an hour of digging and I tried to find it. I did it and I have more than my money. This is one of the best films ever made and which is worth ten reasons alone. Ten reasons give a score of ten. <br /> <br /> My scream ends here!
