I don't understand why everyone hates this movie, except that they're just jealous that their music career never took off as mega Popstar Aaron Carter. Like or not, Aaron saw more success in his young life than most people could ever imagine, making him seem natural to make a film. Lou Pearlman and the company are known to survive their pop prostheses, remember Justin Timberlake's foray into the TV movie Model Behavior? This film is not big and impressive, but it should not be. It's not an effort to impress people or be an Emmy Award winner, it was released directly on DVD. It's just a cute little movie about awkward teen who gets her dream to be with her favorite Popstar; I know that many of you have had that dream at some point, or about you, your favorite singer, don't deny it. It is sweet and gentle and I applaud for not entering the realm of sex, violence and vulgar language, which seems to creep into more and more of our films. Where is decency? Where's the line? Teen dramas come in dozens these days because teens are a big market for companies, at least this is more tolerable to me than Bratz (aka Slutz) with all the fake girls running around "Oh Mah Gawd!" in tank tops and miniskirt and is better than those with movie films like Saw. I feel like a heroine because I was a stupid frightened high school girl who loved Aaron Carter and the NSYNC and Backstreet Boys and other popular music and still did; and like Aaron's character would crush "testophobia", especially in mathematics. Of course, if you judge this film just because Aaron Carter and his fame don't like you or are jealous, of course you will hate him and talk in reviews. The only reason Britney Spears dribbled Crossroads is a higher score because she has breasts. Accept this movie for what it is, not what you want it to be. I think this happy teenage movie ends on a high note and makes you want to sing.
