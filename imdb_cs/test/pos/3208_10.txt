Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, wisest, sharp-witty, sarcastic and warm-hearted TV shows I've ever watched (second place to my favorite TV show of all time, F * R * I * E * N * D * S) . Fast pace and many pop-culture links can leave some viewers confused, but once you get caught up in the ways of Gilmores, you'll be addicted to life. Just some random comments, I recently (finally) started watching season 6 and wow! It's one of my favorite seasons. I like Luke-Lorelai thing and all the drama in different episodes is (as always) exciting. The only thing I'm not so happy about is the surprisingly bad attitude and ruthless act that Rory suddenly "accepted". Unfortunately, I do not consider it very realistic and I hope that this is not just a way to wake up another drama to keep the season strong. And all in a great season and I can't wait for another !!! Ashly a.k.a. "Tookie Clothespin"
