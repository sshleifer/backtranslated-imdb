Graphics: brilliant, of course. The most overwhelming things are NOT off in trailers. Combat sequences move very fast, but after watching a few of them, your eyes should be used and it won't be so confusing. Cloud has a wide range of swords, and I wish things were moving more slowly so we could see them because everyone was incredibly detailed. Finally, let's see exactly how we equip Materia ... <br /> <br /> Music: also great. I was a little nervous because (of what I saw) Nobuo is not the best at writing music to go along with the action (don't forget the Steal Tiny Bronco sequence?), But it's brilliant and fits perfectly. I'm glad I pre-ordered OST. Even if they have changed the text to One Winged Angel, you will not be able to sing unless you know the lyrics of Carmina Burana. Plot: The first half of the movie sets things up and familiarizes everyone in a fairly complex tapestry, but the other half is almost completely a combat sequence once all players are in place. I wouldn't say it was a weak conspiracy, but nowhere is it as intricate as the storyline of the game. I think it's in an effort to avoid the shadow of the game, and I think it's a good thing ... the film is its own entity, and it shouldn't try to overcome the original in terms of total plot. I admit that I was a little hopeful that the film would bring FF7 to a wider audience, but this is not a mainstream movie. I just wanted to give her nine stars, just because it's not trying to explain anything to newcomers at all ... Marlene (at least I think it was Marlene ... she sounded like her) gives a little background to the beginning, but it's more than a refresher course. But then I realized that for me this movie is 10/10, so why should I start points just because other people won't like it anyway ... if you played the game, or you are at least partially familiar with it you should see this movie. But you don't need me to tell you. If you are not familiar with it, go out and buy it, sit there for twenty hours and beat it, and then watch the movie ... although still without any background it is still amazingly beautiful. You just won't have any internal links ... that make up 50% of the film (that's all ISN is not a combat sequence).
