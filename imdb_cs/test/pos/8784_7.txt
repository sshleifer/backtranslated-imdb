The fun first draft of "Northwest", "Saboteur" has several amazing Hitchcock moments (one of the best takes place at a table when a hero is asked for a woman who has not yet seen her handcuffs to put her plate on dropping the knife on the floor, exposing even more!), but suffering from poorly chosen leadership (whether it brings patriotic speeches, romance Priscilla Lane, joking or trying to look worried) Robert Cummings is wooden), and from the lack of really distinct villains (oh, there they are villains, many of them, but hardly anyone has enough screen time).
