This amazing movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny, fun, sweet and memorable, it's hard to decide where to start. From the introductory number, "Rainbow Connection", the outstanding Paul Williams score sung with gusto by Kermit D. Frog, which gives us the prologue of what the whole adventure is all about in the story, it's one fun film. Basically, it's a road trip movie where Kermit travels across the country with a dream of enjoying a "rich and glorious contract". On the way, our green hero meets a number of other ambitious actors, comedians, singers and musicians who are coincidentally muppets like Kermit himself. Is that how the Muppets really started? "About how it happened," says Kermit. Not since "It's a crazy, crazy, crazy world", the formula of recipes has been used so prolife and successfully. The aspiring stars encounter many recognizable faces during their Odyssey; some just look over the screen, but others have very memorable portraits. The fun piece of Steve Martin as a rough waiter is probably the best. Puppeteer Jim Henson nodded to his inspiration, Edgar Bergen, is particularly touching. Anyone who has ever watched the Muppets TV show will see all their favorite characters, they're all here. Puppetry is spectacular; Especially look at Kermit bike ride (how dey do data ???) In-jokes and links to old movies are everywhere, but the best one-liners are reserved for Kermit himself. Example: when scammers terrorize Kermit and Piggy, he lovingly tells his short, green, and handsome Beau: "I wouldn't give up on anything tonight, would I?" shootout on scene OK Corral: brilliantly absurd stupidity. <br /> <br /> I have to get "Move Now" but summarize: a good natured movie that anyone can enjoy, regardless of the age or film genre taste. Highly recommended.
