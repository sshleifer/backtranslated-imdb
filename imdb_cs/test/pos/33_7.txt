Lackawanna Blues is a drama through. It describes the life of a strong woman named Rachel Crosby (S. Epatha Merkerson). Rachel is referred to as Nanny by all who know her, but she could just as easily be called Wonder Woman. She embodied strength, strength, trust and determination. She owned a house she used to be, every house a company would refuse. Her tenants consisted of a lesbian, a psychotic war veteran, an amputation, and a number of other wanderers who made home miles away from the ordinary. Each successive Rachel action set out and flawlessly dealt with. She was not a dictator without compassion, but in fact she was the opposite. She had shown sympathy almost to the failure by providing shelter and refuge so much that she seemed to expand. Merkerson did a good job, but I believe this role was just like her aisle. The film still had a keel from Rachel. Of course, there were dramatic moments, but they had to be expected. Nothing was ever shocking or other than Rachel herself.
