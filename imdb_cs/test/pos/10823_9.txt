One comment said it's not a comedy ... Error! It was a wonderful history-based comedy that is not easy for this genre. Very busy ... and an active movie from start to finish. The shots of the train window or car were often beautiful. A nice way to spend a few hours in the theater. All French historical figures, such as Charles de Gaulle and Petain, and some of the people involved in the French resistance, were included in a scenario that could send those who are unfamiliar with the break-up of France under German invasion would like to research. The characters were engaging and the actors who portrayed them were excellent. Recommend 9 out of 10.
