At the age of nineteen eighty-two, when it was announced that Dismisal was to be done, a storm of controversy had occurred. This was an event that still left open wounds in the hearts and minds of Australian people. After some changes (listen for well timed phones ringing to disguise names) Dismissal went into the air. It was nothing brilliant. Leadership was perfect. Max Phipps as Gough Whitlam leads the way, closely followed by John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and evergreen John Mellion as Sir John Kerr. Time was created well, people's feelings were well done, and political elements were not two-dimensionally made into melodrama as in many American series. The release was a faithful re-creation of a time in Australia that some would rather forget and which we cannot forget. he did not take sides and pointed out the mistakes and lies of both sides. This leaves a person who wants to maintain anger and change a constitution that still allows it. Rejection is now available on DVD in Australia. Watch it, learn from it and learn about our modern history.
