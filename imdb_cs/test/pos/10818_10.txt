I saw Bon voyage 2 days ago and I found this excellent production. The movie should have fun and it does! It emulates the style of American comic books with an American 1930s screwdriver, but Von voyage is more refined. Adjani and Depardieu are simply superb in their roles. The story is simple. The film starts with people who are involved in many situations that should have nothing to do with them. It is very fun to see how these situations come together during the film. It's good to see a French film with such a sense of humor. I find him mainly a movie in which love is the main theme. As a German spy in France, Peter Coyote again shows that he is an excellent actor.
