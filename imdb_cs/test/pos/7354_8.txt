After returning "horror movies" (coming to Scream is not scary!) I had no very high hopes for this low budget three story horror movie. But I was positively surprised! Man is scary !!! The first 2 stories are simply brilliant. The first of them about a new married couple riding in a dark forest with RV, When they hit the wild ........ (watch the movie)! The second story is about a disgusting man who is obsessed with a little girl who is home alone for one night. I know it doesn't sound anything special, but it's Scary. I promise. The last story is not scary, but not so bad. It's about a biker and spiritually. In fact, the stories are based on real urban legends (I think kevin williamson can steal ideas too) .Rent this movie is good !!! I'd say it's the most frightening three-short story-horror movie ever!
