I use "Princess Raccoon" (to give the film not a very accurate English title) as a litmus test of my friends' humor. Either it leaves them cold and confused - as several other commentators have made clearly on this site - or results in double laughs, unbeatably huge smiles and occasional glares of admiration. Laughter comes from the film's perfect blend of parodies in modern style. Objectives include a bouquet of Japanese and Western classical theater drama forms, from Kabuki to late Shakespearian and Spanish Renaissance Christian fantasy; naff the emptiness of a modern American and European musical, as a witness to a series of random songs and rap songs and very funny banal lyrics, all choreographically with a loving "amateur" cliché; Japanese anime and samurai clichés; fabulous Buddhist ritual; and the stunning sweetness of the Vienna operetta. I wasn't too loud about this type of movie because of the nasty musical deconstruction of Ken Russell in "The Boyfriend". The smile comes from a clever textual subversion of a Japanese legend that was written in a traditional five-piece structure reminiscent of 17th-century Chikamatsu games. As in his work, the story is advanced in a mix of songs, recitative, high-age poetry, and low comedic relief. human mask. All this hangs together somehow, and even more remarkably, we can engage observers with emotions through a cultural link welder. In fact, "Princess Raccoon" wears pan-cultural attire with enticing ease, and that is where amazement strikes come. Visually - again, as with Russell's masterpiece - the film is a delicacy, a riot of colors with digitized backdrops of classic Japanese images from screens and prints, costumes and stages. kits, mixed with some breathtaking live action sequences in summer fields and seas. You will love him or hate him, but it is not a place where the king would throw himself like cheese; and "Princess Raccoon" stands primarily as a sinisterly humorous yet loving pledge of our present cultural emptiness, both in the East and in the West. Bravo!
