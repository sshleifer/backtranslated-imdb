First, the story is not as simple as many previous reviewers tend to emphasize, it is a very complicated story, unlike Bergman's other films, which are more bent towards studying the character. We have two main characters in Skammen, but as we are thrown from the beginning in the middle of the war, we have no idea who is fighting and why, everything is open to any decision. This creates tremendous tension and makes every event meaningful. As the story unfolds, we become acquainted with many characters who are transformed into symbols of mankind, both on its dark and light sides. We have an example of innocent passers-by trying to get through the absurd war, a cynical physician who makes fun of his patients and provides the only bitter humor of the film, perverted opportunists trying to get out of cruelty. the event (the character of Bjornstrand), the innocent dead children, the nameless characters almost turned into animals from the ship, etc. They are all somehow seen through the eyes of John (von Sydow) and Eva (Ulmann), their characters are more restrained in other Begrman films Passion) and this is precisely because it is important that the story, the way external events have the ability to radically change human nature. Bergman made this film two years after Persona where the main conclusion expressed by the only word that Liv Ulmann puts it is INGENTING, nothing. That's it: the sense of art and the meaning of life that is nothing but a game that includes all the games. But what about war? And especially those that destroyed XX. Century. The Persona is the only real emotion Ulmann suffers when he sees the Vietnam War victim as a human torch. In Skammen, this idea is extended to a comprehensive analysis of the dehumanizing nature of war. In the nameless region of a nameless country (assuming it is Sweeden), two factions speaking the same language are fighting against the absurd war. John and Eve are two dreamers who have been hit in the middle, but their dreams are woven in some sort of counterpoint. John is initially an idealist, unable to respond properly to the world and subject to the will of his wife. Towards the end, he turns into a radically different personality, capable of non-motivated murder, strong will, integrity (carefully observing suicide on the shipâ€¦ the simplicity of the law is terrible). On the other hand, Eva is gradually losing contact with reality and at the end is completely covered by her own unfulfilled dream. From the technical point of view, the whole film brings its message in a very effective way. Bergman places the viewer next to the character, puts the camera in the car with actors or, in extreme detail, behind the actor. Nykvist manages extraordinary control of the camera, there are some "hand" effects, very good at making everything look like "real". The shots when the characters are captured by the army look remarkably documentary. The scenario is minimalist, but the story is very complicated. In fact, the whole film is paradoxical, it has an intensity in the subject that is in sharp contrast to the cold and lack of emotional involvement with which it is directed and filmed. Nothing here is melodramatic, there is no compassion, no hope and no obvious redemption. But just like in Liv Ulmann's dream, it's so beautiful that you can't help him because it impressed him ... It wasn't that bad because it was so beautiful!
