Actually, I admit I'm a political junkie, so it resonated with me, but the unpredictable nature of Mrs. Green (yes, I know what they did to her), but the end was such a copout and totally contrary to the movie itself. Why Barry L and the crew just didn't let us think what to do? Let's discuss it. Instead, they have this "oh I'm not worthy" crap ending and it just shows that when the chips were down, it's better to leave the table instead of doubling down. Stop Disney's end and put a bow on it. Life is not easy, they should have had the courage to give the main character the backbone. We had to listen to the rhetoric of the whole movie ... and then it turned into a torturous and stupid, Inane behavior of Mrs. Green (when the bullshit was out of her system), just for the absurd near the end of the film that was icing on the cake.
