I feel very sad for some of the people watching this movie. Obviously, their standards are so high that they will never be able to enjoy a movie just for fun. Or perhaps their enjoyment is derived from the act of collecting films from one another; are you looking for any reason why they wouldn't like it? Long Kiss Goodnight is an action movie in every sense of the word. Sure, there are holes large enough to drive the halfway, but none of them are enough to stop the flow of the film itself. I've never been a big fan of Geeny Davis, but I was amazed at how she was able to create two very different characters, Samantha Cain and Charlie Baltimore. In my opinion, it was not even necessary to change her physical appearance to distinguish between them ... her acting was more than enough to do it. However, more than anything else, this film was Craig Bierko. Timothy's character could only be another exchange rascal in other hands. His decision to play with a more casual approach was just the right contrast to all action scenes. It's not often that you find an actor who can only express himself with his facial expressions ... in the case of a scene in the freezer with Charlie and her daughter. Where most of the films would have lost the moment of "revelation" with unnecessary dialogue, Bier's eyes told the story. <br /> <br /> Basic storyline? Thin to be true. A seemingly average housewife suffering from amnesia, she slowly discovers she was a murderer. As her memory is remembered, there are people who want to kill the killer. Is it really Samantha, a baking housewife or Charlie, a cold-blooded killer? Or maybe a little of both? For me, The Long Kiss Goodnight was a nice way to find out.
