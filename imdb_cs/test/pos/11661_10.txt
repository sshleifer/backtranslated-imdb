I had to see this movie about four or five times, and that's better with every viewing. Just say: This is the best movie I've ever seen. And I think I've seen a lot. But I have always wondered why this movie has been avoided in some reviews or ratings. For example, take your IMDb Top 250. Why does it only rank # 216 (as of today)? Sure, the answer is not in the movie itself (because it's nothing but flawless) but in its reception. The film caused controversy in his portrayal of compassion for the convicted killer and his anti-death stance punishment. And so, apparently, a more conservative minded user probably didn't like the movie (as you can see from some other notes). So DEAD MAN WALKING gets a rating that is nothing but ridiculous in relation to its quality. These people did not understand what the film wanted to say, and perhaps they do not want to understand that they are the death penalty. So now I understand: It's all political. You are for the death penalty - you do not like (and therefore do not want to hear) what the film says. I'm really sorry that there are so many people out there who simply tune in when a new perspective challenges their beliefs. Mr. Mr. Robbins, the problem of your movie has divided people's views. Some have reassessed their opinions, some have simply not listened, but you have made a very important point. Your movie will probably never appear on the "TOP 100 ALL TIME FILMS" list, but it will remember, long after movies like Braveheart or Babe or Apollo 13 (all unfairly favored over the Oscars) 1996). Congratulations, Mr. Robbins, and thank you for this important piece of film.
