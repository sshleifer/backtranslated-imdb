This is undoubtedly one of Neil Simon's best games that made movies. It's full of great characters and unforgettable dialogue. Johnathan Silverman makes a great screen version of young Eugene (he was played by Matthew Broderick on stage). This is Simon's first autobiographical trilogy, his followed by the magnificent "Biloxi Blues", and concludes with the television film "Broadway Bound". If I had to say that the film has some shortcomings, it might be that the characters sometimes usually speak in obvious dialogue, but that's okay because it's a great dialogue. Rent this little gem, you won't regret it!
