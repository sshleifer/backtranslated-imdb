I recently watched this movie and fell in love with it. I loved the story and the actors. He has something of everything. I was intrigued by the development of the story. She has so many surprises on the way. I warmly recommend. In fact, I loved it so much that I ran out and bought a book. I felt I had to read it to appreciate the art of writing behind the film. I also wanted to make sure that I missed what was in the book, but I left the movie. I recommend people who love film to read the book because there are enough differences in the book, especially in the second episode to read it. She became my favorite movie. I am now a fan of Sarah Waters and Elaine Cassidy !!
