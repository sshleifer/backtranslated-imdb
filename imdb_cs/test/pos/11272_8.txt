Begotten is one of the most unique movies I've ever seen. It is more for me, studying sound, light and darkness and movement than a real story. The things you see as a video instillation in a modern art museum than a movie that enjoyed in a local theater. I will not try to interpret the images of the Mother Nature, the beast in the cloaks, the twisted and tortured body of her "child." Some things just contradict interpretation.
