This film is almost never seen today - the only reason I can enjoy it again and again is from the slightly worn copy of VHS I shot when it was screened on television in 1991 in England. Of course, the cast of the ensemble is pleased and this is reflected by the viewer. A razor-sharp script helps things together, and once you've seen it, you'll want to watch it again and again. Wayne Rogers is a star, but everyone contributes to a great movie. great jazz soundtrack to run. Emotional moments emerge during the film, but never to the point that it is a sick sweet sentimentalism - these are the guys on the road all their lives and they tell it amazingly. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend if you can actually get to see it.
