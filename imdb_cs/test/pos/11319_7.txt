I lived in London most of my adult life before I moved stateide so missed this movie when it came out and saw it right on HBO. I disagree with anyone who thinks it should be Hollywood production, the team from England made it cool and premonition from day one, and I was at the edge of my place for the last 30 minutes and wondered what would happen to my city home. And, of course, nine months after the movie is 7/7. Yes, truth is alien than fiction. If he lives in both countries, it is also clear that the likelihood that this will happen in the UK is much greater than in the US, Muslims live in ghettos and isolate themselves in the UK, assimilate much more easily in the US.
