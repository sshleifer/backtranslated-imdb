Recently, he first entered the tracking program - a two-hour abduction program. I don't know why I used to be? James Caan is excellent and completely credible in the role of Chief Honcho in the 5 * Vegas complex. So often they have programs like this one or more in a file that is either uncomfortable or seems to have been selected because they have to be in contact with a producer or director. <br /> <br /> This is certainly not the case with this program. Together with Caan, all primary and supportive casts are attractive and credible. Guest actors are selected. The stories I have seen are interesting and the show also features a good view of the city. <br /> <br /> It's a fun program and I hope it stays. I don't know how I managed to skip that long, but I'm planning on TIVO now.
