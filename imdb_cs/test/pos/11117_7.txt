This film and its subsequent watching TV series became a cult stand-in for what's great about America. Glory is famous for its music and performance. There are several standouts including Irene Cara, Paul McCrae, Anne Meara *, and excellent Gene Anthony Ray. One who plays a singing dancer without academic or non-street street credentials is a wonderful person and is worth watching what is basically a portrait of herself. Surprise at how one king was willing to say. <br /> <br /> The story follows an interesting format - chronologically, genre at other times, personality in some cases ... but it all ends up in a mess. Where Parker succeeds, she's pushing this movie into a periodic overdrive - with an extremely annoying and sometimes beautiful and totally straightforward musical score that matches the performers' footsteps. <br /> <br /> The pinnacle of film is the pinnacle of all time. And this climatic complete cast of many talented musicians and dancers and music is fortunately repeated in credits. These are one set of credits that are well worth sitting ... success for ages. Christopher Gore's music is a gift to be seen.
