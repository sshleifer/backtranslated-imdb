I rented this gem several times! It is a small but somewhat vast masterpiece that will welcome the viewer from Manhattan to the beauty of the Greek islands. John Cassavetes on-screen marriage to his real wife Gena Rowlands is on the rocks. He finds a sense in throwing with the footloose Susan Sarandon who he finds in Greece while their daughter, played in her earliest film role by the teenager Molly Ringwald, falls on the son of a Greek naval tycoon who is courting her mother on a yacht to sail in. Extremely talented Raul Julia plays with her Sony Trinitron, who lives in a cave. He has "hot" for Molly Ringwald's character until confronted by John Cassavetes. Everything meets at the end of the classic final scene where everything is reconciled. Raul Julia, a goatherd, is seen dancing with his goat. This film is full of mysticism, beauty, young and old love, humor, sexuality and more. You see it!
