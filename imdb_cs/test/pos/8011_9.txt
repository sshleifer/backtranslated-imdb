I watched this show until puberty, but I still found it a reflection of many situations that bothered us when we were teenagers, even though it was a family show. Until the mid-1990s, she focused more on young adults and their situation. That's why I loved "Step by Step". I mean, he offered the situation for every age and, unlike many shows of its kind, brought expectations. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest; It was not an extremely funny show, no, but it had some situations that you felt in the relationship, but just fun. There was a very good charm between Patrick Duffy and Susan Sommers. Duffy shuddered! Sommers was tender and funny. I was in love with Stacy Keegan because she was extremely sexy (loved legs) and funny. But Sasha Mitchell stole the show with Cody's character. It was back that day! Memories. Nowadays, this exhibition has not been able to adequately respond to new generations and should therefore be kept in the vault of memories. That's all, just memories. <br /> <br /> Thank you Step by Step for making a fun puberty.
