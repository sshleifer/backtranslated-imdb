"Balance of Terror" is still one of the best Star Trek episodes ever made. It was inspired by the film "Enemy Down" (starring Robert Mitchum), a film that deals with a cat-and-mouse game between two captains during World War II. In this episode, Captain Kirk and his crew play a similar game with the Romulan ship. This is a program that famously introduces Romulans wars that are distant relatives of the Vulcans. It is an incredibly exciting episode, firmly designed for maximum effect. It is also interesting to see how the episode contains a number of sub-works that add layers of meaning to the story. Mark Lenard makes his Star Trek debut as Romulan Captain (he will later play Spock's father Ambassador Sarek). I need to see the episode!
