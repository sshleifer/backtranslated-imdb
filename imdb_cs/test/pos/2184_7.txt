This television broadcast of the classic musical "Sweeney Todd" does not produce production justice, but is still quite charming. First of all, the most enjoyable aspect of this version is the production design, from the multi-set to the surprising hatch. Then the production is excellent, until mowing. The main failure is in the performances that people give. Oh, they're believable, all right - but it's quite frustrating when no one seems to come across their impulses in time in the song as fast as they say, "Kiss me." In fact, the actress playing Johanna is not just off-pace at a dismal level, but also slightly off-key. And Angela Lansbury's slightly exaggerated accent is a bit irritating. One more thing - what is so bad about the performance of Johann "Judny Turpin" being banned in the American theater, but not the cannibal anthem "Little Priest"? Otherwise it is an excellent production. It's exciting to watch people doing what they love - and I'm not even marginally talking about "tart cakes".
