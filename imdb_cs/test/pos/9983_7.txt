Disney's Buena Vista Pictures presents a wonderfully narrated sports drama directed by actor Bill Paxton. Photography is great, but sometimes the story is spreading. This film is about 20-year-old amateur golfer Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) and his 1913 US Open competition. What a story; once in a lifetime chance for a supposedly incompetent young man to play alongside the best golfers of that time, including British champions Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) and Ted Ray (Stephen Marcus). The book that ends, leaves a knot in the throat. The cast also includes: Peter Firth, Elijah Koteas, Marnie McPhail, Robin Wilcox, and maybe the show's stealing is Josh Flitter, who plays Eddie Lowery, Cadim's Caddy and Best Friend.
