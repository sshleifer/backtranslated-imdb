This documentary focuses on the events in Gothenburg in 2001. In the Swedish media there were demonstrators who were criminals for anarchy and violence. This film shows that they are not there, in fact they are intelligent, articulate people who have something to say - and it says with the power of bricks. They believe in a better world, a world where people can think and say what they want - without focusing on them. But are they convinced that they have the opportunity to change society realistically? I think not. This documentary gives us enlightenment on the issues of greed, capitalism and the future it can bring. It is a great document that is not propaganda because it is not shown as what they say is right. All it shows is what some individuals think, and it is up to the viewer to decide whether what they do is right or wrong. <br /> <br /> I have heard many people who call it propaganda and therefore choose not to look at it, I think they are making a bad decision, because even if you sympathize with the police or with the conviction of the protesters, everything you get is The more facts you can rely on, for example, the child to shoot, says he thinks it's good to throw a brick through a McDonalds window because it's a step between thinking and acting as you think. Overall, this film scared me because you can't really reject the fact that a few police officers who have been fighting violence with violence have not been convicted or even detained in custody, even though evidence of throwing bricks on a demonstration march ( and in some cases, it beats people with a baton, even if it is on the street without resistance) how it gets. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10 - Very good, but not the best!
