Norma spent most of her 20 years playing beautiful places, but her first talkie cast her as a wind showgirl in "The Trial of Mary Dugan" and went through flying colors. Since then, her sweet and beautiful places have been set aside and lit up in parts that make her as a sophisticated woman of the world or a company of girls in excitement. "Let Us Be Gay" was made earlier, but released after "The Divorcée" and was an unusual twist on the dramas' top dramas that Shearer made her own. Norma first appears without makeup as the fabulous Kitty Brown, who is the main purpose of life, is to cheat on her very priceless husband Bob (Rod La Rocque). He rushes to get him into his golf game - but he actually sees his mistress. When Helena, the mistress, comes to the house for a showdown, Kitty faces the situation with respect, but behind the closed door there is a lot of emotion and Bob goes well. Three years later, Mrs. Courtland Brown (Kitty) comes to stay home to the eccentric Mrs. Bouccicoult ("Bouccy") (Marie Dressler). Kitty is now a knockout and "Bouccy" has a job for her. She wants Kitty to romance a home guest who in his bend romancing her granddaughter Diane (beautiful Sally Eilers). Shock!! Terror!! - the man is none other than Bob, her ex-husband! Kitty meets with sophistication and humorous reparation - "it seems something special about this man!" - and no one is wiser. The film then settles into one of those very early "comedies" that are very fun. Kitty casts a spell on all the men and Bob is desperate to start over. Women have all the strong roles in this film - men are just puppets. Raymond Hackett seems to be in the movie as an extra butler - "go through my pillow", "get me a drink", "move this chair" instead of Diane's pursued fiancé. Of course, Norma Shearer is the entire show, and Marie Dressler adds "Bouccy" to her list of eccentric portraits, and Sally Eilers is a real sight like the beautiful Diane.
