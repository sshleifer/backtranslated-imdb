<br /> <br /> What more can you ask for? Big screenplay based on one of the best games of the second half of the 20th century, two fine emotional performances by Courtney and Finney, a realistic wartime vision in London, great support. This film takes you to the emotional path of humor, sadness, loss and fulfillment. If you're in the theater, it's even more effective. This is the actual value of 10 on the rating scale!
