This movie surprised me. The opening credit sequence offers a nice animation. After that, we are immersed in semi-cheese production, betraying his low budget. Characters, typical American teens, are introduced slowly, with more personal details than is usually found in movies such as this. At a time when the shlitz hits the fan, we know each of the characters and either we love them or hate them according to their different personalities. It's a slow uphill setting, something like a ride on the slope of a really high roller coaster. Fortunately, as soon as the action starts, it is a full fake old school HORROR! Steve Johnson's makeup effects are amazing. Equally good compared to much larger budgeted movies. And scary jerking. Kevin Tenney delivers his best movie ever, with surprises stopping and haunting exciting settings. Facing, sometimes cheesy, humor denotes this film as the pure horror of the 1980s, as opposed to the annoying tone of an earlier genre like "The Night of the Living Dead" or "The Hills Have Eyes". But for real horror fans, this is worth checking. Play it as the first record on the double 1999 remake of "House on the Haunted Hill". The settings and dynamics of the character are so similar that you really have to wonder what movie they actually made?
