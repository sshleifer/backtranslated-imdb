I honestly give this movie a solid 7.5, but I clicked 10 to try to balance 5 pages of imbecile, unjustified 1-star reviews. It's an interesting story, everything is good to very good (even Mrs. Diaz, who is totally out of her usual smile with a smile, but plays well.) The sets are perfect, and cinematography is consistently a haunted one. It is a great moral game and there is no reason to explain the origin of the god / supernatural / alien / anything that is "running the show", so I'm glad the movie doesn't. It's really irrelevant to a story that's quite long, but quite persuasive and summarized quite satisfactorily in the end. <br /> <br /> Before deciding that this movie is horrible (or something that is below ~ 7.5), read dozens of "hated" 1-star reviews of typos, lack of punctuation and capitalization. and critics of minors. Maybe the trailer was misleading or something - I didn't see it - but some of these reviewers seemed to expect Terminator 4 or Saw 5 (one reviewer actually compared this movie to Saw! How utterly inappropriate and unrelated!) <Br> > Seriously, most of these reviews have read comments like you - the trumpet - according to these "critics" this movie is too confusing, but too predictable, not enough action, but too much is happening, too smart, but too stupid, explains too much, but it leaves too inexplicable ... oh - and it's probably a "pass (sic) of time". Consider the quality and source of reviews before taking them into your heart. I'm afraid that these 1-star kids couldn't understand the phrase "altruism coefficient" and therefore were totally unable to understand the premise of the film (despite the stubborn claim that "get it" right before explaining how confusing it was!) If you know what this two words mean you won't have any problem understanding this movie. (<br /> <br /> I really wish there was a reviewer review system so I could be sure I ignore the ratings of everyone who gave it a 1 star movie forever. <br /> <br /> See look at yourself and enjoy a great presentation of an interesting couple who will take an interesting moral test and face the consequences.
