If you are interested in learning more about this thing that is happening in modern civilization, there is an excellent book called "Outlaw Sea" or "The Outlaw Sea" and it describes the story after the story of how these things happen. For many reasons, lawlessness on the high seas is a reality. One of many world carriers has a dubious register (nationality) and it is difficult to enforce international law when shipowners do not have an office in the real country. Two, many shipping lines employ crews from poor third world countries. Crews are often (as illegal immigrants workers) threatened and bullied to abide by controversial or illegal practices. The third is often a language barrier, not only between officers and crew, but also among crew members themselves. The crew is rewarded for their observance and silence. Four, as soon as they commit an unlawful act, the ships are able to hide in sight with more than fresh paint. By the way, it's a fascinating reading. Awesome story, great movie. Does anyone else notice how HBO seems to make the best and most important movies? Hollywood has difficulty releasing enough Oscar-worthy films in any given year, so that several of the top 5 contenders usually come from Britain. Jerry Bruckheimer = the end of a quality cinema. <br /> <br /> I loved Sean Pertwee's bad performance. I also, as usual, loved Omar Epps.
