It is sweet. An actress who played a sister with gonzongs is the same actress who plays Elvira's mistress of darkness. Another little treat is an actress who played a nurse who would give her a wedding ring, was the owner of Mrs. Roy Munsin in the King Pin. This is the most famous story ever said. It should sell more copies than the Bible. My parents were involved in designing the release of this film to a local cinema. The film ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see him. The lady who gave a break (family friend) was released by the theater. I was 3 years old. I fired over 4 copies on VHS and finally transferred it to DVD. That is beautiful.
