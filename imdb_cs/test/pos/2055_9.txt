There's a serious scene in this movie. A scene that lets you know that his film won't pull many cheap strokes. It takes place in a crowded train station and the protagonists are ambushed by murderers with automatic weapons. They bring a break for him and just get into a hail of shooting. The main hall of the train station is now full of corpses of innocent people caught in the crossfire. Some would call it too sad and / or grim to get into what is supposed to be a fun action movie. I call it honesty. Most action films tend to rely on the "safe side" of displaying violence and conspiracy. This usually means that, despite massive firefights, innocent people tend not to die, or at least we can't die. Violence is pure good guys versus bad guys, especially dying. A little common sense clearly shows that it is absurd. Renny Harlin showed how it looks in its first (and unfortunately only) hit, Die Hard 2. Demons deliberately hit a plane full of people to get their point across. The scene was also filmed with a cargo plane back-up scene where only a few people aboard were down, but a grim and probably more realistic scenario was used. However, to fit the spirit of the first movie, Die Hard 2 was mostly "fun action movie". Here, this grimmer and more convincing edge is ubiquitous. Violence is bloody. One liner is cheerful, but with a certain style that more reflects the natural human sarcasm than the clich√©s of film wisdom at key moments of action. The plot is also full of malicious intent than most action movies. The villain is not just a rogue for revenge or a mad grasp in power. It is less ridiculous, but also more frightening. In recent films, the "Bourne" trilogy almost gets with less than a shabby action movie style, but this movie is from 1996 and 7 years before "The Bourne Identity" with Matt Damon on the big screen. Another interesting aspect is that the main character is actually a heroine. And that is before the movie version of "Tomb Raider" became a hit. In addition, this heroine seems to be able to take John McClan off and then take a lit cigarette. This film marks Geena Davis the second action-heroine and still can't hit the hit. While Angelina Jolie plays in "Tomb Raider" a few years later and scored. The reasons are behind me. Completely. Finally, this movie is not completely dark. There are many outrageous and spectacular pieces that can only be seen in action film. The climatic explosion of a chemical bomb is a spectacular display of film pyrotechnics, with more than one physics law that has a convenient break. Here's a formula, but it's Anti-Formula for everyday Hollywood Action Movie Formula. --- 9/10 <br /> <br /> BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence, profanity
