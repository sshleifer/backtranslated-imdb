'Anne Christie' was Garbo's 14th film and the first in which her husky Swedish voice was heard. She plays the main character Anna, who struggled to leave her father Chris (drunken boat owner by George F Marion), and with the misfortune of life he has to keep his head above water. br /> <br /> Meeting with Irish Matt (Charles Bickford) can mean a turning point for her ... or that? Garbo looks and sounds great in this drama, which, although somewhat clumsy and moving at a slow pace, still captivates and attracts the audience almost 80 years later. Marie Dressler has an influence on the role that gave her a second flush of film success in films such as Min and Bill, Dinner at Eight, and Emma; while Marion and Bickford are more than enough. An interesting piece of film history. Garbo would do better talks in the years to come, but "Anna Christie" will always be remembered for the first time she'll be on the screen.
