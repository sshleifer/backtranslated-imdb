There have been numerous productions that tell about the development of the atomic bomb. Robert Taylor's Biggest and Lives (truly interservice propaganda flag; if you think this is what the Army Air Corps, in Paul W. Tibbits, ran the show!), NBC made ENOLA GAY (probably LOT closer to the brand ) and BBC-TV, OPPENHEIMER, with Sam Waterston in the title role. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY has the same approach as the BBC but expands it; avoids Manhattan's "Gee Whiz" technology and focuses on human aspects; personalities involved in work. Instead of focusing on Oppie, it covers a wide strip of mythical, but quite typical people who were part of it. With reservations, Dwight Schultz did a good job as Oppie, representing the dreamy Ivory Tower. Who is trying to combine his contributions as a physicist with his tendency to look at the world in a wider social and moral context ... just to fight this urgent lust for personal power and glory. It was clearly stated on DAY THURSDAY that Oppenheimer considered himself a "superior being" on the basis of his vast and extensive intellectual prowess. In the end it was the fall of Robert Oppenheimer; he saw himself as a kind of "philosopher / king", a moral and intellectual superior who could (and rightly should) "wisely" prescribe what was best for the rest of the world re. development and deployment of nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, wisdom does not dictate the actions of nations or the direction of events on a global scale. Wisdom does not give early power. When he tries to execute such a non-existent power (as Oppie found when he opposed the development of "The Super" hydrogen bomb), wisdom is ignored and expelled by those who have too much power. I found out that I had broken Schultz's character in some way; his Oppie exposes his TOO closely and personally to the Manhattan Project, despite the doubts and fears that have torn on his intellectual basis. The real Oppenheimer would have to have a different approach; at the outset, he would have to make a firm decision that the project would result in the ultimate good. The ugliness she created on the road would be a random price that had to be paid to achieve this ultimate good, and had to be ignored ... at least until the end of the project, when there was free time to evaluate profits and losses. Oppie made it clear and resulted in his controversial post-war statement that science now knew sin, and that was a knowledge she could never lose. While the project went on, such considerations should be pushed aside if it should keep common sense. Because of this ambiguity, Schultz's character becomes a weak, frightened little boy who could never serve as a "Rapid Rupture Coordinator" as Oppenheimer unofficially called his post. Paul Newman on Gen. Leslie R. Groves is fascinating, and brilliant performance, if possible LITTLE BIT over the top. Groves was a civil engineer training, but in the first place was SOLDIER and a general who was supposed to boot! He is accustomed to REQUEST that things go in a way ... an intensely controlled, rotten child, a spoiled child who is angry with a drop of hat who worships his country and is not too proud to fall to his knees and pray. In other words, very much like REAL soldiers (ie NON), aka George Patton! Grove's MISSION not only comes first, but it's ONLY thinking ... feelings and egos are damn except his own, of course! Groves couldn't admit it, but he knew he needed Oppenheimer; military rank meant nothing in the world of theoretical physicists. Oppie was a necessary interface between the two worlds he had to straddle. Again ... I have to reject this scenario and for the same reason. In reality, Groves already OWNED Oppie; if he didn't, Oppie would never have been chosen for this post. History tells of many cases where other scientists, some as stellar as Oppenheimer, have simply left Groves' recruitment. At one point Groves was so desperate that he suggested the DRAFTING physics he needed! Groves attempts in the movie to maneuver and control Oppie have been inaccurate ... they exist only here as a dramatic device that really helps make the movie atmosphere ugly. Kusak's "Michael Merriman" is composed of several real characters, but from a different time frame. Several research accidents similar to those that have emerged have emerged in POSTWAR's weapons research. Overdose of Merriman's radiation creates another ugliness in the film that is, IMHO, necessary and pretty accurate. People with weak stomachs will find it difficult to handle hospital sequences; all are real TOOs. <br /> <br /> The main idea that appears, but not strongly enough, is the great truth of Los Alamos' experience. Scientists who signed up were young, idealistic and naive, as well as talented. Most of them were on their first campus hiding. For them, the project was a patriotic adventure that enabled them to practice experimental physics on a large scale without budget cuts or "excessive" bureaucratic oversight. The atomic bomb was produced not only by their brilliance, but also by their youthful enthusiasm. There are a lot of things to make this thoughtful viewer feel uncomfortable in this movie. Likewise, if you filter out a Hollywood BS (it's not that much), it's probably a pretty accurate view of the interior of a Manhattan project.
