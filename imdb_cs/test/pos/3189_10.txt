Love In Limbo is my everyday favoirite movie. It is hilairious and has an excellent cast including a group of three gorgeous actors, Russell Crowe (as Arthur), back on the day when HOT actually looked short and hairless. Aden Young (Barry McJannet), and Craig Adams as Ken Riddle. Ken is a senior high school student obsessed with sex and is expelled for selling his pornographic drawings to his classmates. She starts a new job at her uncle's clothing factory and becomes a close other guy, Barry McJannet, who buys a car to go out and pick up the chicks. They become friends with good-twoshoes geek Arthur Baskin (Crowe) and three guys drive up Kalgoorlie to sit a mess and lose their virginity ...... <br /> <br /> Watch it, his classics !! As long as I tried to get a DVD or Soundtrack, someone let me know if you have em.
