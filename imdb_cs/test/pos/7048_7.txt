If you take the film for what it is worth, you will not be disappointed. If you think Murray has to win an Oscar for his performance, and that's the type of movie you expect, don't bother. It was fun when I saw it in 1979 and I didn't lose its magic. Good pure fun for kids and easy care for older people. The story is simple and easy to follow. Murray did better, but this is his first film. The film reminds me of the time when we didn't need blood and courage to have fun. Morty is the head of the dune and plays a perfect role. Other advisors are typical who woke up in the summer. One nice thing about this movie, it has a message.
