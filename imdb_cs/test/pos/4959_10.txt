Okay, here's the deal. There's this American pilot who flies together, guarding his own business when he is suddenly transferred by evil, cowardly non-US fighter planes (they're Middle East types, but just say they don't like apple pie or Elvis Presley) who shoot him. Now this American pilot was doing nothing wrong, but the bad Americans didn't like it and before you learned he was fired in a foreign prison and sentenced to death !! Now, what would normally happen here was that the US Army would bomb a carpet of nearby cities until the pilot was released, but not this time. Those evil peace lovin 'types probably involved and managed to stop any kind of retaliatory massacre. As you can imagine, the pilot's family will not be pleased, and the evil foreign dictator has this smug, contented look at him. The Americans will pay, yes yes, really! But Doug Masters did not count, captured pilots of a sixteen-year-old son. You see, Doug was able to fly the plane longer than he could drive a car (which couldn't be that long) and decided to fly into that evil, foreign country and get his father back. So with the help of his friends, Doug and his wingman, retired pilot? Chappy 'Sinclair, Doug launches raid on men for two men. Now you think this plan will have to fail, but you're wrong. Sure, these Middle East types can be all veterans, but Doug has an ace up his sleeve, listening to rock music when he's flying! After shooting down a dozen enemy planes and blowing up the refinery, Doug lands at the airport and gets his now wounded father on board the plane. Obviously, evil, no longer so self-promised, the dictator is angry with these antiquities and takes himself to the sky to shoot Doug. But the young boy listens to other rock music and throws the bad guy out of the sky. HURRAY! After Doug and Chappy shot down 90% of their air force, foreigners send their last few planes in a somewhat bad attempt to shoot Doug down, but within the time limit, and at the time of US F16's turn and scares. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie. It was the very first videotape I brought, and until the age of twenty I had hoped my dad would be shot down over a foreign country to save him. But he doesn't like flying, so it didn't happen.
