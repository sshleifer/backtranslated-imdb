For the first time I saw this film back in the early 1990s and fell in love with it.richrich benjamin and his wife paula of 1981 made the film "Saturday 14" in 1981 before making this film in 1983.i They think they work pretty well This movie has made me laugh on several occasions. He also has a young molly ringwald, who would later film movies like pretty pink and sixteen candles at the end of the 1980s. Not seeing many people .. I don't even think the average movie fan ever heard of this movie.but when I first came across I was glad I did.i gave this movie 10 out of 10 stars as I think it's a fun movie the whole family can enjoy.lastly I would like to say that it is not available on DVD, so I picked up a VHS copy on eBay, so if your interested, you probably can find one on it can be in the $ 20- $ 30 dollar range but i have mind for $ 12 bucks. i wish it would eventually release on DVD.
