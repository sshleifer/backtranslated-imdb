That's more the same thing that made this cartoon popular ..... but who complains? It's always fun to see how poor coyotes try out different counterparts to get on Road Runner, and then crush them with each of those inventions. The underground cave chase was different from ordinary fare and was smart. This gave us an aerial view of the chase in a maze-like structure. I didn't say it was merry; It just differs from ordinary above-ground antiquities. This one, along with some other Road Runner shorts, appears on Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 and their transfers are spectacular. Colors are beautiful.
