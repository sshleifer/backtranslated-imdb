I don't understand why this show didn't work out, there could be different ways to continue on Darwin and Faria's line after Season 2, apparently Darwin couldn't be a UC agent infiltrating cells and sabotaging them from inside, but they should still show this show at least another season. The show is well populated, credible and Islamic religion sees both normal and extremist. It touches on controversial topics in detail and has a dramatic meaning that can be said today about a very small number of shows. I am actually sad that I did not know about this exhibition until the end of 2007.
