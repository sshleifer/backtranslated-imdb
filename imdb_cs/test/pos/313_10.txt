Francis Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" is not a Vietnam War movie. Don't confuse it with one. It is set at the back end of the war, but it is a metaphorical exposure to the worsening effects war has on the human psyche. It is also one of the most daring films ever made, produced, or even conceived (the second to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Calling it a masterpiece would be an underestimation of proportions as ambitious as the film's production levels. <br /> <br /> Starting Without Credits and the ensuing unforgettable first-stage scene of Doors "The End" as a hallucination of Martin Sheen's captain Benjamin L. Willard for helicopter and napalm images is essentially explained in the first episode of Willard's mission to "end ... with extreme prejudice", Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has always left AWOL in the far vicinity of the Cambodian jungle and, as his general said, is "out there without any and is still in the field commanding troops." Kurtz is a deceitful colonel now worshiped by a large group of followers who it is called god, operati seems somewhat more manageable than the actual struggle, but the path it is about to take, it will be a personal quest that will challenge human behavior. <br /> <br /> Joining a small crew on a vast river flow in a broken ship. On the way, Willard is educated in all Kurtz things. During Sheen's hoarse voice, he refines his thoughts about the amount of material he reads. Kurtz was a highly decorated and respected Green Beret. He was a normal man with his family until his part succumbed to the horrors of human brutality and led the way that Willard led. Descent into the jungle is marked by a fascinating aura that reflects the battles that fight, not far. Finally, the power of experiential weights on the group as drugs and some sort of attack itself attack their senses. However, Willard seems dissatisfied and numb in his quest to find Kurtz. As he reads about this mythical figure, he is attracted to male power and why he has become what he has become. We know that the slow disintegration of Willard will be parallel to Kurtz's. Marlon Brando has been honored for decades. His presence: inviolable. His genius: undeniable. But for those who are unfamiliar with his acting prowess and not used to his physical nuances, Brando can be perceived as a hack in the eyes of an uncompromising viewer. Certainly not. Brando was hard to work with, hard to interpret and misunderstand, but his talent for incomprehensible screams and unmatched monologues is irrefutable. The man probably knew what he was doing, though not. His Colonel Kurtz is a being of unlimited delusions and constant stupidity. If the film is any hint of a journey to hell than the real Francis Francis Coppola experience, this masterpiece is the real life story of one man a fanatical struggle to make a film. It is reported that during the film's 200 plus day photography principle plan, Coppola considered suicide. The film was not just an undeniable struggle to be done; It is an exhausting film to watch. Coppola's sweat and blood seep through the pores of steamy locals and his dedication filters through the holes of Martin Sheen's scary soldier Willard. I can't help but feel the warm feeling of nostalgia for this type of movie. At the dawn of everything that was original and unprecedented, films that were attacked and stimulated were commonplace. The Audacity Party, Apocalypse Now Is Pure Movie Creation. My respect and admiration for Mr. Coppola is of the highest order. But when I return to what has become the norm for today's film standards, I am trembling: lack of innovation. It's not just the unoriginality of today's world of cinematography; it is the fact that no one seems to want to tell the story or tell him the heart. But we still have big ones like Coppola's masterpiece, a film that has bathed in its ability to give us something deeper than what we could understand. This depth in the Apocalypse is a step into madness. Killing can interfere. Losing innocence can discourage. But it is a pity from within; The myriad of images that bother us, excite and break away from our everyday world and memories that plague our deepest thoughts that ultimately separate us from humanity and drive us into the realm of instinct, wildness and animal life. If the idea of ​​killing does not provide nourishment, the killing act provides one with a basic catharsis.
