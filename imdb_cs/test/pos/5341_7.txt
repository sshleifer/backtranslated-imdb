Going to this movie, I was a little careful. I've always been a little ugly about movies of illusion. I've always enjoyed decent animated movies, but deception has always been different for me. But this surprised me. Wallace and Gromit are extremely nice characters and it's a great story with jokes for all ages. They are silly jokes for kids and gentle but over the heads of small children, jokes for us older people. A very neat anatomy and while the story had holes, kept my interest starting to end. It's so rare to find clean and intact humor these days, this film was all the more refreshing. Wallace and Gromit are going to do their normal thing that HUMANELY smooths people who destroy people's crops. This time, however, they find themselves in a fight with some kind of big rabbit who can't keep human traps. Great laughter and a great hour and a half of fun. If you haven't exposed Wallace and Gromit, I recommend this movie. The only reason I rate him 7 and not higher is that it's still a family movie and I don't have kids. . I liked it, but if I watched it with some small rats and my wife, it would certainly be at least 9! Try it!
