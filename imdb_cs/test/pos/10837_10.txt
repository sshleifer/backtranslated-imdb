I must say that this is a sign that this film appeals to all ages if someone breaks away from something that the gay man loves at a distance. I thought every last piece of this movie was amazing and the cast was excellent, but I have to say that Anna Chancellor ... where you have been my whole life. When I saw Anna in several other things before, I was completely blown away by how beautiful she was. Diana Letherby doesn't have to be the best of characters, but she could definitely take me home if she was excited ...
