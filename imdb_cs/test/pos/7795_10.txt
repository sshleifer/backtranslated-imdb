Rajkumar Santoshi tries his hands in comedy and succeeds. One of the few good films that include Salman Khan. Very fun movie from start to finish. All characters contribute to the film and believe that there are plenty of them. Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Raveena Tandon, Karishma Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Viju Khote, Jagdip, Deven Verma, Shakti Kapoor, Harish Patel, Tiku Talsania and others. Direction, cut, sound are not up to par, but it doesn't matter because the actors more than make up this part.
