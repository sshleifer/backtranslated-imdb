He loved this movie !! Great actress Carla Gugino. An interesting story about a kidnapping that's terribly bad (not everyone?). Some surprising twists and turns in the film and the plot were easy to follow without being so convoluted that they were completely incomprehensible. It was a totally unexpected joy. More "Quentin-ish" than most movies try to be.
