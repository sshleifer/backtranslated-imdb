OK, so Paris Hilton sucks (typical Malibu Barbie), but the other actors are just great! I watched the movie last night and it let me go through the whole movie. Chad Michael Murray IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he's just an actor. Hero's overall man. The main girl who is the sister of a nickname (chad) is such a great actress. Thumbs up. I think it's so different from the movies of their days, most of them go with psychopaths, possessions, ghosts, but here's a topic about wax! I was totally scared of wax models in the house, even though they looked so real. At this point, I don't have a twin story yet, I'm just waiting to get on the DVD and then watch it again. Thumb on such a great movie! 11/10. All those people who don't like it, don't hesitate to 2 criticize my opinion because most of them all think it's okay. I also think Paris scene when the underwear belts are totally uncomfortable. Why not just get a dog shagging some cats .. be more fun then that. When the Parisian death scene came, I thought it was poor when she was still running, though her leg just lifted her knife. Interestingly. CHAD ALL THEY!
