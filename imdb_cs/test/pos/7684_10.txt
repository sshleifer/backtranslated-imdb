When will ART overcome racism? I believe Americans have grown up since this film was made. Porgy consists of stellar cast and music. This film is an excellent adaptation of the great opera. Miss Saigon is based on Madame Butterfly, Les Miz is based on the classic book. Recently, an opera based on The Fly was introduced in Los Angeles. OPERA !! Budi≈æ !! Disney hesitates to release Song of the South. The NAACP has no competition for racing issues and let's not forget that Amos N Andy was a huge hit in the 1950s as a TV series. Ethnicity is our US heritage and we should accept all forms of ethnic artistic diversity. <br /> <br /> PLEASE PORGY ON DVD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> j hartz
