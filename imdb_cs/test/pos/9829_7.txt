She will arrange with her and see if she knows or has no idea. They begin to befriend each other and then start an intense affair (which could be considered a healing of both) from their mutual pain and anxiety. memories of the dead and the pressures from their respective jobs separate them and cause more harm than good or can they escape the past?
