Jingofighter I agree with some of your comments, but I have to disagree on a few things. First, this movie is nothing like CARS THAT ATE Paris. No IMHO. Nothing like that. I think the film had elements of surrealism, but I think the filmmaker's basic approach is not "surrealistic" in itself. that's why it's not really like CARS Paris, I think more like the strange work of the Euro, with some scenes carrying the "wierd" mark not surreal. Second, I think Heuzenroeder's music is great. They used the whistling, the old sound from the Country and Western records and its waaayyy better than most Aussie movies, which usually make a filmmaker with the stupid sound group of Indy the company wants to push. <br /> <br /> As for the title of the movie - I don't know why it's called Modern Love, I was a little hopeful for David Bowie to look dressed in drag and lipstick ... opps I'm starting to show my age.
