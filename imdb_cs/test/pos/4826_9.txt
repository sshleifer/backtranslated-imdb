I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by this film.

The atmosphere was great, the scenery was amazing, and the undead kids scared me afraid ... I live in a wooded area, so garbage picking creeps for some time. The film works for me to accept what I have already mentioned. Pick up Mom's mom and I'll give her ten ...
