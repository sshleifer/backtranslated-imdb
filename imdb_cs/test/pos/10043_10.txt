this is amazing !!! There is no partnership like Errol and Olivia. love is true! I'm 24, but this movie is as charming now as I'm sure it was 60 years ago. Raoul Walsh is an undervalued genius, his direction so extensive, so wide, yet intimate. the last scene between Colonel Custer (Flynn) and his wife (de havilland) almost brought me to tears (not easy for a 24-year-old guy!), his so heartbreaking. There is also a deep Christian message that knows that Custer has his glory and trust and loyalty to his wife to the point of letting him go to fulfill his moral duty to protect innocent civilians from a particular massacre. There is no film to deal with these issues. You have to see for anyone who wants to look at this crucial moment in American and military history from within. patriotic, for all the right reasons. I knew Errol Flynn was a star, and De havilland was a legend on the screen - it just confirms my suspicion that she is one of the biggest!
