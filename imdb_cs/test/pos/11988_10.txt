The only imaginable mistake of this movie is the title! Stop comparing it with the first one! I did in my previous review only to separate from the first. If you haven't seen the movie and are curious, forget the first one and come up with another name for it. There is nothing like it and it has its own mood. This is a great comedy exponent in the mid 1980s. I seriously doubt that such big names in this cast made the movie because it was broken or even wanted to redo the first. Anyone who wants to kick a snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus. I say the only reason it's at the bottom of the IMDB 100 is its name. I usually hate movies like these (ie Adam sandler, will be farrell, farrelly bros ....), but this movie keeps me hysterical. I don't know, maybe it's like a bad relationship I can't get out or just ridiculous guilt pleasure. Either way, this is the only most valuable film of the 1980s for 'The Stunt Man'.
