"In the Line of Fire" is one of the best thrillers I've seen, built, and built on the big peak. This movie really pulls you into your heart, beats them and you're out of action. The cast turns into strong performances, especially Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich. This film is professionally managed by the thrilling master Wolfgang Petersen. Thrillers don't give it much better, don't miss it.
