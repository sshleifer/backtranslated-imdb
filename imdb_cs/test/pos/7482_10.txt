I was referred to this film by a friend. I've never heard of it, but I thought it was Christopher Lampbert, so I rented it, and I found out it wasn't Christopher Lampbert, it was Thomas Jane who was a great movie. I love that almost the whole movie is set in this suburban house. The characters were great all of them and the script was amazing I really wish Skip Woods wrote and directed another movie. In his book Thursday is the flawless story of this guy who is trying to make a woman and child a thing after a shady past, but then his old drug dealer buddy appears and happens quite Thursday. This is one of my favorite movies and shows some real potential in Thomas Jane. But this movie is very rare, but I found it in several Hollywood Video on VHS. Dust from the old video recorder and pop on Thursday because of Pee Wee's seal of approval
