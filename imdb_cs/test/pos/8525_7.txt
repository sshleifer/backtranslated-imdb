I always liked Sean Connery, but as James Bond I always preferred Roger Moore. Still it was Connery who set the Bond standard and while he had in 1983 settled down as something other than James Bond, the money had to be irresistible for him to do one more look like 007 and save the world from evil Specter designs. And what suggestions are in Never Say Never Again. SPECTER, with the help of a stupid young Air Force officer, who becomes Brother Kim Bassinger, stole two nuclear missiles during nuclear war games, and now SPECTER, headed by Blofeld, played by Max Von Sydow, threatens the blackmail of the world. Von Sydow's operation is Klaus Maria Brandauer, who also pampers Bassinger and is a bit crazy. And he has a female murderer at Barbara Carrera who makes Angelina Jolie as Nora Croft Mrs. Butterworth. But before Sean Connery can start, he has to deal with the new 'M' British Intelligence Run. Edward Fox thinks Connery is old-fashioned in his methods and costs British taxpayers for too much money. I really liked Fox's performance, it's like Colonel Blimp's great grandson. I also enjoyed Carrera, she is something to watch and is very inventive in her methods. When diving with Connery in the Bahamas, notice how Mr. Shark puts the 007 case. <br /> <br /> Will Connery be James Bond again? He was widely cited as saying who would they occupy him as at this point, Roger Moore's father? But I think Connery would still be impressive in a wheelchair.
