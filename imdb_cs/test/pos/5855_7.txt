Cassie (Sandra Bullock) is a hyper-serious police detective. As a former friend, he once tried to kill her, and he really left her severely injured, determined to bring justice to those who harm others. As a result of her near death experience, Cassie also favors one night stands and believes no one. One day a dead woman is found in a forest near the Cassie community. She was murdered heinously, defeated heavily and let herself die. Cassie naturally stops and doesn't find killers. Helping her is a fellow officer, Sam (Ben Chaplin). He soon finds out that Cassie is a tireless attitude and versatile instinct when he asks him to pick up a sample of vomit left on the scene for analysis, among other things. The route will soon lead them to two high school students, Richard (Ryan Gosling) and Justin (Michael Pitt). Could these teenagers really be responsible for planning and implementing the perfect "joy" of killing? This is an interesting movie, but viewers should be warned that the subject is really grim. Killing "sports" is seldom the theme of films that are varieties of "all sweets and lights" and this is no different. That means the cast is great. Bullock, without a hint of her comedy talent, is amazing as a police officer whose own past forces her to lock out the evil people in the world. Chaplin is also pretty nice as a detective who is attracted and discouraged by the strong Cassie. As for Gosling, he gives the most memorable performance as a brilliant mind with a satanic soul. The production values ​​of the film are also good, with suitably fine costumes, settings and photography. If you're a Bullock fan looking for laughter, it's not the one for you. But if you adore mysteries, even the nicest conspiracies, you'll find this story charming.
