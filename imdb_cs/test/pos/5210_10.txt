The people of my generation and those who are older know about World War II (or what is called the Great Patriotic War in Russia) not only from school books but from witnesses and participants in the event. My grandfather was a soldier at Stalingrad, and when I was little I listened to his stories about how he defeated the Germans. He also told me some anecdotes, not everything he told me was grim. But it was a long time ago and not when I was conscious of what had happened there at the Battle of Stalingrad, I had to turn to the books and films for information. Most of the movies I saw were some made in the Soviet Union. The exception is "Stalingrad". In the film, the war is described from the opposite side and the reality itself is interesting. All that is shown in the film is completely different from what I am used to. The film reminds me of a lot of Remarque's "Zeit zu leben und Zeit zu sterben" because war is shown through the perception of an ordinary German soldier. And this soldier or lieutenant is rather obsessed with repeating that he is by no means a fascist. Film heroes coming straight from pure and enthusiastic Europe, coming from the Italian coast to the snow-covered hungry Soviet Union. They are doomed to death; it is clear from the beginning. After the elite separation that took part in their first fight in Stalingrad, one of the soldiers declared an expression that reflects the whole idea for me; he said, "When you start thinking, you're going crazy". And in my opinion, this also applies to the audience. One can think, OK, I'll just watch this movie and not distract me, I don't have to apologize to people on screen like those who attacked my country and not the other way around. . However sooner or later, but inevitably begins with sympathetic characters. Probably when the lieutenant choked his tears when he saw Kolya's execution. "Stalingrad" is hard to follow, all these frostbitten legs, dirt, executions, snow, famine, have destroyed illusions. As I know, Lieutenant Hans von Witzland is one of the few films where Thomas Kretschmann played his star roles. I was looking at quite a lot of Hollywood movies, where he got unimportant portions of small fries like "Next" or "Transsiberian" (why did he do that!!). And after watching "Stalingrad", I cannot tell that European actors would like to appear in American films, even at a second prize. The reality guesses me deeply. I believe that Thomas Kretschmann deserves better parts and much better scenarios than those he gave him in Hollywood. And from what I saw with him, "Stalingrad" is best, except for doubt. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the worst "Stalingrad" is the disadvantage of the way in which he speaks Russian in the film. I mean, of course, those who are supposed to be Russian. Say, the boy who spent some time with the Germans or the girl they wanted to escape with. Was it really so hard to find actors who could say a few sentences without the terrible accent? Initially, I decided to watch "Stalingrad" just to listen to native speakers because I study language. I didn't expect anything extraordinary film. But it impressed me when I didn't go, so I cried. I know I'm 15 years late to watch it, but "Stalingrad" is not a movie that runs around the table, and after 15 years it's still observable and shocking.
