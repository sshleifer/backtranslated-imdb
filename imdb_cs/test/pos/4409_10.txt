Just to fix something in the previous review, I don't believe this movie is just for people who know London, it's a very specific situation that is used to make universal comments. Jack Rosenthal says at the beginning of the screenplay that it was about characters who, by going through this exhausting Knowledge Test, get some degree of self-knowledge. I think it's one of the most perfectly written drama I've ever seen: technically, it's totally adept at getting quite complex details, but it's also joyful about how it involves you. At the beginning, you know nothing about this test of knowledge in London than about the main characters, but you will get through with them until it is vital for you. You become extremely proud of those characters who succeed, and you are crushed for those who do not. Especially the one whose fall without doing this will make your hands fly into the face. Just like the fact, the character of Nigel Hawthorne, Mr. Burgess, is called Vampire, not Dracula. You don't need to know, I'm not saying it's essential, but it's a drama scale: once you see it, you'll want everyone to be and you will evangelize every detail of it. <br /> <br /> I hope you see it.
