Unlike Bond and other detective films, Alfred Hitchcock's hero was an ordinary person who got into trouble and then with his courage and courage (and happiness) got it. The gem thief is based on the same principle, and in a way Vijay Anand is a tribute to the Tension Commander. A tribute to how it can be, but it stands on its own foundations and establishes Vijay Anand as a great director himself. It's the story of an ordinary man, Vinay, who someday realizes he has a double Amar. who is actually a jewel thief. Suddenly, Vinay finds himself in the middle of a hatching scheme and rescues himself as he sets off on a wild goose chase to find that Amara who is one step ahead of him. The tension is almost killing throughout the film and how the plot conspiracy is hit by the brilliance of the system. Like Hitchcock's films, a jewel thief can boast a spectacular climax in the great palace of Sikkim. Everyone and I mean everyone; Dev Anand, Vijay Anand, Ashok Kumar, Vajyanti Mala, Tanuja, SD Burman, Kishore Kumar, Majrooh Sultanpuri etc. They are in their best forms. This is one of the best thrillers ever made in India.
