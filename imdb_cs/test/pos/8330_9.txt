We bought a DVD "Walking with Dinosaurs" and we were excited about things that make it very good. Many DVDs today offer a bare minimum ... the function itself and perhaps one other language (which does not help the viewer at all, but makes it easier for the company to see DVDs in multiple markets). <br /> <br /> This is not the case with WWD. There are plenty of amazing add-ons and sophisticated labels that also follow the navigation menu *. Intra to every chapter of "The Making Of" DVD is ridiculously laughing. The sound and video quality is amazing. And of course the story and the content ... what more could a dinosaur lover want? I looked at most of the TDC-released version (told by Avery Brooks) and watched about half of the DVD (told by Kenneth Branaugh). As close as I can say, the broadcast version slipped into a number of mostly American slang terms in narration (ie In the section on T. Rex mating, Branugh says "The woman's tiring male attention" and Brooks says, "Honeymoon ended") and they cut out some of the approaching puppets. I prefer the Branugh version simply because it's more complete. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's great value and beautiful production. many kudos to the BBC and the crew that made this jewel.
