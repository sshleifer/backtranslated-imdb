Guy's family was so long, but at the beginning of the season I lost my sharp and random humor. Although I enjoyed the Blue Harvest, it felt that the remaining episodes were "packed" - episodes where producers made little attempt to meet America's reputation as American social satire. I've seen all the episodes of Season 7 and I was absolutely surprised and happy that Family Guy found his true colors again. Season 7 brings a lot of fantastic episodes and lots of jokes about the current situation in America, which is exactly what we need right now - more fun. I feel that the Simpsons have lost all the sparks, but this show has made a wonderful recovery from proving how perfectly they can be satirical. Good work!
