An interesting look at the experience of immigrants, written as a fable with some strange image. I got into this movie because it tells about immigrants from Sicily who traveled to America. I imagine the same as my grandfather. I cannot imagine traveling in the wheelhouse to make sure that the boats are loaded, as this film shows. Laws restricting immigrants existed. I guess these laws were stricter for those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants had to be deprived of infectious diseases or hereditary diseases. In the film we see physical and mental examination, the other because low intelligence is hereditary. Unmarried women could not enter the country, provided they became prostitutes, so most married single men were already in the country, as previously agreed, on Ellis Island before entry. This is the story of a British immigrant (Charlotte Gainsbourg) who has arranged to marry a poor Sicilian (Vincenzo Amato). He tries to get his family with a son who is dumb and mother (Aurora Quattrocchi), who is considered a weak mind. By the way, she was fantastic in this role. <br /> <br /> In the last show you will also see actor Vincent Schiavelli. I don't know if his last movie was released. He plays a matchmaker and is also very good. It was a strange but pleasant movie. It's not for everyone, because I think those who are not interested in immigration experience would consider it slow.
