I watched Love Jones more than thirty times. It is one of the rare films that capture a love story about people who are African-Americans. The dialogue was written in realism and delivered with honesty. It was nice to see a movie where the story focused on young professional African-Americans. This is a virtually untapped market. Love Jones was also visually captivating. Chemistry between Lorenzo Tate and Nia Long will bring back memories of past and present love. The sensation of the film is jazz and blues and brings the sensuality of warm warm creamy chocolate with the splash of Kahlu and Butterscotch. If you didn't, I loved it!
