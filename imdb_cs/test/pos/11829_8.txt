An interesting story and sympathetic treatment of racial discrimination, the Son of Gods, is too long and contains some hammy acting, but overall remains a fascinating film. The Story of a Chinese Transition as White (Rchard Barthelmess) begins as Barthelmess leaves college after being offended by a trio of mindless collaborators. He sets out on a world tour to appear and finish as Secretary of the British playwright (Claude King). In Monte Carlo she meets beautiful Alanna Wagner (Constance Bennett) and falls in love. But when he finds out he's a Chinese man, it's an unforgettable scene. Alanna, plagued by guilt and love, goes into the mental spiral and tries to contact Barthelmess. After his father dies, he takes over the business (banking?) And the Chinese garment as a symbol of his hatred of the White Race, who rejected him. After a San Francisco detective tells him the truth about his birth, Barthelmess decides to honor his Chinese father and mother. And I agree that one reviewer never saw this movie. Alanna declares her love for Sam before telling her about her recent discovery. And that's the difference in this movie. Barthelmess and Bennett have several scenes in which scenery is on the move, but overall it is a solid and interesting drama. Frank Albertson is good because dear college boy, Claude King is solid as playwright Bathurst, Bess Flowers has one scene like Oklahian Indian, and E. Alyn Warren is Chinese father, Dorothy Mathews is ugly Alice. Not so good are Anders Randolf as Bennett's father and Mildred Van Dorn as Eileen. Also note the beautiful blondes to the right of Barthelmess at the roulette table. What a stunner who was!
