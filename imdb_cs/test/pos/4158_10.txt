I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo' (still known in the US as 'The Golden Door') and was impressed by both the dream and the occasional surrealist story of a family who emigrated from Sicially to the US in the early days. 20th century. He also acted as a (proverbial) middle finger stuck in the inner security eyeball (preferably up to the third joint) in his ill-treatment of strangers who want to have a better life than they do. the original maternal soil. (Mostly) Italian cast, with a few exceptions works fine. This is a quiet, inconspicuous movie that is beautiful to look at (occasional but tasteful use of surrealism is always a pleasure), while the script is well written. This is a movie for those who are sick and tired of a mindless escape from Hollywood, which is little more than selling popcorn (not that I have some hot problems with popcorn, you think of you! --- Actually I like those things ). You would wisely look for Nuovomondo / The Golden Door (or whatever it is called in your area).
