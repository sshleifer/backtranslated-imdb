Ted Danson was a great choice to play Gulliver. Although his background was mostly comedy, he shows that he can do drama just as well or perhaps better (though there is a lot of humor in it). It's hard to close your eyes to his American accent, especially since his character is supposed to be English, but that's just a small thing. All villains are just as well occupied: James Fox, Edward Fox, Peter O, Toole, Warwick Davis, John Standing, etc. Despite the fact that most of them are either small people or giants, they are 100 % plausible in everything they do and their motivation is very clear, for example, the Lilliput who are constantly struggling with Gulliver, Grildrig (a giant) hatred of the dwarf against him for asserting his position as a jester, an attempt by dr. Steenburgen is brilliant as Mary Gulliver (another 17th century English accent, but does not matter). She is a deeply troubled character because she waits nine years for her husband to return home, and when he finally does, he talks about small people, giants, flying island and talking horses! Mary, despite the strong element of imagination in the story, is a very credible character. Special effects are breathtaking, especially when you realize that it was filmed on TV at a time when CGI was in his childhood. It looks very realistic when we see a 6 foot tall man walking through a city full of people 6 inches tall. The cameras are also great: Omar Sharif, Richard Wilson, Sir John Gielgud, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ned Beatty. All the great actors who create strong support that complements Danson's great acting ability. Houynhnhms and Yahoos are probably the most effective element of the story on the satire of things: companies of talking horses who have no vices that people have, while Yahoos are primitive, outrageous people who dignify strongly and name their leaders in depending on how disgusting he is. The study of Gulliver and Mistress is also very well done and displays the differences and similarities between people and Yahoos. <br /> <br /> The best version of "Gulliver's Travels" by far and one of the best mini-series ever.
