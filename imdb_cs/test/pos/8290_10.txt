CHIPMUNE ADVENTURES <br /> <br /> There are several movies I could watch all my life and never get tired of them, and this nostalgic favorite is one of them. CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE was an attempt to bring old favorites back to the front of the animation, this time on the big screen. At the age when Disney dominated the film industry in terms of animation and cashier quality, CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE is one of the best animated films that Disney did not produce in the 1980s. The story is simple and elementary, having Alvin, Simon and Theodore compete in a around-world-world race with Chipettes (Janette, Eleanor, and Brittany). However, as chipmunks encounter exotic dangers, they are unaware that they are pawns in the main diamond robbery. CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE has never been and will never be a movie that floats thanks to the engrossing plot. And for people who didn't love him as a child, the film will probably never be more than a fun, yet forgotten, animated film. But for me it will always be a little known masterpiece. Something about the movie just clicks for me as several movies do. <br /> <br /> Every song is fun, positive and harmless. Among the most significant are the Chipettes in slightly risqu√© Arabic dance to calm the snakes. There is also a very sweet song in which Chipmunks sing about traveling around the world and we get them to see major landmarks around the world. One thing about Chipmunk characters is that, despite potentially annoying vocals, composers have always managed to write songs that were catchy without ever grating. This film is no exception ... in fact, it boasts one of the best soundtracks of the 80s animated film if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Every joke is cute, honest and fun. The bites between the bad guys and the pampered puppy are very fun. And also the shock of the Emperor being forced to marry. The comedy can be constantly played on the kids so that nothing is missed, but everything remains charming to adults with a nostalgia that will entertain them. It's a really fun trip that is absolutely humble in its ambitions. CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE never tries to be anything but harmless entertainment. I will be the first to admit that it is a distorted review because I have such a nostalgic kindness to CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE that I could never give her a bad review ... but still fills me with such childlike viewing pleasure. Everyone has a random favorite since childhood that no one knows, and for me it's this movie. And any movie I can watch over and over again, whether I'm 5, 12, 23 or older, is a great movie in my eyes. <br /> <br /> ... A- ...
