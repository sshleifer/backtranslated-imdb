Let's get it straight from the start: I'm an asshole with the emotional sensitivity of cubic stone. Therefore, I consider the dramas of people with disabilities, the social stigma or any illnesses they have to be crying and about being stupid films with bad taste. If you have a message, you can say it without the help of sick or pitiful people. However, I liked this movie. It's about people with incredible bad luck because it's about personal health, but they're not talking about it, on the contrary, they're trying to live and people are trying to "protect" or "take care of" them by actively removing them from real life. life. The message is a living life to the full, even if the end is as sad as possible. <br /> <br /> My conclusion: as sick people dramas, it's a breeder. It's sad, but hopeful. I like James McAvoy, though he always seems to have played an arrogant rebel. I also say that Steven Robertson played very well. Either that, or it really has partial paralysis. :)
