"King QUEENS," is in my opinion a pure CBS hit! Despite the fact that I have never seen every episode, I still enjoyed it very much. For this reason, it is difficult for me to say which episode is my favorite. Still, I have to say that CBS really knows how to make a good sitcom. Before I wrapped it up, I'd like to say that everyone always gives good performance, production design is spectacular, costumes are well designed and writing is always very strong. In conclusion, if this show lives in syndication after CBS goes out, I strongly recommend that you catch it just in case it looks good.
