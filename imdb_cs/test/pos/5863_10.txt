Perhaps this film is one of the most creative works of horror. He has everything you could want ... tension, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native Americans, eating your brain ... If you're looking for everything that's over, all the movies that get into your brain don't look anything else. The story of a man seeking revenge. And how is it better? "I know, suck their brains!" With great sound effects and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie.
