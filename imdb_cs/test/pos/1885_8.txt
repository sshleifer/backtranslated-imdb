Classical comedy. The moment the brain breaks, it's a two-minute scene with Bruce Campbell, who is partially defeated, reminding me how simplistic movies and ideas can grab and wrap you in the whole movie. For years and years, Bruce Campbell knows what kind of movies we want from him. We want to see weird movies like Bubba Ho Tep. We want to see the role in Sam Raimi and we want to see 'Man with the Screaming Brain'. With the title itself, one knows that it will be the boundary that a totally stupid type of movie, like an army of darkness, with only more stupid and less monsters. The idea of ​​a movie is simple. Bruce sees the doctor. The doctor has a new idea. Bruce gets bad stuff happened to him on the way to the doctor. Coincidentally, the doctor wanted to show that he would save him. Then happiness follows. With the addition of Ted Raimi as a strange Russian guy, and journeyman Stacy Keach as dr. Ivan Ivanovich Ivanova, it's funny to have this movie. Complete funny. There is never a scary point. <br /> <br /> If you like stupid Bruce Campbell, you'll like it. And then, why would you watch it if you didn't like Bruce Campbell?
