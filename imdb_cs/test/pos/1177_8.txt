Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, both of whom are unfortunately left out, have once again proven that it is a team dedicated to their craft skills to make happy moments on the screen. This film is just another example. This time, the two sister-in-laws who land on the ship are playing as deck instructors. their boss is a perfectionist and unhappy man named Gil Godwin who likes to harass these boys. It's fun as Lemmon gives a quick lesson when dancing to Matthau and dancing a riotous rumba dance with the owner of the Rue McLanahan. so little, but their parts require it. Matthau falls on Dyan Cannon, aboard with his mother, who is a dig, the usual outrageous Elaine Stritch. Matthau has no money. Lemmon's widower falls on Gloria De Haven, looks better than ever. The film belongs to Matthau and Lemmon and will serve as another tribute to their famous career.
