This is one of Peter Sellers' best films. Why is he never appearing on TV or in the cinema? Will it ever be released as a home movie? Is it too derogatory for medicine? I'd like to see this film again. I'd like my son to see it, a doctor. Laughter is the best medicine and Peter Sellers is the best doctor.
