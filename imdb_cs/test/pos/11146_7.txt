Those reviewers who complained that this film lacks credibility or has problems with construction is missing. This is wonderfully camp romance, with lots of play, gypsies! Dance, Gypsies! music that both sends exotic love stories and celebrates them. On Ray Milland's on, he makes a fun foil for Dietrich with black hair, tousled scarves and lots of jewelry. The eagerness of the character to feed Millanda and take care of him more resembles a good German hausfrau Dietrich was off set than her polite role vamp. Censorship is in force, it is clear that they share the caravan only on platonic terms, while Milland fights Dietrich's procedures with a determination remarkable for a heterosexual bachelor who can be killed at any time. His only excuse is that he smells, so perhaps even a sultry, pernicious Englishman may be postponed. In a small role as a young companion Milland on his secret mission, Bruce Lester adds a different note to the camp's note. Initially, we tell him he loves Milland, and actually he is rather fawn. When, after being separated, she meets Milland, now converted to brown skin with her waist-open shirt, his shining recognition of the disguise further suggests that not only Dietrich is romantically in love with Milland. Despite the amazingly improbable characters and sequence of events, Milland's growing love for Dietrich and his acceptance of irrational aspects of life is rather moving. And when they say on their last night alone before he escapes, that each of them now contains half the other, the two have happened once and then the darkness falls, I think we can assume the censor decided to give them a break. !

Since Milland was a British, he had to say so, because American filmmakers feared that the American audience would be scattered and confused by British style.
