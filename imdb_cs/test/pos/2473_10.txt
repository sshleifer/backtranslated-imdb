I can't believe I missed this. Made in 1970 with a budget that would probably allow you to make one indifferent TV soap episode, that is, 90 minutes of durable, sharp-edged knife film production. On this page you can find outlines, plots, etc. Consider that the whole thing was filmed using a single, 16mm camera that was held in your hand, the whole dialogue is improvised ... none of the actors appeared before the camera ... disaster. Instead of getting hippies in the cops running around in the California desert, what's going on in "it's not fair." The only problem is that the director is constantly shifting you and we are still not sure who he is at the end of 90 minutes. Brilliant ... Pretty brilliant.
