It is a video version of the theatrical production with extra shooting for video release. The result gains as a stage drama with the impact of a well-made film. George Tsypin's set, with Julie Taymor's statues and masks, is excellent. Jessye Norman is amazing and you can hear (and see) young Bryn Terfel. This production is stunning, emotional and majestic. If you don't see it, you missed it.
