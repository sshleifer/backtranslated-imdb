"Falcon and Snowman" is the story of two young men, a CIA employee and a drug dealer who are disillusioned with US foreign policy and sell state secrets to the Soviet Union. Film events are based on a true story. Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn are convincing in leadership and developing interesting characteristics. The support cast also performs well, especially with the performance of David Suchet of Hercule Poirot fame as an experienced Soviet agent. The film is generally effective in setting out its assumption and its development and giving meaning to two boys have caught on in something they did not understand, but inside. It seems, however, that they are too long and cumbersome in the center. But the end is tense, overwhelming and effective. There are some catchy rock songs included in the soundtrack, but also unfortunately repeated soft synth tracks that do not fit with the spy story. There are other spy movies worth looking than "The Falcon and Snowman," but it's a decent movie.
