I was watching a lot of TV at the age of 51, but I didn't have so much fun a week after week as I watched Oz. The whole cast was excellent. Writing was just perfect, with each character consistent for six years. I also enjoyed chaos and ultra-violence. This may sound strange, but sometimes it was a comic discovery of how one of the characters would end up dead. I especially enjoyed the real romance and love between Beecher and Keller. These two men really knew how to throw themselves in all possible ways. I really hope HBO will continue to show us the re-run of this great FOREVER show! I watched every episode at least 4 times, but I'm still looking forward to Tuesday and Thursday evening at 23:00. for an episode of this fun and very fun show.
