This movie could do you cooooo. The film was awarded for a dark city trip. Betty (Renee Zellweger) is a lone "acceptable" soap group out there. Her character is so charming and so convincing that you find yourself forgiven for being stupid. I could even get lost in Bettys' delightful imagination if it wasn't because of the real name of Dr. Ravell is George ... And talk about the devil; "Seeker" Greg Kinnear performs his role as PUBLICLY. While Charlie (Morgan Freeman) forces you to make his wish come true, Wesley (Chris Rock) wants to tie you to his chair. And Rosa (Tia Texada) will take you back to those school friends. The Sheriff encourages you to feed him and release his name. The rest of the cast fits well. No one who does the same movie twice is the sister of Betty the exception. One of those long, cold ones who need to smile for something winter.
