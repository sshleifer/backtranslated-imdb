Nostalgia is not always the best reason to watch a movie. More often than not, movies you loved as a child will disappoint you as an adult. While there are exceptions to this rule, it is hard to justify having a Krull DVD, no matter how director's comments might be. Stay Sharp Gen X / Y'ers because dozens of disappointments that dominate your way down the memory lane can stop you stumbling over one worth again. One surprise movie worth a look at Joel Schumacher's Flatliners, a supernatural thriller playing popcorn 80's The Hard Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Julia Roberts and Billy Baldwin. Do you think the goulash of this cast, the wonderful Schumacher atmosphere and the neat eye of cameraman Jan De Bonta would result in something nasty, but calorie sideways ... Flatliners are half bad. Although the design of the production is inexplicably enthusiastic and the photo is excessively stylized (full of neon-soaked streets spouting endless waves of steam), Flatliners is still able to become an effective dark and impressive thriller. If the explanation of why Flatliners was forgotten, it could be because in 1990 another, much supernatural, supernatural thriller was released: Jacob's Ladder. it is likely that Schumacher's flashy thriller would be rejected as a softened, commercialized night market with Adrian Lyn. But with these films released in the same year, Flatliners enjoyed a different fate, tripled JL's at the box office, despite the weakened version of a similar assumption. The past time was not so kind for Flatliners, it was lost at the top of a dated stack of Brat Pack dreck for 80 years, while JL consolidated its reputation as a timeless classic. Fate aside, JL is frighteningly awesome and manages to keep the audience arguing to the last frame, while Flatliners are victims of excessive simplification and Hollywood conveniences that drag the final act into a predictably tidy denouement. The comparison between the two films is unfair and ultimately ignores Flatliners' ability to represent the 1980s at its best. Released at the end of a decade of shallow surplus, Flatliners will always be dated with their hair styles and clothing styles, but in fairness they should also be remembered as a well made film on (or at least near) the top of their particular piles of dreck. For purposes and purposes, this is a fun memory tour.
