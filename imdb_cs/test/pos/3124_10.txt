This film must be as perfect as John Ford's film. The movie is magic, a masterpiece, the reason why Ford was, well Ford. If you want to know why Ford was great, he explains it. Of course, photography is excellent, black and white as black-and-white photos, wonderful shots, not over the shoulder conversations in it, pure Ford, great moments, big and small. Ward Bond's famous torn pants. Two dogs seem to have rushed into the fight and fought so that Ford wanted to use them in the battle scene, but he fled instead of fighting one dog, and the other attacked Ward Bond and ripped his trousers that caused Ford to end merriment. The whole scene around the rope knitting. The way Ben Johnson fires, then snorts his rope, the wonderful foreshadowing and expectation of the final. Naive fucking Harry Carey about caution. An ordinary ford line that he is afraid and does not mention it. Bond's horse accidentally fell into him and his left in the film. Johnson and Bond are fantastic in this scene. Sir, help every Ford actor who doesn't stay in his character when the camera is spinning, even if a horse falls on you. A few very sweet romances that are not related to the focus, two very nice leads, no matter how many times the cameras focus on the relatively nice back of Ben Johnson. Lots of old times stuntmen who get lines and roles, Cliff Lyons, Frank McGrath. Some amazing character studies mostly face staring, all the villains and the main stars. A set of villains rivaling any group in any Western. Many many Fordian face shots, groups, children, women, little things happening, foals in the background (Ford looks like he likes the foals), women in aprons, allowing the moment when cars cross rivers and the camera persists. Probably not a Western, but an artistic image that takes place in the West. The Lucky film was made in 1950 because it is impossible to imagine such a film being made again, but then it is such a work of art that it would be sacrilege to try
