This is the type of movie he chooses initially to make a video store number ..... just to discover an undervalued fun and fun movie !! The opening sequence of the police arriving in the dark and rainy house where "wife" committed murder ....... or is it? .... and the rest of the movie is trying to decipher what really happened. ... OK ... the movie is a little "campy" ... but it has a good editing and dialogue ..... a professional acting performance ..... often funny ...... face expression is one of its best kind ..... definitely worth watching ..... deserves at least 7 or 8!
