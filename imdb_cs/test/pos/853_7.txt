The jungle is more of an adventure than a science fiction movie. The only sci-fi part is Woolly Mammoths currently living. Elephants are attacking villages in part of India, and these attacks also kill people. The expedition is sent to investigate and one of the members of this, an American hunter blames these elephants for being frightened by Woolly Mammoths, which are supposed to be extinct. Nobody trusts him at first, but they do it when Mammoths appear at the end. The earthquake will end them. The Jungle was shot in place in India and has a lot of nice scenery and some good Indian music, including some songs that keep the movie moving nicely. Mammoths are actually real elephants with fur coats and long tusks stuck to their heads. /> <br /> Jungle is worth seeing, just for scenery and music. Very pleasant. <br /> <br /> 3 stars out of 5
