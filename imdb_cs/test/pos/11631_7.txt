I was a little surprised to see all the hateful comments. Of course it's not the best kids show, but people stop scoring Barney so much after class five? Okay, everyone hates Barney. Well, I think his voice and songs are unpleasant. Well, it's a little scary and weird. I'm fourteen, so I know well. But here's the thing. Children? LOVE this show. When I was a little boy of two or three years, my parents spent more time chasing me around the house before doing anything else. Nothing could hold me more than ten minutes. Face to face, that's how toddlers are. Even the hardest ones can't sit long enough to give their parents a break. There is much to be done and see and explore, too many problems to get inside. And then came Barney. I don't know exactly what a purple dinosaur is, which is so fun for kids, but they certainly love it. I know I did it. I was addicted to the show and I wanted to watch it all the time. Yes, the song kind drove my parents nuts, but being able to follow their kids learning, and is excited about something that can really keep their attention span, worth it. I learned ABC and 123, magic words and brushing teeth. Of course I grew up five or six, but at that moment I was at least a little more patient, and I gave my parents a break. All my nieces and nephews went through Barney's stage grew up, a lot to mother's delight. I know what keeps Barney in the air. Having fun. Of course there's Big Bird, Ernie and Oscar, and they're great too. But in the toddler phase, more children seem to prefer the great dinosaur singing. And that's enough for me.
