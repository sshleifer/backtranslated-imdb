I'm not much for "police" movies, but this is supposedly classic and when I found it cheap, I bought it and stuck it on the shelf just to finally get to watch it yesterday, and LIKED it! Now you can have New York City, but as the environment for this movie, in the winter months, it's perfect. Roy Scheider is a member of an elite police working group called The Seven Ups, which is 5 boys who fight crime. In the opening scene, they restore the money box full of antique store money by distracting cheaters with a "blow in the china shop". But that's just the beginning. It seems that there are two guys who act as cops who kidnap crowds and hold them ransom. Richard Lynch becomes one of these slime bags and is as scary as ever. When one of the seven players who performs at the funeral as a limousine driver blows up, he is defeated and crammed into the trunk of a car, which then leads to perhaps one of the most interesting chases I've ever seen. . However, it's amazing how easy it is for the NYC scene to pursue, but it's amazing because Scheider watches the two kidnappers through what I guess is the Bronx and then the turnpike and then finally Scheider's car comes to screech. in one of the most serious chase finals I've ever seen. In any case, because the cop is dying, Scheider and his men are suspicious because the police commissioner knows so little about his activities he is interested in, whether they are doing bearable gangsters, so of course this kind of thinking must be torn in the bud & Scheider is relentless to get to the bottom of things. Overall, a decent police action / drama is not really my business, but I liked this. Look at Joe Spinell (Maniac) in a small role. 7 out of 10.
