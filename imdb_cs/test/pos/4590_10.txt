We just saw this movie in Austin Texas at Alamo South Lamar last afternoon. I laughed many times! The scene about Albert Einstein's thoughts on mankind has struck me over and over, and I couldn't stop laughing. It's too bad that it's not in more theaters, I know a lot of friends who die this movie! "Welcome to Costco, I love you." ... great work for everyone involved! Also, if you see it, be sure to stay until the end of credits as well! I'll take my family to see it again this weekend! If you are a fan of the OFFICE and BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD, you have to watch this movie. It's a classic and no one knows it's out! So if you're in the mood to see something fun this weekend, be sure to try it out.
