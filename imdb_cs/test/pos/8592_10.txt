As for political films, I usually feel empty. They generally occupy some moralistic attitude and you have a clear good vs bad story line as if it is some kind of Batman movie. But with Lumumba it is the first movie that saw it showing politics for what it is, and the real problems of trying to rule a country of broken people who did not know any other rule but violence. There were no good or bad interests and conflicts of interest. This is, in my opinion, the only political film that one can really learn from. Especially for anyone looking at politics as a career, this film shows you that you can't decide what you want for the country, but what the country wants from you. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the reviews that say that everyone is coming wrong, I think they come too idealistic, (the Belgians want a perfect colony, Lumumba wants the perfect unity of Congo, Tshombe wants wealth and wealth, America wants a perfect ally against communism, Russia wants perfect allies) help communism). And Congolese? They come out of use and abuse (the best example in the film when Général Janssens tells his black troops that the government has lied to you and left them all upset) is always drawn and pushed to support that person or other person. This film shows a mistake in politics that can cost you dearly, and this film everyone makes a mistake after mistake until the earth's destruction ends and ends. Their intentions may be good (or at least in the characters' minds), but it is the fault of anyone who leads to the collapse of the Congo. I don't think anyone in this movie is bad, I think they want too many people who are giving and wanting to get started. Overall, it's not just the best political film. great movie in general. Acting is fabulous (Eriq Ebouaney as Lumumba was the perfect casting, I really believe him) scenario flawless, perfect editing and production value higher than I expected in a Central African movie. She has to watch.
