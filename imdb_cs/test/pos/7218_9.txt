This film is a brilliant story about Shakespeare's classic love story, complemented by "eccentric sex, piercing and disintegration". This follows the same spirit as all the other Troma movies [except Combat Shock ... This fool was depressed], but it's not just for Troma fans. Anyone who appreciates the lowbrow visuals and cheerful script will no doubt fall in love with this movie. Don't wait for pretentious, artistically-would-be bullshit like the R&J version with Claire Danes and Leo DiCaprio; this knows his stupid movie and it draws humor from it. Acting is also surprisingly good and you can feel the pain of Sammy Capulet as he tries to put his brain back in his head. The soundtrack, which includes many original and high-energy bands like The Wesley The four-star is also Willis Fiasco, Supernova and The Meatmen. This film should be seen by all because it remains true to the original story while still wrapped with Trom's gore / sex humor mark.
