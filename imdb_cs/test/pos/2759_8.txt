This game is very good for n64. You can skate like Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska and maybe other skaters. The game doesn't have Mika V or Bam Margera. Dang! Anyway, the game is awesome. School Level II is a great level with such skating. In career mode, you collect SKATE, get money, get a high score and other stuff in 2 minutes. There's a skater who's pretty cool. I created a skater named Butt Mulligan, a black man with an afro, and a girl's board. There is a park editor, some super premade parks, free skates, and there is a single session where you skate for 2 minutes and get a score. You can watch records that are always cool. Each skater has 2 styles: A and B. The graphics are not so good. Well, they're good for n64. I wish I had a regulator pack so I could store my data. Overall, this game is amazing. I give him 8/10 for n64. But with the GBA version, it's as fun as the n64 version, but a little hard to control. I give him 7/10 for GBA. So go to a place that still sells n64 games and pick up a copy. PS1 versions are also available.
