Whether you are a fan of a series that inspired him or not, it's not a denying that this is a non-uniform job. But in the best possible sense. Peenton, Dyson, Shearmsith, and Gatiss set off on a different path to get rid of the traps of old sitcoms that made the big screen unpleasant. Inevitably, rehashing some of their favorite characters. It is a pity not only to keep a more consistent film of the League League, because as resourceful as it is in the script, it weakens the finished film. Well worth renting.
