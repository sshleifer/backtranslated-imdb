I read more comments on the IMDB, I had very high expectations before I saw "angels of the universe". I wasn't disappointed, and I give film 8, I guess I can justify that grade. The film has some incredible acting, especially the main person, Pall. Auxiliary actors also work very well as patients in the psychiatric hospital, parents and siblings of Pall. Music is also worth noting, supporting the film throughout, giving depth and feel. Although the film is very Scandinavian, it doesn't miss some humor and has some kind of objective authorship about the life of Pall. But if you want to see a funny comedy or something light, it's not for you. It is a story about people with mental health problems, about the way they are treated in society, but above all about the Pall story. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all film experts. It's one of the best movies ever released from Iceland, if not Scandinavia.
