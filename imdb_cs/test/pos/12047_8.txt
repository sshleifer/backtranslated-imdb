That was Bollywood's response to Fatal Attraction, and that is a classic film in itself. Juhi Chawla was good, so was Sunny Deol, but it was Shah Rukh Khan who shot as a stalker. Since then he has become Chopry's favorite (Dilwale Dulhaniya le Jayenge, Mohhabatein, Dil on pagal hai, Veer Zaara and Chak De India). Shah Rukh initially appears to be a villain, but you will eventually sympathize with him. The scripting was excellent and the songs were graphical. My favorites are Too mere alone and Jaadu teri nazar. After the unfortunate failure of underrated Lamhe Yash Chopra fought with Darr. Dialogues have been unforgettable, the Cianian dialogue is often repeated. Since Darr Yash Chopra has slipped a bit. The Dil to the pagan hai was bad, but he slightly redeemed himself in Veer Zaara, which was much better. This was the last masterpiece of Yash Chopry.
