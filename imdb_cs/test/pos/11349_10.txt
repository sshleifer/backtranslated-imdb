The most attractive factor in this masterpiece of film is not beautiful actors. It is not their excellent acting and hissing chemistry. For me it's the mis-en-scene of the whole movie. Settings, lighting, props ... all contribute to the mood of love among the main characters. Smoke smoke from Chow's cigarette tells us his state of mind, the ever-changing, tight-fitting cheongsams Lizhen reflects the constraints of decision making, the ruins of Angkor Wat associate with the deteriorating relationship of both leaders. /> <br /> The excellent use of mis-en-scene gives the film exactly the right feel it needs to fulfill the complicated character relationship. The film leaves the audience to yearn for more.
