That was really an epic production that had all the elements one would want in a fantasy movie. Costume, music, cinematography - all the artistic elements of this film were absolutely beautiful and provided a wealth of experience. Ted Danson, best known for his television roles in "Cheers" and "becker". was excellent in the role of Gulliver. Mary Steenburgen (Time After Time, Cross Creek) played as well in her limited role as his wife. The next show I really enjoyed was James Fox as Dr. Bates, Alfre Woodard as Queen of Brobdingnag, and Peter O'Toole as Emperor Lilliput. That would make a fun children's movie, but it would definitely appeal to adults to be a deep social commentary.
