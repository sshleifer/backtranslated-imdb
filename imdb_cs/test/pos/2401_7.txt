I watched a movie with tears and laughter. Anger in me went to see the ruins of Hanoi after a 12-day bombing. And now living in the country with parents living in Saigon for 50 years, I understand that we are much better now, and it would be better if the American did not bring war. When I watched the film, I learned more about the different kinds of wars America had planned in Vietnam and about the disasters they caused. The series seems to interfere with real people. But I do not like that some people just give general opinions, just like the analyst at the end of the series, I forgot his name. There should also be more documentary films, such as life in the South Vietnam military camp and camps in the north (if possible). There was also a sudden change from 1972 to 1975 (I'm not sure if there is censorship between them because I watched this series on TV).
