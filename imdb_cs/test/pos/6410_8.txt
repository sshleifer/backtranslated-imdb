The whole world becomes prey to deadly disease and the rain continues to fly: in this atmosphere of nightmare, however, a man and a woman find themselves neighbors, thanks to a hole in the floor of a male apartment. They fall in love: at least they wouldn't be lost. Although this amazing film expresses the loneliness and weakness of a human being, there is also room for hope in shiny singing scenes.
