(Mild Spoilers) Frankie Machine was killed in his life by the wrong hand. A card dealer in an illegal gambling court in his Chicago neighborhood was arrested when a joint attack was raided by police and got six months in jail. While behind the bars, Frankie was treated for his heroin addiction in the prison hospital and learned to play drums as part of his rehabilitation program. Now out of jail and back in his old quarter, Frankie tries to put his life back together by getting a union card in the Music Union and then working as a drummer in the band and putting his old life behind, but instead catching up with Frankie in none the moment at all in "The Man with the Golden Arm". Otto Preminger's surprising movie of 1955 on heroin addiction with Frank Sinatra, who introduced his life as a drug addict, a sharp Frankie Machine, a man with a Golden Arm. Frankie tries to escape from the life she leads, but she has the monkey, or better still, the gorillas on her back that won't let him. Soild introduces the full support cast of Frankie's new friend Sparrow, Arnold Stang. Sparrows are trying to get Frankie to his feet by pulling out his suit for him, and finally slamming him and Frankie back, and almost back to jail, until his former boss at Schwiefka gambling him. There's Frankie's mentally and emotionally mutilated Zosch's wife, Eleanor Parker, who sees her holding on to Frankie's slip and is slowly driven to the madness of murder and suicide. There's a Frankie drug dealer, Louie, with Darren McGavin in one of his first acting roles, who keeps Frankie well if he stays addicted and Louie goes out of the way to make sure he does. There is a gambling proprietor that Frankie is working on as she is the best Schwiefka card dealer, Robert Strauss, who as Louie goes out of the way to get Frankie back to work for him, though, if Frankie is arrested again, hope for a new and better life will go down. And then there's another neighbor, Frankie, and a friend of Molly, Kim Novak, who goes almost impossible to get him over his addiction by locking him in his apartment. It's there that he goes "cold turkey" and almost ends up dying trying to dig a habit in one of the most agonizing sequences ever put on film. And not holding a wasted movie with the explosive performances of all involved makes a "man with a golden arm" one of the great classics of realism in movies coming out of the 1950s.
