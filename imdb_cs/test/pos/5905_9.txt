Don't be fooled by the nostalgic aura that surrounds "Mon oncle Antoine" because darkness lurks just below the surface as the best Canadian movie. The story, probably set in the 1940s in rural Quebec, explores young Benoit's unfolding awareness of how to deal with sexuality and death. The film's appearance is overwhelming, especially seen as a high proportion of criticism among Canadian cinema by the general public surrounding aesthetics. In addition, the unobtrusive Benoit is a seductive protagonist for the audience and looks at his spoiled community with fresh innocent eyes. I recommend reading a critical essay by Jim Leach about a film in Canada's best feature for anyone who wants to put the film in a historical context and break down the film. Be sure to check it out.
