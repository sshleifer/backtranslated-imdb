I like Dylan Moran from his work in Black Books, although I found that some of his stand-ups are indeed indulgent in terms of long confused gaps ... but I was interested in seeing this movie starring Michael Caine and the curiosity . Better of me. <br /> <br /> I was impressed. Dylan's vocal character and the characteristics of the different people who played in the film were absolutely perfect, something beyond the mere stand-up comedian and really really on par with alec guinness, john hurts and other greats - indeed he was skillful in his depiction. Michael Caine was a very convincing prima donna and a standard British film device to have a premature baby on hand to be too wise and withered working - the only aspect I really didn't like was the incredible chemistry plot between Dolores and the hard man of rooster gangsta who played Dylan. Otherwise it was great. I also like the endless ending where it ended happily to the end, but with MC getting beaten. OK, it's not exactly how it would happen to your goolies and beijng disembowelled (which is what a real crime chief would do to you if you dropped them $ 50), but it showed at least a small degree of reality in the story. /> <br /> I liked the movie and would recommend it to anyone - but I would also warn them not to turn it off after 15 minutes because it started a little slower. If you do, then it will all come back. And as for the oath - well, they are in Ireland. It wouldn't be otherwise.
