This film is masterfully directed by Clive Barker, he really knows how to establish a relationship between the audience and the characters. I think there is no sequel to this film, Barker should devote himself to continuing this film instead of making a boring Lord illusion, which in my opinion is real waste. But I also think that because of this and the lack of continuation of NBreed, it has become a dark cult classic of horror movies.
