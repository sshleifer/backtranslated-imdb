I turned to this movie in the middle of the night and almost skipped it. It was just because I decided to follow him. Finally, I thought it was great. An interesting story, good characters, clever script and brilliant direction makes this movie a great movie to sit down and watch. That was actually the first thing I heard about this movie, but I'd like to pay the money to see it at the cinema. <br /> <br /> My IMDB Rating: 8 of 10 <br /> <br />
