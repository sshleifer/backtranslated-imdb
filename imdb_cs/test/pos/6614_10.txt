I remember when skateboarding was born in the 1970s. I asked my parents for money to help me with my friend's second skateboard. It was a piece of junk, full of clay wheels and everything. I also remember that I read Skateboarder Magazine and that I was absolutely overwhelmed and utterly frightened by the Dogtown crew. Skating has never been a way of life for me, but in some ways it has always been a part of my life, be it a board for transport or just a few friends who skate. <br /> <br /> This film is a brilliant documentary of the true birth of modern skating. As I watched this crew reflect from a flat boring hobby, it's a vertical lifestyle. It's amazing that there are plenty of shots from this period that created this movie, and thank God for it. The shots are brilliant. It made me feel like I was watching an old movie, Buster Keaton: I've seen some tricks Keaton has repeatedly repeated in other movies since then, but when you go back and see the first person to do this trick, it's amazing that Not only were they the first person who tried it successfully, but that they lived through it and seemed effortless. That's the feeling the movie gave me. Yeah, I've seen people skate pools, but watching the FIRST people skating pools and inventing the tricks that eventually became the basics of modern skating is like watching the facade of a fall house at Keaton so it stands securely in the window frame. It is absolutely amazing to watch something that has never been tried before, but it has been tried by almost everyone. This movie is beautiful to watch and incredible listening. Soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard in the movie. It is a movie that appeals to people whether they like skating or not. I talked to a few of my friends who made their girlfriends sit in this movie after a tough protest, and everyone said their girlfriends were mesmerized by the end of the movie and loved it just like them. As for the previous comments on this council, which complain that the film is too congratulating, I think it is an unfair dishonor. I liked that these guys are excited about their past. They created something that influenced their sport and changed forever. They have the right to lean on their backs. They were stars for what they were doing. Most of these guys / girls never achieved astonishing Tony Hawk's success today, but this kind of success was not available to skaters then. Sure, they had some success, but more importantly, they were able to live life by what they love, and as we see in the end, almost all of them still surf, skate or work in the surfing / skating industry. How many of us can say that we have been able to live our lives and have been successful by breaking all the rules and doing what we love? They can. My hat is gone to Dogtown and Z-Boys for being alone and changing the world of skateboarding forever.
