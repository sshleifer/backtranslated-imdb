I saw this amazing documentary at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival. It is extremely absorbable and very well processed, drawing you into the life and career of Harry Nilsson, one of the most overlooked musical talents of the 1960s and 1970s. Although I was familiar with his better known songs "One is the Loneliest Number", I learned about the brilliant writing and beautiful singing of this man. If you like music, you'll find plenty to drag you into your world, which unfortunately went out of control when its success grew and its past haunted it. However, sad, yet completely devoted to his family, you will be so glad that you met this man. The profile is narrated through Nilsson's own words and the words of his friends and colleagues (the virtual who is the Rock) who loves and respects him. Don't miss it!
