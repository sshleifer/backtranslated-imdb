Boxing is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. To explain my experience, let me use this picture: Imagine you were blinking on pixie sticks for the last month and painting fumes without watching anything but repeating the Twilight Zone. The resulting coma will unload you in the hospital, where the nurse seems to kick out of the adrenaline shoot to IV. The dream you have while in a coma something like this movie. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: A man appears at the door of a couple. Giving them a box with a button. Press the button, get a million dollars in cash and the person they don't know will die. I will try not to spoil anything, but from there things turn into a convoluted and complex and purely original character that will challenge you. But hey, most of us have been healthy for a while and the change is good. PROS: Amazing story, overall a good performance, not a slow moment when it gets. He asks questions of human morality, which are seldom when asked in popular culture. This film is profound, meaningful. It's not a summer blockbuster special effects fluff (not that it's something wrong with it); this movie had a relatively low budget and showed up in some places. But I think it's maybe the thing that I like so much. CONS: The first twenty minutes before it gets really slow. At the end of the movie you'll be so confused that you just have to sit down and think about a good half hour. I can guarantee that this film does not get enthusiastic reviews from your peers or most critics; It's too strange and there are no explosions every three seconds. In fact, there are no explosives in this movie (except that your brain is trying to understand exactly what the hell happened). Personally, I don't think it's a bad thing, but it will be a lot. <br /> <br /> RATING: Easy 9/10. I've never had any experience like watching this movie. The only reason I can't give it to 10/10 is that it's just too wrapped up in itself. There are a few great things that remain unexplained at the end that still annoy me when I sit here and write it down. But overall, this is the best experience I've had in a movie theater for quite a while. But be warned, you won't like this movie if you can't sit down, turn on suspending suspicion at about 150% and prepare your brain to do some impressive acrobatics. <br /> <br /> Visit www. thestuffblag.com for more reviews
