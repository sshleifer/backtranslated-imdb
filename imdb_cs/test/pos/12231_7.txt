Most Christmas movies have a theme of "redemption," but most of them are variations on a very similar plot. This movie is crazy and has an unusual plot. You may have to hang up there for the first half, where events may seem hard to believe for a movie (but not as incredible as real life - Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, says he never created anything in any of his cartoons - all based on real life stories told by his fans). The other half begins to fit into the conspiracy. I enjoyed it. BTW, one reviewer noted that the idea of ​​someone who does not have cash is not trusted on these ATMs, but it is totally trustworthy if you have lost your wallet - which bears ATM cards anywhere else on business trip?
