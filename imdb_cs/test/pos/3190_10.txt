I came across this film in an Australian hotel room at 3 am. My brother and I were on the canals and who we see, but young Russel Crowe. But not the phone throwing Russel Crowe we learned and quasi-love back in the states. This movie, much to my surprise, was amazingly creative and cheerful. It's a cast of embarrassing teens with funny stories of strange sexual experiences, including a neat shop assistant, prostitutes and an unusual sexy mother. If you're lucky enough to come across this movie, I'd strongly pick it up. I must say that this film was incredibly fun and I thank the gentle people of Australia who did it ...
