I only gave it nine stars instead of ten because I don't approve of too much pornography. pornography has a useful purpose in society (it can't say I can always think of one), but it probably does. I didn't buy this movie because it was pornography, I bought it because I'm one of those 'Alice' obsessions who will watch anything about 'Alice in Wonderland'. I only own about every version of it on DVD, so it was an obvious choice to finish my DVD collection with this one. I have to admit that I was scandalized for my expectations and the whole thing would be thoroughly offensive if it weren't so damn funny. Besides, music is really good and I like musicals. <br /> <br /> Not everyone can make a good musical on the nude. Anyone who has seen 'The First Nudie Musical' knows what a smelly bomb it was. Given the low budget Bill Osco has worked with, 'Alice' is remarkable as a musical (it's better than some musicals made on expensive budgets). The movie can't completely escape the dirt of porn. I usually watch XXX for a full shock effect, and some of these scenes are scandalizing (scandalizing because we're talking about Lewis Carroll). I felt very uncomfortable and embarrassed during the scene when 'Alice' (Kristine DeBell) began to masturbate. I felt like a voyeur. and the gratuitous lesbian scenes with "Alice" and cat cats were too dizzy. However, the film has a great sense of humor about everything. There is one particularly funny moment during the Queen's orgy when one of the actresses gets up and says, "Who am I on F --- K to get out of this movie?". Cheerful. I'm not sure if I buy all the sex is good for you ball your brains out of philosophy here, but sex is human, and nothing human disgust me. I really feel like this, but I couldn't resist saying that some people think everything should be about sex. I don't know. Jeez, just show some frick'in responsibility and decorum. This movie definitely scores for sex-minded, but I don't want to push your luck, next time someone could really get angry. I mean, it's a children's literature.
