The creative team that brought us the police unit - and the Naked Gun derived from it - said in an interview that their network contact told them that the show would be canceled after their first episode was released. Basically, the show never got any chance. Typical Hollywood. The contact apparently told the team that the problem with the show was that in order to make the show fun, the viewer would actually have to watch it; most shows are presented on television, with the viewer needing to get up and miss a few minutes when they get food, or go to the restroom, etc. He doesn't use any laughing tracks and the universe that inhabits the characters is one in which anything, regardless of logic, if it was absolutely incredible; So, for example, in one episode, a surgeon must bribe an informant on the street to get a tip for heart surgery. Those who are familiar with the Naked Gun movies should be advised that there is a number of interesting disjunctions between the show and the movies. In the film, Nielsen developed a special "take" approach - that is, the eyes widened when confronted with an unexpected. This will not happen in a show where Nielsen's Drebin is the center around which the rest of the universe is rotating - nothing unexpected for him. Also, there are no romances in the show, and no parodies of MTV. Eventually, the show presents some of the risks that movies are avoiding; In the first episode, Drebin, to "re-enact a crime", has a group of detectives killing to shoot each other from a number of different angles - a ballistics hard way. It's actually a risky humor because we have to accept that it is perfectly normal for police officers to kill each other when investigating a crime for reasons other than experimentation. Such things rarely happen in movies. <br /> <br /> In fact, each episode is more funny than any of the Naked Gun movies because they're both more compact (more in less time). -frame), but an even quieter pace (it's not a rush to punch-line, as sometimes happens in movies). There are some inconsistencies that happen in movies (primarily "2" and "3") that never occur in a shorter time frame of the show. Of course there is no doubt that Naked Gun is one of the great theatrical comedies. And if you watch an episode of a TV show after an episode in one session, the dry quality of humor can take away tolerance. Still, it would be helpful to have a DVD of this movie and watch an episode daily for several weeks - If the laughter seems to be a healing value, watching this show is good for human health.
