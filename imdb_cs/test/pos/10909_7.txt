I remember seeing it a long time ago, and I knew it was the most, but no detail, so I'm glad I watched it again, from director Frank Oz (Muppets Take Manhattan, Bowfinger). Basically the new star Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) has just won an Oscar for his last, where he plays a gay soldier, and he makes the usual "thank you", even mentions his past English teacher Howard Brackett (Golden Globe nominated) Kevin Kline , and he's like him! Howard is determined to clear his name and get out of the spotlight as a denial homosexual, especially since his marriage to Emily Montgomery (Oscar and Joan Cusack nominated Golden Globe) is on its way. So it comes to the wedding day, and when it comes to Howard to say yes or no, it is when he finds himself, and confesses to himself and everyone that he is gay. This of course gets him as a teacher, but everyone stands on graduation day to get themselves (to support), and Cameron even shows to make things, so everyone, especially school director Tom Halliwell (Elf Bob Newhart) knows it's okay be gay. Also starring Tom Selleck as Peter Malloy, Debbie Reynolds as Berniece Brackett, Wilford Brimley as Frank Brackett, Gregory Jbara as Walter Brackett, Glenn Close, Whoopi Goldberg and Jay Leno. The highlight of the film must be when Kline can't help dancing to Diana Ross's "I Will Survive" version, which had to convince him of his sexuality. Kline is always good, Cusack is an Oscar-nominated surprise and all supportive members are also acting in this very funny comedy. Very good!
