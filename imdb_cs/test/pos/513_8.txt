If you like horror or action watch this ASAP movie. If the opening scene doesn't get your adrenaline pumping, then someone should check your pulse. Great action, excellent casting and top inserts. This is the only movie I saw in the cinema where the crowd applauded each chop and kicked. Not perfection, but who cares when movies can be so fun. It's a pure rush of dark comic action. 9/10
