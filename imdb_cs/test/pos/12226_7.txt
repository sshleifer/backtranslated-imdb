This is one of the better sci-fi series. Includes character development, a couple of thrilling moments and sensible episodes. As one other commentator said here, it looked like it was a mini series, not a whole series with episodes of fill and low budgets. The problem with the show, which is simply Godzilla's series, is that it started too big, with incredible monsters, fantastic science, then it all brewed on local Americans doing things. The show ended too early because the Olympics came and hey! The sci-fi show is a sci-fi show, but half the naked athletic people run aimlessly more important. Instead, they expected only 15 episodes. The audience was also small because people didn't really catch it at 20:00. Eventually it succeeded. Trust the marketing plan to destroy anything that looks remotely and promisingly. Conclusion: you have a show with good special effects, things like huge monsters, killing people or destroying ships, then going into genetic engineering, transforming people, human clones, end of the world, tsunami. The only fillings are scenes with aggressive stones or other annoying people who are killed for their stupidity. The down-side is that after 15 episodes that prepare something huge, the show ends. No real end, no closure, just a bitter taste of substance in your mouth, as if you just swallowed a piece of suit.
