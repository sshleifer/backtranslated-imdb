A couple of cowpokes will help the group of Mormons through some rugged land on their way to a new deal. This low-key Western is unusual for Ford in that it lacks any big stars. Johnson gets top-billing, but he's basically a supportive role, though he and Carey work well together. Dru has little to provide love. The best performance is given by the popular Ford Bond, who plays the leader of the Mormon. In fact, this role helped him play a major role in the long-run TV Western "Train Car" before his untimely death at the age of 57. Featuring beautiful cinematography, Ford considered this one of his favorite films.
