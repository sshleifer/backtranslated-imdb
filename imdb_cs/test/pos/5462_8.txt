Okay, so maybe getting married to Jay Leno and David Letterman is out of place, but you still feel who these people are and how they work behind the screen. Bob Balaban and Treat Williams are excellent as Warren Littlefield and Micheal Ovitz. <br /> <br /> It's not a joke and a punchline, but it's still funny. Especially Kathy Bates is amazing as Leno's manager. <br /> <br /> Funny, amazing, interesting, very attentive, that's a good TV movie.
