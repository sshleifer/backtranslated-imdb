Although I am very familiar with the poet Dylan Thomas, I do not know anything about his life. Whatever his life, and specifically his marriage, I'd imagine that Edge of Love manipulates things a little, but if you're not a historian or a poet who cares. The film is about Thomas less and more focused on the two most important women in his life. One of them is his wife Kathrine and the other one is Vera, who was his first love. One romantic evening on the beach as a youth is something they both tried to give them, but they can't, they've grown up, they're good friends. I forgot to mention that it happened during the war. Vera becomes a committed captain, Will Killing, who gets her pregnant and goes to war. While he is gone, Vera begins to fall back on Thomas and Kathrine fell out of love with him. He also carries another man's baby. Things become even more emotionally complicated when Captain Killig returns <br /> <br /> As you can see, it is a very soap opera plot that takes the form of a slow, fabulous, drab, slow process, with one too many smiling dialogue sequences. But everything is not lost yet. For a non-Hollywood production, I think Edge of Love is about a stylish picture that can be obtained. It is certainly more dimensional and intelligent than about 90% of contemporary novels, Hollywood production or not. Some of them have to do with being built during a war that creates an emotional conflict that is more convincing and less artificial, a bit like reconciliation. this represents playing and cinematography of the same talent as an Oscar candidate Joe Wright, but in a much greater need for stable stimulation and progression. Things are fine at the beginning and the end, but the middle part is where your attention span can be tested unless you are deeply and deeply rooted in the story. I doubt that Edge of Love will have such an impact on the viewer, but it's a good movie to check. It might even make a good day night movie, given that it is much smarter than a cat waving that lovers are forced to endure today.
