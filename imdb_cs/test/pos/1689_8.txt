The film was certainly true to the real life story on which it was based. It was hard for me to find news articles about real facts, but when I found them, I saw that the truth in this case was strange than fiction. Judith Light was horribly evil in her mother's role in this film, so much that it was hard to separate it from the role, a brand I think of excellent performance. Rick Schroder was appropriately clueless as her son, who also defended her in court, which is an example of how difficult a child may be in certain circumstances to take on parents' actions, no matter how criminal they may be. One can find a mistake with the film, but not with his reality cure on which it was based.
