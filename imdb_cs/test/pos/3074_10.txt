I don't think I've ever seen a better film parody. Mel Brooks is crazy. Every time I look at it finds something new and makes it even more fun than ever before. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a great and unexpected end that lets you crack. Each character is great from little John and will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed all the way and never tired of it. Watch it !! <br /> <br /> If you like Cary Elwes in this movie, you must definitely see The Princess Bride.
