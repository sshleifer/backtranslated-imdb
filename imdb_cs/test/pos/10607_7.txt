If you've ever seen a Bollywood movie, you know it's longer than most movies because of more songs and dance routines (each of them is more than five minutes long). Fortunately, this has less song and dance techniques and fits into the "standard" length of the film. Don't get me wrong, I like Bollywood movies, but they tend to fast forward through the song and dance parts. I bought this DVD because I'm a fan of Ian Bohen. Although his role was not as big as I hoped, he still had a good time on the screen. And his character was much different from his other roles. Overall, it was a good movie. Like most Bollywood movies, there is at least one element of dispute / conflict of traditional Indian culture. But true love triumphs over adversity and everyone has a happy ending.
