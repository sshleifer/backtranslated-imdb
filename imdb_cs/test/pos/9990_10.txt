My God, what a story! This movie is very good and it had to be God who did it! You did a great job. This movie is so good that I'm really glad you did it, because if you didn't, I'd never know about this story because I'm not a big fan of golf and I think it's kind of boring, so thank you. I really liked it and that's why I gave the film 10 years and I also liked Shia Labouf, which was ideal for the roles of Fransis Quimet. I hope most of the things you put there were also true. And some parts were funny and others were really happy.
