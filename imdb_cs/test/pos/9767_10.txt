I remember watching this series attentively and being so disappointed when it ended. Over the years, I've been trying to find out if I could get a copy on video or d.v.d., to no avail. However, I was pleased to find this detail page just to be disappointed at the time of purchase that the available videos would not play on English recorders! This production was so amazing that it is absolutely accurate with Nevil Shute's novel, the story went through after the war, with the subsequent life of Joe and Jean - absolutely amazing - and I wish I could see it again because it was the original screening , it doesn't repeat on British television.
