Now there's a movie that does something that hasn't been done in a long time. It takes ten or so different elements that we are already familiar with (vampires, martial arts, techno beat, top-of-the-line special effects, etc.), and turns it into something that feels completely new. What could easily be a combination of "Mortal Kombat" and "Buffy: Vampire Slayer," Wesley Snipes (no favorite of mine because and mostly because of "passenger 57") gives a really good half-human turn It recognizes internal conflict, but it does not take more than it is necessary. He makes Blade as a deep character like Michael Keaton did Batman. I will say that the only part of the movie that made me a little miffed was always the present horror movie clich√© that one person that the hero happens to know who knows exactly how to stop the evil guy. On the other hand, you must have it in a movie like this, so it's easy to excuse. Well, Snipes is good. And Steven Dorff, praised in the previews, makes Snipes' hero more than a bad guy. He has a class, presence, and enough control in his little pinky to teach Al Pacino how to mute it a little. Who would ever think a comic film would be a stepping stone for actors? I sincerely hope it is. And who! Where the hell did Kris Kristofferson get an acting talent? Don't get me wrong, but a prolific actor has done nothing unforgettable since the "millennium" and how many of us have watched that make it a cool video box? Well, here it is, people in a very skillful turn, like Blade's mentor and father. And good work. <br /> <br /> The quality of acting is linked to the quality of choreography and special effects. Accompanied by the pulsating techno beat, the battle scenes get back and quickly expel memories of Mortal Kombat. Hi! She also had a script! I wonder what happened to all the good writers out there. The two main indications for me that I saw a quality movie were these; I had no sense of remorse that I paid the full price to get in, some Schumacher "Batman", "The Avengers", "MK: Annihilation", "Godzilla" or "Armageddon". (wow, how many of them came out this year? Ugh) I'm also looking forward to the inevitable sequel as at the end of the movie. Hopefully they will work with her as well as with the first. <br /> <br />
