I really enjoyed watching it. And both times I left thinking about it, and the "story morale" a lot. I agree with another reviewer that the film is not focused on the sci-fi aspects you might expect from a movie on Earth, but rather on the human state. Characters in a psychiatric hospital provide a great insight into how they go from hopelessness to hope. This film touches sadness to humor to sympathy for the ultimate "is he or not". This last question has been well mastered, and while some may argue that you don't know what will happen at the end and the question is unanswered, I feel that this is happening in more detail than something that is the case when it is called, Ronin ( with Robert De Niro) where you will never find out what's in the box and that makes you feel very frustrated. I highly recommend K-PAX. 8/10
