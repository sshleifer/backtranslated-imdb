Almost four years after the start of the Iraq war, we are in a bigger hole than ever. That's right, so all those flag flags that were so confident of the right and power of the American way are now chasing their tails, isn't that true? You bet you did. This movie said it from the beginning. It's kind of weird how much film or I have to say to filmmakers, knowing what's going on. It's almost like going to a seer and hearing what happens in the future. When I told GW that "major combat operations had ended" at the top of a visual broken RV that had been pulled away with American flag waving in the back, it was the point where I felt the hairs stand on the back of the neck. You have to see to understand what I mean, but even if you are apolitical, or even if you are pro-war, this film will have an impact on you because it is so rooted in history.
