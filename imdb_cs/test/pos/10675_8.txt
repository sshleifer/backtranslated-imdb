"Doppleganger" (or "Journey to the Other Side of the Sun" as is more commonly known) was written (with the late Donald James) and made by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, best known for their television Supermarionation shows like "Thunderbirds". The Eurosec International Space Agency finds out the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the Sun and proposes to send a crew flight there. The Committee avoids exhorbitant costs and eliminates the project. But when a security leak occurs in the agency, fearing that the Russians might get there, the project will get green. American astronaut Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) is affiliated with British scientist John Kane. (Ian Hendry). After weeks of exhausting training, Phoenix sets off and heads for the unknown. Three weeks later their ship crashes in a gloomy mountain landscape. Ross survives, but Kane is badly injured. The light is seen moving toward them ... <br /> <br /> Leaving the report here. In the meantime, the film was grasping, with excellent special effects (Derek Meddings) and music by Anderson's resident songwriter Barry Gray (why it wasn't published on C.D.'s Secret). But when Ross and Kane land on the ground and discover the mystery of a foreign world - it's a duplicate of our own, everyone is the same, the only fundamental difference is that things are turned around - becoming less interesting and ending with a broken anti-climax. I think the cinema was the wrong place I did it, in fact Gerry & Sylvia later something similar on my 'Space: 1999' show. Ross risks (and ultimately loses) his life in trying to return to Earth - his Earth. But why? The new Earth is so similar that it could not even bother. Roy Thinnes recently made a television series "Invaders" and gives a competent performance (a pity that there were no more scenes like this one with his wife). Ian Hendry is good as 'Kane', but the story goes too soon. Several actors appeared in Anderson's 'U.F.O.' like Ed Bishop and George Sewell. Blink and you'll miss Nicholas Courtney ('Brigadier' ​​from 'Dr.Who' in a small role). But the honors go to late Patrick Wymark as 'Jason Webb', leading Eurosec. The character is not far from 'Sir John Wilder', the one who starred in 'The Power Game' A.T.V. Webb is so sinister that it's amazing to watch. Herbert Loma's contribution (as a spy with a camera hidden in a false eye) makes a little more than a portrait. <br /> <br /> As I said, special effects are amazing as well as sets. So the film is worth watching, but don't expect it to happen when the action moves to the mirror planet. With a stronger scenario, it was another planet of apes or I was saying it - "2001: Space Odyssey". <br /> <br /> In Anderson's productions, it seems that the future looks like a great place, the adventure playground where science was fine, everyone had swank cars whose doors opened vertically, sexy women, and absolutely no suggestion that something is really wrong with the world. We are now in the future and people are still watching "Coronation Street" every other night. How disappointing. If there is a mirror Earth somewhere, we hope this is a better place than this. If all women look like Lynn Loring or Loni von Friedl, I'll be on the next flight!
