I watched this episode many times because I didn't get Prue died. That's what happened. Prue, Piper and Phoebe are trying to save their innocent, doctor, because he wants to kill him. Phoebe goes upstairs and looks into the Book of Shadows while Prue and Piper protect their innocent. Shax appears while Phoebe is still upstairs, so Shax throws an energy ball at the doctor, but Prue pulls him out of the way and Prue hits his chest and breaks the wall, just like Piper. So Phoebe comes down and says spell because it was just Phoebe who said it and not a lot of three Shaxes were hurt. Phoebes calls Leo to heal Piper and Prue. Leo is healing them. Phoebe went to the underworld to find Cole while Prue and Piper were looking for Shax on the streets. Piper and Prue see Shax and Piper use her power to blow up Shax, meanwhile New Reporter got everything on tape. So it's all new about the three mighty sisters of Halliwell, yet Phoebe knows nothing, because she's still in the underworld. There are Reporters and people all over Halliwell House. Then a maniac comes in and says, "Can I be a part of your Coven?" and Prue says, "Not here is our house out of here!" and Prue uses her powers to fire her. As the maniac came out of the house, he shouted and said, "There are middle witches". Maniac is so insane that he shoots Piper directly with his stomach. Prue gets in the car and the tray to go to the hospital, but people don't let her go so Prue uses her powers to move people out of the way so people want to kill her more. They got to the hospital, but Piper didn't. Meanwhile, Phoebe in Underworld.Phoebe finds out that they were exposed, so Phoebe asks Cole to ask the source if he can reverse the time. said Phoebe what the source told him. Phoebe says, "What would make him do something like that?" and then Cole says, "So you can save one of your sisters." Leo goes to the hospital to find out that Piper is really dead, so he tells Phoebe it's true. Then Phoebe agrees to stay only if Cole returns to warn Piper and Prue of Piper's exposure and death. At the hospital, SWAT is filming Prue, but the second before they make time is rewound back when they were at the estate with the doctor, but this time Phoebe didn't say Leo to heal Prue and Piper, so the doctor got thrown into the wall too. The doctor died, as did Prue. But that's what I didn't get when Piper tossed on the wall, how come only Prue died? Why didn't they show that Leo came and treated Piper and Leo trying to heal Prue? If you know the answer, send me an email at angelpuss924@yahoo.com PS. I miss Prue, but I also like Paige and I'm glad the show went on
