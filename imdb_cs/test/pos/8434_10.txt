I wish Hollywood would do more movies like The China Syndrome. Because this is on every level. <br /> <br /> Has an intelligent, believable script. It shows you that it is not just nuclear energy itself, but the money involved in it that causes danger. And the movie also gives you a great look at how television is made. It's like a thriller: when I first saw it, it held me right on the edge of my seat. And it's like a character-movie: I really took care of the main characters. Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas, Wilford Brimley and especially Jack Lemmon are great.
