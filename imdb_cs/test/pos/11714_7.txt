"Sharky's Machine" is clearly a Burt Reynolds vehicle that is supposed to allow stellar space to erect its talents, and he sprays paint on the machine, film fence, other film colors, and other styles, and offers a variety of moods in a live story. Made in 1981 in 119 minutes (a lengthy period), the film succeeded, with grosses cashier at $ 37,800,000. It had a lot for him: actor and director Burt Reynolds, one strong double; a novel adaptation of William Works and the southern land of Atlanta Georgia, at this time the country's opportunity for film production from Hollywood. Reynolds' Tom Sharky fell in love with Ward's Gulls Dominoe hooker -sa-heart-of-gold here is an echo as it was in "Hustle" when playing opposite Catherine Deneuve, and that the film also had a spoiled politician at his core, but with an optimistic ending not of Hollywood happiness in "Sharky's" Machine ". The story is a purely detective procedure. innocent passers-by, and gets humiliated, literally brought down to vices to deal with perverse people and other misdemeanors that "persistent" cops consider to be a latrine duty, and his new digs offer him the opportunity to meet many equally flourishing officers, who do dirty work that no one else wants. When some attention is focused on a certain pimp, Sharky looks at some evidence and finds it is the bottom of a particular prostitute Dominoe (Rachel Ward) - Dominoe is protected by police forces and political forces, and Sharky prepares a 24-hour surveillance force to look at her. While he watches, he learns that the current governor, elected Hotchkins (Earl Holliman), is visiting Dominoe, as is the slippery Italian gangster Victor (Vittorio Gassman). Before the police can build a case with evidence, Billy, Victor's brother, the dick-snuff shooter (Henry Silva) shoots the door of a Dominoe apartment that seemingly kills the beautiful Dominoe, but when Sharky finds out that the murdered victim was actually a roommate. Tiffany (Aarika Wells) Sharky faces Victor and tells him he wants to arrest him. Sharky is captured by some ninja killers leading Smiley (Darryl Hickman) and tortured for information to lead to Dominoe, but Sharky overcomes them and arrests the governor and kills Billy after killing Victor in a heated chase. Reynolds wants to show the inner workings of stiff cops in love, but the noir-inspired police story and Reynolds' ability in cinematographic development tend to dodge relationship dynamics. We came to learn something about some people and that leads us to why they are working on their retirement pensions instead of fighting real crime - this element of the film appears below the surface of Reynolds' extraterrestrial direction. and performance. Reynolds' film is always unique. He likes to hire stars, be it actors or other characters, and then let them improvise, sometimes with different results. With his crew in "Sharky's Machine" he gets some fine moments and sometimes some overcrowded grandstanding but always a sense of ensemble and kindness. Reynolds as the author works. Reynolds, the actor / author always seems to have smirked at himself and the viewer, as if to say it's all fake, but good fun. Great Line: In the Victor scene when Sharky throws a glove "You're all around people like you have," and you want to know the worst part? This seems to be the biggest insult an officer can throw at a criminal. Reynolds made the film in Atlanta in his career point shot himself by reading the phone book and would certainly be targeted and demographic. The film marked the appearance of Rachel Ward, who was nominated in 1981 as the New Star of the Year by the Golden Globe. Reynolds always had the presence and power of the star and chose to make movies near home, Georgia. <br /> <br /> I have a DVD from half.com for $ 7.99 and unfortunately it doesn't contain any comments or feature creation, which is a shame. Maybe the next generation will have them. The movie is still a lot of fun and Reynolds and Ward are great actors at their best.
