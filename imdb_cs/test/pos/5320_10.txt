Leland follows the story of Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling), a disgruntled teenager who apparently murdered a severely retarded peer, the girl's brother. The question is not whether he did it or not? Leland admits it now? but rather why. Interestingly, rather than a dramatic drama, Leland becomes a character story, exploring why people do what they do? not necessarily the simplest soil to. And Leland offers the desired indie group of screwed people. In addition to the title title, there is also Pearl (Don Cheadle), who is his teacher in a teenage correctional facility and who sees straight that Leland is different. We meet Leland's distant and egotistical father (Kevin Spacey in an extended portrait) who never feels emotionally in any way what his son did. But the real flavors come when we dive into Pollard, a retarded child's family. First, it's Leland's girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone), a junkie who can't keep herself clean; her sister Julie (Michelle Williams), perhaps the most normal person in the film, who just tries to get away from it all; and Allen Harris (Chris Klein), a young man who lives with Pollards and is Julie's friend. Finally, there is Ryan (Michael Welch), whom everyone else calls goofball, who can't communicate and seems to be barely aware of his surroundings. Leland focuses primarily on his main protagonist, but the film is slow? sometimes too slow? plunges into the life of each of us, asks the main question, why do people do what they do? While Leland is openly discussing him in Pearl magazine, which allows him to keep up, explore ideas about good and bad and personal responsibility, all the characters face the moment at which they have to make the basic choice of their own happiness or another, perhaps the most basic choice they can make. man do. And the film looks at what is going on with these choices and their consequences. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, you're just hit by the depth of cast. Spacey. Cheadle. House. Michelle Williams. Even Chris Klein ??? These are people who for the most part tend to elevate any film they are in and put them together for a heady drink. For the space in the middle, the film seems to stop as it unfolds; it looks like a moment, as if it were only content to ask questions and not provide any answers. But when we get to the home section and the film starts to step and meet, Leland becomes a silent powerful film work. Leland's explanation of the world and his actions, in the end, bring every story to focus, and all the investments you made in the film are worth it. He says Ryan Gosling is excellent, he is like saying a sunny day is nice. Is it pointless at this point in your career? this is one of the most beautiful young actors working today, and it is a pleasure to watch his craft, which could be an inexorable character in the thought-provoking protagonist. Here, Gosling uses such subtlety that it hardly looks like playing; he has to face most of the film opposite Don Cheadl, whom we know he has goods, and not only he owns, but also Cheadle's. Cheadle herself is in a top form that fills the pearl with a fully rounded humanity? for good and bad. Spacey is a kind of one note, but it is a character and can handle it great. I was surprised by Chris Klein; With this level of acting, I thought he would be buried in the mix, but so far he will probably turn his career. Amazing work all around. Leland is a bit descending, and again it's a lift on site. However, it ends strongly and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer (in this case as well). There is also a subtle commentary on racism in the film (in Leland's first day in the juvenile classroom, he is the only white person in the room) who, like most of the film, is very efficiently processed. Wouldn't I go so far as to call this mandatory tracking? some might consider it too slow or too special? but I thought it was one of the best movies I've seen in a while, much stronger and more satisfying than most out there. Would I recommend it? with the above reservations? If for another reason than watch Gosling further refine his craft.
