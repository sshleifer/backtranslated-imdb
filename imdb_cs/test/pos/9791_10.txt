This is my favorite movie. Nothing special. It's so incredibly detailed. She makes me cry just thinking about it. Geronimo Bill is the most beautiful guy I can imagine. Money is not important. Bamboo spears are important. You don't need money to get what you need. If you need something that comes to you. If people realized that the world would be much better. Whatever you do, don't do it for money.
