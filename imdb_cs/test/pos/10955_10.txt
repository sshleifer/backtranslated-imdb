Improvisation was used to pioneer the stage in this film, but it only works as a novelty. No greater truth about the situation appeared by asking actors to improvise. The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much worry: not only whether they deliver the line well, but whether the line itself is good. That is why the performances in many Robert Altman films are often truly honest - because the actors are not really confident and say the lines they have created and are therefore unsure whether they are good. And quite frankly, it's often not very good. Often the dialogue does not go from one line to another, or it fits into the surroundings. It bursts with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but I honestly found it hard to watch and focus on meanders so badly. However, a fascinating raw piece of film and a commendable 100% for taking power over green light on the street. There are some generally great things in it. This joke, for example: I'm a dancer. What a dancer, like a dancer? Oh no ... exotic. And the whole scene is in it, the next trip to the park and the scene where the boys look at the statues. However, I wouldn't say they have 2 hours of their time.
