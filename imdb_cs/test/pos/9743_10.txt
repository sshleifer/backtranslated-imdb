As mentioned in one of my great reviews, universal 'FLASH GORDON' images should not be classified with other series. In fact, these three made a kind of cellulosic electronic mythology for the tense, phobic center of the twentieth century. They become lonely in the minds of many nations because of the example of what was a reef curtain. It can be remembered that Buster Crabbhe is a guest at the late NBC night show in TOMORROW hosted by Tom Snyder. This was circa 1979-80. During the interview Mr. Crabbe was asked about his personal fitness habits. He credited strength training and swimming, coupled with some healthy eating habits-which included vitamin and protein supplementation (and you would believe it, he smoked several cigarettes!) When asked about his career, Mr. Of course, Snyder came to the subject of his (and strong) identification of Flash. Buster said he read and enjoyed the feature in his original medium, that is the comic book character of the ownership of Hearst's King Syndicate features. He said he thought it wouldn't work once he was transferred to the screen! Fortunately, he was wrong. <br /> <br /> It was a very good adaptation to the original continuity of the Sunday Color Comics for the first show. The world is coming to an end due to a looming collision with Planet Mongo. It is on the independent Dr. Dr. Zarkov to change the direction of the rocket into a wild planet. Helps Flash and Miss Dale Arden, the newly-known airliner skydivers landing in Zarkov's property. Serial is excited out and manages to feel that there is still some other danger. just outside the frame. The costume and decoration is varied, ranging from Romanesque to Oriental to artistic blanket. It would be easy to believe that it was because of the modesty of Universal, but again it was true to the creators, the visual concepts of cartoonist Alex Raymond (just look at the old strips printed in many collections). used earlier in JUST IMAGINE! (Fox 1930), science fiction science fiction. Other scientific laboratory equipment has been provided by Universal Prop Dept., Being a Top Hollywood Society to Do Horror and SciFi. Feature Cast Jean Rogers (Dale Arden) and Priscilla Lawson (Princess Aura) who get a good girl vs. Charles Middleton portrays Emperor Ming in a sort of too melodramatic villain, but he does it. Zarkov (Frank Shannon) is weakened by the sheer insanity he has suffered in his newspaper appearance. (By the way, I'm wondering how Zar-KOV has any damage?) Richard Alexander makes a great, powerfully built Prince Barin who is always helpful and so noble. The comedian actor Jack "Tiny" Lipson is a surprise cast, stealing the scene after a scene as lush, Henry VIII as a villain turned allies, King Vultan, ruler of Hawkmen. Among others, most notable is Jim Pierce as Prince of Thun Levs of Men. Pierce, as well as Crabbe, also portrayed Tarzan in the film - but later married Tarzan Creator, daughter of Edgar Rice Bourroughs, Joan. FLASH GORDON and the two sequels, FLASH GORDON TRIP TO MARS (1938) and FLASH GORDON CONQUERS UNIVERSE (1940), were the basic juvenile tariffs for generations, first in film houses and then in a TV release. As a fine wine, they saw how to get better with age. <br /> <br /> We are all so glad that Mr.Crabbe was wrong.
