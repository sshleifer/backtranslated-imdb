Finding this piece of sandwich between stale prequel and rehashed 80s machomovie on UPN affiliate noon Saturday's program would be misleading. It deserves better and definitely uses its best talents of talented talents to its maximum advantage. Bracco and Walken will provide a movie that may be predictable for those who are familiar with their genre. For a chance to ride a psychological roller coaster in the "training day" at Fuqua School, go back to the world of television films from the early 1990s.
