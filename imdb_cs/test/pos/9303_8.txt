I find it remarkable that so little was actually done with the story of a-bombs and it's been developing for decades after the Manhattan project was completed. My suspicion is that it was due to serious concerns in the film and entertainment industry (in the 1950s through the 1970s) with "McCarthyism" and related national security phobias (including Hollywood Black List). There was one film in the 1950s (with Robert Taylor) about Cole Paul Tibbits who flew Enola Gay in the Hiroshima bombing, but otherwise nothing else. One could look at the side tragedy of the problem (sinking U.S.S Indianapolis soon after the delivery of bombs to Tinian) in Robert Shaw's story of shark attacks on survivors in JAWS. But the real trials and griefs of Groves, Oppenheimer, and their team were not considered cinematic. In 1989, two films appeared. I've already reviewed it (DAY ONE), which in my opinion is the better of two discussions about the lengthy technical and emotional and political issues in the Manhattan Project. The talks of Brian Dennehy as General Groves and David Strahairn as Oppenheimer were first and neatly balanced. Small side medallions related to Szilarda's anti-aircraft crusade (Michael Tucker) help to fill the story well. This is a problem. Paul Newman is a great actor (as well as Mr. Dennehy), but Newman approached Groves in another way that is not terrible, but smaller than the intelligent but soft Dennehy army. It seems Newman is too out of sight for the possibility of a weapon as the biggest stick the other boys in the school yard could meet. Yes, it certainly was, but the real Groves would be more like Dennehy, who would think she was not on the great toy of the future, but that she would create such a big toy. The performance of Dwight Schultz as Oppeheimer helps keep the film interesting and good by helping his wife, Bonnie Bedelia. But the most interesting aspect of this film is the modernization of the two tragedies of Daghlian and Slotin, especially those that are in the style of Merriman John Cusack. Inevitably, in all technological advances, people are killed. It is these two tragedies (except for the tens of thousands that have been lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki) that have brought home the dangers that new unleashed forces have brought in the so-called peaceful, controlled experiment. Two tragedies (especially the slow, painful death of Louis Slotin by radiation poisoning) showed how much care was needed to use atomic energy - and how the hardest chances could cause disaster. The only really different thing I saw in Cusack's show (and the screenplay) and the real incident with Slotin was that Slotin actually took some time after the accident to find out where all his scientists were when they were hit by an accident (he was able to show that only he had the full effect of an accidental explosion, so only a relatively minor treatment would be needed by others). Perhaps the whole story of Slotin's actions was too technical for the screen, but since he suffered the pain he eventually suffered when he remembered the others, he shows what was the first person he really had.
