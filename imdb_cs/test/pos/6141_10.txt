Though several of the Wirey Spindell scenes can be described as "over the top". I thought it was refreshing to see something that was willing to go to the level of almost taboo comedy. Wirey Spindell is a great movie with great dialogue. I wouldn't say this movie is for everyone, but the movie is on my top ten list. <br /> <br /> If you can look beyond the occasional insult and watch it on a movie that's, I'd hope you see it in the same light as I do.
