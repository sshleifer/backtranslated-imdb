I went to Glenn McQuaid "I Sell The Dead" at his North American premiere at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival. When I see this is the second world, I don't know what to expect from this movie, especially when I didn't see a short film that inspired this big screen. I'll start with a somewhat more complicated plot of synopsis, without giving away spoilers. This film is about Arthur Blake, how he became a gravedigger and interesting and supernatural discoveries he and his teacher discovered. Costume and scenography in this film were excellent. I was amazed to hear that the whole movie was shot in and around New York. The costumes were very accurate until then, they really brought you as a viewer into the thinking of that time. This film works just as well as a period piece, as a horror comedy does. <br /> <br /> The interaction between the two wires was very fluid. They play each other with ease. The dialogue between them was very well written when Glenn added his comedic touch even in tense situations. The story is very extensive and the ball is starting from the very beginning. I would compare it to the visual turner site, I always wonder what's next. The characters themselves are very lively and unique by adding different emotional layers to the film itself. All in all, I recommend this film to anyone who is in the mood for some dark humor, with a bit of laughter with horror. in. 9/10
