Good. To enjoy this silent short comedy you have to suspend distrust of the main starting point for the movie. If you can't, then you're probably more likely to score this movie much lower. Charlie Chase has a huge overbite and his wife has a nose big enough to have his own area code. Unknowns save each other to correct these defects. Plastic surgery and dental surgery seem to have been better in the 1920s because neither of them had any need to recover from these major operations and immediately looked like a dandy! Well, remember, I ignored it, right?! Well, you also have to ignore the hard-to-believe idea that they might then meet and have no idea that the other is their wife. Okay, ... now that you dared accept these two stupid spaces, the movie gets really, really good. Charlie goes to her and she makes a pass. Both are shocked and excited because nobody has ever considered them attractive. So because of this new vanity they agree to go out. But both are coming home - they don't want their husbands to know! Anyway, they meet later and are quite attracted to each other. But what about poor husbands supposedly at home? Well, they both learn that the other is married and they both assume that their marriage will result in divorce because they really want to be with each other! Later in the movie, Charlie discovers that a woman is truly his wife and he is going through a very funny sequence where he plays both a friend and an old husband - by changing clothes and putting into false teeth when playing a husband! It's really a laughing revolt to see him bouncing in and out of the room as he seems to be fighting with another person! You really have to see it to believe it. However, the wife sees advertising with Charlie before and after the photos and knows what's going on. Finally, they both feel stupid enough!
