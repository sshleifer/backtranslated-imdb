Contrary to what many can believe as this film are "against the system" the type of film and attitude. It is an excellent view of the "system" in question and how ridiculous it is. The funny parts of the movie are actually funny because they talk about the world around us. Anyone who considers this film to be unrealistic simply denies the obvious truths about life. And that is to learn what you enjoy. That's what the school should be about .. <br /> <br /> I came to find out that the comment must have at least 10 lines. I think I commented on this. So now I write a few more lines as well as fill. I hope you enjoyed this time. I suggest you look at the movie. It's well worth it if you follow and immerse yourself in the movie.
