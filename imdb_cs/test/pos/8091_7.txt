Big comedy by Charlie Chaplin. I saw Chaplin's four main films (Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times and The Great Dictator), and I think it's the funniest of the four. This movie made me laugh more than almost any other I've ever seen. From the opening of the disclaimer ("Any resemblance between the Great Dictator and the owner of the barber shop is a purely coincidental"), the film is a laugh and a minute with a blend of wonderful slapstick and verbal humor. At the same time, Chaplin manages to portray the evil of totalitarian persecution. Maybe a little short at the end and lasting topicality things, but easy 9 out of 10 for me.
