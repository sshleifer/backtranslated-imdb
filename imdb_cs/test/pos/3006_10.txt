I loved this show. I waited for it to come out on the DVD .... it never has it. Does anyone know how to get the show available on DVD? I contacted Lifetime TV and a few others and nothing. Please let me know if there is a way we can have this series on DVD. I'd be the first to buy it. I was really addicted to this show. I don't understand how many other TV shows are available on DVD, but not every day. I'm sure there are many of us who would like this series on DVD or even VHS. I thought I'd contact the manufacturing company. Has anyone tried to contact someone else with this information?
