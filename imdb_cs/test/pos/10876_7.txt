I was actually happy to play this game. The graphics were something new. The mission was great. But I still felt like more from this game. It would be a lot better than it could just be cuz i'm into games like resident evil, dead growing and those kinds of games. who was constantly dying and unable to run. I recommend this game to those who like FPS games more than i do.7 / 10 STARS
