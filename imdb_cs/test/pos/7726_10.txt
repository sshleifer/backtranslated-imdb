Even for the non-opera loving public, the name CARMEN is instantly recognized as Bizet's opera about a gypsy girl whose capricious lovers destroy men. Just as the opera is now considered essential in every opera repertoire, the real story of a wild gypsy girl, as created by Prosper Mérimée in 1845, has never been so well described, as in this film version the abundantly gifted Spanish director Vicente. Aranda ('Juana la Loca AKA Mad Love', 'Amantes', 'If they say I fell' etc). Incorporating the novel's novel as the main character seeking the story of Carmen from one of her lovers - José - provides the right advantage for the story of this famous Roma wild lady to be told. Carmen (amazingly beautiful and talented Paz Vega) works in a cigar factory in Seville, a factory adjacent to a military station where the right José (Leonardo Sbaraglia) building is located. Carmen is tumultuous, and in a struggle inspired by a fellow worker's worker pointing out that Carmen is a gypsy, murdered Carmen's co-worker and is arrested. José is physically attracted to sensual Carmen and when Carmen flirts with him, agrees to let her escape - his return is a promise for the night of passion with Carmen. Carmen holds her pact, providing José with his first sexual encounter, and José is doomed. His lack of military discipline results in his loss of his position and being imprisoned for a while, but at his release José meets Carmen again, kills a fellow officer, and in fear escapes into the hills to live with smugglers and gypsies that are Carmen's \ t . Many incidents are trying to experience a passionate bond between lovers, but when real wife Carmen is released from prison, she takes on the destructive behavior, the behavior that includes Carmen's infatuation and the bullfighter and passion of Carmen and José ends at the tragic end. One of the factors this story does (as well as the screen by director Aranda and Joaquim Jordà is so well is the role played by Prosper Mérimée (Jay Benedict): his interrogation José complements the story that Bizet The Acting Is Outstanding, The Paco Femenia Cinematography and José Nieta's Outstanding Musical Score make a huge contribution to the success of this very fine film, which I recommend Grady Harp to Carmen lovers and a wonderful action drama for viewers who admire historical pieces.
