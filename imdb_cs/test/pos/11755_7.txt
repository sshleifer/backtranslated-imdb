This movie will probably be too sentimental for many viewers, especially for the current audience. But I enjoyed this movie mainly because of its charming magic of William Holden, one of my favorite stars, and the brilliant beauty of Jennifer Jones. There are some really pleasing scenes between the pair and the talent of these two actors will save what might be trivial lines in smaller hands. Another highlight of this film is Hong Kong's filming cinematography. All in all, better than average romantic drama, 7/10.
