A gentle story, bumping against fury, with a redeeming message and a glorious celebration. The photo is amazingly well done. The cameramen are looking at this kind of film to improve their craft not only for what the eye can do to improve the story, but also what the camera's proper vocabulary can do to increase emotion. Feeding the soul is by definition what the film addresses, but with the elegance and grace of childbirth, which simply does not happen many times, at least with the degree of taste, restraint and subtlety. If you care about storyline and character development, it's also a great movie that you can see as an example of what simple lines and proper delivery can do to completely fill the character's impression. Match it all with a film score that is almost minimalist in nature and also perfectly conceived, and you'll "get" this movie.
