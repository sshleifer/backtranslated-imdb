Chen Kaige gives us a wonderful depth of atmosphere. Yes, it's a "period piece", but Chen's artistic use of paintings makes her more. Actors often behave like players using stylized diction, attitudes and facial expressions of the Beijing Opera. All the actors in the scene play on the "back wall" even when they talk to each other. They are like ghosts of the past, interpreting, with clear clarity, a story of imminent importance to those present. Combined with great attention to scale and master cinematography both inside and outside, "Jing to ci qin wang" is a stunning story with great respect in its own style that will captivate you.
