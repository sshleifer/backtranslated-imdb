A demon from a tree is being removed in the form of a human being to make love with a young fair girl just to die. Demon's eyes freeze, two drops of blood fall on the bed he created especially for his object of desire. The bed consumes blood and it is the hunger that will remain in contact. This is explained to us by one of the victims of the bed, a painter whose soul is trapped "inside" one of his last works, the artistic portrayal of his last resting place (dies of eating, coughing up blood, decides to die on the bed of death). You see a painter, whom we can see as if he was trapped in a small room, looking through his image, unfortunately, the viewer for a meal in bed. The bed has a dark sense of humor and we see it by allowing the painter to live, even give him the jewelry and other possessions that once owned the eaten victims. One victim's skull radiates bright red flowers near the basement where the bed is located. The film contains three young women who meet a manor that holds a basement containing a mortal bed. The painter (Dave Marsh) could only have a method of destroying a mortal bed, but it would include a human sacrifice in order to resurrect the body of his death. Patrick Spence-Thomas provides a subtle, depressing impression of the imprisoned painter, tells the film, talks about his current situation, tells us about past sacrifices and often avoids the bed of his predatory nature. And the definitive, true cult film. I expect his condition to grow, that DEATH BED: The BED that EATS found is the way to the audience (... like me) who appreciates the bizarre and grotesque . The bed itself contains a liquid type of acid with a cider shade, where we see that objects and people (... fighting for nothing) are consumed. Many could recognize the young William Russa (BOY MEETS WORLD, UNHOLY) in curls, looking for her sister's escaped sister, finding her in the basement, zombies and traumatizing (.. of course, Julie Ritter was almost all. word) with both traps. In one of the most beautiful scenes of the film, Russ attempts to stab in bed just to get his hands caught in his grasp, the meat acidifying with only the remaining skeletal bones, the cartilage getting worse. One victim, whose feet were caught in bed, tried to escape, almost out of the basement, when the leaves took her back to her belly. The film feels almost totally unreal, as if we were watching a spooky nightmare. Director George Barry often mentions gags about the victims who find themselves in an unhappy position that chooses a bed of death as a place of refuge. The painter gives us a memory of all the people who were eaten. This film is nowhere to be found, it is certainly of its kind.
