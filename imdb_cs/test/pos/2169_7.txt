This film will not be considered an academic prize, but if you like a movie that is not taken seriously and wants the viewer to enjoy ninety minutes, it is not a disappointment. You will enjoy Darth Vader's mission as a criminal, a female Batman for a heroine (but much tougher with much less costume), and a running joke that includes cigarettes and a police captain who is very entertaining. It is by no means a great film success. But if you like campy fun it was worth viewing. God help me, I liked it.
