Well, it's safe to say that subconscious cruelty is one weird movie! Probably an insight into the human mind, subconscious cruelty consists of four horrific and bizarre stories of extremes. The first segment, called "Ovarian Eyeball", is really just a warm-up, but it's good that it gives the viewer an idea of ​​what to expect from the following three segments. He simply sees a naked woman spread out on the table while another woman cuts her into the belly and pulls out a human eyeball! I have no idea what's going on, but it's definitely for visceral monitoring. The following story is the best of the bunch, and takes in the "old favorite" sick film theme of incest. The segment follows a man who lives alone with his pregnant sister. She is repelled by her pregnancy - yet she wants to have sex with her and naturally gets in the way. This story excels in the monotonous and "factual" narrative, as well as the end - which cannot bring the shocks. This segment is easy to read, well turned and easily highlighted by subconscious cruelty. Of course, the other two sections are not as good as the other; so the only way out of there, but director Karim Hussain still can pull something out of the bag before the film ends. He doesn't do it right now, however, because the third segment is the weakest of the movie, and just sees that many people have sex with the country. It is very unreal and is therefore unforgettable for this reason; but it doesn't seem too much, and after the second session, I was in the mood for something a little more morbid. The film ends at high, however, while I'm not quite sure what it was - the last segment of the film's best shots. This segment focuses on religion and is definitely not for anyone who appreciates it! Director Karim Hussain achieved something here - while this collection of four "extreme" stories does not meet as a whole, the film feels very tasteful as it is shot in such an eloquent and engaging way. The director seemed to emulate the highly respected surrealist director Luis Buñuel, though with gore, rape and incest; and if you ask me, he didn't do a bad job at all. Not for everyone, but it's definitely worth looking for extreme fanatics!
