You've seen this movie in Australia on satellite. As I avoided reporting more than usual in the last week coming from the US in terms of gunmen, so that it was totally blunt, this film is a foresight gem. Great bravo to all involved. I had little idea of ​​what the movie meant, which is the most common case of good effect, and it certainly came with movie goods. setting the scene is effective in the true sense of the word, with all the furry confrontational objects of today's world in relation to the family's own deception, even suburbs. The first forty-minute set of such a professional theater wasn't ready for loud laughter when they came. Although the catechesis moment was built through comedy and character, when the family and neighbors gathered extraordinarily. The most important film and must see. <br /> <br /> Please note the date of this report.
