How many movies can you imagine when you see such a movie? I can't count them, but the filmmakers seemed to be trying to help me. I have been so often reminded of other films, it has become a great distraction. One of the unforgettable lines borrowed came from the 2003 film After Day Tomorrow. One line in itself is not so bad, but this film lends so many films that it becomes a bad risk. <br /> <br /> ALE ... <br /> <br /> See the movie! Despite his falls, he's pretty interesting and maybe they look smart. While we borrow so much from other movies, it will never exceed. You will probably find yourself when you find yourself above the hatch and head for a storm. Why? ... Costner and Kutcher played their characters very well. I was never a Kutcher fan and I almost gave up on The Guardian, but he came up in good fashion. Costner is a filmmaker who has the best Costner skills. I don't think Mrs. Robinson had anything to do with his success. <br /> <br /> The support cast around all played well. Finally, I had no problem with any of them. But some of these characters have been used too much. <br /> <br /> From there, I can only use a nit-pick to save you wear. Enjoy the movie, parts that work well enough to keep your head above water. Don't expect a smooth ride. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10, but almost 6.
