I've never seen the original "House of Wax", so I really didn't know what to expect when I went into the sneak preview of the new movie. After a somewhat inquisitive beginning of the performance of our young characters, "House Of Wax" will shift gears and become an extremely effective horror trip. This land doesn't matter much - I think most people know they've seen that these stranded kids meet an ugly murderer and find some scary things in the wax home. It's all about special effects here and they're top-notch. Viewers who like their horror movies with lots of blood will be happy here, but there are other ghoul effects. Production design and sets are excellent and the cast makes maximum of their underwriting roles. Of course, many people are probably wondering how Paris Paris is performing. To be honest, Hilton is very self-reliant and doesn't show herself how many people predict. Her character is sexy and sweet and I think her good work will hopefully change many people's opinions on her. Elisha Cuthbert is also good, moving from her previous film, the horrible "The Girl Next Door". Her character is very old and Cuthbert turns out to be a wild heroine. Chad Michael Murray, as well as Hilton and Cuthbert, are nice to look at, but unfortunately he's not very convincing as the "bad boy" of the group. I predict good things for "House of Wax," as audience viewers, I was deafening, shouting and clapping over many parts of the movie. Congratulations on the cast and crew for the job well done. Congratulations to Paris Hilton for proving that many people are wrong. As always, he says, "That's hot."
