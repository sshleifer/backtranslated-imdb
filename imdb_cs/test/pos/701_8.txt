I liked it Western Starring Randolph Scoot and Glenn Ford.it have almost everything that Western should have. They should be clashes, actions, horse races. Edgar Buchanan, who plays Uncle Willie McLeod, a character who pretends to be an old fool, but in fact is aware of everything that is happening. Randolph Scott plays the city sheriff and Glenn Ford plays Cheyenne Rogers / Bill Smith, a hunted outlaw who is finally trying to change his ways. I liked the different tracks of the characters in the movie. I didn't find that it's always a fast pace, but I never found it boring either. 8/10
