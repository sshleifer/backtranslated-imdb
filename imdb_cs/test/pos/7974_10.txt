Hell to Pay is a little bloody for my taste, though it's no worse than many movies. Still, I enjoyed the show of experienced stars and Western scenery & everything; but the story was very weak and I couldn't see its meaning. However, the music that accompanies the film more than just the faint film. <br /> <br /> Where do the -Nate & Noah Cryns guys come from? They are amazing!! From the moment the music begins, it's far better than I've heard in years. I think it may be the best I've ever heard! Although I wasn't excited about the action that was taking place on the film, the music evoked the exact emotions needed for each scene. I was transported on time to the old west during the opening credits, and I really felt like I had survived those old days through music. This movie is definitely worth buying and viewing for beautiful music and a journey down the memorial strip to see the old western stars again.
