Wow, I can't believe I'm the first and only one to comment on this great movie. Although the film itself seemed interesting enough, the real thing that attracted me to this movie is Matt Lillard, most people probably either think it's too caffeine happy or just plain, but we're both the same age and the same generation and I've been watching this guy so many times that he's one of my favorites now. This is one of the few films where Lillard is another great film and star, such as SLC Punk. Baiscally is the story of your usual movies, but more twists than anything that is getting mad. Very remarkable in this film is another great actor named Vincent D'onofrio, a highly underrated person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a newbie and she's not too bad even though you know she hired her mainly for her accent and naked scene =) <br /> <br /> It's a jack vs jill vs bob game as everyone wants to reap rewards but share with anyone. Everyone is trying to get in touch to kill the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode. Matt shows his true prowess as a JAck scheming that initially starts the whole scheme. Vincent and the woman play a couple of art thieves who need money because of lack of business. Vince's character is somewhat derailed and skitz is the whole film, but it only adds to the intensity of the film. <br /> <br /> Surprise left and right are well welcomed and the end is very clich√© and make you happy Maybe it depends on the type of endings you like. I was very interested in this film, besides the fact that Matt was in it, it's a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone who likes movies. Critics may not like this movie, but they don't like the movies they like.
