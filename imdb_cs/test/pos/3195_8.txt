I remembered watching the program as a young boy in Australia in the 1960s and once again enjoying it on DVD as a 50-year-old father of young children. Even though poor people are mostly shallow and there is a component of violence, I am very happy to have six to eight year old children, because the central characters are deep, kind and honest, Japanese culture shines through, violence is not cruel, no one has glory and the program is beautiful when you look. It does not support nightmares, but instead it shows much of the culture that must primarily influence the design of the Jedi Knights in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> DVD quality leaves something you want. Video perfectionists will not like it. It is strongly reminiscent of something that holds onto a 16mm film and is projected onto a wall in some basement ... which can be good. The soundtrack is also missing in the quality we expected from a home theater. However, my children noticed that it wasn't in color, and I think they only saw it because we recently talked about how old things are often that way. The beauty of Mt Fuji is evident in BW. Something about a 17th-century setting makes a good part of the atmosphere as if you were looking into the past in a time window. <br /> <br /> Overall, this program is better than most things in the air and far. Better advertising for Japanese TV than Pokemon, but you can consider it as a limit value if you have no experience seeing it back in the 60s. My score of 8/10 takes into account his age.
