Excellent performance by Mary KAy Place, Steve Sandvoss, Jacqueline Bissett and Rebekah Johnson. A great story that pulls you into a movie, emotional, yet cheerful. I own this movie and everyone I share with him loves it. Great for Mixed Society, 18+ crowd. Nice production, not cheap budget, well organized and keeps your interest. It uses newer ideas, for flashbacks, and keeps the viewer on the edge of its seat in one place. Regardless of where the viewer is from, he buys one or more views in this movie. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see the sequel!
