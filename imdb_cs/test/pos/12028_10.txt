Spend an hour to see this great Dan Finnerty and his "Dan Band" playing their special on Bravo's most enjoyable hour I've ever spent watching TV. This young man (Dan) is such an incredible talent as a singer, performer and even a dancer. It can come from the sweetest songs, all of which were sung only by women, hip-hop, rock, but also songs written for women. I saw him live at least 11 times, so I wasn't expecting how well his show would adapt to television or film, but all the reservations disappeared when the show began because of the overwhelming star quality. kindness and watch it, or better yet, buy it.
