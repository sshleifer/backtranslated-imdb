He signed up for imdb to say what a charming Love Love movie is and I'm completely confused. It seems to me that someone got their mixed titles. "Plastic demon child" what? This wasn't Love Life. A little dovey meadow for my taste, but a big, funny and original movie. Especially he liked the end that did not fall into the normal pit clich√© that all Hollywood romantic movies fall and burn. Nine out of ten.
