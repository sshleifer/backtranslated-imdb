Perhaps the best film ever made by director Kevin Tenney (well, his Witchboard is not at the top of my horror list of all time), this is a strange, fascinating mix between Pin and Child's Play, both better than this, but not so much better. Sure, the storyline is fictitious and perhaps too predictable, but the actors are good, Rosalind Allen is very nice to the eye (and so is Candance McKenzie - God bless her for the shower scene!), The actress is very good at interpreting disturbed daughter and puppet Pinocchio is scary enough to give you a couple of spine excitement. It's not bad for film B at all.
