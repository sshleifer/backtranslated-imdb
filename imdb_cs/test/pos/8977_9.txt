I stopped watching "The West Wing" after Aaron Sorkin stopped writing and producing. It just wasn't the same. Imagine my excitement when I see a movie he wrote again. It's been a long time - American president, a couple of good men. His screenplay was a beautiful mix of humor and tragedy. He made a convincing story believable and also made me cry. Tom Hanks was incredible as a small Texas congressman whose voters only wanted lower taxes and kept their weapons. It's not hard work, so he had a lot of time to deceive - and he did. His office staff seemed to be on Playboy Mansion. As he allegedly said, "You can teach them to write, but you can't teach them breast growth." * Despite their sexist attitude, which fits directly into the Texas Congressman, they were wildly loyal, especially his assistant, Amy Adams (Junebug and former girl Hooters). Now add rich Texas sociality, who wants something done in Afghanistan, played Julia Roberts perfectly; and a CIA agent for a painful boss, well done by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and you have a movie that's worth watching. Excellent writing and superlative gaming and the story you need will be said. What more do you want in movies?
