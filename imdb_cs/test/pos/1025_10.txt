There is a great danger when you are watching a movie that has had such a profound effect on you for the first time around that 20 years later, it won't hold the same magic as it used to be before. I have to admit I didn't expect him to be as good as I remembered, but I was pleased to be surprised. P'tang Yang Kipperbang is still as fantastic as I remembered when I was 12 years old. This movie has a certain kind of brilliance that not many movies own. It's engrossing, it's brilliantly acted and the best of everything that feels like a kid over and over there is not a lot of things they can do. John Albasiny and the role of Abigail Cruttenden in this film are first class and I forgot how well they were until now. I urge each of my teenage parents to sit down and see if they have the same effect on them as they do to me. P'TANG YANG KIPPERBANG EEHHH! 10 of 10.
