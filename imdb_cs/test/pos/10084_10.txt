We will open in a doctor's office of some kind. The girl is escorted to the seat opposite the doctor. She asks her questions. The silence follows. She still asks, ignoring the apparent traumatized atmosphere of girls. They are greeted on their arrival by their stepmother, who is obviously too harsh, but it is absolutely evil that the girls obviously disagree. As time goes on at home, the bad mother finds new ways to torture girls. And to all this, there is a vengeful spirit that is far from helping girls regenerate ... This movie is amazing. It has a twist, turns, and definitely will let you think a lot without it making sense. The relationship between the two girls is so gratifying that it almost makes crying at some points (I know I had a teary moment of two, specifically 'cabinet scene'). But what I like most about this film is the overall feeling of horror after rolling. The soundtrack is flawless, the furniture in the house and the use of colors are fantastic. Pure joy for the eyes. This is a necessity to see all Asian film fanatics. Or ANY kind of movie fan! Easy 10/10.
