Serial killer Carl Stargher kidnapped and murdered young women by letting them drown in a cell filled with water. He's arrested by the FBI, but he's in a coma and his last kidnapping victim waits timed in the cell to fill up with water. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the above assumption and you will see that there has been a very saw it all before looking at it.

You'll probably have to watch a huge number of thrillers until you see another as worrying
