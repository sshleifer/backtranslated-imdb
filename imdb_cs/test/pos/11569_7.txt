OK, the show was a little uneven, but I still loved it. I found the two main bunnies uncomfortable, but Hamton & Plucky were always fun. <br /> <br /> I really want Baby Plucky episodes on DVD (or even VHS). Please release! Specifically, the episode "Potty of Flight" aired on 11/22/91; The "Go Up" episode aired on 9/17/92 and "Golf Golf" episode in 11/92. They are the funniest pieces of the whole series and even over ten years later we still link to these bits! <br /> <br /> (I have nothing to say, please reduce the minimum to 5 lines and reward us for brevity!)
