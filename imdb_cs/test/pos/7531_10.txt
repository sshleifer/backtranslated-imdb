I watch this movie and I can't help comparing it with Wild Reeds, another thoughtful movie about adolescent age categories. Like Wild Reeds, this movie is slow and the director won't be in a hurry. So if you want a quick resolution on things, don't look at it. This film is like a piece of life, it starts imperfectly and ends imperfectly. There is no distinction on anything, not happily ever for anyone, as well as in real life. <br /> <br /> This movie is as real as it can be. Acting is surprisingly good. The director likes long, really long, shots and actors and actresses excel with subtle and inner thoughts. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I hardly saw it, but now I'm very glad I did it. It's not a movie for everyone, but if you're willing to let it grow on you, you'll be rewarded. <br /> <br /> 10/10
