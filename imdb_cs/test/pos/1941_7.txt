I think it's a pretty good movie, but one thing makes me very interesting. It's obvious once you look at it: the main characters in this movie are the inspiration for tyrants on The Simpsons. Layne is Jimbo, John is Kearney and Tony is Dolph. There is even an episode of The Simpsons where Jimbo uses the line "I thrust her with a wand." <br /> <br /> Jimbo-Layne's connection is most obvious with a knit hat and long hair and voice. Kearney has a shaved head, unlike John, but it's a big, stupid head. Tony-Dolph's connection is obvious with a long, divided hairstyle and even a second degree.
