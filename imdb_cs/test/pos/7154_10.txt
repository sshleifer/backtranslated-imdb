Wow, he just captured this movie from a stunt and I love that jewelry like this. While it was definitely shot on a budget and missing a bit in clumsy editing (ie Accidents, Hospital scenes, second to last end of the scene) for the first directorial effort, I give it 10 stars! I absolutely loved the thoughts that evoked thoughts, and if you are a free thinker and open to thoughts outside the box, I highly recommend this movie. I think director and writer Jay Floyd should have some attention and more opportunities in the film industry. Based on his credits, he can be another Quentin Tarantino.
