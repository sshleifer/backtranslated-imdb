Batman Returns This is my opinion that the first Batman of the Batman series was just half the movie that Batman is returning them to. In the first Batman Tim Burton we only had Batman and the Joker both played amazingly Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. In Batman Returns we have what I feel is a perfectly cast Batman movie (yes and better than the Dark Knight). Keaton returns as Batman and is perfect in a role that will never cross the top with Batman's character, which is perfect in this film when it comes to two villains he is against. First you have Danny DeVit, who is beautifully crazy like a penguin. Then you have Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat-Woman, which I dare say is one of the most interesting and complex villains in Batman movies. I feel this way about Pfeiffer because it becomes Cat-Woman, which starts as a rather pathetic miserable Selena Kyle and then really immerses in the dark side of her mind and what you get is a great performance of a woman who goes from trying to be a villain to a villain and eventually I return to the hero. Also in this amazing cast, you have the evil businessman Max Schreck, played by the amazing and legendary Christopher Walken. While in a supportive role there is something about this role that I love and maybe it's the look of Schreck in a movie that makes his performance better than it is already. The wise story I have to say, Batman is returning much more this time than the first Batman. The reason I loved this story is the fact that Burton dared to go in a much darker and twisted direction than Nicholson's top opposites. You have a story about a penguin and how he tries to deceive the people of Gotham to become a new hero and mayor of the city. Then you have Cat-Woman and her efforts to decide who she really is and what she should do with her new personality. As far as Batman is concerned, I feel that in this he is the more ring leader who holds both stories together, but of course kicking his ass at once. Cinematography was a dark and atmospheric film as well as a story taking place in it. Gotham City never looked as good as it does on Blu-Ray and HD, so if you have a chance to see it this way, then by all means, because it really contributes to the overall Batman Returns experience. So all I really felt about all the Batman Batman Returns movies is, or not, that it's a dark knight for me, because when I enjoyed the movie for the amazing performance of Heath Ledger as Joker , I felt the film was missing. Batman Returns Nothing, So If You Want To See A Amazing Movie With What I consider The Perfect Cast, This Is Batman That Bat Battens.
