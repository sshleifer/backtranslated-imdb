This film proves you don't need a Hollywood budget to enjoy something fun. What has remained with me is how the crew from different locations managed to pull out without promises of wealth to do anything just because they believed in it. I think anyone who makes low-budget films may be concerned with certain scenes, such as actors who just can't get one line, harassed by the police, and most crew members disappear after the first week. No one was paid for it, which tells a lot of people who had to travel across the country and for long hours of editing. After watching Stuie sell your personal property, use your own money, and garbage your house to make the film a little curious about how close his wife could come to leave. Good work for all.
