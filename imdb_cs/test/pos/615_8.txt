There's no boring moment in Robe d'Ete by Francois Ozon. It's surprising how much is packed in this short film. While lying on a deserted beach after a naked swim, a young homosexual is approached by a girl looking for light for her cigarette. He invites him to make love in a wooded area near the beach. When returning to the beach. finds out that all his clothes were stolen. He lends him a summer dress to cover his nakedness and ask him to come back the next day. Cycling back to the recreational cabin dressed as a girl. His gay companion is sexually excited. Early in the morning, a young man returns to the sea to say goodbye to a girl whose vacation is over. He suggests keeping the dress as a memento of their summer romance. It is a light film that captures the spirit of summer holidays by the sea, but perhaps not for those who are embarrassed by nudity or homosexual topics.
