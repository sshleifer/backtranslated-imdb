"Everything Is Illuminated" comes from the director, director Lieva Schreiber, who first edited Jonathan Safran Foer. The book was ambitious and vast, its magical-realistic elements and the live use of seemingly impossible language to represent on screen. Film, wisely, less experiments. While the end result is not as wildly original as the novel, it is still a perfect movie about a strange East European trip, or, as one of the characters would have, a "very rigid search". This character is Alex (Eugene Hutz), a young Ukrainian man who loves American pop culture, but he doesn't seem to get the English language straight. However, his grandfather (Russian actor Boris Leskin), who runs a US Jews tour, convinces him to serve as a translator of Jonathan (Elijah Wood). Jonathan explores his family history and tries to find a woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. During their search, more than one family secret is revealed. Jonathan Movie (not confused with the novel's novel) is a semi-kleptomanic weirdo who steals his dental substitutes for his own grandmother to join his collection of "family things". Wood's quiet, wide-eyed, serious way in this role works very well. Hutz makes an impressive debut as a loose limb, a carefree Alex. His malapropismy are cheerful, but he is also able to pull the growing self-awareness out of the character. Dog Mikki is very funny as demented Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., and one of the few movie dogs I've ever seen, is not clonally cute and premature. Finally, "Everything is illuminated" puts the Holocaust on a human scale and asks us not to remember it as a general event, but as millions of specific, small tragedies. Recalling European film also reflects on the impact of past events on current young people like Jonathan and Alex. With his original perspective, strong performances and some very imaginative visuals, "Everything is illuminated" is a great job for the first timer, and hopefully Schreiber will continue to direct movies.
