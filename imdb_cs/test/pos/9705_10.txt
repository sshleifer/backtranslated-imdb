Johnny Knoxville and Jackass guys went for Jackass Number Two. At the press screening, laughter was so loud and hoarse that it was difficult to hear the dialogue. Stunts are up and jokes are fun and more outrageous than ever. <br /> <br /> All the guys put their limbs on the line to make a great movie, and they succeeded. If you like this genre, you'll love this movie. If not, don't bother. Some of the funniest pieces are the jokes the boys play on themselves, and they don't have what's going on with them. They do anything to do stunts. Many critics have included John Knoxville in a less active role in the first film, but not worrying about being front and center in number two, and having enough cans shots to be halfway. number three. <br /> <br /> This is a must for fans of this type of humor.
