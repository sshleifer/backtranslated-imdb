With boundless, raw energy and the uncompromising vision of Talk Radio, it brilliantly examines the kindness of the public to reduce the foreigners' private problems to radio entertainment. Eric Bogosian is sensational as Barry Champlaine, a rude, in-host radio. It's natural for this kind of role and fine-tunes one of the most impressive, interesting radio personals I've ever seen on screen. The timing and delivery of his insults to his various callers are brilliant strokes. Alec Baldwin also shines as Barry's boss. He demonstrates the same explosive cynicism that he would later show 1992 by Glengarry Glen Ross. But the supporting role that really stands out is stoned, seemingly the brain of a dead teenager playing Michael Wincott. You have to see it to believe it. Oliver Stone and Robert Richardson are doing great work with photos, which is almost exclusively limited to one room. The claustrophobic feeling of the film perfectly reflects its tone. After all, one of the main points of the film is the exploitation of the private moments of the people to attract the audience. Stone demonstrates that these moments are often too private for the world to experience. Talk Radio is a movie with a strong emotional and brain impact that is rarely visible today.
