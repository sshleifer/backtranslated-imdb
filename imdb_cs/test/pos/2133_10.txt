If this film was directed by DW Griffith or Stanley Kubrick, it would be recognized for what it is: a film masterpiece narrated with depth and subtlety and passion, a film without equality in the visual sphere. It is constantly overwhelming and also very brutal in its depiction of our great heritage of greed and destruction. And, of course, what the reviewers couldn't keep is not that he was telling a simple story like 99% of Hollywood production. His characters are complicated and confused by their passions and thoughts, fears and emotions. They even seem to think, something your average film reviewers don't understand and can't follow, so they destroyed them. Look at the original uncontrolled wide screen. It's overwhelming.
