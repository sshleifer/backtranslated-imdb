This is the best fake documentary about a dog show I've seen for a long time. Very long time. Well, let's face it. Isn't that the part of the spell? The idea of ​​actually going into trouble to make the film mock the documentary about the event that most people would be odd in the first place. Even if there were no big laughs, one would still sneer at the thought. Any movie that is trying to get something new is very strong in my proverbial book. I loved dogs too!
