this is another good western I enjoyed, it's not an epic or anything but it's good for what it is. "About 3 fur hunters, led by men named Jed, who is rude and uncivilized. friends find themselves as scouts for the fortress, the only thing that stands between them and the Indian band that hates Americans on their land and wants to take it back. This is the essence of the story. Even a bit of humor, and forbidden romance.one Poison Friends, Gus, reminded me of a lot of Quint characters (played by Robert Shaw) in the movie Jaws.they both have that crunchy, gruff demeanor. \ T a lot of likes about this particular entry.i thinks they deserve 7/10
