I haven't read Anne Rice's novel on which this film is based, but who knows, maybe reading a book is cheaper than renting QUEEN OF DAMNED and it's probably better for your health. It's not that this movie is necessarily bad for your health, but the book can be very relaxing and certainly exercise the active part of your brain more than this movie. You can count the number of pages by Anne Rice I read on one side, but after seeing this movie and the Vampire Interview, I feel like he's writing really good novels. Graphs for both films suggest a whole sea of ​​deep and intertwined history of vampires. Stuart Townsend's vocal story is, however, damn much more annoying than the story of Brad Pitt's vampire he has ever done. you can say that the limited production resources of QUEEN OF DAMNED hardly give the story to Anne Rice enough body. While Interview has decided to go with lace and elegance, QUEEN relies on special low budget effects that are really hard to take seriously. It can be seen that the original novel had potential as a film and that the production team focused its attention on the wrong places. The costumes and rock & roll scene could be replaced by more blood and eerier soundtrack. However, I will give credit where the debt is due. The soundtrack is excellent. Korn and Disturbed met me with a disease that wriggled noggin like Butthead. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a very cool Goth-Rock mount and zoom, but degenerates after the first ten minutes. fast. It is as if the film was so long that the director realized that there wasn't enough time and enough money to do the romanesque justice of Anne Rice. What are some average vampire scenes and lots of special effects. Unfortunately, QUEEN OF DAMNED cannot manage genre justice, just as its counterparts John Carpenter cannot impress. Where are the yellow contacts? Where is Pale Blue Makeup? Scene scene, I shook my head to remember the days of Salem Lot and Fright Night when the low budget was done correctly. There are quality redemptions though that save this film from garbage. Aaliyah supports her and her soul can rest forever. She could become a renowned actress, her life wouldn't be prematurely taken away because she gave this movie a decent performance with lots of nice belly dancing. Did I mention that the soundtrack is good? Let's see what else can I say? It wasn't too long. Anna Rice's novel could easily be a three-hour film if an ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola had it. There are several twists and turns around here and there on the property. But in everything it was a legitimate rock and roll supplement to kill the second-speed vampire movies out there. The director of this film continued to direct the new Battlestar Galactica mini series if he tells you something. <br /> <br /> JY <br /> <br /> Jimboduck-dot-com
