I was shocked at how good this German version of movies was like Scream. Overcoming all modern American endeavors for slasher films. It's what all these films don't have. Likable characters, real secrets, tension, graphic murders and a great soundtrack. This stylish horror movie is one of the best of its kind ever released. German cinema has recently moved from strength to strength. It's a pity more people wont go to see such movies because they're missing. It's easily available on DVD, so even if you hate subtitles, I think you should see it. It will be one of the best horror movies you'll see all year long.
