When I first saw this show advertised to be on Australian TV back in the late 90s I ignored that it was just making money on Kevin Costner's 'Bodyguard'. But then I caught the episode and I wish I watched it from the beginning. The partnership between Sean Pertwee and Louise Lombard was so good and the structure of each episode was very fun. It wasn't an exaggerated TV show that you could say that you spend most of your energy doing things so that they can put this clip in the ad to lure the audience and then get to no other level. The show plunged into the lives of two main characters and that's what made it interesting. Stories for each episode where also well written with interesting guest stars who were good actors. And of course there was a lot of action and intrigue that is always good. But it was great that there was humor, and that naturally emerged from the characters, it didn't look the opposite. It was British, but in a good way, and if this show was made in America, it would no doubt be on DVD. I don't know why British TV production companies are not interested in releasing this show on DVD. It was a great show and deserves a DVD release.
