More Raquel Welch Classic! This film hit theaters on November 10, 1969, starring Raquel Welch as Michele, James Stacey as Joe and Luke Askew as Alan Morris. Nikki is on her way to meet her friends Michele and Jackie. While he's on his way, he runs to his former husband, who wants a second chance. Nikki leaves him and goes to the table where he sees Michele and Jackie. Alan approaches her again and begins to leave when Alan shoots her in the back. Nikki is taken to the hospital while Michele and Jackie go to the police station. Michele goes to the hospital to meet Jackie to find out that Nikki has died. Then Alan goes to Jackie, who strikes with a car and then tries to run Michele. Michele jumps into the car and heads for Los Angeles. When he gets there, he calls Lloyd, his Las Vegas boss, to let him know he's okay. Lloyd tells her to go to the club he called losers to see Jeri work. But there is one problem! The bartender has a drug problem and Alan knows that Alan and the bartender are talking. Back in Los Angeles Michele not only gets a job as a dancer with Jeri, but also joins with Jeri bouncer Joe. Now there are some thoughts in this picture! This image was much better than Raquel's last, and he had a nonstop action. Luke Askew did a great job of playing Nikki's ex husband. It was your typical murderer with a look at it. As for the performance of Raquel Welch, the only word that comes into mine is fantastic. She was amazing in this film and her beauty excelled and shone like never before. The clothes she wore on stage on the stage were breathtaking. In fact, all the clothes she wore in this movie were breathtaking. Of course, no matter what Raquel had, she looks good in everything or nothing. I give this film to 10 weasel stars for two reasons. The first and by far is Raquel Welch, who is a leading actress and deserves 10 stars. The second reason is that this film was from the beginning to the end of the wall-to-wall excitement.
