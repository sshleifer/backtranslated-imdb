- has Carla Gugino * yay * and a lousy ending * boo * <br /> <br /> - "Jaded" is a very erotic story about a beautiful woman who comes to town and tries to escape the past. There they meet with two lesbians and after a few drinks they both decide to have fun. But one of the girls takes things too far and rapes when the other girl holds her. She is discovered on the beach where the incident occurs the next day and is taken to the hospital. After that we spend the rest of the film watching as they try to undress both girls while learning some new information about who they are and where they came from and a bit about their past. - Director and co-founder Caryn Krooth is doing a great job with this film because of his low budget. It's handy and sometimes looks like 16mm, but it fits into the movie because the story requires a hard look at it. All the actors do well with what is given to them, and there is nothing to complain about. Of course in the film, of course, Carla Gugino, who reveals all of this in this film. She is actually more nude in this movie than she's in "Sin City". Christopher McDonald is also in the movie, but his character is really a bit unnecessary, but he's funny to watch. I didn't pay much attention to music at all, because it doesn't really pay attention to it, but it does what it has. The film is rated R and it is for a very good reason. sometimes it is very sexual and very graphic. It's basically a soft-core boundary, but sex scenes are essential for a movie, so it doesn't feel like it's just to be there. Although there is one pointless scene we see as Chris McDonald gets it, the scene was useless, but I don't think it's a problem. The only mistake in the movie is that we don't get to court trial after all that we go through in the movie. It's like having sex and having no orgasm, or something <br /> <br /> -It's a shame that talented Caryn Krooth has never made a feature film ever since. This is a very gifted woman can do great things with a very small budget. I really hope she will soon return to the game because she's a wonderful director. Jaded is not a masterpiece of erotic cinema, but what we have is a nice movie that shows a great director in the making. <br /> <br /> -Hide the kids and close the curtains, you don't want people to think you're watching porn as you watch this movie.
