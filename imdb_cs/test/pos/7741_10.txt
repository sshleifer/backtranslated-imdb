I love this film and all its aspects, well-controlled as a comedy and as a drama. Acting is great, played by a star actor who plays perfectly in New York. The scenery is incredible, absolutely breathtaking. I also like the story: NYC's successful architect, who is going through a middle age crisis, leaves his cheating wife and runs to the Greek island to hide with his daughter who decides to go with him. I just can't express my love affair about this movie. "Show me the spell".
