After being captured by a grandfather and sent to Changi during World War II, I hesitated to watch it when he was first screened on television. My grandfather kept the diary when he was in captivity, and when he died there, his friends bought it and I was lucky to read it and feel that I have at least some idea of ​​what Changi really likes, from first hand. Br /> <br /> This is a fantastic list of what happened to the poor who were sent to Changi Prison and shows the hardships and cruelty they witnessed to protect their country. It is an amazing story about friendship, commitment and spirit of Aussie, who will never give up his attitude. It's worth watching whether you like Australian history or what to do with World War II. I enjoyed this mini and gave it 10 out of 10.
