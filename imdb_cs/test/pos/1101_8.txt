OK .... so in minute 15 in the movie, there's no dialogue yet. This movie came to me in a padded bag from Down Under, with Sharpie encrypted information on the front. I am a North American programmer and MOD LOVE sent me our chief as a potential starter ahead of the remote Moscow / Karlovy Vary interface. Directly I thought "this movie is not for us" (no minute 15 ?? dialogue), but it was just as it watched. But but but. It was built and built and built halfway into the film because, as you go to the zoo, you are initially restrained, but when you get to the dangerous snakes, you're absolutely "there". This film is dangerous, not at all like Wolf Creek, but because it is so completely "different" in all directions of shape and form, and it seems to weave a web of all the fantasies of most independent first helmets, ie - gloomy weather, red neck intrigues, strange weaving, frightening music and a plot that, although imperfect and basic, has a bit in common with one of the "big Aussie Movies", ie Cars that ate Paris, Wier. But MODERN LOVE is not really a very Aussie film in the sense of Ocker-ishness and playful self-depreciation that penetrates many of the country's films. It works on a more nightmare from the beginning. No cell phones, no trademarks, no i-pods, no brave city center / class anxiety - just a dude married with a good seeker, old Volvo and a little boy (son) who has weird teeth and chucks around. And it's in a strange village where people look a little "bad". Photographed by Nick Matthews (2:37) and music by Tom Huzenroeder (Ten Canoes) MOD LUV succeeded where many Aust. films will fail - that is, regardless of the "God-forsaken" country of origin. Instead, it enjoys the distorted but fun puzzles that the film itself cannot solve - and here lies a weak link ... what the world has to do with "Modern Love" ???? The last minutes of the film seem to give an answer, or at least allusions to one .... and when I was sitting and drinking coffee and ate then Hershey, all I could convince was that this movie assistant, Alex Frayne, with this They will have a lot of fun.
