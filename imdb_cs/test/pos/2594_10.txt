Rabbit Spices is one of three cartoons that include Bugs Bunny / Daffy Duck / Elmer Fudd in the War of Words and Wits about whether it's a rabbit season or a duck season. Love Bugs and Daffy stir up "excuse trouble" with Daffy always victim of Elmer's shotgun, making his beak always get torn. Then there's a rabbit cross-dressing that always gets Elmer in his love hit mode. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always my favorite in the writer-director category, because I laughed at these funny cartoons of hunting trilogies since my childhood. And at least two of them end up with Daffy's scream of Bugs: "You're despicable!" It can't be better!
