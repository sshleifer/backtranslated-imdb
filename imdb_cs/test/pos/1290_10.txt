Christopher Nolan's first feature film stunned critics who saw it when it first came out. Shot at Micro Budget $ 6000 This is a real-class student movie. Filmed in black and white, the film presents people you think are friends of Nolan. That doesn't mean they're bad actors because they're pretty good. You can see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Hawe appearing in other projects, but unfortunately it wasn't 6 years ago. Nolan's thriller, like Memento, does not play chronologically, shifting scenes like Pulp Fiction. Writing is fantastic. It's a big twisting thriller, but because the movie's timing is shifted around it makes it even more interesting. I thought the last ten minutes, especially when everything became clear, were excellent. <br /> <br /> For a movie with such a small budget and no discernible names at all, it's so good. This is better than most of the Hollywood studios, and Nolan after three films (this is an outstanding Memento and not so good but still excellent Insomnia) has become the most exciting new talent of recent times. I can't wait for Batman. <br /> <br /> This movie is short and sweet and certainly great. It's very professional and the twists are fantastic and absolutely surprising. I also thought that David Julyan's score was also excellent, very atmospheric and had a cool quality. He went on to compose Nolan's other films. <br /> <br /> Overall, I recommend, I intend to get all Nolan's films. It is a low-cost gemstone. ***** <br /> <br />
