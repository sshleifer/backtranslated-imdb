The sign of what to expect in this movie came when I noticed that it was the first (and probably last) movie to have "Vomit Technik" in his credits. What is a few Hours of Silly Gags, Hilarious Violence and Great Humor slapsticky. This film was exactly what you would expect from boys from underwear, and it's great to see them at their best after Rick Mayall's life. Richie (Mayall) and Eddie (Edmondson) are too similar to their bottom figures if we can have any criticism at all, and Edmondson is doing a surprisingly good job in directing the film. This film has already produced predictable comparisons with Fawlty Towers, which are simply not there, and Paradiso itself is hardly Torquay! <br /> <br /> Watch out for some of the great Dialogue between all violence and chaos. If you don't like Bottom, you'll probably hate it - but I loved it.
