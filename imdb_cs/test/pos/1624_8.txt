When I was sitting in the theater, I was almost anxious about the cruelty of how Ron Howard and Tom Hanks call the Da Vinci code, I did not see the light at the end of the tunnel, which is angels and demons. Hanks and Company are back for Sequel-Prequel angels and demons, and they've learned their lesson. <br /> <br /> Acting wisely everyone is much better. Aylet Zurer is very good as Vittoria Vetra and better than the girl who played Sophie Neveau. Tom Hanks is very good as always, but that's better because he works harder to make the film feel like it's a thriller. I think Ewan McGregor does the best work of any of the actors. He could even earn a nomination to come in March, but doubtful. He convinced me to the very end. He is dynamic and faithful, but rational, and realizes that the Church must give past. Smaller actors also do a very good job. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is much better. Cinematography is much ... much better and visual effects are excellent. The final explosion sequence at the end is excellent. Howard makes a masterpiece, takes you through a tour of Rome. Stimulating wisdom, Ron Howard, will do a great job this time to keep the story moving. condemning Christianity. The film also feels that more is at stake. In our weak minds discovering whether Jesus had children or not, he is not on the list as high as a cataclysmic blast killing thousands, including the Roman Catholic Church. The reason I think the story is so fast is because it's an excellent result. I can't say enough about the score. Sometimes it was epic, like something of the Lord of the Rings, but sometimes it seemed like a Bourne movie, which is a nice mix. My only complaint about this movie is that it's ridiculously far drawn. The chance that Carmelengo is an Ewan McGregors age is very unlikely, and the cardinal's chances with the adopted son, who was elected Pope, are even more ridiculous. Not to mention the whole thing Antimatter to be created, and Dan Brown wrote a book in 2003 ... <br /> <br /> Overall, angels and demons are much firmer knitting, faster pace, more exciting, and more important than a movie Da Vinci Code. It must see a thriller for anyone who loves history and a mystery combined into one.
