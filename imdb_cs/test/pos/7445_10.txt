Didn't play the game? Don't bother. This is for Final Fantasy VII fans out there that beat the game, and no other will appreciate this precious gemstone movie. Want to watch and love it? Buy a game, beat it and then watch it. When was the last time you saw an excellent video game movie? Well, this is it. The story takes place two years after the game, and no short summary will resume to remember (even if I doubt it would have forgotten) and goes straight into one hour and a 40 minute adventure. <br /> <br /> All your favorite characters are there, even Cait Sith. Voice Gaming is excellent in Japanese, each character is perfectly cast. The cloud sounds hard and courteous, Tifa sounds kind, but strong ... Aeris is also perfect, sounds just as I imagined. Cait Sith sounds less cute than I imagined, but worked very well. <br /> <br /> Character models are spectacular, great textures and lighting. The environment is breathtaking, and the battles are choreographed to make the Matrix blush. Amazing work with the camera goes through the chases of the bike, for example, where your eyes just scream happily and your lungs breathe hard without permission. <br /> <br /> Music is a typical Uematsu quality, which means it's top quality. Known tunes are redesigned to accompany the Advent Children graphic jump, which fits well with the visual aspects. There is even an inner joke for fans that includes music, it will make you smile for sure. <br /> <br /> I'm looking at it with headlines because I'm half Japanese, so I can't say the headlines are good. In Japanese, however, dialogue is very good and every word sounds like it comes from real living beings, not just actors. Impressive. I will watch it once again with the headlines to see the differences because I played both Japanese and American Final Fantasy VII. <br /> <br /> If you're a Final Fantasy VII fan, buy this movie on the day it comes out or pre-order it. If you haven't played the game but want to see this movie very badly, don't waste your time: buy a game, beat it and then return to this DVD. I won't tell you not to notice it, but play the game. This will make the experience much better and will not leave you in the dust scratching head. Come back, old friends - it's time to go on an adventure with your brave friends!
