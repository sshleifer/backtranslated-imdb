Ali G Indahouse must be one of the most entertaining movies I've seen for a long time, and Cohen's portrait of a British gangster is cheerful. This movie has a cult classic written everywhere and contains some really cool lines. Ali G Indahouse is a good party movie that leaves the viewer literally from start to finish. Definitely vote Ali G and keep it real.
