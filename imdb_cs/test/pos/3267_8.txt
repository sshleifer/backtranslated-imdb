Jordan takes us to the dirty side of Sydney, Australia, after a 19-year-old Jimmy (Heath Ledger) desperate attempt to join a local gangster and need a change before they reach him. The Gangsters (led by Bryan Brown) are a menacing band with a humorous stripe in them. This is what makes the movie work because we are always gangsters like a rough bunch to make you screw up badly. But this crowd tickles your funny bones. A crazy structured script from Jordan has characters that cross paths and are captured on the web.
