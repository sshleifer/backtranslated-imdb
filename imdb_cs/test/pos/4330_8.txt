This is probably the second best movie Death of Wishes. Death Wish 5 is the best. Death Wish 3 reminds me of "West Side Story" with a new twist. Even the recent movie "Gangs of New York" cannot measure with one New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3 that is not plagued by two rival gangs - but one big gang. A gang who is willing to do things like cutting a man to death with an ax if he falls on his set. Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, plays in the action movie he plays, gently filled with a lot of violence. So, like Geri Nichols in Death Wish II, Death Wish III scores with its subtle, romantic moments as well as its violent moments. Only James Bond's love-interest scenes would be much better. <br /> <br /> In addition to his .38, Kersee plays with this new weapon called the Wildey .475 Magnum. It reminded me of Dirty Harry's movies when Callahan used his Magnum in Magnum Force, Sudden Impact and Dirty Harry. Wildey's weapon wraps a big blow, and when Kersey kills her, he doesn't care if he has a big kick. And the anti-tank rocket that killed the main gang leader? Well, that's something. Kersey wouldn't use an anti-tank rocket as his regular vigilante weapon .... that's too military for him.
