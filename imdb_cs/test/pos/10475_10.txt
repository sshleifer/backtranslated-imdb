Some have commented on headlines that are not a problem in this movie - please be different - the difficulties in facial expressions and subtle interactions between characters are such that you cannot afford to take your eyes away in a split second. . I tried to watch this problem in English on DVD to overcome this problem (don't make this mistake, the result is travesty). The only way to get full advantage is to watch it two or three times in quick succession, so you know and then ignore the headlines. Acting master class - not in dialogue, but in body language. These are little things - the postmaster / businessman spewing out of his chest and going to take his cap before delivering a letter from France! ! The general's confused expression, like his joy from a bunch of perfect grapes, evokes a biblical reference with a depth of "being there". <br /> <br /> The camera is a wonderful and bleak minimalist village with a flush of color just accentuating the richness of the banquet. I have a friend who claims to be from Borgias and whose family motto is "If it's worth doing, it's worth surviving" - Amen. Always laughing loud and crying I watch this movie
