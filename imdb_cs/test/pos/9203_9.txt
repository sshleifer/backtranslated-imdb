I was shocked to find out that Jimmy Caan left this show, does anyone know why? I consider James to be one of the greatest giants and was not surprised he ended up on television, which may be better than the bullshit you see on the big screen. Stories are neat and the camera is faster than a quick shot! You must not forget the rest of the cast: James, Vanessa (yum!) Nikki, Molly, Josh, Mitch .. Also can someone tell me why on Earth is on the DVD sets melodies on the theme, but Elvis's JXL remix Little less conversation is used on the initial NBC Broadcasting? Doesn't it make sense to use a melody that would connect with America's gambling murmur for DVD release?
