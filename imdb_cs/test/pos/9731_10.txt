It's great to see a new dose of puppets that cause confusion in this series. I found this chapter a lot of fun. In fact, it would probably be my second favorite series. This film has very little violence and is only rated PG-13. This is remarkably different from other R-rated puppet master movies that have been loaded with gore and violent chaos. However, the lack of violence does not diminish this entertainment. This film also has remarkably better special effects than the last movie in this series. Good.
