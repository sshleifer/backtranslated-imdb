George C. Scott gives his best and most fun with a wonderful drama in this scenario, Paddy Chayefsky. Diana Rigg is an attractive and pretty complicated young woman. This film moves between tragedy and chaos at a New York hospital in the late 1960s with overwhelming consequences. Barnard Hughes is as beautiful as ever (great actor on stage). <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. Best Performance = George C. Scott. Chayesfsky was a big hit when he put Vanessa Redgrave at the Oscar ceremony in 1978, but he's a good writer. A real file that works wonders, down to the smallest role. It won the Best Screenplay at the Oscars and Scott was nominated. He was to win for this PATTON site the previous year (which he was also brilliant in). Look for it!
