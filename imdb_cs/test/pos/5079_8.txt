I liked this movie. I saw it in a packed house at the Toronto International Film Festival the day after a gala evening that had to go through. Director, Gavin Hood was supposed to be present at today's screening, but unfortunately his twins were only born a few hours ago, so he had to take the plane back. '2 births in 24 hours' was how you joked about it. The wording refers to "extraordinary rendition" - a date when suspect terrorists in the US can be sent, without their parents' legal consent, to nations abroad to be questioned and detained. It's quite predictable - an innocent Egyptian-American man who was wrongly accused of being a terrorist disappears while traveling from South Africa to Washington DC. He is sent abroad while his wife at home (Reese Witherspoon) fights to find him and free him. But what makes this movie special is some nice choices in telling stories: 1) a story about human touch of what is happening in a place where a suicide bomb exploded; 2) the humanity of a CIA agent who is trying to understand and be honest about what is really happening; and 3) a storytelling chronology that makes it a tight, tense story that moves and tears at the right moments. Ah - relief! And a mixture of emotions that revolve around how the story fights for the end. <br /> <br /> Versatile powerful playing with Meryl Streep as a vixen standout.
