This is a great comedy, emphasizing how it was to live alongside racist bigot. But it also shows that the two main characters are actually as bad as the others. Based on the ITV comedy, this is very politically incorrect. And that's all the better, comedy after all it's fun. The only real drawback to movies is that there is not plenty of conspiracy. However, casts are as great as usual. Jack Smethurst and Rudolph Walker make one infernal team playing in one way of leadership. It's been many years since I saw this movie and I could finally buy it on DVD last week. The fact that the film still contains real laughter aloud means that I can recommend this film just as it would be in the 1970s.
