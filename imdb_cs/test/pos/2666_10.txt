Instead of writing a paragraph, I'll give you four good reasons why 2001 is the greatest film experience of all time: 1) This is a visual Odyssey that could only be said on the big screen. The special effects that Kubrick won his only Oscar are the most stunning effects before that age of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow Kubrick to provide accurate (or at least the most accurate) display of space travel to date. The silence that fills the cosmic scenes serves not only its purpose as a precise science, but also contributes to the mood of the film (later discussed with the HAL). The fact that Kubrick shot Apollo at the Moon Scenes before landing is a disdainful, yet filling step. Many said it was a popular "cruise" film after its original release. I can't think of any other movie that has such an amazing picture for its time and even all time (sorry Phantom Menace fans!) 2) Kubrick's directorial style is amazing. As in all his films, Kubrick likes to use his camera as a means to immerse himself in the psychology of his characters and conspiracy. His camera is not as mobile as other greats like Scorsese, but instead sits and watches the story unfold. Faces are a key element of Kubrick. Like classic films such as M and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the faces of the characters to give the audience a psychological perspective. Even he uses extreme close-up shots of the HAL's shining red "eye" to show the coolness and determination of the villain's computerizd. I could go on, but in summary, Kubrick is in his style. 3) The HAL 9000 is one of the most vulnerable characters in film history. I fully agree with Gene Siskle's late opinion on the HAL 9000. Most of the film takes place in space. Through the silence and darkness of the space itself, a mood of isolation is created. Dave and his crew are isolated between the country and Jupiter. Combine this mood with cool, calculated HAL 9000 actions and you have the most feared villain. Although I have seen this film several times, I feel my chest tighten in a certain scene. 4) The controversial end of 2001 always distracts people from this film. Instead of trying to express my opinion on what it means, and what is my idea of ​​the importance of 2001 in general, I would like to say that the end serves to keep the film open. Kubrick said he wanted 2001 to be open for discussion. He left his meaning in the hands of the viewer. By respecting the audience's intelligence, Kubrick allowed his film to be the beginning, not the end, of a meaningful discussion of the man's past, present and future. The beauty of 2001 is that the end does not mean anything deep, it can be a purely conspiracy explanation and the whole film can be considered a fun journey through space. No other film, apart from the great Citizen Kane, is left open to discussion like 2001. It is really a surrealistic path that embraces not only the eye but the mind. Instead of waiting for long queues on Phantom Menace, rent a widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest movie experience.
