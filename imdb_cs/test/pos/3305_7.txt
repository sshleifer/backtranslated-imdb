This is a stunning female drama that people can enjoy. The story is followed by a young woman (Hope Lange), who goes to work for publishers after college. We can forgive her a jump from secretary to editor (hey, that's Hollywood) and a few other shortcomings. Here is one of the few films in which the great-time producer Robert Evans (once beautifully depicting a rat with women) once appeared. It also features mature Joan Crawford and an amazing support cast. Check it out.
