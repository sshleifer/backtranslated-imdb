No need to repeat the synopsis created by Glenn. The black and white rendition is even stronger in portraying the bleakness of rural village life at that time. The profound degree of friendship shown by Babette to two older sisters touches heart threads. The support cast is excellent and their performances are excellent, it would not be fair to choose one character because the whole story depends on the cast as a whole. I can't put my finger on exactly why I rate this movie so high because I'm not a professional critic; Individual viewers may or may not agree with my rating because the enjoyment of this type of film is always in the viewer's eyes.
