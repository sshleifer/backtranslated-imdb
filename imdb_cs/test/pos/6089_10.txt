TEP is like a long cool drink of water after going through the Sahara to the classic movie enthusiasts who have been deprived of this film magic for too long! Not only is it beautifully photographed, but the characters are perfectly rendered. If you are looking for a film to be a mirror book, you will be seriously disappointed. Instead, this is an excellent "companion" to the book, and I think that's what Anthony Minghella intended. Ralph Fiennes is probably the most beautiful man in the world; not to mention a great actor. Juliette Binoche is a posterchild for vulnerability and children's enthusiasm. And of course, I'll go see any movie that Kristin Scott Thomas is on. She just has to be the best actress since Deborah Kerr. So much has been promised with this movie and there is a lot!
