Finally, director Maverick Seijun Suzuki was able to shoot his dream project "Princess Raccoon" and in a way it's lucky he didn't try it in the sixties. Special effects and computer graphics certainly made this kind of production easier to achieve than old film matte technology should. Some familiarity with Japanese history and theatrical traditions will help with the enjoyment of this film. Much like familiarity with Shakespeare's "storm" would help with Peter Greenaway's dense "Prosper's Books". These two movies have a bit in common, though "Princess Raccoon" is much more varied and easier to follow without a background to realize it. While art design, acting and direction are fine for most of the movie, it seems that this viewer that energy runs out in the last third of the film. Most interesting files have already been introduced and the camera seems to be a step back for more shooting experiences. This is certainly a unique film experience and I recommend it to anyone interested in alternative forms of film performance. It's not really meant for children, even if nothing happens that would upset them. If the last third were better, I'd give her nine stars.
