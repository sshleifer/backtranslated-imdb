When I read a video for a local magazine, I called it "the greatest success in American film history." It wasn't entirely on his face. TW&TL remains Milius's best job and it is sad to have such a small opportunity to work. However, TW and TL remain a notable exposure of what once was known as the American character, largely on the strength of Brian Keith's exquisite portrayal of Teddy R. (Apparently Milius - and Keith - admired by TR overwhelmingly making two films about him, including "The Rough Riders . ") It is difficult to cause this film at any level: a great balance between action, levitation, relationships and a serious American theme that comes to the world. In addition, TW&TL has an extraordinary appeal: note the statistics that show that it is best suited for under 18s, women 18-29 years and over 45 years! It is clear that Candy Bergen struck a sensitive chord with both women and men.
