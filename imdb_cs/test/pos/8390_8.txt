It's just to show how bad you can be. I didn't expect to like this movie. I was disappointed with both Kill Bill movies (though I preferred the latter) and Death Proof (though it was better in a shorter double edition). I love Reservoir Dogs, I admire Pulp Fiction and I think Jackie Brown is the most mature film of Tarantino - technically his best - including the last big show Robert De Niro has brought. Since then, it seems to me that his films are fine (I hated them), treading water into a reference, respectable, confident juvenile. Then I read the script last year for Inglourious Basterds - and I hated it! Of course it had some typical QT flourishing and the opening scene was undoubtedly strong. There were some great characters. But on the site it was more juvenile garbage, largely destroyed by the prostitute of the uninteresting Basterds of the title. That really made me think I didn't see the movie. The trailers didn't convince me. I only changed my mind when I was able to see a film with Tarantino Q&A in London. I thought it would be worthwhile to hear him at Q&A as I know from the interviews how fun he can be in person. <br /> <br /> So little I've been prepared for the sheer thrill and brilliance of Inglourious Basterds. Br /> <br /> Mr Tarantino's easy work by Jackie Brown is a triumph. Yes, the links are there, but they do not disturb the story, they are not the driving force. Yes, Eli Roth is a stunt casting, but it works well, with little to do but look aggressive, and does nothing to hurt the movie. While admiring Mr. Tarantino using stuntman Zoe Bell as myself in the Death Proof movie to intensify the enthusiasm of the main scene, her lack of acting ability in the pivotal role was a problem for the film. The same could be said about Tarantino's own performances in several films, especially Robert Rodriguez From Twilight Till Dawn, who wrote Tarantino. <br /> <br /> What makes this job really is how it's BIG. The western atmosphere of spaghetti on most of the style, dialogue and performance is amazingly above the peak without falling too far into the quality of the Kill Bill cartoon. Violence is so great. Such insolence. Brad Pitt is so big! In the trailers, Hitler's moment and Pitt's performance bothered me, but in the context of the film they are cheerful. Pitt is actually great, exactly what he must be. He is Mifune's stormy samurai in Yojimbo, he is Robards Cheyenne from Once Upon a Time in the West, there is a very James Coburn atmosphere to him, and of course properly Lee Marvin's edge. Christoph Waltz (who I did not know before) and Melanie Laurent (who first noticed in the British short film Sean Ellis) are sensational and I expect both to be used much more in the future. Apparently Tarantino had not lost his eye for a cast that seemed to leave him in evidence of death. Waltz is just as big in his performance. Cooling, but theatrical. It's Fonda of OUATITW, Van Cleef of Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is appropriately Cardinale innocence, but tough, fighter. They both dazzle here. That each member of the cast gets the fun he has from what they do without just having fun and trying to help immensely. Laughter - and there are burdens - come organically. Only Mike Myers comes close to blinking and pushing him too far, but his scene is ruled by enough - with the help of fantastic Michael Fassbender, who seems to be in the form of the great leader of Attenborough's Great Escape. <br /> <br /> All the actors are shining, and Tarantino throws in beautiful flowers, but those who work with the story. The introduction of Schweiger's Hugo Stiglitz is a rebellion. After a sensational slow warm up and a famous opening performance for those frantic Basterdy, the pace never stops and flies for more than two and a half hours. It also looks beautiful, which marks it as a return to a real movie - rather than just self-confidence. The musical selection, as always, is inspired by Morricone. <br /> <br /> The film is bold and cheerful. After the summer, when almost every film disappointed me, it came as a huge surprise that real fun and fun, but also impressive and impressive cinematography should be that I would never believe in the script. Welcome back QT.
