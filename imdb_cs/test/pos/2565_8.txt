When I read the comments, I was surprised when I came across the one who said this movie wasn't "too deep". I have to disagree, it must be one of the deepest and most provocative films I've ever seen. Yes, acting and music were excellent; in reviews they praised themselves again and again. I also praise the heart of the film. It resonates with a deep sense and feeling - it's a story of redemption. It's about two very different and very erroneous characters, beaten by life, but too strong to lie down and die. It's about a man seeing a girl more value than herself. She strongly reminded me of the book Redeeming Love by Francine Rivers, which has a similar story of redemption. Yes, pictures and themes are chaotic and sometimes shocking, but if you look close enough, you can only see yourself in these characters. Sometimes the truest things in life are not nice, but they are real.
