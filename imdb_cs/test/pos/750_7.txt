Personally, I have a soft spot for horror movies that take place in hospitals and asylum facilities, so I felt good about watching this "Don't look into the basement", even though its reputation is doubtful. Well, it turned out I was right! This is great, handy fun with several effective shocks and beautifully absurd characters. Of course, you also have to look for bad production values ​​and a totally illogical plot, but if you do (and if you are a fan of this kind of horror, that's basic quality), you'll be rewarded with an outrageous "video ugly" in which main elements. Young and cute Charlotte arrives at a remote sanatorium to start her new job. He finds out that the Doctor who hired her was killed by the patient, and the surgeon-accused Masters is reluctant to accept the new arrival. Living inside a sanatorium is rather strange when patients move freely and all doors are unlocked. After a series of bizarre events, Charlotte reveals the horrible secrets that the institution hides… Opening 10 minutes (pre-credits) is great, as is the utterly summit. Everything in between is almost without surprise or tension, but you are waiting patiently because you feel that the finals will be wild fun. Asylum patients are textbook lunatics, but I still like them. My favorite one is a former judge (who still speaks solely from the legal point of view), a suspicious army-Sargeant and a crazy old lady. "Don't look into the basement" is a great fun with a low heart, especially recommended to fans of a 70-year-old cinema, sick puppies and other scum. Fools took asylum, yeah!
