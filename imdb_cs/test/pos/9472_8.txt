I saw this movie today (opened yesterday here) and was just pleased. I saw a review that said something that would make the reviewer think it would be just another teen movie, but then found that it was based on Shakespeare's twelfth night ... and then he began trying to justify this film on Shakespeare's soil. I really think it goes the way overboard: the only connection I've seen with the Twelfth Night is (a) the basic idea of ​​a girl who disguises herself as a human; (b) extensive male and female humor resulting from this basic conceit; and (c) some names (including Viola and Duke). <br /> <br /> In addition to these names, thematic common features (a & b) are really great themes for each script, and the script for this movie is no exception. In addition, it is really simply a wonderful and very modern / traditional teen movie. And this is a totally legitimate genre, even though the highbrows have to find an apology to enjoy it ... like a mention of Shakespeare. The film is clear, fast, emotional, stylized, funny ... full of teenage hormones and teenage humor and male / female humor suitable for all ages. And that's really the best part of IMHO: really just about every male stereotype and every female stereotype is shown in spectacularly attractive entertainment. Those stereotypes are tirelessly, but lovingly parodied, with the complexity of the invention, that I'm still a little confused ... but in fact, I don't feel disappointed at all, it's not such a movie: things come to you fast and fun and you get laughter and moans and then go to the next split that is taking place. Amanda Bynes is really beautiful as Viola / Sebastian; Channing Tatum is a great duke; David Cross is great over the top of Principal Gold. All acting and characterization were all right and on target. The camera was excellent. <br /> <br /> Wonderful fun from start to finish ... check it out!
