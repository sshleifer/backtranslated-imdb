This movie has had a lot of ups and downs ... The story is strong while telling the saga of Ma 'Barker growing up, and then her misfortune with the boys and the FBI. in public enemies. Director Mark L. Lester, while not as good as in "Commando 85 is still very interesting." Eric Roberts, plays a short-lived part as a guard, turned thieves (and Ma's Lover) Alyssa Milano plays a prostitute who hangs with the gang, so to speak ... I was confused, biased and biased, throughout this movie .. So I'm wondering what movie all these others who voted so low watched ! .. For all those who were interested .. Mmm FBI was actually so bad at the beginning, he didn't have tommy weapons like outlaws, and they were so downright whenever they got into a gunfire with the gang of that time. For years, I felt that it was more realistic than many other films that displayed this era ... It is how it can happen that it becomes a train wreck Atch, but JUST have too .. Enjoy !! !
