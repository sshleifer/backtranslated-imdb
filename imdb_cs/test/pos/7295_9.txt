One of the IMDb discussion forums had two women who talked about Colin Firth watching the movie just for him. Apparently it was two young women; But what struck me is how little this film will appreciate in general. Brilliant and I think the brilliant performance of Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange has barely noticed not only the audience, but the academy and most critics. I think I know why. First, the conspiracy - or just the setting - is the kind of bastardization of Shakespeare King Lear with the dying, crazy patriarch and the three little daughters they inherit. Their names even start with the same letters, Regan, Goneril and Cordelia - Rose, Ginny and Caroline. And I think "Larry" (Jason Robards) works for "Lear". The obvious idea Jane Smiley had presented in the Pulitzer Prize novel was to tell a story similar to Lear from the point of view of her daughter girls and tell him that it was a realistic late twentieth-century way that Bard didn't consider. The problem is in the story of Smiley and Moorhouse that the two older daughters are very human with strong and weak points, while the father is the most contemptuous without having a significant effect on redeeming qualities. His only strength was his ability to achieve the financial success of the farm; But we can even compromise that since his father and grandfather built a farm in front of him and he inherited it. The second problem - and that's the one I can't personally confirm, didn't read Smiley's novel - that the film is just a limited and partial interpretation of this novel. Yet it is almost always true that a great novel, especially long and ambitious with many psychological nuances, cannot be faithfully transferred to the screen. The vision and sound requirements of the film emerge from the subtlety of narration, while time constraints do not allow the full development of the character and motivation achieved by the novelist. With regard to five or six hours, Moorhouse might have made the film more consistent with Smiley's novel. The third problem is one that is perhaps Moorhouse itself. She began her directorial career with the very well done film Aussie Proof (1991) starring Russell Crow. It followed with How to Create an American Blanket (1995) that celebrated women, especially women of a certain age. However, it was a bit hard and clear and definitely a cub. In a sense, there is a thousand acres from there, which shows us not only the view of women, but also in a way that may seem politically motivated for them. Apparently, Larry Cook is a bad, bad dad. He defeated his daughters and knew about them. He drove the household with an iron fist. Jess (Colin Firth's character) seduces the inexperienced Ginny and breaks her heart for nothing more than a little fun to appear. And then she goes to Rose, who is clearly the power behind the new property, and joins her while her husband is forced to end his life in a drunken accident. The rest of the men are a one-dimensional character with no nuance, the way they often appear in novel novels. I think most viewers have been postponed by a severe incest disability, adultery, and sexual betrayal that has been implicated in the story. I said critics and the public were bad. I think the direction was biased against men, but it must have been in this story. I think Moorhouse did a great job of making an emotional and engaging film about family dynamics that wasn't very beautiful. And the actions of Pfeiffer and Lange were nothing less than sensational. They seemed to feed each other in a way that I thought was absolutely authentic and deeply moving. Especially Pfeiffer was impressive as she projected her bent anger and hatred. The way Moorhouse allowed her to be gradually revealed is a tribute to her ability as a director and to Pfeiffer's outstanding performance. And the skill with which Moorhouse led the change of Ginny's character when she went from "ninny" as she called herself, with someone who was aware of herself and understandable bitterness, was also excellent. The fact that she left her husband was as shameful as anything else. He needed to get her and forgive her and bring her back. And Robards in his intensity and madness was also very good. I suppose this movie, which bombed theaters, will be better appreciated in the coming years when people see it on DVD. My question is, what happened to Moorhouse? Her talent is obvious, but she still has her fourth feature film. When he does, I hope he will remember to go with what he believes, but to be fair. In fact, I think she was fair to the two leading figures in this movie, but she didn't pay enough attention to the others. In addition to an unnuanced father, Caroline Carolina's Jennifer Jason Leigh was unfinished, so we wondered why she did some of the things she did. The couple needed to be more than dummies. They had to be involved and involved.
