This short is one of the best of all time and is proof (like most of Charlie Chaplin's work) that sound and color are not demands for quality work. In fact, this caricature uses (and may have started) some of the gags and devices that have become standard in animation in later years, such as personality cartoons (including Chaplin's above. While characters are silent, they do "talking"), using verbal Balloons as well as in comics because Felix started out in the newspaper like a comic, this device is natural, the atmosphere and style of the short is absolutely harmonious with the atmosphere of comics and adds more. Dimension (literally and figuratively) and this short pleasure looks, it's worth taking the time and effort to get you.
