Joan Cusack steals the show! The assumption is good, an interesting line of land, and the script was fine. Tad too simplistic in that the rising gay story was so positive when it is usually not so positive. Then it's fiction again. :) All in all a fun romp. One thing I noticed was the "inner joke" aspect. Since the target audience was probably direct, they may not get homosexual "things" into the context of the story. Kevin Kline has shown an aspect of his prowess that screenwriters sometimes do not consider when designing Kline for a part. <br /> <br /> This hit the mark.
