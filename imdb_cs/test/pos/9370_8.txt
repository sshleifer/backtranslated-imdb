"Crossfire" feels like an underdeveloped masterpiece - it is well and beautifully filmed, but closely written and too short. It is just a decent police procedure alluding to film noir (in its zenith in 1947) and social commentaries (at that time also trends) that fit well. Today he remembers it as one of the first two Hollywood films dealing with anti-Semitism and is much better than a similarly thematic "gentlemen's agreement" (no average performance). But his real theme is the difficulty that World War II soldiers had as trained killers who switched to civilian life. (For more gentle on this subject, try "Best Years of Our Lives.") The man is defeated to death in the first few shots of the film. We can't see his attacker. The film is about investigating this murder, which is actually quite straightforward, but it requires some unnecessary detours, like when a major suspect, depressed soldier, ends up in Gloria Grahame's apartment, a hooker ballroom with a really weird pimp played by Paul Kelly. There is also a civic lecture in the middle of the film, which slows down the procedure to crawl, and the end is tidy enough for a police show. But otherwise it's a pretty decent secret. What was this great noir? Director Edward Dmytryk dropped several hints on the subject of the original novel - homosexuality, not anti-Semitism - as when the sadistic creep Monty points to a picture of his friend Mitch, who talks to a strange man in a bar. And the cast is excellent. Robert Ryan does for a very trustworthy Crete, and even becomes a little compassionate in his final scenes, not unlike Peter Lorre as a child killer in "M." He deserved an Oscar, but that year he lost to Edmund Gwenn (you can't beat Santa Claus). Robert Mitchum is an onhand as a friend of a soldier's accused murderer. Was Mitchum a great actor or big star? Someone else can find out, but his sleepy eyes and confused half-smile work very well here because they suggest his character knows something that everyone else doesn't have. (And he does it.) And Robert Young, as a detective assigned to murder, is surprisingly bold when he discards his usual auncular favor even if he has to bring civil rights preaching in the middle of the picture. There is no doubt that Bogart or Tracy would be brilliant in this role, but neither of them was in RKO in 1947, so you will have to deal with Dr. Welby. Yet Young is good enough to want him thrown into a detective drama instead of "Father Knows Best" who hated him and who led him to alcoholism and suicide attempts. The man deserved better than smarm and Sanka.
