Dakota Incident is curiosity for several reasons. It will be clear from the beginning that it was long before anyone thought of political correctness. Although the character of Ward Bond softens the edge with "maybe we can communicate with them, after all, there are also people", the type of dialogue. Part of it stands side by side and the preacher tries to communicate with the Martians in the War of the Worlds. In fact, it's mysterious. The name is also curious. The use of the word "Incident" contributes to the meaning and sophistication of the film, which probably did not hurt the boxoffice. Linda Darnell's diverse assortment of characters and fantasies and caps are wonderful dates that make Dakota Incident a cool mid-1950s western artifact.
