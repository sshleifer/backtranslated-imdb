I like this show. His refreshing take over some older science fiction feelings and styles. they are not afraid to shoot, and when they make people tend to die. Too many shows are afraid of it and ending up on guns and then postponing. Farscape also comes with plenty of pleasing characters. They all grow up on you until they confuse you to hear them discuss that some of those animatronic ones will make a mini-series. From start to finish, Farscape leaves you feeling hopeful and distracted, as new and unexpected things happen, and then people live and die, they always surprise you. It's worth watching, even if you don't have time.
