I'm crying for a lot of movies. Call me sentimental. Call me one of those viewers who always like to see a happy ending. This movie, though it has a sad ending, was great! Of all the actors I would like to dine with, it would be Sidney Poitier. His performance, along with John Cassavetes and Jack Warden (of the 12 angry men's fame) is stellar. His character, who befriends a man on the run (Cassavetes) and helps him in every possible direction, is incredible. This is another of those forgotten noir that came out at the end of the Noir era. It's well done, has excellent cast, extremely talented acting and great cinematography. It's a movie that's worth watching over and over again. I highly recommend this! This is just another really great movie that Mr. Poitier made and should be sold on DVD. Though I screamed, kudos to such great art!
