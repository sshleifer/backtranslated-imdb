This film should go as one of the most entertaining movies in history. His Mighty Wind cousins, Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman are great at their own right, but Best in Show is a cake. <br /> <br /> A film about dog idiosyncrasies that show their dogs competitively, it's the complexity of characters that make it so good. After seeing the film about 75 times, I came to the conclusion that there is no weak character or actor in this film. There is very little interaction between some "bands" of the characters but it only seems to add to the beauty of the film. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie again and find it as fun to charge as you watch it again. When I first saw it, I thought it was real, but not very cheerful. It's a movie that grows on you. Definitely a movie that you find yourself quoting frequently. <br /> <br /> Characters: Hamilton and Meg Swan: + If you get a DVD, see how these characters were "born" amazing that these two could hit the head. And to find out that they did not actually go through the script and did it in some way. Gerry and Cookie Guggleman: Cookie is especially funny and makes a fantastic job in selling Cookie character. Gerry (Eugene Levy) brings his standard star performance to the cheerful dissatisfied type of weaker half. Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donalan-A + Find me a more fun character than Scott Donalan, I DARE YOU! He will forever be posted as this character for me because he was so natural and did not look forced at any point. Stefan (Micheal McKean) was also very good and together (and with a short performance with the Gugglemans) are going to show why he is always in these movies. Big actor with a razor as a joke. Harlan Pepper-B +, I don't want to make it look funny, but it's definitely the only solo action that can't be as fun as everyone else. above. He uses the dog more than others and has some other idiosyncrasies for him. The rest is also great, there is no weak character. Check out this movie at least twice. Buy, you won't regret it.
