I didn't really see this. Roy Andersson let me out, I'm the perfect fool for a static camera (the long-lived King Borowczyk!) And I hysterically laughed for the first fifteen minutes of the movie, hit me right between the eyes. You have to be a brilliant man to be happy. Andersson reminds me of a third friend at Pequod in Moby Dick, Ba≈àka, a man who took his life for a practical joke that a good master plays on us. And the web of egoism in this film is really cheerful. The level of satire is at the height of fever, you have one deceptive self-confident dreamer of harp about the cruelty of the world and then completely ignore the spiritual self-reflection calling in agony. The depths of egoism itself are installed. I never really thought it would be possible to go further than Bergman's "Silence" in this regard. However, the grotesqueness of self-love and self-esteem by each individual character in this film is overwhelming. We are shown the existence of a talented and inactive railing against a world that he believes to be unfair to them is truly a legend in his own living quarters. Human beings in this film make self-deception and a great art deceit! Only one woman in the movie seems to have some sort of understanding of what's going on. The old woman, who refuses to leave the chapel, knelt and prayed for the forgiveness of all mankind, her speech the most electrifying condemnation of the modern world I have ever heard. With his prayers, he reveals that what is wrong with the world is not to be corrected by merely absorbing, there are not only a few mistakes, there is a gap in corruption that can only be corrected by forgetfulness and judgment. Watching this film plunged me into the mind of a naked monk, standing at midnight in a deep cold river, shouting a thousand Kyrie's eleison for the sins of mankind. Another great thing is that it is clear that her prayers are in vain, and in fact she stops everyone who returns home at closing time. It is not a smug movie, no one is spared, there are no idols left on the altar, no group of people is bothered by the fame of another group. There has never been a greater transcendent, more wonderful summary of our sins. It's a movie for the end of the world, it's a big joke, a big, nasty practical joke of human life! <br /> <br /> It's too hard to choose a favorite from the paintings catalog, I knocked down my thigh and almost fell off a chair in the cinema, screaming with laughter as one tried to pull the tablecloth off. set up a service. I won't spoil what happens, but tension builds up and something really unexpected. It's probably the funniest thing I've ever seen in a movie theater. I'm quite reserved and I just couldn't control myself: that's the size of this movie. <br /> <br /> Shooting "You, the Living" is perfectly formal. We showed a palette of artist, dirty brown, yellow, gray and sky blues alive with the shock of light brass textures. There's never a tone, it's like an hour and a half of a symphonic Whistler color field. The obsession that had to go to make this color scheme work is extraordinary. And no picture is useless, as with all great movies, there's no cellulose centimeter. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best movie I've ever seen.
