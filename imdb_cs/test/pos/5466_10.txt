Great story with supernatural acting performance. The warmth and insight into who Joad represents is withdrawn from the screen and into the viewer's heart. Excellence Barbara Hershey has also made Mad Madonna's frustration and tenacity in her quest to do HIS work until her final breath. The intertwining of Joad and Madalyn's personalities has grown throughout the story with a breathtaking crescendo in the final scene.
