Even the movie trailer makes me cry like the first time I saw this movie. Not for people who are easily excited by intense material! The finest performance by Alan Rickman and Madelaine Stowe, without a doubt. This terrible story of a society with the power to kidnap and torture citizens for whatever reason, whether they are anarchists or children's book writers, will cripple you into bones. I saw it when it first came out in 1991 and I remember every picture. She scares me today. It's happening now. It seems that IMDb requires ten lines to meet the criteria for a film review. IMDb may want GET AND GRIP! Some of us are a little more brief about writing opinions.
