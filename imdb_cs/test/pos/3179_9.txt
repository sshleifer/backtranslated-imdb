That was a great show ... I don't remember much about it, but I remember watching and love it. I remember my mother and father. I love Grandma. She was like a grandmother you couldn't appreciate until she became an adult. She was very knowledgeable and nonsense. My favorite song at the show was in Sardines in the morning. (it may not be a name) I remember after seeing the show and hearing that song that I went to Cleveland Ohio to visit my cousin and me and my sister singing that song so much that when we left all my little cousins ​​to sing as well. I would also like to put it on DVD.
