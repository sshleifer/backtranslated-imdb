Such a pity that this beautiful little patch on the canvas had such a talent in writers and actors, such a beautiful scenery that was the ultimate escape for those who were in a country locked up by the state, sunless. Many actors continued to do more ... another indicator that unfortunately something was lost. At that time I lived in Columbus, Ohio, with all my (now former) husband a very large family in the NO NO !! every time it was taken over by the broadcast baseball game. Someone who wrote here was against 'Rosanne' ... all my ex and I noticed that it was always always preceded by BASEBALL !!!! Yes, FOX really missed something amazing that one and nothing was equal to ~! Thank you for your memories.
