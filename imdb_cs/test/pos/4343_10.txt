This classic has so many great one-liners and unintentionally cheerful scenes that I don't even know where to start. If you want advice on dating, it's here. Simply ignore the person you want and then climb out of the classic lines, such as "Chicken is good ... I love chicken", and before you learn, you'll have a one-storey room in the basement (it's a NICE cellar) with a woman which is 35 years younger than you. Bronson does it all in this movie. He buys a car for no good reason just to murder two gang members ... to pay "CASH" ...... chunnng .... He buys ice cream, simply because "this is America, not" it " , and wasting someone named "giggling - he laughs when he runs" is just because he stole his camera. By the way, this "giggling" is so fast that Bronson's regular pistol can't even catch up with him, he needs to order a special just to he gets to clean up just so he can eat really stinky food (stuffed with cabbage) trapped in rats with a couple of old people who like to wear heavy clothes in 90 degrees of weather. that he always finds a bar when he needs it (and the same thing!) And last but not least he seems to always have a rocket launcher just in case he needs to blow older brother Chuck Richie Cunningham, who is now being pulled out Anyway, it will make sense once you see this classic ... all I can say is enjoy! "I owe you one DUDE"
