It is a charming little film that, like many of its kindness, derives its magic from circumstances rather than from the dialogue itself. Glenn Ford (as always) shines through a great comedy performance penniless Air Force officer, married after just one day for the gold-digging showgirl Debbie Reynolds. After one initial wedding night of passion and life changing movement to Spain, the two quickly realize that unlike the strong sexual attraction they feel for themselves, it has nothing at all to do. But when he decides to release his marriage, it is only with the knowledge that it takes only one month of probation and sex is definitely not on the cards.

His potential buyer is also causing him trouble because he is a disgustingly handsome Spanish nobleman interested in the car, leading to a stronger interest in Ford's wife, which is even worse by offering a rich lifestyle and it is what she was trying to do. long. With Ford's sexual frustration and jealousy in his love, he competes with the montage, along with Reynolds's materialistic attitude and flirtatious behavior around the lover's Spaniard, who has served to drive the wedge deeper between the two, their The relationship of faith is <br /> <br /> But let the love and attraction that these two love birds fit first, shine through and keep them together? It's not the best example of this movie genre, but due to observable performances according to its principles and a fun plot, it's certainly good.
