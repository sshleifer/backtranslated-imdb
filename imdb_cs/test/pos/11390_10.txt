The small town that works in the big city becomes a huge star and then spiral out of control. It shows you a rise to fame and then a fall from fame and back to a little rise. Great cast of actors and great director = great, great movie called Boogie Nights. P.T Anderson. Amazing director who made Boogie Nights amazing. From the moment the movie starts to the moment it ends, you can feel how beautiful this movie is. Some scenes are breathtaking, literally. Great story, great movie. Mark Whalberg was fantastic, Philip Seymour Hoffman was amazing because he is in everything. Thomas Jane was also magnificent and although he had only a small part, he played it perfectly. There is one scene in this movie I can't get through, "The Drug Deal Gone Bad Scene" it was awesome music acting and cinematography combined to make it amazing. I haven't seen Boogie Nights and thank God I did it, it's so well rounded up and now I'm a huge PTA fan (Paul Thomas Anderson). <br /> <br /> Do everything you need to do and watch this movie.
