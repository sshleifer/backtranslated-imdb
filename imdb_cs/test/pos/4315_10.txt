The show begins with the ship. Desmond was me. Then they tried to save Walt. And Lock stuff that button pushes is a big joke while Desmond found out that hes the one who crashed the plane. Eco tries to open the door that Jhon has locked him, and Charlie helped him find Bomb. While Sayid and Jack's plan is, Sasyid is finding others first and finding out who and what others are. And find out if they are armed and have some weapons. Micheal takes Jack, Swayer, Kate and Hugo into a trap. And they get caught. There were more questions than answers after the show, but what makes the show great. And you can't wait until the 3rd season
