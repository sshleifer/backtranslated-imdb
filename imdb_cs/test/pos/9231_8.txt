221 episodes of "The Lone Ranger" were originally aired on ABC from 1949 to 1957; and then for many years played in local syndication. For most of the original broadcast years of the series, ABC was the most watched piece of programming. The new Pop Flix DVD set includes the first 16 episodes (September 15-29, 1949) and for some reason I don't know episode 22 of season 5, a total of 17 episodes (same 17 available on last year's release of Mill Creek Entertainment, so they are probably in the public domain). These sets largely portray the film "Legend of the Lone Ranger" superfluous, since all three episodes that were combined in 1952 into a film are part of these versions. <br /> <br /> Initial episodes are returning to the radio because much more voice narration is used as an introduction. The series itself was a pure children's western with clear and evil differences and no romance. The title character (played by Clayton Moore) started by Texas Ranger John Reid. The first three episodes provide a background for his conversion to the Lone Ranger status, his partnership with Indian Tonto (Jay Silverheels), and the taming of his horse "Silver". There is an unambiguous code of positive morality infusing each episode. The lone Ranger is absolutely good, but accepts the evil blow. While the masked man in the west was normally afraid of good citizens, and the Indian was distrustful, the Lone Ranger is afraid of those who would do evil. One of the persistent topics is that when Lone Ranger and Tonto first meet an average citizen, they are trapped with suspicion, and by the end of the episode the citizen is convinced of their value. The end of the mark was a secondary sign that asked, "Who was the masked man?" <br /> <br /> To really enjoy the show, you have to accept it for the simplistic story of morality that should have been. If you don't take it seriously and want some self-thought stone parody, you will only be frustrated. Then again, what do I know? I'm just a child.
