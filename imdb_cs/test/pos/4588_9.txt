Idiotism Mike Judge is an interesting movie that his fans will undoubtedly track down and see. Before I start the review, I would say that if I had a chance to see it, it certainly is, because it's worth watching, and it's not the easiest movie in the world to watch. Let's start with the premise - Luke Wilson is a private Joe Bauers, an army librarian who is considered to have absolutely no extraordinary qualities or glaring defects, making him absolutely average in every way. This, along with the lack of living relatives, makes him an excellent candidate for an experimental cryogenic procedure. Also frozen with Joe is a prostitute named Rita, who was prepared by Upgrayedd, her coarse pimp. Unfortunately, a few days after being frozen, the top secret project is abandoned and forgotten. Recently, everyone on Earth is just a little more intelligent than a chimpanzee. The way "every" Joe Bauers talks is considered "faggy", just as someone who talks like Shakespeare would mock now, and a former professional wrestler is the president of the United States (actually, this is probably not so ugly) really). The best show on TV is called "Ow! My Balls!", Which sounds pretty good, and not only is everything written wrong, but there appear to be characters at the end. End. It's a funny assumption for a movie, but this is a problem - In addition to the original assumption, not so much in the movie is really funny. I mean, thoughts that come to mind from reading the film's premise are about as funny as the movie itself. Obviously, it's not terrible, but it might be more fun. There are some winners in the script, such as Starbucks, who now offer "happy endings", and people who put their blind faith in universally misunderstood "electrolytes" but are only too little and far away, so if you will not laugh hysterically every time one of the future idiots rips a murder that is angry, blasphemous, unconscious, with little to no logic and / or intelligence, then laughter can be quite well distributed. It's unfair for everyone to compare it to Office Space because it's a very different movie, but as a movie, no matter what it came to it, Idiocracy is a humorous concept that is likely to be in an interview 15-20 minutes laughing much more than the rest of the movie. I give it 5 out of 10 because it's nice but not. She doesn't do enough to lift him above the middle of the road.
