It's just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3. Now, 4th in the series, which in my opinion is the best of the series. Jennifer Tilly was great in this movie. For dolls, they were better than a few actors who come to mind (Freddie Prince Jr, for one) and more fun than the many comedies I have seen in the past. The story wasn't big, but I didn't really care. You just have to see Chucky and Tiffany's bickering and fight each other. And the end leaves open for the 5th sequel (which I hear is in the works). Idle Hands premiere next week and it looks like there is another horror / comedy but I doubt it will be the pinnacle of this.
