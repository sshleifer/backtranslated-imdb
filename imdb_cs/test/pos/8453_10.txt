TV newsletter Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her radical cameraman Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) are in a nuclear power plant when a serious accident occurs. Race leaders play it, but Adams did it all. Wells and Adams are trying to get it in the air, but the corporation running the plant is preventing it. Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) is aware of serious problems and tests have been falsified. They're trying to make managers trust him - they know. Wells, Adams, and Godell found that all their lives were in danger. I saw it in the cinema in 1979. I was only 17 and it terribly scared me. To make matters worse, there was an accident on Three Mile Island around this time, so the film was all the more real. When I see it 20 years later, it doesn't frighten me, but it's still a great movie - it works like a mystery, a rough drama and a nuclear power exposition. Fonda (with red hair) has one of his best roles as Wells - perfectly expresses the growing suspicion and horror of his character when he realizes that a nuclear disaster might happen. Lemmon is (as always) excellent. He starts believing in his company and work, and slowly begins to fade as he begins to look for things. For that he was rightly nominated for an Oscar. Douglas is good, but has a small part and is totally overshadowed by Lemmon and the Fonda. A really great movie - one of the best 70s. Don't Miss This!
