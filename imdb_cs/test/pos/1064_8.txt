Make sure this wonderful comedy part of your holiday season! If you admire Dennis Morgan or Barbara Stanwyck, this movie is fun. They really work well together, as you would see in this movie. The whole cast was very fun. Since I'm a Dennis Morgan fan, this movie was a real experience! But ... everyone can enjoy it! Recommended!
