I love this movie because every element of it is nothing less than excellent. I quickly praise a few of them. Peter O'Toole gives us one of his great performances when he becomes the ultimate Mr. Chips. Petula Clark, she has a beautiful voice and is perfect as Katarina. The director was able to bring the story to the screen in a new way. Combine it with fantastic and creative cinema, editing, writing, etc. And you have a movie that shows the quality of its production. I cannot praise the well-planned work of the camera, move us up and up, zoom in and out, give us the best views, and allow sites to become part of the scene. Petula Clark's last song, 'YOU AND I', is just 3 beautifully lengthy longs, and in this era of 2 seconds I can appreciate the special care that everyone involved had to give to the long scenes. Music is great and the songs move the story as they should. Leslie Bricusse is one of my favorite composers. Listen to these songs, how wouldn't someone like them? This is a very romantic story between two middle-aged people who find each other, bringing the best to themselves and ending up to the end of their lives. Excellent production values, acting, camera work and music, this film is worth watching.
