I think I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, it had a good cast, an interesting story, and a lot of other things that went on, but I still couldn't shake the feeling of fear in my stomach, what would it be . I am glad to say that I was very pleased with the result and I regret that I have taken care of it all the time. The films that started the scenes were extremely interesting and were enough to show interest in the film. As the film continued, we were familiar with the characters of the film and with what happened in the prison riots. Like most reviews for this movie, I have to admit that there are some unessecary clich√©s, but it can't erase the overall power of this movie that reads like a good novel. The cast is all great, especially Chestnut and McGowan, and the film is one of the better films of the year. Certainly worth watching if you're looking for a good courtroom drama.
