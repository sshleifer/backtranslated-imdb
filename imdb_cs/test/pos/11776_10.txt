Fourteen Most Fun Celluloid Minutes. This short parody is at least as big a part of the Star Wars saga as Phantom Menace and much more fun when you ask me. Hardware wars were the first in a long line of SW spoofs that today form their own subgenre. I hate to describe too much - it's so short that the assumption is just about the whole thing. Suffice it to say that many of the most popular and well-known aspects of Star Wars have enjoyed them. Household appliances, such as toasters and vacuum cleaners, depict spacecraft and robots, Princess Anne-Droid's figure carries real pastries instead of famous braided hair spools, and Fluke Starbucker is much more than its original, if possible. Ernie Fosselius is one crazy son-of-a-buck-he is also a source of Porklips Now, Apocalypse Now spoof.
