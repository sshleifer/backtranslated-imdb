I have nothing but praise for this film and cast, especially Ann Margaret. But more importantly, I praise my in-law who were (are) adoptive parents of Warren and Frank in real life. I met most of the "children" at Warren's wedding in 1989. This is an amazing story and is even more incredible to me when I know a family and what they have all gone through. It is so nice to see how my laws were depicted in the film. It was quite accurate. My wife even enjoys little details like a toaster that she remembered from her childhood. Yes, it's hard to watch, but so wonderful and cordial. The beauty of this story is for me how many children have passed through my lives in law and as a result of marrying my daughter and having Warren as a brother-in-law, how much I have met in my. For the past 20 years, this story has been a part of my life because it was my mother-in-law with me. This and the knowledge of Warren. For what's worth, Warren lives with his family in California. He married his high school darling, who he teamed up with at his 20 year reunion college. There was a show in the 1980s called "It's Unbelievable." T They had a family meeting that also had to meet the cast of the show. For some, DVD is available in the UK and Australia. It's a hard video coming up in the United States, and I haven't found a DVD here yet.
