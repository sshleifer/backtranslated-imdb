I really enjoyed this movie. For one it did not have the special effects that great budgets movies. Playing was decent in this, only you can say right away the bat that is dubbed, but once you get through this fact and that you can't switch the languages ​​on the DVD version it's cool. The plot line was very unique, you take the situation as a warm wave very common around the world, especially in Frankfurt, where I have been to many times, and you take a garbage strike that happens quite often in this country and you have a catastrophe recipe . I loved how the hordes of rats went everywhere and how the idea that if you picked up trash, that's the last thing you want to do, you take it, the rats don't get what they want, they basically pick the following trash, so to ask well if garbage men are on strike who pick up trash, private contractors, like the army wants quarantine out of town oops the wrong thing to do, then you should take all the rats to take the city, then throw the mayor who wants to keep the lid on the budget, and The line of her pockets, you have a realistic movie, and the female leadership is also pleased to watch the screen, a very decent movie I thought I wish more was made like this, another little nitpick is showing Frankfurt could be done a little better, but for the average viewer, which was never in Frankfurt ... I was born in Germany and was in Frankfurt many times. It matters, but there is a big big thumbs up in all of them.
