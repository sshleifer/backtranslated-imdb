I've never seen a Bollywood movie before, but I caught the first ten minutes of this, I laughed stupidly and press R on Sky +. I'm glad I did it! I hope I will not offend anyone (because basically I have BF and I loved it!), But we couldn't take it half as seriously as the actors did - especially obsessed (who, I mean, it's a huge Bollywood star because we saw it on the cover of a lot of DVDs and since then I've seen his doll in Hamleys! BF goes on this stupid guy - I'm beginning to think HE'S is obsessed! traditionally good looking who's anti-movie hero, but then we like movies that are not your stock predictable Hollywood fare). <br /> <br /> It was on top, but really good fun. If all Bollywood movies are such, then we are looking more. All week I had this bloom song and I can't talk about Hindi! PS any recommendations would be appreciated!
