At that time there was nothing like that on TV and it would probably never be. From the first picture of the police light that blinded you and from there you heard the words: "Police unit - in color", you were schocked to see that it was by no means an ordinary sitcom. Kill the "Guest Star" and then never find him where you saw it before. Then the real show started and if you didn't pay attention, you would leave some jokes in the background. Do not add too much attention to one thing or apologize. This was a demonstration that VCRs were made before they were married to children or The Simpsons. Stories in no way made sense, and the dialogue was sometimes so strange that you had to think about it 5 minutes before he realized it was a joke. Characters Frank Drebin and Ed Hocken came straight from Dragnet and were absolutely equal (no funny accents or expressions), but instead there were puns and twisted sentences played totally dead. Just once, as I recall, there was a segment that was played for silly laughs - a scene involving a path to the dentist, sucking and lots of saliva. Johnny and some celebrities. That was exactly one joke, but they had to use it in all six episodes. Oh, good. Everything can't be perfect. Importantly, the rest of the time you were deep in the tears of laughter. Leslie Nielsen was fortunate enough to revive his career when he put Frank Drebin in three roles, but he must also have been an Achilles heel. Do you remember seeing him in anything other than Naked Gun? And don't count the terrible Mr. Magoo redesigned for live action. But he probably made a lot of money.
