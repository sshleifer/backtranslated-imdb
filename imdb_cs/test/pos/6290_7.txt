Despite myself, I'm really a bit like this movie. Pauley Shore is always ridiculously laughing, and there's no exception. It's just great to play the winner with a heart of gold. His performance in this, although not unusual for him, is so good, he seems to pick up the performance of the other members. Maybe it's because it's the kind of guy that can be easily bounced. The clich√©s about life in the country in this film are merry and the way Shore's "urban boy" is crawling in such a way as to live is also funny, but it's not just him who is a fish from water; comedy also derives from the fact that to any "common" man or people, Crawl is a scary nightmare of a person. That's why this film works so well: we love Crawl, it's the breath of fresh air, but we can also sympathize with the Warners. It is one of the hellish cultural shocks. Although this film is a classic Pauley Shore, there is no need for much energy from the brain to enjoy the movie, enjoy it and even "never judge the book it's cover" type moral here somewhere. "It's not bad, bad at all.
