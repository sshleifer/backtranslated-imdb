I loved this movie and tried to get it for years. It's just not available, and it hasn't been on television for many years. I liked it and the songs because it had something else that was said and made you think how each person looks at something from different angles. We also often do not feel something we have until it is there. My 12-year-old daughter just discovers music and is excited about some songs. One day I hope to get a copy of the movie so that she can see it. (Oh, I'd love to see it again!) <br /> <br />
