For his last film, John Huston directed his daughter, Anjelica, in this story adaptation from James Joyce's "Dubliners", and he gave us one of his best achievements to remember him. Joyce is probably just as impossible to film as anybody else, but "The Dead" is at least a traditional story to be worked on. Much (indeed almost all) important information in the story lies in the gaps between the lines, thoughts and expressions of characters - there are great moments, but they are cerebral - they are not things of which movies. But somehow, Huston can do it, and he can handle almost flawless adaptation. Anjelica is beautiful and the movie is scary and powerful. <br /> <br /> Level: A
