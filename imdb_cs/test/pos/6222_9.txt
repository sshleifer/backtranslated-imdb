A wonderful film in the best Scandinavian eldritch magical tradition, with a very far-sighted analysis of the many great problems we are just beginning to face. <br /> <br /> It should be a mandatory display for all policies. Choose from privacy, nuclear sustainability, global climate change, quality of life. Reminiscent of Thoreaus' Walden, but with a modern twist, and considerable humor. I'm not Finnish, even though I traveled there and I have good Finnish friends, but I found it completely accessible and also culturally informative.
