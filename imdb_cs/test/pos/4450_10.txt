I've seen this movie five times and I never enjoy it. This features a trace of the "giallo" genre, but also with the vivid Italian rural environment, where ignorance and superstition are more deadly than any serial killer. With an excellent location (sometimes reminiscent of Fellini, sometimes Taviani brothers), good characterization and some of the best genre actors (including the great Thomas Milian and Ida Lupino in an unforgettable role), it's NOT a Euro-basket, just a masterpiece to be discovered after generation (recently received a huge acclaim at the Cinematheque in Paris on a double tribute to Lucio Fulci)
