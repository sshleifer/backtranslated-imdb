This is the hardest movie I've ever seen ... emotional content is terrible but memorable. A woman accused of being a political activist is brought to questioning. The whole film revolves around her interrogation. Alan Rickman and Madeline Stowe have strong and intense roles for which they deserve Oscars for their performances.
