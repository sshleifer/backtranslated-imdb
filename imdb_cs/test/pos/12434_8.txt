Decameron Nights! otherwise it may or may not be, there is no place for carefully nurtured girls! "Yes, the Ministry of Education has made a terrible mistake. Nutbourne is a school for boys.

There are 100 young girls and 170 young boys who are to be fed and found sleeping places (along with all their teachers). But the chicks are on the cooking tasks. "Come on, Angela," she told a girl who was trying to break something in a big pot, "you didn't make a porridge before?" "Yes, but no one had to eat it." , my dear. It is hard to do things well when Pond discovers four school governors that he hopes will lead them to come at any moment to see how well they are doing And Miss Whitchurch found that four wealthy and influential parents had just come to find out how their daughters were doing free of charge in the new boy, they were told - the facility - the only solution - Miss Whitchurch and Pond, their teachers and their students, invent Divided classes to give a hint that Nutbourne has no girls and that St. Swithen has no boys.After the parents check the dorm and go to the classroom, the girls in the duck beds and the boys who were hiding under the jump, into the beds, as governors walk in.

They wrote, produced and directed, sometimes making one, sometimes another. Either way, they were responsible for such first-class films as Green for Danger (with Sim's dramatic performance), I See the Dark Stranger, The Lady Vanishes, Night Train to Munich, Wee Geordie, Belles of St. Trinian's, The Rake's Progress and many more. With the happiest days of his life, Launder wrote and directed while both produced. It's one of their best.
