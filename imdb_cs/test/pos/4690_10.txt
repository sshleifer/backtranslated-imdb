Used to track when I was very small, then used to watch videos. Now I watch the DVD, I love it. Ray Winston is 'The Dude', the rest of the cast is good and even with the change of Robin Hood it all works. Big stories, twists and the way she was filmed - on an untrained eye (not on being my training) can be interpreted as ropes, but at the same time contribute to the absorption of films by viewers. With green slopes and contrast of lush sunny illuminated forest dark corridors and dungeon castles - It's great. Personally definitive interpretation of Robin Hood legend. I can't emphasize how much I think you should watch it, if you have a chance, then YOU MUST SEARCH IT.
