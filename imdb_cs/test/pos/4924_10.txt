Although not the first movie I bought for myself, it's almost certainly the one I watched the most. The animation is well-drawn by experts on the Tokyo film Shinsa, and animators often used clever techniques such as having the sun cause "lens flares", to have the camera get wet (and have "camera operator hand" to clean it. the film avoided becoming an "animator gadget-fest", thoughtful, but the generous use of these techniques gave the film a much more "realistic" feel than a typical cartoon. The story has many intertwined lands that seem to have a lot to do with each other until everything ends up in a way that even self-effacingly writers admit to be fought. Each of the main lines of the plot has its own musical theme, from "Pop goes weasel" [Hamton & Plucky], to the theme of love from "Romeo and Juliet" [Fifi & Johnny]. The transitions between the plotline are slightly varied but consistent. A really beautiful movie; There is not much original music, although the new lyrics on "Spinning Song" are smart and enjoyable. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
