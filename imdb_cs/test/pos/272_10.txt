Stepford's children, besides being very good for a TV movie, shows a very disturbing result to indoctrination. It is quite a statement about how to act within what is considered "good" behavior, can destroy anything that makes a person unique and unique. I think it's a movie that parents who want to keep some semblance of the idea that clay in the hearts and minds of young people should follow with their children and discuss what the film says. I don't know if it was the intention of this film anyway, but I always thought it was one of the best film devices against the desire to have children in line with the unrealistic and domineering pretense of what is in the best interests of anyone other than the children . I hope one day I'll see this movie on DVD. I'm at the starting gate ... waiting.
