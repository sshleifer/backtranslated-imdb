I think Melville intended this film to be a cool definition; it has a cool approach of late '60s / early' 70s thrillers of the same discreet quirkiness. LE CERCLE ROUGE, a bitter and fatalistic story, is also the Delon, Bourvil, Volonté and Montand playgrounds in defining roles. Bourvil is a cop who has three cats and a daily routine in his apartment. Delon's hoodlum. Montand is a sick, unsuccessful cop. Volonté plays the escaped suspect. Of course, LE CERCLE ROUGE is far above the film of robbery; Melville uses his techniques - long words without detailing each step of robbery, etc .. Yet this particular action drama is much better than his other movies ??? And it's very unlikely that it's so much better. The look of LE CERCLE ROUGE is very typical of Melville, very Melvillian. Delon was sharp and cool; Bourvil brings his craft and Montand is perhaps the best part of this film; its performance has unexpected heat. On the other hand, the characters are barely outlined, not more than absolutely necessary, and they are personae. Or masks; but the image is inspired, economic, but suggestive. Another of the films that prove that Delon is a good, very good actor; and the fact that he's not a genius doesn't mean he should be disdained as a fourth actor. He is good, he can bear the proximity of Bourvil and Montand. <br /> <br /> Only ten years. before LE CERCLE ROUGE, Melville did, at the end of the fifties, boring elongated insipid noir pastiche (play himself)? And after only decades, here's, in full form, with this pretty awesome action drama. It's stylistically a success. Before I saw LE CERCLE ROUGE, I wasn't a Melvillian fan; Now I think I'm rather one. LE CERCLE ROUGE is a drama, specifically an action drama, one of the most distinctive genres. Melville scores.
