First, I have to say that I love this movie. It was the first movie I saw from director Michael Haneke, and I was amazed at how good the direction was! Surely Haneke knows how to order actors. What I found is also Haneke's script. At first you saw a woman who is very straightforward and seems to be a good piano teacher and very well loved and respected by everyone in her company. Then you realize that she has a mother who is false and too present in her life. Now you know she's terrified of having emotional problems, but you don't know exactly what. And then you fall into her dark side, but her dark side is just a revelation when a student falls in love with her. She can no longer control herself. The roles are very complicated and difficult to play, but Isabelle Huppert is amazing in her role and deserves the recognition she had at Cannes. Benoit Maginel is also very solid, but a bit of an eclipse of Huppert's performance. <br /> <br /> In this scenario, I found it odd that the character played by Magimel is not very trustworthy. He's too talented! It is rare that a person is a piano virtuoso, but spends most of his time hockey and studying ... He thinks it's a weak point, but just a minor mistake. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie once, so I can't do a complete critic because I didn't analyze the movie. I like what I saw! so i give the movie 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Oh yeah ... as in the end, Haneke showed he really wants to shock his audience. A motivation that doesn't think you need to make movies, but Haneke does it with style and precision, so his film is better than, for example, Baise-Moi. <br /> <br /> Vince
