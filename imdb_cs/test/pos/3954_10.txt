When I saw this movie a few years ago, I was impressed and started to look for it. Nothing to do, not in cinemas, DVDs or Blue ray. Absolutely nothing !!! How can that really happen? The direction is IMPECCABLE, the story is interesting and it was shot in a very original way, how music is perfect and James Franco is hot as hell !!! Please release this masterpiece and let it have a good life !!!!!!!!!! This is a really great movie that people should see and deserve another chance !!!!!! Edvard
