Heath Ledgers, working in this movie, really beats me, but overall it's a great watch. Bryan Brown is excellent when I don't like him normally, but then his whole group is a great job. Jimmy is an unlucky wannabe gangster who doesn't seem to do anything right (SPOILERS: losing panda money, car Ackos and almost banging a bank robbery), but still coming to the top. <br /> <br /> they didn't know what the two kids were at the start, but some of the stories combine nicely. all together damn great piece of australian cinema 9/10
