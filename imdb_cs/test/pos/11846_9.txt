I loved this movie. It's a lot of laughter. The game is good and writing is really sharp. I'd rather see a hundred movies like this than THREE LORD RINGS that repeat and repeat. It's a low budget issue and seems to be shot on DV but looks good and Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson are great together. Why do you have at least ten lines? I'm not a critic, just a patron. I doubt that Quentin Tarantino could have written this picture funny, without filling it with masturbating gratuitous violence. This movie should be seen on more screens than just one. I laughed from start to finish. >
