While watching the world-class modern film (The Runaway Bride) with her granddaughter (22 years old) she asked me, "Ever since you watched movies since 1938, what's the biggest movie of your life? Boy! What is the choice! It took me a whole summer to think about it. It's "THE BEST OF YOUR LIFE". This film has no shortcomings. It is one film in which each of the tiny characters and dialogue is essential for the story. There is no single piece in the film that could be left out. The young girl with her brothers did not get her hands, the man returned home to young adult children who grew up without him and with various ideas, a portrait of a young man whose sole responsibility was a jerk who became the leader of a group of men and was awarded medals for his work. Women who now have to adapt to her husband's life are gone for years. The realization of the people who were safe there provided the homes of the victims that these ordinary people did for their benefit. A look into the life of love and life with man without hands. Parents first look and react to their son's new distortions. The man who decided to make a decision about life and death at some point had to go back to the way he drifted into the structure of the conservative bank loans. This is no compassionate, jerky jerking. THIS REAL LIFE! She couldn't be portrayed otherwise. This, my friends, is HOW I AM! This could easily be considered a document. On this day of color film, please don't be turned off in black and white because it's one of the best B / W movies, editing and direction you'll ever see. The cast was perfect. If I could, I would be obligated for all those who take history, filmmaking, creative writing, sociology, family counseling or psychology to see and report on this grand example of filmmakers' art.
