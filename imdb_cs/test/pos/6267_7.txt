A very sweet film about a young Chinese man in love with Western technology and an Englishman trying to make his fortune display movies in China. It is a very interesting story that is probably based on real events, although I suppose it's more fantasy than real. It has a fabulous quality that you rarely get in real life, and it's also 8 people who were added to the script, so they had to do things right and left. This is a very likeable movie that expresses how a magic movie was for people who have never seen it before. It is not a very deep film that briefly touches on the loss of tradition and the penetration of Western culture, but mainly just a pleasant little film. It's actually a movie that I enjoyed very well and which starts to flicker 15 minutes after watching it. Light as a souffle, but I enjoyed every minute.
