I first saw this short when I bought a random DVD of short movies a while ago. this is the only short on the DVD i liked, but i don't like that i like it ... when you spend a lot of time with me, you'll see it. it is beautiful, simple and passionate, no bells, no whistles - it could be done with sharpie (but don't get me wrong, the animation is elegant and bright - this person has spent a lot of time with cats - but that's just black and white) then there is writing and music ... it's just beautiful. i eat chocolate, drink wine and watch it over and over again ... nothing else matters, waiting for Pedro Serrazina to come up with something else.
