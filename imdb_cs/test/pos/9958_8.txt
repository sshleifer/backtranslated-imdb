"The Merchant of Venice" was one of Shakespeare's most popular games during his own life, but it fell on difficult times during the 20th century because of its undeniably anti-Semitic content. The game was also called a schizoid in its screening of comedy scenes for tragic, leading some to say that they are two games that try to coexist as one. Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes, who played William Shakespeare in "Shakespeare in Love") is in love with Portia (Lynn Collins, Outstanding), but needs to borrow a considerable sum of money to make her woo. He goes to his ever gay lover Antonio (Jeremy Irons), who does not have the resources on his person, but takes a loan from the Jewish usurer Shylock (Al Pacino). Shylock is amused and insulted that Antonio, who offends his religion, now comes to him for money, but offers it on condition that the penalty for non-compliance will be Antonio's body pound. What happens, of course. Bassanio and Portia offer Shylock much more than the original loan instead of a pound of meat, but Shylock, distraught after his daughter leaves him and marries a Christian, refuses to marry him. Portia, in a scene where the audience is never quite clear about where to place their sympathy, sheds Shylock from what he should be legally his, and then relieves him of his wealth and religion. Shylock was originally essayed as a cartoonish villain, but modern actors and directors turned him into a tragic figure, railing against 16th century injustice Venice. Al Pacino has a great job as Shylock and Jeremy Irons is good as Antonio, but I think Lynn Collins' work as Portia is the best part of the game. Portia is one of the few remarkable female roles in Shakespeare's canon, and Collins is amazing in this part. But Joseph Fiennes is more than a little boring; I have never enjoyed his often exaggerated acting style. I give "The Merchant of Venice" 8/10.
