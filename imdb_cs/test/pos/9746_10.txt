Flash Gordon was the first show. I know there was a couple of goofy, but I wasn't looking at it. Buster Crabbe is Flash Gordon. He was not a trained actor, but very well, convincingly. Jean Rogers is nice and 20 years old. old was, in my opinion, a pretty good job. Charles Middleton as Emperor Ming is excellent. He was in many other films, quite versatile, he could sing and dance. His portrayal of "Ming Merciless", in all 3 Flash Gordon series, was the top notch. The rest of the cast also did a very good job. Well, boys and girls, take your popcorn, sit back and enjoy. John R.
