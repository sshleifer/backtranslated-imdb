Quiet historical drama based on the story of Anna Boleyn, the newly arrived lady waiting for the queen to catch Henry VIII's lustful eye, the evil lively king of England who loves the holiday, drink, hunt, entertain her clown yard, watch tournaments and chase after young beauties jumping from cakes and diverse attractive women around the castle. Soon he canceled his marriage, married Anna and told her that it was her holy duty to produce a male heir. She does not succeed in this score and he soon has his eye on another lady-in-wait. Meanwhile, Anne spends nearly all the film looking hesitant, upset, or downright ready to burst into tears. She just doesn't come across as a happy camper (or is it just a bad game?!). This movie is a solid piece of fun, with an immersive story that took me two hours. - and I enjoyed seeing the spectacular medieval costumes that appeared here on a beautiful sepia tone. Emil Jannings is quite remarkable and unforgettable in his well-executed portrayal of King Henry the Eight - he really looked like Henry was eighth. I'm not so sure about the performance of an actress who plays Anne, she seemed to be a little over the top. The DVD of this film contains a suitable, nicely done piano score that suits this story perfectly. Pretty good movie.
