I saw this movie when it was released and there is no doubt that it touches the heart. I liked the look of a child who came to know that what she was thinking about was not really true. It's a break of the little boy. And her search to find out who she is. And before she knows about her, the relationship between her and her foster mother. That's a nice look. R Rahman adds his stress with good re-recording and songs. In this film, mani ratnam do not exaggerate or give advice (as in Vuyire), but simply tell characters as they are. That's why the film hits the audience exactly. The pool bath chakkarvarthy scene and nandhitadas did not say perfectly what it meant. Mani Ratnam has improved amazingly.
