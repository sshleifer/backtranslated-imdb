I grabbed it at the end, late Mexican cable, and I have to lean on it. The title was translated as "Secretos" (Secrets). Well, there is a secret that has an important role in the movie, but come on! We're not stupid. We know there's a novel behind it. Anyway, the movie is quite interesting and it is borne by its strong rhythm performances. Always beautiful and stunning Jordana Brewster and Christopher Eccleston bring great performances and have such great chemistry among them. Cameron Dazaz is also good, though he has minimal time on the screen. Blythe Danner is perfect and his latest movie appearance is moving, sad. Great performances. Jordan's character and her sister's former friend travel to Europe to deal with her demons and understand why her sister died. Through flashbacks we learn sad truth and we can't help but apologize for the whole family. The end really moves. So it's nudity, but it's minimal. In fact, sex scenes are artsy and have no intention of being steamy or sexy. To be honest, I still watched him for Joranda Brewster on a charming beauty screen. And I like the story and dramatic presentations. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a try if you like solid dramatic features. Great movie. Last, the last scene was very sad.
