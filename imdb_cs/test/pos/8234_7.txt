Note the wide release date on August 8, 1945 - about a week before Japan surrendered in World War II, so we are likely to report in more than 21 years. Irene Dunne (It Happened One Night, a 1939 version of the Love Affair) is Paula Wharton, who goes to live on an Army base while her newspaper editor's husband is in school training. Alexander Knox (longest day) is her hubby Max. Look at Charles Coburn (Monkey Business, gentlemen prefer blondes) as a stuffy, commanding chief of newspapers. Also look for Coru Witherspoon as Mrs. Gates, The Women, Bank Dick, Libeled Lady. A war story written from the perspective of wives who was not very common these days. a fun commentary on the shabby state of "marital housing"; Irene's wardrobe in this movie certainly wasn't at all shabby .. because they never had to leave their little cottage, it seems that the whole movie budget was spent on her always-excellent dress and hats.
