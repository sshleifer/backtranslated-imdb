We went to the cinema where we expected a big budget release and got an artistic film. The film was screened digitally at approximately two-thirds of the slanted real estate screen of classic digital projection, and had a limited stereo sound that was wasted on cinema experience. The film's content was the same old historical content we'd all seen before, but heavily disinfected to prevent ill viewers. Live action scenes, few of which were repeatedly used in classic documentary style, which after a while became unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I was a little surprised that only 4 people looked at it. others knew something we didn't do. I think producers recognized this film for the ninetieth anniversary of Gallipoli. I have to ask if they should bother. Seven out of ten for trying, and out of respect for ANZAC.
