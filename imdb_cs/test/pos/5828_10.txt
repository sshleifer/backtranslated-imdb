Yes, this show had a lot of male frontal nudity and yes, over the years the plot lines have become over the top, melodramatic and very unrealistic, but it didn't matter because the show is great. You really get involved in characters and every character, no matter how small or bigger, is perfectly cast. I can't imagine anyone else besides JK Simmons playing a neo-Nazi racist rapist, nor anyone else playing Tobias Beecher except Lee Tergesen. Transforming his character from Season 1 to Season 2 is amazing. However, the character that MADE Oz OZ was CHRIS KELLER (played by Christopher Meloni). He had no relationship with anyone else in prison except for Beecher (except Ronnie Barlog, but it was only for Ronnie to stop playing with Keller's lover Beecher). Their relationship exceeded sex and Tom Fontana actually cared for the two of us and wanted these two together. I loved Vern's soft spot for his kids on the show, and how Fontana made nice characters out of all these nasty criminals we grew up, adore, even Simon Adebesi. However, some plot lines were absolutely incredible and unrealistic: * Guy build a bomb in oz * Guys standing in focus in their windows in their pods looking at other men plot something in their minds - too over top. * Drugs get into oz * Everyone in the rehabilitation group used or sold drugs and Sister Pete never helped anyone in six years. * People are killing in the gym, dressing room and kitchen. * Nobody injured Ryan's mom * No one fought Cyril outside the boxing ring (except Vern, of course) * Two instrumented inmates who were left alone in the elevator shaft and one of them died without investigation. Karl Metzger (the guard) kills himself and nobody examines it. The Governor holds all his press conferences in prison * All inmates must do is say "I want to see Glenn" or "I want to see mcmanus" and they are asked no questions. * People die every week in Oz * On the outside, people kill someone and get 20 years, except for the word of honor, but if they kill someone on the inside, they go almost to death. kitchen or post office - inmates run both departments without question * Aging drugs for prisoners to be replaced * Ryan has no friends or companions but never becomes injured, killed, maimed, raped or defeated. * Men NEVER flush toilets when they go to the bathroom or vomit. The NBA Scout comes to jail to accept NBA players (yeah) <br /> <br /> However, with all these shortcomings, this show is still amazing. It's terrible, brutal, sexy, nervous, raw and innovative. Dean Winters, Scott William Winters, JK Simmons, Christopher Meloni, Luiz Guzman, Adele (the guy who played Simon Adebisi), Eammon Walker, Lee Tergesen, Terry Kinney, mUms, Alexander Man, LL Cool J, etc., Etc. They are all amazing and have shown that it is worth watching. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend renting on DVD. Season 6 will be released on 9/06 (next month). The first five years are on DVD - watch them and watch them again with audio commentary. I loved the director's commentary with Chazz Palmentari. A succession with Andy Schillinger running across the dining tables and then falling into the hole was an amazing, top shot !!!! Glory! And Kathy Bates directed Family Business and the famous match scene between Beecher and Keller - just awesome !! Brilliant!!! That would have to be so special for Meloni to touch Tergesen's private part in front of an icon like Kathy Bates in this scene !! Wow! He pulled it beautifully, pun! Waiting for Oz: The Next Generation !!!! (like Star Trek, etc.) C'Mon !!! Let's start it !!!!
