This thriller is one of the few (movie) surprises I've experienced. Everyone - I mean EVERYDAY - I talked to him when it was in the theaters, he said it was awful ... but then I thought none of those people really understood horror / thriller movies or metal rock - so why DO I listen to them first ????? This movie digs ass - but ONLY if you're able to understand and enjoy this type of entertainment. In short (too late) - you see it with an open mind and it can only open your mind. ... also soundtracks ...
