I saw it because my cousin is in addition to one of the wedding scenes. I read somewhere that Oz and Rudnick wanted to have fun on liberal movies, but the climax ended up in one of those movies. Some humor is also a little on the cloning side, Joan Cusack was too excited for me and someone has a special timeline for the Oscars. Yet there were more than enough funny moments like a kiss scene, a wedding that is not, and a scene with a director to enjoy it. As always, Kline is good, but for me it was a real surprise that Selleck is not a big fan, but he's doing it pretty well.
