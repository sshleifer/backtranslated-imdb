No real conspiracy, no character development, no direction at Scorcese level, but seriously, did you really expect any of this? The only thing that matters is that this film is absolutely cheerful, almost at the same level as Borat. Sure, the end is a little stretched, but when Borat's portrait has not released you, you must be the worst batty in the history of batty boys. Sacha Baron Cohen is perhaps the biggest ALIVE comedian, and here he gets more laughter than Jude Law on the naked beach. I dare not laugh. <br /> <br /> If you can pull a ten-foot pole out of your background in an hour and a half and enjoy some well-timed and very silly jokes in a silly story about a stupid character, see that stupid movie. You'll be glad you did it. Keep it real!
