"It's fun, your worst nightmare always seems so far!" Dark Habour characters, married couple (Alan Rickman & Polly Hunter) and vagabond (Norman Reedus) slip into a game full of hidden sexual energy and betrayal. Now it's an exciting break that increases tension and gives plenty of room for interpretation. A good meeting and a story that, if you're not using your brain, leaves you confused. You have to watch it at least twice. The very strength lies in its unconventionality and, of course, in Alan Rickman. The one who loves him will love this movie. Conclusion: It's not a typical movie, but Okay!
