Richard Condie's sheer insanity madness cartoon 'Big Snit', is a journey through qwerkyness, madness, hillarity, pleasant background, melting characters, and the conclusion that almost brings me to happy tears every time I see it. This short I saw again and again AND OVER and I never TIRE out of it (fortunately to have it on tape from TV broadcasting) !! It never ceases to explode uncontrollably in laughter, and then I get down into the depths of my spirit, emphasizing the magnitude of human condition. Because when someone says, "Come on, let's finish the game," everything is all right in the world, and the problems we face every day are suddenly realizing that all the small ephemeral things that no longer fight or to worry. This film looks like a simple exercise in humor cartoon at first, but it's much more. This film hits a human spirit with a greater sense of spiritual meaning when everything seems so bad and trivial. It's flawless ... in every way. A DAMN FUNNY TOO;) <br /> <br /> Rating 10 out of 10.
