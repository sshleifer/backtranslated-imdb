In this movie, my Santa Lucia choir was selected. All 100 plus. When the time came for the movie, I was asked to choose just 10. Oh my God. We had a little daughter who went early to keep her almonds because she wanted to be in the movie. It was difficult to make a decision. Georgetown people are just as nice as the people who show in the movie. Love, kind, believers. The city sponsors the annual Christmas Market the first two weekends in December each year. I was there this year and it was amazing. The city is beautiful and people work hard to make it magical. The city is appearing today, as well as when filming. Much credit goes to the Historical Society, which works hard to maintain its historical value. The headmaster of the school, which was transformed into a charter school, received a prize for Colorado governor for volunteers.
