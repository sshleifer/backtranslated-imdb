I thought it was a movie, Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie. The character of Yasmine Bleeth plays women who have fallen into the head and heal in love with Richard Greic's character. They finally get married and everything seems perfect, except that Yasmine Bleeth wants a baby more than anything, but she hardly tries to get pregnant. Richard Greico will do anything to make her happy and come to extreme measures to be happy. I thought acting was great in this movie and it assures you. It shows how naive it can be when they fall in love. Yasmine Bleeth is a good actress and I wonder why she never came in her career. Richard Greico is very impressive as a misleading husband and plays evil very well. I wonder why some actors do it and some don't. Everything and all the great movie that I would recommend.
