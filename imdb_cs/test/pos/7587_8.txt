After seeing this short VHS cassette with Summer Stock, I reevaluated every Sunday on TCM. This meant the film debut of 15-year-old Deanna Durbin and 14-year-old Judy Garland outside her two older sisters. These two teens showcase their musical talent with a solo from Deanna "Il Bacio", then one from Judy "Waltz with Swing" in front of the two peak with "Americana". The slight conspiracy of this 11-minute film concerns the possible Edna unemployment (Durbin's real name given here) of grandfather's work in the park due to low attendance. With the help of two girls, you can probably guess what happens from here! Contrasts are marked not only by Garland and Durbin's musical choices, but also by height, poise and movement. Despite being quite good at the end, it is almost surprising that MGM chose Garland while Durbin was already closed to Universal because this short film was briefly released because her feature debut (Three Smart Girls) was at the beginning. preparatory phases. Judy herself would make her first feature film (Pig Wig) for the 20th-century fox when MGM decided what movie to follow. That would be the Broadway Melody of 1938, where she would perform at the stop "Dear Sir Gable". what the future holds for them ...
