I saw this movie when it was aired on Lifetime in 2004. Since then, I've never seen it before, but I've often thought of it. I left an impression on me that I was looking for lately. I found it finally and realized it was just for TV. The film is wonderful - full of great writing and playing. William Petersen is as always perfect. This film left me without words and in tears. It is an amazing story of faith, love and compassion. Does anyone know how can I get a copy of this movie for my home? Is it possible with TV movies? I'd really like to see it again. This is to be between my collection !!
