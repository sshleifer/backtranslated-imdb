Dee Snider was inspired to make a two-part horror song. This film was written / directed / produced and played in the details of these songs (Horror-terria, from TwistedSister / Stay Hungry). People commented that they must have a sick mind to eliminate something like that. I can't hear anyone commenting on Stephen King, Wes Craven, Dean Koontz, or Alfred Hitchcock in his own time. The film is profiled as a modern psychotic created by contemporary trends in society. Personally, I thought it was quite well done from total imagination and inspiration, also without the benefits of a big budget and conversations with real victims / criminals. This movie is perfect if you want something to give you nightmares and make you cringe about the possible and likely. COULD IT HAPPEN !!
