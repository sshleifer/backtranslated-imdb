Burlesque on Carmen is one of Chaplan's longest films until it is a clever and surprisingly complex parody of what was then known as "Prosper Merimee" about "Carmen". I was a bit confused about the difference between the 1915 IMDb Burlesque listing on Carmen and the 1916 version. Based on the runtime, I suppose it was a 1915 version I saw because that 1916 is 20 minutes longer, What I read is 20 unnecessary and unimaginable minutes. It is clear from the outset that Burleska's Carmen is still one of Chaplin's most complicated and ambitious endeavors, starting with a story of a tragic love story. Carmen. Carmen is sent by a band of gypsies ("the band that gave GYP to the Gypsy Emperor") to seduce a Spanish officer to get rid of the smuggling operation. He is a clever band, a criminal band whose leader, Lillas Pastia, "spent 50 years learning to steal, thinking that he could be offered a job in politics." On a side note, I saw some almost misogynistic reports and jokes in some of Chaplin's earlier works, but probably none quite as obvious as in this. Near the beginning of the film, while a group of gypsies is traveling, there is a scene where mules and women load, and an inter-title explains "mules are those with long ears." T In case you can't tell it, I think. Chaplin plays the role of David Joseph, the unfortunate officer to be seduced by Carmen. He is described as "a brave soldier and a lover of women." Not for Chaplin, who would remove any doubts about his ability to play a convincing comic soldier a few years later in his brilliant shoulder. And of course he didn't have to deal with being a woman's lover. Of course, of course, his polished military uniform and straightforward disciplinary, of course, diffuse. , with some of his traditional slap-stick moves. He strikes me as a little boy in authority, trying to keep the respect of his subordinates by developing a grumpy, solid exterior. Soon, Carmen ("Beloved by All Men to 96") will come in and she will immediately flirt with Charlie, and I should mention that for the good majority of the movie she is surprisingly true to the original story, which was full of Jealousy and Tragedy Chaplin is strangely convincing as a jealous lover, capable of evoking a jealous passion I've never seen from him, There is at least one scene where he is really scary. Gags such as the merry dance and the classic sword fight near the end, and his boyish charm and soldier role is also definitely a winning combination, although there is another strange piece that includes a group of men pushing huge doors back and forth, which wasn't too effective to begin, but only to continue and continue about five times longer than it was worth. as a prop movie, I always appreciate such views on old movie sets. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is its strongest part. It bears a noticeable resemblance to Romeo and Juliet, but only when you think Chaplin will perform a major thematic experiment by distancing himself from his traditional style is it a hilarious twist that's like vintage Chaplin I've ever seen. Nice work!
