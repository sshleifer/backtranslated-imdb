I loved this movie when I was a kid. I saw it theatrically. Randy Edelman made a good soundtrack. David Seville is the Chipmunks father and record manager. Chipmunks consist of Alvin, who is best known for playing harmonica, Simon, who is a bright and diligent chipmunk & Theodore, who is the youngest and always hungry. There is a lady known as Miss Miller who takes care of chipmunks and has 3 daughters known as Brittany, Jeanette & Eleanor, all of whom have the same character as Chipmunks. My favorite songs from this soundtrack include "Diamond Dolls", "The Girls of Rock & Roll" and "My Mother." Alvin really wanted to see Europe when Dave had to go to the store. to race each other and do the right thing.
