OK ... time for a little bragging. It's been 2 flamin 'years since I submitted my original comments to praise this top-rated comedy footy ..... and that damn thing still isn't on video or DVD (or on that thing was even repeated on telly! !) !!!!! Does anyone know why not? Was there a BBC style error where the original copy was deleted / mistaken / deleted? <br /> <br /> Listen a lot to ITV - now on DVD! Do you even realize how fun this program was? This makes "Mike Bassett" look as bad as the current Spurs Team pants. <br /> <br /> Rant over. For now.
