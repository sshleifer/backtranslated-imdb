Punishment Park is a great cinema. Shot in the Southern California Desert using its patented fake Watkins documentary style <br /> <br /> creates a movie like no other. It tracks two groups of prisoners (one <br /> <br /> pre-convicted second post-convicted) throughout the picture. After a military trial, <br /> <br /> they can choose either <br /> <br /> to serve a custodial sentence or take part in a punishment <br /> <br /> Park (an exhaustive three-day tour through a desert with nothing but clothes on your back while being hunted by local law <br /> <br /> law enforcement agencies who use the park as a live action training <br /> <br /> country). I can't say enough about this movie. Sometimes it looks like you're watching a real document. This is one of Peter Watkins's most prestigious films. I suggest you take care of it. It's not sorry! <br /> <br /> We highly recommend <br /> <br /> A + <br /> <br />
