This production was pretty good. The usual fairy-tale scenery, interesting, unpredictable characters. It was so strange that they did not have Captain Hastings, Miss Lemon and Poirot's office / residence, so prominently featured in the original PBS / BBC mysteries. <br /> <br /> There was so much at the office in the original series. Hastings reads the newspaper while Poirot "trains his little gray cells." Miss Lemon, whenever needed. Poirot without Captain Hastings would be like Holmes without Watson ... he can definitely solve the crime, but it's not that interesting. And what would be the poirotic secret without Hastings, with his perfect ways falling on some beautiful, unattainable woman.
