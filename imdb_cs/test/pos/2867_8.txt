I liked this very much. Camera angles are fine, it's not all that would be like Blair Witch. And I thought they did a great job with Sound when we saw things from Kane's point of view. Lots of fun. Many people screamed at the screen! Kane did a great job with various psychic emotions. It is much less one-dimensional than most horror heroes. Kane is much less frightening and more believable than most movie psychos. I was not sure how he would react to different situations. There are not many twists, but it is smart and original in its own way. Good, scary, B-movie slasher fare.
