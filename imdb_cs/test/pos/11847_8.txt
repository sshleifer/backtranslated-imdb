This movie impressed me tremendously if I was nothing but comedy. It may not always be the most interesting, funniest humor, but I find it appropriate for every scene. The flow of the movie is certainly a bit messy, sometimes confusing. characters. Sometimes we watch a bit of grotesque and other scenes revolve around a decisive relationship discourse. This could be somewhat frustrating for some viewers, but it brought me closer to the dilemmas of irregular character chaos. <br /> <br /> Acting is great from everyone. I'm a huge fan of Andy Richter, but I wasn't above his heel because everyone else seems to be. He did it very well, but Julianne Nicholson and Lauren Graham stole the show in both ways. Jay Mohr performs as expected if you've seen him in other movies. I always liked him. Overall, the movie is very funny and offers some nice basics for several types of relationships. When it comes to relationship issues and problems, some movies try to surprise. There is nothing surprising about what is being offered here, but it is fun to watch as they are revealed throughout the film.
