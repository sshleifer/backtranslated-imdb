'Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul' is one of the best music documents I've seen lately and is more than just a movie about music. It is also a musical love declaration about a fairy tale town, one of the biggest cities in Europe and the world, one of the most important cities in the history of Europe and Islam, a city that can bridge the future of Europe and the Middle East, or once again, how has already become a history gap between two worlds. Then there is music. The interesting approach the film takes with regard to music is that it is based on modern music and we hear a lot of (good) rock and rap in the first third of the film. Just as backward movement in time, the soundtrack takes us to the roots, to Turkish traditional music, to commercial novels, and to exotic instruments that are essential elements of the landscape of Turkish music. In a complex and conflicting state like Turkey, the film will not avoid some political aspects, such as the censorship introduced by the military government in the 1980s, or the importance of minority songs, especially Kurdish. In fact, one of the best musical moments is provided by a Kurdish singer with a fantastic voice singing in a Turkish bath in the shape of a cathedral. By the end of the year he loves the city and his music. watching and hearing this movie. I've never been to Istanbul, but after seeing this movie, I'm sure I want to visit this place soon.
