SOLD DEAD (2009) ** 1/2 Dominik Monaghan, Larry Fessenden, Ron Perlman, Angus Scrimm, John Speredakos, Eileen Colgan, Brenda Cooney. An uneven blend of horror and comedy that presents as "Valentine's Day" the 60s horror movies of Roger Corman and Hammer's studies, with two assholy thieves thieves (Monaghan and Fessenden) who face final penalties for guillotine crimes, but not before their occult stories can be trigger in flashbacks. Fun and a few well-sprayed shocks, but really a B-movie mess that tries to live as a cult classic thanks to the casting of Perlman and Scrimm veterans to no avail; good rental for Halloween.
