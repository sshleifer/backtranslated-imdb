A recent survey of children in the UK forced the idea that this film presented 27 years ago. Young people who are more than anything else want to grow up to be famous. There used to be doctors and firefighters who wanted to be children. Everyone wants to be famous. Fame is a story of a group of children admitted to High School for Performing Arts in New York. We saw them in the first audition, then they learned about life for the next four years. The film has a lot of quality qualities but in the end you feel a little dissatisfied. Alan Parker's daring directorial style fits well with the story. The film was classified as a musical, but more than anything else it is a drama. Music numbers and dance routines break out and there, and Parker keeps them as realistic as they could be. For the most part, acting is top-drawer with a few exceptions. Stimulation is a little off, especially towards the end of the movie, but at that moment the story has already turned around several times. First, the auditions at the beginning of the movie should knock out a few basic characters out. It seems unlikely that anyone would show up and audition for one department, then they would hit the road through the entrance to the other. Some of these people just don't look so talented or start with. Once the first year of instruction begins, the film settles into a nice groove. The interaction between students and teachers is very well managed and leaves you wanting more. The film begins to lose later, as we see more and more pupils outside school. Some of these people just don't care. The biggest mistake of the movie is that the character Ralph Garcy is so prominent. This guy is cruel; self-centered blockbuster. "A professional hole" as he proudly declares on stage during his comedy routine. It is believed that viewers feel that they are feeling this guy and his tragic personal situation, but I was hoping to get him out of school. Irene Cara, Maureen Teefy, Paul McCrane and the late Gene Anthony Ray are the people you will care about when this movie is over. Try as I could, I still can't develop abs as Gene Anthony Ray had in this movie. Overall, this movie is good. It is unforgettable, interesting and full of bold scenes and performances. It runs maybe a little too long, and maybe some bad characters get fully developed while others kind of float in the background. Music numbers are great and there is even a surprise or two waiting to be discovered when the movie ends. Although it is not perfect, Fame will be a movie that lives on one way or come for many years. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 stars. The Hound.
