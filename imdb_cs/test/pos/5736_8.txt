Six teenagers go to an old distant abandoned school, where a terrible night of fun and jokes took place 27 years ago. Instead, the kids run with a crazy, crazy security (he played excellently with the terrible menace of the Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy) who committed ugly murders. Director Carlos Gil combines an interesting story at a fast pace and makes an adept task of creating an impressive, scary and mysterious atmosphere. The funny script Tino Blanca and Mercedes Holgueras offer a clever and inspired blend of slasher and supernatural elements that guess the viewer to the end. Fernando Arribas' neat cinematography allows expert use of light and shadow. David San Jose's mood score also makes a trick. Attractive and appealing young casts contribute to lively and engaging performances, especially with the commendable turns of Carlos Fuentes as leader of Ramon, Olivia Molina as panicked Maria, Zoe Berriatuy as an unpleasant joker Jordi and Carmen Morales as a dirty goth Chick Sandra. The murder parts are as bloody and brutal as they should be. And also amazing crazy surprises. Strong and satisfying shock.
