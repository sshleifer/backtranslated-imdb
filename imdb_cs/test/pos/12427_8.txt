I saw it on the horror of the Zone and I was fully expecting it to compete like most of the movies they play, but I was pleasantly surprised. The film revolves around 2 friends and a maniac in a monster truck that is chasing (I know it sounds crap, but its actually pretty good), the movie is creepy when it wants to be and is laughing loudly funny in parts (and not either unintentionally, it's well managed and it's a lot of fun as well as being very cruel, there's also a very funny black humor. it's not if your after a funny movie then it should be fine
