That was an interesting movie. I could do it without the bathroom scene and the seduction scene - EWWWW! Otherwise, I loved the music that spun around my head. Chris / Izzy's parents are amazing! They fully support the interests of their sons and believe in it so much that they support it - now it's amazing !! What really surprised me was that Chris's realization at the end. It wasn't entirely "Hollywood" ending on the road to exploring. The overall rise to fame and fall was a roller coaster ride.
