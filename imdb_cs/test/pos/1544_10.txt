This is one of those classic Americans that are made for television movies that are just being created for watching on a rainy afternoon. Although very unlikely, the script is never taken too seriously, and the cast that leads to a big tongue in a mysterious mystery / horror film on the face is the most popular popcorn or candy box. The big bonus of this movie is the fantastic filming location, and despite the strange events and even strangers around the Tommahawk Lake, it bothered me to live there! <br /> <br /> All in all a great movie you can watch and see again.
