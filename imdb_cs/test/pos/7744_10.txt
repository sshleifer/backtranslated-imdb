"Tempest" is a somewhat confident, uneven, discursive film. But as Lord Byron, another visitor to Greece, protested against his friend John Murray about his similarly self-confident and discursive "Don Juan", "it may be shameful, but it's not a life, isn't that a thing?" The connection with Shakespeare's "Tempest" may seem a bit unclear, as another commentator says. But after reading "The Tempest", watch the movie again and it will look much closer. What makes this movie wrong is its unpleasant mixture of straightforward normal narration and sudden, violent seeming improvisation, especially between Cassavetes and Rowland. But to be honest, these scenes are the most remarkable and enjoyable in the movie if it's the hardest to watch. The music of this film, written by Stom Yamasht, is also overlooked. Especially fine is the perfect little piece that accompanies the afternoon siesta, like people, animals and seemingly the whole island will collapse to sleep the hottest part of the afternoon. It is a noble moment, representing the best aspect of this film and one thing that keeps it somewhat united, the fact that (in addition to the large flashbacks and the very end) it is a story one day on the island, from awakening tonight. Overall, I'd rather watch this movie a hundred times before I see a bombastic Hollywood piece of crap. And I actually watched it several times. Most often I see something I missed before. <br /> <br /> (Confession: I'm impressed. This was the second film I took my Greek-American goddess.) Trivia notes on this movie: <br /> <br It was Molly Ringwald's first film as Sam Robards'; In fact, it wasn't filmed on the island, but in the film Gytheion, the southern tip of the distant peninsula of Mani, the Peloponnese of Greece; <br /> <br /> - (according to today's standards) Primitive Special Effects was made by Bran Ferren, who later became Disney's Imagineering leader and was still an adviser to the American news community; - Director Paul Mazursky chose the name of his recent autobiography "Show Me the Magic" from the "Tempest" screenplay.
