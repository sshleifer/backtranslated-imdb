I saw this drama through cable TV. Although I only saw two series, I love this drama. I expect the next series to be broadcast by cable. Although it describes the horrible, absurd situation in the prisoners' camp, this shows us an unreal spirit, warmth, friendship and humanity. They don't know whether they can survive or not, but keep their hope strong without being deterred. I know this film is not realistic as another war document, but I don't want to blame it. This will convince me of the strong will of people in the most difficult situation. <br /> <br /> 'Private Account', especially this episode touched deep in my heart. <br /> <br /> I remember every scene. I always hate math. But after I have seen this drama, I can understand something about mathematics ... Mathematics is its connection between past and present, also symbolizing eternity. <br /> <br /> "Time, Light and Memory in the Circle." Like other victims of the war, he lost his lover with an irresistible destiny. I am immersed in his time and memory as if I experienced the same thing. He had a great loss, but he has a pure passion for studying. Studying started in camp, his realization pleasure, I believe his commitment to the study kept him. I've seen it several times, but the meaning of this movie has never disappeared. Every time I see it, I feel the same deep emotions. <br /> <br /> * Their songs are beautiful, harmonious, <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I can't listen to OST.
