Expected second part ATOR !! Diluted quickly by JOE D'AMATO, a specialist in all kinds of subkinds (subgenres) of exploitation, and interpreted MILES O'KEEFFE again. The budget of a debio movie is ridiculous or minimal. Despite the fact that it's not a better film for his antecesora not to have fun, ATOR 2 either, has something, something that makes it enterteining. His introduction explains the origins of ATOR with the images of the first part. The screenplay is incredible, it's like any comic book about the great ROY THOMAS movie. it has so fantastic elements inside the SWORD world and such FANTASY as invisible men, black men, cannibals - monkeys ... the role of a villain who is interpreted brilliantly. Finale this match very well. Missing mass violence and blood, but this good. He never becomes boring. He has everything that was missing ATOR 1. Let me be enchanted! 4/5
