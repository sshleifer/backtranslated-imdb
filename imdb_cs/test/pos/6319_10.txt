While this movie may not be the next Evil Dead (Hell knows, maybe it will be, it was just a year) It's worth a look. Don't expect a $ 10 million movie. cuz you will be disappointed. Expect to have fun, laugh and enjoy the experience. Everything in all this film is much better than many, if not all, low budget horror movies. I have seen movies that have spent more than 10 or 20 times what this movie is worth, and it turned out to be 10000000000 times worse. The effort that has been put into this film is weighing on the kit it has by having a limited budget. The movies are meant to be fun and this movie definitely does. In fact, this movie can even open a new door for you in watching a movie. It is available on Netflix, if not in your local video store. So look at it, then decide.
