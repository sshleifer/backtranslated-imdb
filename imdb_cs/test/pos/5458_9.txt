Over the years I've been watching this movie many times when I saw it on "HBO" and now I have a copy on DVD. I have to say it's very memorable and fun. How every television fan can relate to the early 1990s, when time came to replace Johhny Carson's television living legend "Today's Evening Show" Who Will It Be Jay or Dave? This original HBO movie "The Late Shift" remains faithful to create and depict real events very well, demonstrating the backstage battle between NBC and CBS headsets and even ABC fought for Jay and Dave. Acting looks like real, because very few real TV shots are shown with the real lives of people as actors depicting Leno and Letterman to make it look so real. I haven't read Bill Carter's book, so I don't know if he stayed true to the site, but I've enjoyed this movie over the years. From the moment he starts showing CBS fun heads watching Leno sub for Johhny and decide they want to get a late night game. However, when Carson announces his unexpected retirement, NBC wants to remain loyal to Leno, but the conflict occurs when Letterman wants at 11:30 am in the slot machine. It was fun to watch a crazy meeting with Michael Williams and Treat Williams, who wants to see all the networks as a showman. It was interesting to see the scene of Johhny, who telephoned Letterman by direct way of going out of NBC and considering CBS. And by the way, Rich Little was amazing because Johny Carson's display could not be closed. And lots of tense moments were provided by showing bickering and shooting Leno's talent manager Helen which NBC heads pushed him to do. Overall, a great movie that showed what television really likes, and that proves that networks are hungry and money, while showing it to be a cruel business. Obviously, no business like show business. Great work from HBO very memorable and watches at any time showed the real story of the wars at night.
