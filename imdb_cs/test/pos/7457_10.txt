Duckman was a show that was in the last hour before it was time to sleep about ten years ago. It was a contrast to the many animations I watched at the time; I was getting a smaller junky for Disney and Looney Tunes stuff, and most Saturday morning cartoons were still on the run-off peak since the days of Ninja Turtles and Batman. But also around this time, I began to realize that the more frightening, mature, surreal, obscene, and (although I didn't know the term at that time) satirical cartoons, was more creative than I was used to. Around Beavis and Butt-head, Ren and Stimpy, and even Maxx beat TVs over MTV, the US released two shows - one of which was Weird Science and the other was Duckman. I've always remembered a few key pieces from the show, and some of those lines are very sensitive to those who have not forgotten it completely. Fortunately, I recently found a tape with about six episodes that I recorded a long time ago, and the jokes were very fresh. And the jokes delivery is a quick time fire in better episodes. In the voice department, talent choices are top-notch for stories that are usually just an excuse for gross, fascinating parodies of pop culture, politics, movies and TV shows, music. , detective secrets and a dysfunctional family unit. Jason Alexander is a great choice for Duckman and his performance is a comic 180 of his days at Seinfeld (although there might be some similar features). Also, the voices of Gregg Berger as an unmistakably monotonous and dead corpus, Dweezil Zappa as a cheerfully incapable of Ajax and Nancy Travis as a sex hungry, annoying sister brother-in-law, Bernice, contribute in full. Along with some great writing - although the joke is not sure-fire, the joke behind it offsets - the style of animation, while far from some of the refurbished, computer-enhanced product today, is resourceful and often abstract. This has a home-brave quality that Beavis and Butt-head or South Park would later have. And just like these shows, if you're a small child, I mean as little as in the younger than I watched the show, you don't have to understand most jokes (ie, there are plenty of stripers and VD links that sometimes fill two shows). But it's resourceful to catch it if it's on TV late at night, and it works pretty well in this time slot. One can only hope for a DVD box set. So, to anyone who has barely or even never heard of this program, here is a general note: think of this show as if Dashiell Hammett met Walt Disney and decided to go to the slums of Vegas with free mini-bar and collaborate with Luis Bunuel and The Simpsons. Not to mention that it's a group that did Rugrats
