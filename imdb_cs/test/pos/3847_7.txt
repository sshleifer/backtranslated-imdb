Walt Disney's 20th animated feature film was the last of which was a great person himself (died in late 1966) and is generally not considered one of the best. The main problem is that on the surface it seems that the film is only a cat version of LADY AND TRAMP (1955) or 101 DALMACI (1961), both of which are fans of fans. and a cat lover, I dug this reasonably bouncy mixture in which the pampered cat (expressed by Eva Gabor) and her three little kittens are thrown out on the streets of Paris by a rich lady (Hermione Baddeley) who is greedy. Fortunately, they meet the equine streetwise cat (Phil Harris), who leads them on their way back and is further supported by a cat-like jazz band (led by Scatman Crothers) and two helpful and friendly dogs; Meanwhile, at home, Edgar, the valet celebrates his supposed heritage and the mouse and horse are trying to help their cat pets a little. The legendary entertainer Maurice Chevalier was taken back from retirement to sing the title song (which includes a verse in French) and Scatman's band dedicated to the spectacular number "Ev'rybody wants to be a cat".
