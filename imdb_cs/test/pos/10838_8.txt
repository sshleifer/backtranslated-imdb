This drama apparently caused a bit of a stir six years ago when he debuted on television - he didn't take many television news himself, went under the radar; but after seeing it, I'm not surprised that it caused a stir. Not only because of its content (although it is somewhat more "invincible" than the usual TV feed) - it has more to do with the reactionary media in this country. In any case, this three-part series is based on Sarah Waters and focuses primarily on lesbians - although the plot also has room to explore other "dark" sides of sexuality. Our main character is an oyster girl named Nan (short for Nancy) from Winchester. She is enchanted by a female to a man pulling performer Kitty Butler after seeing her at a theatrical show and soon begins to attend all of her shows - eventually catching the artist's eye and becoming her dresser. It doesn't take long before Kitty is offered the opportunity to play on larger stages in London and become good friends with Nan. This act gets bigger when Nan gets on the podium and the couple becomes a dune stage ... but Kitty breaks Nan's heart and leads her to the Odyssey in London's irritable robbery. I must admit that my DVD Collection has no lack of slimy and sordid movies, so there was nothing to shock me. Despite being a bit tired, I have to say that I am still surprised by anyone who says this film has gone too far; naturally there is some lesbian sex and other things, but it is never exploitative or overused and the film could not be created without it. Main attention is always devoted to the story; and the story is really well done. The film is a total of three hours long, but if something is not long enough to get everything across. Of course, Sarah Waters is an inventive writer and the film remains interesting for the duration. Behavior is solid, as you would expect, but I must admit that I found the main actress Rachael Stirling, who was at first glance clumsy and heavy. although she grows into her role well as the film progresses. Realization is a bit of a problem and director Geoffrey Sax is a bit too imaginative for my taste. The story is a little happy until the end, which is a shame, because this film is the strongest during the dark moments (episode 2 is the top three for me). There is no defined point in the movie - or at least the one I haven't seen. It's not important to me; however, as Tipping the Velvet tells a good story and more than exceeded my expectations. It's worth checking out, for people who like such things.
