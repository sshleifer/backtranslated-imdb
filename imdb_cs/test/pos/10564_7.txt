I'm not entirely sure why I ordered "Fingersmith" from Netflix - probably because I like BBC dramas, that was on the list of recommendations. I didn't know what to see. The story that I will only describe in general, so that it does not spoil anyone who sees it after reading my review, has more twists and turns than the mountain road in the Rocky Mountains, the kind that usually appears in "caper" movies. They are very unusual in contemporary drama. I did not read the novel (and I do not intend to do so), I was totally unprepared for the surprise that ends the first segment on the DVD and so surprised by subsequent twists and turns. However, two young directors (Sally Hawkins, in particular, such as Sue and Elaine Cassidy as Maud), and in key support roles, Imelda Staunton as a mother figure in the house of thieves and Charles Dance as a wealthy uncle who collects pornographic materials and who will save the young Maud from the mad house where her mother lived as his secretary. Lesbian matter between Maud and Sue is a "big news" in the movie, but not really its highlight. The highlight is the conspiracy to steal the luck Maud has on his 21st birthday. The twists and twists in the plot add film to the film, though not very credibly. However, no viewer is likely to doubt that Maud and Sue somehow end up - unlikely - as credits. Although one has been raised as an ada, and serves pornography collectors, and another is a pickpocket featuring as a maid lady, the author of course means for them to live together at the end. It's a little hard to swallow because everyone conspired to cheat on the other. Despite these reservations, I had the film pretty well. This does not deserve the praise that others have experienced. The most horrific and interesting scenes take place inside the madness, where one of the two young women is closed until she is able to escape and return to London to bring the story to an unexpected conclusion. Sally Hawkins (Sue) is a very impressive young actress capable of expressing her character cascading and changing emotions with her facial expressions and eyes. No doubt we'll see more. I hope so.
