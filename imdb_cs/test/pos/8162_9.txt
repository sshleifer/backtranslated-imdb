The story impressed me. She had a "typical" predatory homosexual and a "typical" Mormon missionary. But each of them also had friends and family who had a good balance between their lives. There are a number of characters, some nice and some not so nice, each of which has its own personality nuances. And most reminded me of people in my life. The story begins with a few humorous moments and slowly evolves into a pleasing film relationship. The story progresses without visible plots and never talks to you. This leads you to think while waiting for what happens. Even though I thought I could predict something, I was surprised at how it actually came about. pain of the characters. I was watching a DVD movie and I couldn't stop watching it until it was over. (I usually watch a movie after a few days.) It's nice to see a gay character movie that is uplifting, but not preaching. I highly recommend this movie! And not just for gay viewers. Relationships go beyond sexuality.
