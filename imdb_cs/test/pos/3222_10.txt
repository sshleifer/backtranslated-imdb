Posedl√Ω !!!!! I have every Gilmore Girls every season and I think the reason I love her is that how much the screenplay is smart, it's not your average comedy show that it's not a pause after a joke to skip it. missed it. And it's not like a drama of soap opera either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have that stupid surprise. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the most popular shows on show at the time. Its fun because it speaks so fast that you can't get everything that is the first time you come back and laugh at other jokes. They also have so many links that it's amazing how smart it is. And you can talk to the characters anyway, and their real and actors are great from funny Lorelai to hermit Luke to immature Kirk. the show is just amazing. Definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time and spend there with their family this is definitely a show for them. There is only one word that can describe Gilmore Girls .... CLASSIC !!!!!!
