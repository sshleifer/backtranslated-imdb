I loved this movie! So it is worth a long time. I need help with the end, though .... <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Mary's Last Shot at the End - Is that suggesting she's still looking for Renaud? Or maybe she was the one who wanted to revive 13? (It seemed to be the one who delivered the first letter to Colin in the first place.) I don't understand, but I know I really liked it. So if anyone saw it and recalls it, or just saw it, please drop it at the end. <br /> <br /> Thanks
