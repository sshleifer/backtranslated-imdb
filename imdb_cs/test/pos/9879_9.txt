To understand the "Crash Course" in the true context, you need to understand the 1980s on television. Most TV shows made no sense. Situational comedy depopulated drama at least 3 to 1. They were still figured out where the lines were to overcome them. (TV shows like "Hail to the Chief" was quite a bold move!) This made-for-TV movie "Crash Course" featured an All-Star cast, joining members of all 80's classics: "227", "Family" Links ", "Who's the boss? ", Et al. The directors then had to have a penchant for these stellar films. Yet this film offered a very light fare and a simplified view of heroism and maturity. And sometimes it's not bad. Viva Soleil Moon Frye.
