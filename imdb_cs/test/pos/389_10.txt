You could expect Hitchcock to return to the main movie film to be wrong about caution. Certainly little was expected of his most noble, unlimited film, joyful melange of vicious black comedy, exciting tension, mocking manipulation, and amazing fantasy flights. But that's exactly what they got: THE PARTIES ON THE TRAIN. What is remarkable is how much of Bruno's violations of the world of film. Much has been made of a masterfully cross motif, but its immediate effect is to completely disable the direct line of progress Guy makes of his life, and thus the society he represents or wants to join. Guy is an archetypal American, a working class boy moving well in influential circles, athletic, successful, handsome. Bruno is his destructive contradiction, gay, decadent, "European" (living outside his father, in a big house and only lounges about dreaming of murder). Bruno is a life of repetition, circularity, while Guy moves straight. It is Bruno's success to relocate Guy to his empire (represented by the merry-go-round) and force HIM to offense (break the law, hope for murder (Bruno)). Bruno is literally fighting patriarchy. All the authorities in the film are criticized - Bruno's father, the man whose brutality we see, but the true horror he constantly mentions in the film (especially in Aunt Clara's pictures - that incredibly intense negative energy must come from somewhere); Anna is incredibly Machiavellian, a self-serving father; an insensitive judge who, after execution, is unaware of lunch; a tennis commentator whose smelly commentaries are always wrong. Hitch, perceived by Robin Wood, is deeply hostile to fathers and patriarchy, far from being a mother-hate legend. Bruno's offenses transform the world into excitement. This is Hitch's most realistic movie. Whenever Guy is in his conspiracy, he is filmed directly, with conventionally romantic music. But whenever Bruno gets through, the atmosphere becomes carnival, bizarre, much more fun. This is the first true American movie Hitch, looking forward to primitive criticism of America. Adult men puncture small boys' balloons or try to throw them out of the carousels. Major mathematics professors sing about goats on trains. Older Matrones are grinning at elegant saris. Washington is filmed as a series of replacement lines in a vast desert under a vast sky, like the scary Dali painting. There is one of the biggest, and most entertaining, scenes in all theaters when we see motionless, smiling Bruno in the sea turning head to a tennis match, a picture worthy of Magritte. Just look at any scene with Bruno in it and watch it emerge into a bizarre environment. Phalluses abound with the most sensual permutations - check all the balloons (Hitch seems to have seen THIRD MAN) - as well as in a more tranquil setting: Washington will never look the same again. STRANGERS is also VERTIGO, despite the fact that Hitch's most visible sexual film - just like phalluses, is a permanent homoeroticism, a remarkable game with "equestrian" horses; Gobsmacking fellatio joke when daughter Hitch is spilling a powder over a policeman. And yet Hitch is not a stint on good old tension. In a very good effort to show what a great artist is, critics tend to overlook what made him famous. Much was made of Bruno as a prototype of Norman Bates, and Hitch plays a cheerful trigger to identify the audience, willing Bruno to murder. There is a hilariously painful succession where Bruno loses a lighter with which he intends to frame Guya down the drain. The breaths of tension and sigh of relief from the audience, which I was involved in supporting the insane killer, are inherently humorous, somewhat distracting and highly revealing about our true reactions to compliance and success. And Hitch loves it with heartless joy - listen to mocking music and frightened songs and kick for taking it all so seriously. things in the cinema. Dialogue is so strange and brilliant, I can't believe it wasn't written by Chandler. Patricia Hitchcock is an amazing imp who stands behind her harsh father when he taunts Guy. The fair's final is a remarkable, dizzying fusion of exciting, tense set, black comedy and symbolic place. If Bruno's last words condemn him to hell (according to Catholic instructions, Hitch should embody: compare with a similar end in KILLERS), we appreciate his integrity, infinitely favored over Guy's spoiled self-serving.
