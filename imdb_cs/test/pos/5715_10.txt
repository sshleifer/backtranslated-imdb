This one-man show can be the most amazing show I've ever seen. To say it's just worth it, it's a big injustice, there's a reason why it was a show on Broadway. John Leguizamo is the master of making people from every culture feel at home and listen to his story of growing up and dealing with family and life in general. I would recommend this show to anyone if they can speak the language.
