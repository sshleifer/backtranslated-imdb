And I would rate him more than 7 out of 10 if it were not for the seriously unequal Barbara Hershey Irish accent in Madalyn's mother role. The accent came and went unfortunately, which I found more than a little distracting. However, the performance of William L Petersen in the role of Joad was excellent, bringing warmth and depth to the character despite some regular hokey dialogue. Captivating and genuine, I found him in an astonishing way to capture the character. The film's assumption is rather simple, building a forgotten staircase in the church. I believe it is based, rather loose, on a true story and I heard about this staircase before I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> It was a phenomenal technical performance - floating double helix without nails or screws. It exists to this day although it is now privately owned. <br /> <br /> ** Minor Spoiler ** A good supportive cast and Barbara dies so well in all her movies and doesn't disappoint. Lots of special moments. <br/> 7/10
