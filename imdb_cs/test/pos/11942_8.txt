I gave it 8 stars out of a possible 10. It had an excellent plot, and Peter Coyote and Michele Lee, as well as the rest of the cast, did their part well. Both Peter and Michele were too long in the tooth for ages their characters were supposed to be, and their kids in the movie, of course, would be preferable to be their grandchildren. I missed the first ten minutes of this movie, so I don't know how this body appeared after 25 years and tracked it back to Denny Traynor (Peter Coyot's character), but I had no trouble getting I'd get into the action. Barbara Traynor (Michele Lee) is overwhelmed when her longtime husband Denny is arrested for murder in Oregon about 25 years ago, State Denny says she was never in. <br /> <br /> However, as evidence accumulates against Denny, his story changes. Then his story changes again and again until Barbara knows what to believe. But Barbara thinks he's going to get to the bottom of the secret that swirls around Denny's fateful time, and a young girl named Sherry took a ride from a stranger named Wayne Kennedy who ended up murdering. <br /> <br /> I found the movie fun, walking and still guessing what really happened between the Three People. From what I saw during the closing titles, it seemed to be based on a real story.
