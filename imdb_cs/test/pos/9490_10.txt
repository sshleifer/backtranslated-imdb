just another zeppelin-led show at their best and their best swing. Every member of the band is on their best side of Jimmy and his bow and guitar JPJ with their thunderous bozo bass bangs away and Robert sings like their tomorrow. I have to say that when we get to the first song, where it will irritate, it's the beginning of something special. this DVD follows the zeppelin over their 11 years Carree starting in 69 in the Royal Albert Hall, then Madison Square Garden 73 followed by a much older and mature band in 75 at Court Ear and eventually another looking band at their last English show at Knebworth in 79. This DVD is fantastic zeppelin show and if your fan isn't. N
