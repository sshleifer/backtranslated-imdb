This epic combines superbly talented cast and crew, narrative depth over most novels, amazing music, philosophy and a connection with LIFE that is difficult for me to explain. Diving into Die Zweite Heimat is like a spiritual experience, similar to the respect one gets when looking at stars in a clear night sky. The language and use of both color and monochrome segments contribute to a dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some places, including Edgar Reitz's office. Since then, I have promised to improve my German skills - after Die Zweite Heimat I feel almost German as if I was in the lead. I'm also trying to match Henry Arnold's piano play (Hermann), but this is the only thing that always keeps me going! This drama is unique and I was lucky enough to see it on BBC2 in the UK and SBS in Australia. The sequel, Heimat 3, is currently being shot in Germany.
