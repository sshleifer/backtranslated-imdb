This is undoubtedly the most horrible black and white war film I have watched; Samuel Fuller was the only Western director to approach the intensity and sheer visceral power of the distance during this time. By the way, in September 2002, I took part in the Kon Ichikawy retrospective at the National Film Theater in London, but I managed to capture only some of his works from the 1960s and 1973s. The film is certainly depressing to be considered; however, it also depicts welcome touches of black humor throughout - 'dead' man who wakes up to answer interviewing soldier and readily 'dies' again, deliciously ironic shoe exchange sequence, silencing eccentric telling famous hero which part of the body he should eat, etc. By the way, the script was written by a woman - Natto Wada, the director's own wife! Ichikawa is a versatile and prolific filmmaker whose reputation doesn't have to be as high as it was during his peak years (1956-65), but his direction here is often striking - a surprising pre-credit sequence (the hero is forcibly rebuked by his senior officer for being released from the hospital before he waited!), death of death. impersonating Japanese in the hands of an artillery Filipino woman, bombing a hospital (with medical personnel running to rescue, leaving wounded soldiers to crawl out of their huts at their own limited pace), an automated march in the rain of disillusioned soldiers (which also includes the above a shoe shop that actually resembles a similar scene in ALL QUIET ON THE FRESH FRONT [1930]), a hill dotted with the bodies of soldiers trying to climb it, finals Certainly one of the major film benefits is stunning cinematography of a relentless and desolate muddy landscape. The film is notorious for working on the taboo theme of cannibalism (almost 10 years before it became a foundation). Terrible films), but Ichikawa's approach is not only gentle but highly effective: the body is actually referred to as "monkey meat", while the hero is only seen at the party (and immediately spits out of it together with most of his dilapidated teeth)! ); on the contrary, when a weak underling soldier (played by Mickey Curtis who, despite his name, was a Japanese pop idol of time!) angrily indulges, the land nearby is sprayed with blood. In add-ons, Ichikawa recalls that Method-training lead actor Eiji Funakoshi (whose appearance is unforgettable, incidentally) arrived on the starvation scene - with the result that production was forced to shut down for two weeks until recovered! Donald Richie's perceptive interview favors the nihilism of film over the basic patriotism that has previously appeared in a recent Hollywood ride, such as SUCCESSFUL PRIVATE RYAN (1998). FIRES ON PLAIN are widely regarded as one of his greatest efforts by the director and from several Ichikawa films I have seen are in the spirit of THE BURMESE HARP (1956; another character-driven war movie, but with a spiritual tone that is also available on Criterion's DVD) and ENJO aka CONFLAGRATION (1958; which in fact was given a limited theatrical performance locally, as part of a foreign film week, a few years ago). Personally, I also have a special soft spot for the director's tremendously stylized color extravagance, AN ACTOR'S REVENUE (1963), which I actually caught on the NFT in 1999 and the aforementioned retrospective of 2002.
