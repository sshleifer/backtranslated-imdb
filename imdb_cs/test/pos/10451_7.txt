Yes, it is fast wannabe times, but it's still fun. Some of the comic parts are really funny. The scene where three boys visited a Spanish lady is cheerful with little flamenco music in the background. The reaction when her maritime husband returns home is a rebellion. It is also fun to use boys to handle crabs when they try to "drown" and when they visit a pharmacist. The abortion scene is also a quick exchange of short times, but it does a good job of capturing the fear of the situation. You really feel what Karen is going through, and for Gary in his crazy pulling for the money he pays for abortion and the satisfaction of her recovery. The end is painful to watch but refreshing reality. The first viewers will not be prepared for it and it will be a shock. A good eye candy is available for boys with young girls and a Spanish lady, but heterosexual guys will probably want to skip the penis competition. <br /> <br /> Also underrated soundtrack. Check out early, early U2 (!), The Cars in their premiere and matching tearjerker song by James Ingram for a surprise ending. Some people will hate and that is a bit old, but those who like a teen flick or grew up in the early 1980s should like it.
