I was watching this night at the local station because I didn't feel like watching trips like 'American Idol'. Peter Strauss gives a great performance as a convict named 'Rain' Murphy, who keeps himself. He admits to his crime and gives no bones that has no shame on him. His cell is free of any consolation that other prisoners have like books and pictures. The only time he feels in another zone is running. He does it often and can run a mile in four minutes. When a college coach hears about it, he wants to prepare him for a shot at the Olympics. Initially, 'rain' doesn't want any part of this, but when his best friend is killed, he shows interest. That's a good movie, a season. Strauss is very good (What did you expect, something less?) And Michael Mann shows hints of size that would take a full bloom years later. This film had such realism (probably because it was filmed among the convicts). It's almost like it was a real story. Another cast is good. There's a lot of notable names like Brian Dennehy, Roger E. Mosley, and Richard Moll as well. My heart sank when some pompous board let him escape because he didn't feel bad for his crime. His last act made me stand up and cheer. When his dreams came to him, he took them back hard. It was back when TV movies were really good. "Jericho Mile" is the jewel of the film. ESPN Classic, PLEASE THIS FILM !!!
