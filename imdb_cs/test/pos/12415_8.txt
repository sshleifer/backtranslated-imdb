Two college friends - one upset nerd, the other rude lance - go on a country trip. On the way, they meet a cruel vehicle that looks like a military tank combined with a monster truck trying to launch its car. They escape him, but the mysterious and dangerous driver just gets angry when one of them stops in the upper hatch. Later they pick up a sexy hitchhiker who eventually joins a life-threatening situation. MONSTER MAN is an extremely entertaining horror comedy that has a few good exciting moments and a few good gorians. The two main characters and their constant bickering are fun to watch all on their own and the end insists on a TCM tournament that was very good. Definitely worth checking out.
