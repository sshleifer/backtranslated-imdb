The details in The Big Trail were so incredible that I felt the movie was taken at the time it represented. I've never seen cars that were so real! They were large, full of accessories, and even felt as if they were filled with details beneath canvas covers that should never be seen. Every dirt filth, every scratch, every splinter was there. Modern day computing would never be able to recreate scenes from many wagons moving across the ground or circle to repel Indians. The cars were all real, individual vehicles, each with its own real team of horses or oxen. The actors couldn't feel more real. With the exception of John Wayne's stocking and Marguerite Churchill's pretty dress, the clothes were very casual, torn or dirty in an authentic look. Many actors and actresses were born before there was normal electricity and indoor plumbing, and they had to feel comfortable around. All the Indians were more Indians than white tan accessories. <br /> <br /> Old West women had to be strong because there was a lot of work to do. In every scene that shows the work of the people of the car, women are exposed to cutting wood, pulling logs, and so on. The story of revenge and romance is playing well. Nothing is exaggerated or played. Something was lost on the road in the 1930s in Hollywood. Just as I love the fake scenery and the controlled environment of old movies, The Big Trail can feel really over all the others. The more I see the big budgets of silent era movies, the more I like it. I am thinking of several 1930s movies that I have seen are equal to the grandeur of the best of the twenties. If home movies were made on train days, The Big Trail is what they will look like.
