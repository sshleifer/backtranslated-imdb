The last dinosaur was one of those "out of the blue" movies of the seventies that was very exciting for Tokusatsu fans. Originally went on a theatrical release (around when Dino King Kong was out in the previous December) that was suddenly pulled out and made into Friday night by ABC Movie of the Week. Rankin Bass - who were not foreign to Japanese co-productions, were the weapons behind this production, co-produced with the Tsuburaya Productions of Japan-People who brought us the Ultraman in various forms. Starring mainly American cast including late Richard Boone, Joan Van Ark and late Steven Keats, it narrated the story of a prehistoric pocket of time in what was an overheated volcanic caldera somewhere at the frozen Arctic Circle, containing dinosaurs. He plays a lot like the Land of the Unknown (1956) and The Land, which has forgotten (1975) in feelings and tempo. Sure, dinosaurs were boys in suits (Triceratops with front knees!), But they were filmed in such a way, music and score were so good work, and the cast did a great job that many people didn't care. we took Godzilla. The film has a lot of class, from Nancy Wilson's "The Last Dinosaur" to the overall "big" feeling of film - places on hot springs in northern Japan were excellent and fresh - and the undeniable feeling of Kaiju Eiga. There are some amazing sets of pieces - T-Rex's "bone yard" and a tracking shot that takes us deep into the jungle to see the T-Rex eat giant fish from the creek. Tsuburaya FX people have done their style work here and besides a few risky frosted shots, they do their job well. This film is considered the best "kaiju" film from Japan in 1970, even over five Godzilla films that have been produced during this decade. Rankin Bass has made several other co-productions with Tsuburaya to provide creatures or miniatures - Depths of Bermuda (1978) and Ivory Monkey (1980) - but none timed to the epic appearance of this film.
