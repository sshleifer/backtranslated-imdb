The plot of "Sally of the Sawdust" is the usual melodramatic affair - orphan, rags-to-wealth - but the film rises above most silence thanks to three people: <br /> <br /> This isn't, Of course, DW Griffith is a masterpiece but it shows off his film-making savvy at full maturity. It uses all of its innovations, which are the techniques we take for granted today: close-ups, cross-cutting, mobile cameras and the ability to modify gameplay from theatrical exaggeration to film subtlety. W. C. Fields also demonstrates his skills - not his signature gruff, but his remarkable dexterity as a physical comedian. He does some inventive juggling acts that are too short to be fully appreciated, and some very skillful pocket thefts, but any support that comes within reach seems to be manipulated for comic effects - hat, cane, car roof , dog, money. It's a pleasure to see. Finally, there's Carol Dempster. Much has been said about this actress, but her performance is also richly comic. She was 22 at the time, playing a teenager and her approach to this role is a combination of grace and embarrassment, which may not be entirely convincing, but she really catches the eye when she's on the screen - especially when she dances. It is not beauty - even though it is positively luminous in one scene while she is curious as Sister Talmadge - but her simplicity adds to the character of Sally, especially at many moments when she shows very obvious affection for Fields as her guardian. "father." Few, if any, Hollywood artists could compete with Fields when it came to comedy, but Griffith gives his lead lady every chance to come to terms with his star, and Dempster holds his own.
