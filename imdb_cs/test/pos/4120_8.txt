Almost every commentator mentioned that some of the interviews were translated into concert shots in places. That's right and it's the biggest mistake of this movie. But it's not that often or so bad that this video shouldn't be seen. If you're a Black Sabbath fan, you have to see it. Besides seeing Black Sabbath in the Sevnties and early 1980s, I saw them in 2005 or 2006, when they also titled OZZfest as in this video. The concert was amazing and very similar, so I rented it first. It's just about the best geezer-rock. Check it out.
