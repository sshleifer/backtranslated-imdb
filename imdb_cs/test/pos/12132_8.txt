Surprisingly good "middle street" -type criminal drama. Predicts elements of "Goodfellas" and "Casino". The first big role of Joe Pesci. Clever dialogue. I think this Maltin's guide gives this bomb rating. I can only guess that nobody bothered to look at it. I saw it at the Tarantino Film Festival and said Scorsese used a number of these actors in Raging Bull.
