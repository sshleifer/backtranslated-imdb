I'm a 17, and impressed Muppet fan, and when I love Treasure Island, Christmas Carol, and the Great Muppet Caper, Muppet deserves to be there with the best. It's extremely fun, thanks to Jerry Juhl's clever script, and the movie looks beautiful, with some beautifully staged music numbers. Speaking of songs, I really liked them, they certainly aren't the best song score from the Muppet franchise, but they were very nice to listen to, especially never before. He has never before been one of my favorite songs, Muppet, along with First Time It Happens and Professional Pirate. Muppets as usual were fantastic, especially the beautiful Miss Piggy and the chemistry between Kermit and Fozzie was great. And what about the brilliant human cast - from Bob Hope to Orson Welles, from Madeleine Kahn (the same beautiful actress who brought us fun movies like What's Up Doc?, Blazing Saddles and Clue) to Cloris Leachman, from Steve Martin to Richard Pryer, all who did unforgettable guests performances, if careful not to miss the Muppets in a fantastic movie.
