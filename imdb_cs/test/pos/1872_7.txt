I firmly believe that a film, TV series, or any form of art should and should be fully appreciated once the timing factor is considered when it comes to when to write, produce or conceive. Yeh Jo hai Zindagi is one such series. I remember watching him in the mid-1980s on television and re-running through the videotape library during the early 1990s. and laugh loud and addicted to it. This forced me to buy a whole series of DVDs and surprise surprises - comedy and moments of good "ol days" just fell. Even the very popular "30 Years to Experience" "GULAAAAB JAMUN!" and "Sofa cum bed" did not produce the kind of merriment I thought. Time factor: in the 1980s it was showstopper. The main event. Mother of all television comedies. And it worked in age and time! Now the same can not be said, but watching DVDs has brought pleasant memories. I wish the seasons with Shafi Inamdar and Swarup Sampat were longer. Satish Shah was un-credibly good as the heart of the show, with equally effective support for the cast of Farid Jalal, Tiku Talsania and Bengali neighbors. Rakesh Bedi Hams Worldwide. All in all, the experience that will bring back memories for those who have seen it during the early times may not appeal to younger audiences or to the first observers!
