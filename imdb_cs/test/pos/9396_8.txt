I'm not sure what I can add that has not been told in some of these other fines, and quite hilarious, comments, but I try. So you know, the conspiracy: there's a demon possessed bed that "swallows" and selectively disintegrates the bodies of someone who (or whatever) puts his body with orange soda. We have this man, in some scenes that look unusual like Robert Smith of The Cure, hanging inside the wall and commenting on the action, and we have different sacrifices that can't resist the comfort of this mystical bed. This is not an ordinary bed. No sirree Bob! Not only do they eat people, but they also cleanse themselves, cover the covers and even become themselves. Who wouldn't want such a bed? He may even use his leaves as the basic "lasso" to return to escape to the victims of the escaped victims (especially if they take up half the length of the film to try to escape). Our "main" story (if you can call it) is about these three girls who go to this distant house-to-sit area (???). I don't remember exactly, but it doesn't matter, because there are a lot of things that contradict the convention you just have to give and receive. The dialogue in the film is like no other; the characters seem to talk to each other telepatically because their mouths never move, and there is a constant echo. One of our girls is convinced that the gang does not like the rest of the group, and that it tells us all their feelings about the matter through echoey-voice-over, but we don't care; character development has been fired from the LONG window time before this movie, so why start now? There are scenes when the bed laughs, snoring, crunches, and makes various other sounds that we assume judging by our cast of non-responses to the stated sounds, cant be heard. This and telepathy make it difficult to detect the diegesis problem ... but that's okay .... this is a mortal bed: a bed that eats and resists all logic, so it's OK. This is for the lush dreamy quality of this most bizarre movie if you buy (hehe to buy ... I said "buy"?) This DVD, make sure to check out the director's introduction. He explains that filming this "movie" began in 1972, didn't wrap up until 1977, bought it for years without luck, and then quickly moved 26 by 2003 and released DVD. Probably someone somewhere printed it in some other country and made the bootleg after his bootleg it and it was quite a coincidence, on the board not less that our director found evidence that people knew, and gasped! he took care of his little-known film. It's from him that he decided to do it and deliver it. I'm glad he did. Once you are as many as you have heard the title of this movie, you must see it. I'll buy it and preach his gospel around the world ... from this commentary
