Faith Akin made me realize again the deep passion for this city called Istanbul. Addressed as a city of cultural mosaics, Faith Akin has helped to address the film through a mosaic of music. What's more, in my opinion, the culmination of the film is a scene in which Muzeyyen Senar (Turkish musical diva) sings at the age of 86, just as she did in her younger years, and throws raki glass in the air without spilling. one drop, which is a traditional act in raki culture. It's just amazing. Sezen Aksu (a Turkish pop singer) with her mystical and meaningful look at the end of her song, which gives the film her Turkish title, makes the scene no less than a peak. Last but not least, the beautiful scenery of Istanbul can make you feel nostalgic if you are gone. Attention!
