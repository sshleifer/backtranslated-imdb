Whenever Ida Lupino appeared or made a film in the 1930s, '40s and' 50s, you were guaranteed great fun, even though the picture was black and white. Ida was able to capture the audience and keep them to the very end of her films. In this film as Mrs. Helen Gordon, "High Sierra", "41 along with Robert Ryan, (Howard Wilton)," Golden Gloves, "" 40 will keep you guessing how the relationship will develop and how poor Mrs. Gordon will have normal and happy marriage with love and true affection. If you liked Ida Lupino, who could play the role of a criminal in a female prison prisoner who was hated, this is a movie you enjoy. I really believe Ida Lupino didn't get the real credit she deserved for her great talent in the Film Industry !!!
