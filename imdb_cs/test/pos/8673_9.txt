What we have here is a film ideal for anyone involved in the post-industrial world: those who sit in their privatized house, make money by buying and selling insignificant commodities, and maintaining a system that evaluates little to preserve the self. Beautiful filming (I always appreciate fix 35s and soft boxes) makes it an even more interesting place to go, both pleasant and looking, but it's a scary understanding (maybe it's too much dramatic but true). Andreas's journey through his hell is absolutely tragic. His search is honest, commendable and expensive. The conclusion is necessary and we are not sure if it is better, which is the perfect conclusion. Breve! I highly recommend it to all people who see their world with a critical eye, and especially to those who do not (maybe it will be supported by reflection or two).
