The only problem with Married to the Mob is that it's not funny. She dresses like a romantic comedy, but almost anything that happens is funny. But if you can look at it as a movie where almost nothing fun happens, then you will have a really good time. It's also a glitz mob movie by name. Extremely shimmering. However, director Jonathan Demme is one of the few cult cult directors who have fully and fully embraced the 1980s in their work of this decade, rather than pretending it was still in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> Combining initial credits The 1980s animation, Italian-American American and mission-en-scene flooded each other. From there, despite the 1980s, that's right. Illumination by Demme Tak Fujimoto's cinematographer and jukebox soundtrack is characterized by widely changing pop and alternative jams. Demme is good at varied instant characters in his visual and sometimes seemingly impulsive composition of a fun mix of styles, conspiracies that could go in any way where a smooth FBI agent, playing a very weak Matthew Modine, is trying to penetrate a mafia family, seeing a chance when The Gun Minor, played with the horrible love of Michelle Pfeiffer, attempts to abandon the criminal lifestyle after her husband trigger man, in what you would have hoped for in Alec Baldwin's performance. The way it works for a while, because Demme has a steady hand on the bike. She knows the importance of showing us the very subjective and portable scenes of life at home with Pfeiffer, as well as her worries and desires as a morally conflicting mother, though her relationship with Joey is a bit for granted. What son of a gangster is listening to a party-pooper mom when the boss's dad was playing with Dean Stockwell's trademark and by far the scene she was stealing, is it amazing gifts? Overall, however, Demme is easily perceived as a novel in a fun story about a criminal thriller with annoying stylizations. Finally, however, we find out that we are going wrong because, inevitably, Modine and Pfeiffer must fall in love. This is not inherently bad, and every now and then it actually feels bearable, but as a romantic subplot, it is not handled intriguingly or well, barely at all, because it jumps over various different clich√©s that meet the initial expectations of a cheesy 1980s date, and for this audience, I think it has the right impact. But for someone who's really interested in the story and the aesthetic approach, it's a break into the tedia state. So it's a decent movie with huge missteps at certain points, but as a Data Movie or nostalgic piece for those who grew up in the 80s, they may have seen many data movies in the 1980s, a fun value it is not so likely to fluctuate, except for the aforementioned deficit in real laughter. Maybe there are a few mockery and it's a very broadly linguistic face, but I wouldn't leave a comic aisle with high hopes I initially entered. Either way, there are other pleasures in the bit roles of the great actors who have so far started to fade, like Nancy Travis, Joan Cusack and Oliver Platt.
