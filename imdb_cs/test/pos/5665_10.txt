Giorgino is a long, unbearable journey from bad to worse in the life of the protagonist after whom the film is named. A young demobilized, gas-poisoned First World War Lieutenant of very sensitive health, who had previously been a physician at a children's children's home with some mental deprivation, goes to find his new place and finds much more than he ever intended. of another nature. The depressing atmosphere of ultimate despair, where freaks are much less terrible than healthy, where madness is a kind of poetry, will keep you in hypnotism from the first shots of this film to the last. And all the beauty: the beauty of winter and mountains, the beauty of snow-covered landscapes and wild forests, I don't even know how all the sorrows and sorrows of the last days of war could have been so beautiful.
