I grabbed the movie on the end of the tape I used to capture the movie I really wanted to see again. When I saw the name of Raquel Welch in the opening credits, I decided to follow it. It was actually slightly fun, and took me back "in the machine track" to farcical movies that Hollywood set out in the 1960s, much in the same genre as contemporary Austin Powers stuff. Oh acting wasn't great, not a plot, but it was worth watching. There was some beautiful scenery, though Mrs. Welch was the most enjoyable of it. Tape it if you get a chance and watch it when you have nothing else to do. It's not a snoozer, but you won't even move in the aisles that want more.
