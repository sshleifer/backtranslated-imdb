I'm trying to be diverse in my movie watching. I can get into "Pride and Prejudice" as easily as I get into "Falling Deeds". Love Jones is my favorite time, it's the standard I judge any modern urban romantic comedy. Shot very well, the shot of Nia and Darius riding the Lakeshore Drive on a motorcycle is one of the classic 3 second movies of all time. Of course, nobody ever remembers it. When it came out, though, it would be a new paradigm for making a modern urban film, a good actor, no weapons, and so on. The film industry disappointed me to some extent, you will have the occasional Drumline, or the Roll Bounce, or Tyler Perry's "Why I Married". So whenever I need to see "my people" that are presented on the screen in a very professional and stylish way, I will go to Love Jones. There is no best movie ever made for many people and opinions on it. But it's my personal best. My favorite line from Love Jones "Baby, I just want to come and talk!"
