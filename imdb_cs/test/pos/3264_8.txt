Based on my current IMDb rating and several graph summaries, I didn't expect much from "two hands". But how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> From start to finish you'll be deeply immersed in a genre that has been unoriginal for a long time. Even in the field of mise-en-scene and cinematography, the director excels and creates a film with great imagination. If you're looking for a movie that's not only fun, but also provocative, convincing and truly extraordinary, make it the next movie you're watching. I hope Heath Ledger's tragic death will lead to more people getting this film. It was an incredible talent and his performance is not to be missed. Don't make the mistake of judging and eliminating this amazing movie before you saw it.
