So well made, no CGI crap. Was anyone else on the "Jumping Crocs" tour of Darwin's Adelaide River before? Black Water was realistic; Rogue was a little cringeworthy. The idea that the blond cat was excellent - she hadn't seen her before. And the other cat is a child, always excellent. V. Thrilling - I would compare it to the jaws of every other person who ate the fast moving animals. Got an Aussie hole on the pat without going OTT with struths and crikeys. <br /> <br /> He loved it!
