Mud and sand is one of the spoofs of Stan Laurel's popular films at the time, this one being Rudolph Valentino's blood and sand (hence Stan being Rhubarb Vaselino). While partly inconsistent on characterization (as he defeated those bulls at the beginning is not explained), this was mostly funny from start to finish with one of the best sequences to be dancing he makes with his then common wife of law, Mae Laurel. Another funny sequence concerns his reluctance to romance the femme fatale, Filet de Sole, while his wife, Caramel, awaits him, which shows some looks at his later innocent character with Oliver Hardy. It is worth seeing for all those interested to see Mr. Laurel's early work before his fateful teaming that made him popular around the world.
