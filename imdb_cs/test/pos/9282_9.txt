This is the first movie I've seen from Singapore and it's great. If you don't know much about Asia, its languages, and its culture, then this film may be a bit confusing to uninformed people. As an Asian American who has a dual specialization in two Asian languages ​​(one of them is Mandarin) and has some classes of Asian American studies, this film was easier for me to understand, but even without this kind of knowledge, I believe that this film is still accessible to your foreign audience if you realize that this is a type of movie that is close to age. The movie is definitely worth seeing just so that you get a chance to see what problems Singapore's young teenage boys are facing and have to deal with. It's an amazing movie, but it was filming and showing itself in a more artistic and original way. The actors are excellent.
