This film brought me to tears. I have to say that if I didn't have a beautiful husband at home, I would ask this beautiful art to marry me. Aaron Carter gives a masterful performance as a confused young pop star, while Timothy Barton writes a quick and witty dialogue that only supports Carter's genius. Kyle is quite gay, but his performance was nothing less than spectacular. She is also very handsome and cute. I'm thinking of asking him for a date and giving him a very sweet good night gift.) <br /> <br /> Please contact me if you want to discuss this in the future.
