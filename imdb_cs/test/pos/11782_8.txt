Of all the star wars I have seen, it is probably the most fun. Not because of Star Wars with simple electronics instead of spacecraft, but because of how badly behaved. This is deliberately redesigned, and it makes it hilarious, and since everyone knows that its intentionally overacted, no one complains. Special effects were also intentionally as terrible as they can be, and include a toaster on the visible string that shoots toast, and an egg beater on a string. This short is fun for all fans of Star Wars (which I am not) or someone who has 15 minutes to kill. Great short !! <br /> <br /> My rating: *** outside ****. 13 minutes. Not rated.
