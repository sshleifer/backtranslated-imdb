It's one of my favorite TV series. Beautiful cast, great script and scenic ride. Watching the Kyle routine is a guarantee of great moments of humor and great comedy performers. Let's see: - Damon Wayans: no comments. Today it is one of the best. He has perfect timing and always gets to the point of wit. Tisha Campbell: Her paranoid and sentimental Jay is just amazing to see. George O. Gore II: ideal for paper. It's impossible to imagine someone else as adorable (and stupid) Junior. Jennifer Nicole Freeman: The egocentric Claire has found the perfect actress. Beautiful and talented. Parker McKeen Posey: I can't fall in love with her. Noah Gray-Cabey: This boy has a future, I'm sure <br /> <br /> I'm very sad when it ends but this show will be in my mind forever. Michael, Jay, Claire, Junior, Kadie ... we love you!
