The last dinosaur is a movie to be fun and exciting. It succeeds in doing both. Maston is a great hunter hunter who hunts a big game (go number). He owns a company he plans for an expedition with a group of people, including a photographer named Frankie, a Japanese scientist, a guy who works for his company called Chuck, and an African guy who helped him on many safari called Bun Ta. . It is a study of what is considered a Tyrannosaurus Rex, a dinosaur who killed the last expedition to this area. They will get to this prehistoric area, taking a drilling vehicle that travels underwater called the Polar Borer. After getting into the area, they soon found a Tyrannosaurus who was trying to shoot Maston, but his gun was stuck. Chuck immediately feels that Maston wanted to hunt a dinosaur all the time to add him to his "Stuffed Animals" collection. When they were gone, the Tyrannosaurus attacks their camp and takes the polar Borer out of their camp. Upon returning, the group realizes that they may be longer in the area than expected, and Maston says he will kill the Tyrannosaurus. The story is great for sci-fi movies. Drilling into a prehistoric area is something that seems to actually happen. The scenery is beautiful and looks like a place where dinosaurs can still be found. I also liked the characters in this movie. Maston is a typical big time hunter who wants to get anything that could be a trophy kill. Also big was Bun Ta, played by Luther Rackley before the NBA, who really looks and works like an African tracker. Jackie is a typical woman who causes problems to a group and does not seem to be in the wild. Chuck is a former Maston employee who has a perspective on changing his boss when he is in the wild. Tyrannosaurus in this movie is one of the best in the movie. He stands a little too up, like Godzilla does and pulls his tail, so he's a suit guy. But the suit looks good, especially the head and tail, and Tyrannosaurus looks good and very scary. I've seen a lot of other movies where dinosaur suits look worse. Tyrannosaurus in this film sometimes publishes a roar sounding like Godzilla's and other times roar as King Kong from "King Kong Escape" and "King Kong vs Godzilla". So great Tyrannosaurus. There's a lot of action in the last dinosaur. The peculiarity is the great struggle between Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops. Also a great scene where Bun Ta tries to spear Tyrannosaurus. There are other great parts that I didn't give away. You have to convince yourself. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. Watch it and you won't be disappointed.
