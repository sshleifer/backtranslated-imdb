This excellent 40 years after the classic war, tends to be overlooked by these <br /> <br /> days. When it was released in 1945, it tidied up at 1946 <br /> <br /> Oscars, mostly at the expense of `It's a wonderful life. 'Both movies were for best film, best <br /> <br /> director, and best actor, all won ?? Best Years'. Frederic March, <br /> <br /> and Dana Andrews along with amateur actor Harold Russell (real-life soldier lost both hands in the blast) <br /> returning soldiers, find life is very different from what you remember <br /> <br />. Myrna Loy is great as the March wife who has to keep the <br /> <br /> family together while he was gone. Jumping tears the scene where March and Loy are reconciled is wonderful. All three <br /> <br /> men find they have trouble adjusting after the war, not at least Russell gets on with his hands and his money <br /> <br /> (Cathy O'Donnell) is trying to be too helpful. Sam Goldywn is quoted as saying that he does not care for the film to make any money until everyone sees the movie in America, so <br /> <br /> will appreciate what these men have gone through. If the movie has 10 out of 10, it's this one.
