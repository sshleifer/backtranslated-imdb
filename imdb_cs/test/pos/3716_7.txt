Pierre Jolivet plays Don Quixote's character, unable to speak, to live in a world incompatible with modern life. He believes in his home furnishings - helmet, sleeves and spear - made of cases, cushions and discarded office furniture. Like Don Quixote, he went to Rocicante, "The Man" rides on his counterpoint, literally, transcending lost lives, captured by the harsh and humiliating modern world - hovering over the earth, far from the suffering of modern man. Both characters go in search of adventure in an effort to correct the wrongs of the world. Both characters are guardians of the knights of values ​​unknown to most other characters in the story. Unlike Cervantes' story, in this film we identify directly with the anachronistic ideals of the main character. We can only compare this extraterrestrial and forbidding landscape with the lush and beautiful world in which we live. Our reference framework is the fantasy area that the lone knight remembers. Our vision would be one that expects the main character to triumph, beat, change his world (for the better) back to a world that no longer exists. We are looking at this film and seeing a true knight among the world of humans as animals. Don Quixote considered himself a true knight among the animals. With Cervantes' story we can only see the dreamer without understanding the extent of his anachronistic displacement. In the story of Besson and Jolivet, we see a new world out of the eyes of Don Quixote because we value the same visions and ideals as the main crusader character.
