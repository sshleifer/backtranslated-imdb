When I watch this movie I'm also excited to see the scenes of the miss world scene. She has a beautiful and charming body. When a cute lady into the bed scene and show her a fully naked body ... I think the man has a hard time resisting .... I think his time for cute girls like hrishita bhatt also nude scenes. At least no one wants to make a naked body of ugly women like Seema biswas c in a bandit queen. I agree with what mallicka.b said. The movie is displayed in a way that seems to be a kind of defamation of the original content. Emotions are not transmitted correctly. I think that some of the poor performances contributed to his mediocrity. In my opinion, Tabu would be a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes she looks a little lusty, which is not what the movie should show. I also noticed a little exaggeration in some scenes. I'm a bitter critic of Aishwaryi Rai :) I can't help him; Sorry about that. 'Raincoat' was a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali when I saw the raincoat; I wasn't impressed at all
