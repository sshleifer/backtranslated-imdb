Sharky's machine is a criminal drama that originated in Atlanta in the early 1980s. He plays Burt Reynolds as a renegade who is in hell stopping crime and corruption in his city. The story is about a dirty politician who is at the top of a criminal circle that connects the city to his knees. Sharky's reference to the overthrow of this syndicate is a highly valued hooker that is clamped during the film. Action sequences are well done in the early 80's and the soundtrack / scores are pretty good. Acting is a B-level, but it's a pretty decent movie to have in your DVD collection. <br /> <br /> Overall 7/10 <br /> <br /> Buggieblade
