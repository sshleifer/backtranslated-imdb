I know Chill Wills usually played nice old species in western countries. But his role in this segment is something I have long remembered. Wills could be the first villain. Yes, Burgess Meredith's Fall was right! It looks into Hepplewhite's eye! Suddenly she expressed the greed of pigs, ignorance and the threat of violence. I think quite a performance, <br /> <br /> The segment itself was also good. Question: couldn't a small black bag cure alcoholism? I think it was like this with Fall. But the doctor would be wise to apply the drug if he had it as quickly as possible to Hepplewhite. There is one moment that was unpleasant but also necessary. And it is something that repeats in the Night Gallery segments. It's Serling's constant need to preach. That's what we got once again with Dr. Fall. I don't know what was more frustrating, losing the black bag and all her miracles, or not, to stop Fall from preaching about the benefits of a bag for humanity, all while rubbing Hepplewhite's greedy face in the mud, and therefore, everyone except begging Hepplewhite hit him . But as I say, it was necessary. At least it was for me. Otherwise, we could not see the performance of the Wills we discussed above. Everything happens without moving the muscle or speaking a word.
