I really enjoyed this movie. I am not usually one for fairy tales or do believe the floor, but this movie has caught my attention. For the first time I saw this movie on the British channel Hallmark ... which usually shows a handsome movie guy ... but then the Snow Queen came ... and I loved it! I really admire Bridget Fund in this movie ... playing brilliantly and gracefully the snow queen. I will not explain what the story is like other people have done, so there is no repetition point. I'd just like to suggest that if you want to watch a fun fairytale trip ... get this movie ... but if you want to buy it and live in the UK, maybe you will have a hard time. I bought it from South Korea brand new (of course English edition).
