WOW !! Talk about a movie that distributes viewers! This is real love, or it hates the movie. I really enjoyed it. I noticed that other reviews compare it with Pitch Black - that's a little stupid, because the only thing they have in common is SAND! People can be real stupid. No, this movie is much more common with The Thing (as people don't realize it's amazing - they even have the same basic music) Lots of carpentry touches are there, heroes of blue collars, sharp humor, endless rolling lands full of death and things that not understood. Perhaps what stops this movie is a real classic is it's respect for other carpentry work. Last but not least, the Dark Star with which he has something in common. I wonder how much it costs? $ 8000? Is it even possible? Maybe it was based on a short film that cost $ 8,000? But when I died, I found myself strangely moved. They are so underestimated that it's like watching documentary at times. He said the script is a bit clunky and only about half of them can act and I'm not sure if one of them is big. But his gun is amazing! Give him a chance, if you like the former Carpenter, you can do it, just don't expect 2001.
