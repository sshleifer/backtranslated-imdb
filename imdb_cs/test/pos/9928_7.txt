Betty is like a subconscious in the production of Verdi's Macbeth, who is asked to continue when a diva is injured in a traffic accident. However, in the great tradition of "Scottish Games", production looks cursed with problems, at least which is some lunatic carving crew. Unfortunately for Betty, the killer seems to have special plans for her ... <br /> <br /> This is one of several must-see Argento crazy-slasher flicks, in this case especially for the extraordinary photo of great British cameraman Ronnie Taylor. I did not measure it, but I expect that about two-thirds of the footage in this film relates to either pans, dollies, watching or cranes - the sheer amount of camera movement is just overwhelming and the film is ten times exciting than the standard thriller. The pictures are wild and dizzy - detailed images of heroic eyes forced by nails opened, sliding sail around the opera house from the raven's point of view, shots of a brain killer, bullet shooting by peephole, swallowed chain kicked out the victim's trachea. Conceptually, it is simply amazing and could only be realized by this director. However, the film has no shortcomings; the casts are at best variable - Marsillach and Barberini are both a bit uncertain (and its dubbing in the English version is scary, even by Italian standards), although Argento's regular Nicolodi is fun and Charleson gives a thoughtful performance in a role that is more than little autobiographical (horror director very malevolent for his remoteness and reliance on technique). The material is a nice three-way mix of The Phantom Of The Opera, Shakespeare and the slasher film, written by Argento and his usual collaborator, Franco Ferrini, with a delicate suspicious galore and the usual disdain for boring showcases to explain what's going on. . Full of various kinds of music - Brian Eno, Claudio Simonetti, Bill Wyman, Puccini and of course Verdi. The scenes in the beautiful opera house were shot at the Teatro Regio in Parma. For some bizarre reason, the British press of this film has the alternative name Terror At The Opera.
