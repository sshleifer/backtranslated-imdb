Driving Lessons From the writer of critically acclaimed films, Mrs. Brown and Charlotte Gray, Jeremy Brock brings a heartfelt dramatic play with Oscar nominations Julie Walters and Laura Linney and Harry Potter, Rupert Grint. A beautiful portrait tells the story of Ben Marshall, (Rupert Grint), a 17-year-old boy who was captured in the heart of his religious neurotic mother Laura (Laura Linney). At the end of the school year, she decides to work with a clever, free and "heavy bottle" actress, Evie Walton (Julie Walters). The couple embarks on wonderful adventures from camping, strolling around, on simple life talks. With the challenge of a native mother, as well as with each other, they develop two beautiful ties that revolutionize both their lives. . Brock uses his unique style to create an infamous and loving nature that directors could only dream of for the first time. The director naturally comes to Brock by building stunning images that break up the surfaces and throw the viewer in excess of adoration and creation. Even the subtle scores of unknown composers Clive Carroll and John Renbourn underscore the tone and the way Brock did not have generation problems. Laura Linney is always in her films as Laura. Bossy and superior mother is sometimes unbearable and with Linney at the helm we are flooded into that personality. The complexity of her character could not be flawlessly portrayed by anyone else. Rupert Grint breaks away from "Ron Weasley" and tries someone new. His performance is more responsive than flattering, but the Grint gives us a brand new baby performance and the viewer can enjoy it. But the standout comes from an Oscar nominee Julie Walters who gives "Evie" her own life. Despite the fact that the role is clearly the leading figure, Walters is better placed in the supporters' category, where I believe he will simply take the prize home. "Evie" is a mix of "Clementine Kruczynski" and "Mrs. Laura Henderson" with her free spirit and loving personality. Hopefully, her role will not be unnoticed by this award of the season. Driving lessons are not "out of this world" experience, but subtle, pleasant that every viewer could just kick back and learn a little about life, love and friendship in the form of the most beautiful colors and sizes. <br /> <br /> Class: *** / ****
