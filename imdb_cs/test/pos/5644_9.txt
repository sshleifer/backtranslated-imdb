I got this film one week after Ichikawa Kona's death - I suppose there is one way to mark the passing of a great director to take a glass of wine and watch one of his biggest films. Ichikawa had one of the best careers in Japanese film, but as he never had a distinctive style or theme he often seems to be disregarded compared to his close contemporaries such as Ozu and Kurosawa (he was a little younger than them, but not much). He is one of those directors who defy the author's theories - his likelihood that his wife (who wrote the script for this and many others of his films) was equally responsible for the quality of films like him. But at that time he was as good as any Japanese filmmaker. In particular, he had great technical skills, which allowed him to tell complex stories in an accessible way. But as for the subject, this film could hardly be easier - war is hell. Not really, his really hell. Fire on the plane does not follow the rules of the ordinary war genre. There is no real beginning - we start as a pathetic Tamura, who is a regular private (although it is indicated that he is more thoughtful and educated than most - one stage shows that he understands English, but vampire when others ask him how it knows) is ordered to the hospital because his unit is already in a frightening state. Soldiers are defeated and starved to death. They are no longer an army, just a group of refugee rags - hunted by locals and Americans who have larger fish to fry. Hunger and despair drive the soldiers to the brink and madness. <br /> <br /> In a typical Ichikawa style, it's not all gloomy - its strange funny parts (of course, very black humor). /> <br /> The highlight of this film for me is excellent performance from leading and live photos. The characters, in all their humanity, but also their complete loss of humanity, are too believable. That's the rare movie - the one that refuses to get out of your head, even if you want to forget it.
