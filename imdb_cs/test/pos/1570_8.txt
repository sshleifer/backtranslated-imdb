It's a sad state of Hollywood in business when the film surprises you by not taking the routes you saw in the movie house from day one. I had no idea how this film would end because he left when I expected it to go right, zigzag when I expected it to happen, etc. This could easily untangle into a generic tense thriller or a depressing drama of white waste , but it remained a course all its own until the end. But it is a sad story. Not because of what happens to Alice, but because of the sad world that surrounds her and leads her along that path. The storyline has a calm dignity form that is usually reserved for theater, but stimulation use some tightening up. Either way, it's a very good movie, and for some reason I suspect sour grapes from those who scored this low.
