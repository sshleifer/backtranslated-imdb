This wonderful movie is a love story and shows that not all relationships are destined to endure. Even so, they can be great and worth the pain and suffering of breakup. Director Pieter Verhoeff gives us a look at the period around 1900, the way society treats women, and how very strong a woman deals with. With great costumes, landscapes, beautiful music and good actors, and acting on this image, you will be drawn into the length of the film. Initially, the end is a bit sudden, a page describing the rest of the life of the scrolls. At consideration, this is a great (best) way to create your own fantasy for the rest of your life. This was the second movie for me to have people sit while the final titles shifted (The First Schindler List). The film seems to have had this effect on everyone.
