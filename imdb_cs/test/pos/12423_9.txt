Michael Davis's Great Horror Comedy. A great performance by Eric Jungman as a good guy who saves the day and a great performance of Jack-esquire as Justin Urich's performance. There was only divine in this film. This guy deserves to be a big star. Also, Aimee Brooks was good in the film, as was a girl in danger, along with the killer boys resembling Jeepers Creepers. Gore was in abundance and I loved it. I just hope they release unrated versions. Great low budget horror comedy. The dead cat in the hotel's sex scene is just so funny! ***** outside *****
