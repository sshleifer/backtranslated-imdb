True love, I really enjoyed it and loved this movie. It was fun, funny and inspiring. I saw it on DVD. How I miss this one, it's a winner! I think Flex was "The guy." I wanted to marry him. It was my first time when I saw him as a direct leader and he pulled him away. I thought Tangi Miller was the best and I was Felicity too. An intrepid woman who just worries Nana. Thank you for making the women a color gamut in your work and looking great! Tasha Smith was a blast! Aloma Wright was invaluable as Nana. This cute romantic comedy is "Must See". Oh and the new comedian Marcus Patrick is worth the surprise of the lady ... True love. Karen
