If you want to see the true, outrageous nature of communism, look at DARK BLUE WORLD. (Blue World) Describes how brave Czech pilots who refused to surrender fled to England to join the Nazis. After the war, the Communists feared that they had taken dangerous Western ideas about freedom. So they had these heroic Czech pilots thrown into a frightening prison where some of the guards were the same Nazis to risk their lives to defeat. If Hollywood wants to understand why so many of their films fall flat, they should compare the character drama of "Pearl Harbor" with this movie. In Dark Blue World, you really connect to all the characters. At Pearl Harbor, everyone is like some neat cartoon version of a real person. There are countless examples of brilliant writing in this film. One funny scene that holds in my head is when the character of Charles is taught by English rather formal English. When he cannot pronounce a word, he scoffs at the lesson. In typical Stoic English, the teacher calmly, but strongly confronts Charles, and embarrasses him. <br /> <br /> The air battle sequences in this movie are amazing and help keep the movie alive. I read that it cost $ 11,000 an hour to rent an aircraft, but it cost every penny. Ladies, you expect to cry for sad movies, but guys .... watch out! This film would general General Patton cry. And if you are a dog lover, you will use half the Kleenex box. Don't say I warned you.
