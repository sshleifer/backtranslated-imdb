What can I say about this film in addition to the story is one of the most interesting in film history ... and based on the true story! Old enough to remember the Berlin Wall when they were still using it, this film contains a dark look at the gloomy imprisonment of East Berlin and their desperate attempts to escape, regardless of price. The film follows the lives of two families who decide to escape using the hot air balloon they produce. Despite fears of arrest by the authorities, under the supervision of neighbors, they have to calculate a plan to get to the other side of the wall. A tense and exciting story of courage and determination that truly pays tribute to all who have succeeded and failed in a treacherous journey to West Berlin and freedom.
