Despite its New York scene and characters in New York, "Summer in the City" is not an American movie, it's better than this. Mixing styles and genres is most unusual. Director Niami shows a quick touch combining comedy with tragedy, a pathos with drama. The secret of success Niami seems to be a bigboard of great characters - everyone could have his own movie around him - and then fill them with beautifully executed performances from one of the most beautiful eclectic casts he could find in the same country , let alone in the same film, from Bai Ling to Ornella Muti, Robert Burke to Peter Stormare, who shows that he has a lot more in it than the bad stereotypes he plays in Hollywood photos. Even Sandra Bernhard is funny here! Another bonus is cream on a substantial cake.
