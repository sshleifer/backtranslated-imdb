I loved this movie and I never knew it was the old one that came out the day n year I was born, and now I'm 19 now I still love this movie, especially songs like "My Mother" and "Boys and Girls Rock N Roll "and I remember how a kid I believe I was 5 n my sister was 6 and my cousin (boy) was 6 anyway we used to pretend to be characters in the movie I was Eloner and Janette and my sister was Britany and my cousin was Alvin Simon and Theodore were good times and I miss it and have this movie reminds me of good times because my cousin is old for this and so I and my sis won't forget the chipmunk and squirrel movie I still remember songs and words away with my heart even though I haven't seen this movie for 12 years but now starts to love again ALVIN AND CHIPMUNKS AND CHIPETTES <3 <3 <3 <3
