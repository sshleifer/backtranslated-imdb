"My wife and children," in my opinion, is an absolute classic of ABC! I haven't seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. There are many episodes I have enjoyed. One of them was where Junior (George O. Gore II) obtained a driving license. If you want to know why, you have to see it for yourself. Before I wrapped it up, I'd like to say that everyone has always done a good job, production design has been spectacular, costumes have been well designed, and writing has always been very strong. In conclusion, although this can be seen in the syndication now, I strongly recommend that you only catch it in case it looks good.
