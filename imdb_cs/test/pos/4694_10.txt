I accidentally ordered a BBC series, their new version of Robin Hood. Very unsatisfactory compared to RoS. Terrible costumes and background. While I enjoyed the sheriff, who took the allusion to Nick Grace's character, the rest of the cast remained much to wish for. Like "for example" Marion's costume looked suspiciously like Walmart. And Sir Guy, well, looked a bit like a character from the Universe movie! RoS stole the spotlight, probably forever, in telling this story. Cast, costumes, storylines, scenery, filming and the Clannad soundtrack are excellent, as evidenced by all the 26 years of continuous feedback. RoS is a timeless classic. Thank you all who did the series.
