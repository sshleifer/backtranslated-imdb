Dekalog Five was an interesting viewing experience for me because Kieslowski seems to be gently asking the audience. Three men deal with this chapter, and Kieslowski presents two who are involved in the murder, with special features both good and bad (in one case, almost overwhelmingly bad). With such disgusting characters I found myself almost glad to get some punishment. But when it comes time to murder (And this is a subsequent effect on the killer), Kieslowski takes an interesting angle and seems to ask those of us who share my opinion: "Aren't you as guilty as this man?" audience addresses make the final Decalog five that profoundly deeper as Kieslowski (as usual) does not remain in the literal boundaries of his theme. Like the other parts of the Decalogue, the Decalogue Five does not take the theme of their commandments in its literal sense. He asks us what is a murder that is more guilty of murder, and what should be the appropriate punishment, if any? It's a fantastic movie, typical of Kieslowski, absolutely stunning.
