Red Skelton plays radio detective known as "The Fox" in "Whistling in the Dark," also starring Ann Rutherford, Conrad Veidt, Eve Arden, Virginia Gray and Ragland Ragland. Wally Benton, aka "Fox" finds his plans to marry his fianc√© Carol (Rutherford) thwarted when he is kidnapped by a false cult leader (Veidt). Joseph Jones (Veidt) has just learned that his cult, Silver Haven, does not receive the promised legacy due to the existence of an old woman's nephew who will live out of interest. He wants Wally to devise a perfect murder conspiracy so that a man can be killed in a plane en route to meet his lawyer. For backup, and because he's not sure which one is Wally's fiance, Jones kidnaps Carol and also the daughter of radio sponsors (Gray). This, for me anyway, is an excellent movie for the second recording of this series, "Whistling at Dixie." The storyline is better, the cast is better, there is less grotesque and less corny jokes. Skelton, when he doesn't make faces and returns his eyes, is quite friendly and Rutherford is very good. Veidt always played these evil men to perfection. Eva Arden is Agent Wally who sets a date for him and Gray to make sure the contract is renewed. I've only seen Gray in movies since the fifties. She was always a good-looking woman, but who knew she was such a knockout in the 1930s and 1940s? This is a fun movie with an elegant cast.
