I love the memories of watching this visually dazzling movie as a child in the late 1970s and early 1980s on TV wor-tv (now up-9) in New York. Although it is the product of the swinging 1960s, this film has barely grown old. The effects are as miraculous as in 2001 and in some ways superior (the work of the model is flawless). JTTFSOTS with an attractive cast, great color photo and scenographic design and evocative score is the winner!
