Eve is an eye opener because of the great scenery and tech-no music in the background, we hear. This film shows a good aspect of the human body, which is God's creation, and to pay attention to it, viewers can earn respect for the legendary story of Adam and Eve (whether it's true or fairy tale, depending on what we believe) . watching this movie. Actress / model Inger Ebeltoft's personification of Eve is so good is not a good word to describe her performance, and I can't imagine that another actress was Eva. This movie for me comes really handy for the type of stress relief therapy. We've never been so relaxed before we watched this movie. This movie is a masterpiece, God allegedly wanted this film to be made in the first place! Mr. Pan Razbin!
