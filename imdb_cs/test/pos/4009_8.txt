Most of the criticism of "show attack" is from people who are unfairly comparing it with an old computer television program called "screen savers". People are upset because the G4 has decided to cancel "Screensavers" and replace it with a "Attack on Show" pop culture. To compare two shows is like comparing apples with oranges! "Attack of the Show" is a unique hourly program that covers the current generation of X / Y culture. It features segments on movies / television, panel discussions, video games, new DVD releases, sex advice, new gadgets (MP3 players, cell phones, etc.), comic books / graphic novels, magazines and internet fads. <br /> <br /> It's a fun show that's definitely worth being in 20s or 30s. I give him 8 out of 10.
