The First Reviewer Is Right - In this film we see ourselves, snuggle to most, are pleasant, try to stay out of trouble, just try to live our lives and see how easily these very human traits are so crucial to the functioning of society lead us to become complicit in great evil. The story takes place during World War II, with radio, newspapers, and movies that remind us of Hitler's attacks on Jews to underline the irony of the same kind of violent anti-Semitism that takes place in America. Sometimes it seemed a little hard to me. It's more like a game than a movie, but it's such a provocative idea that such quarrels mean little. Perhaps less trivial is the fact that the whole conspiracy hangs one small fact that I thought was somewhat improbable. Larry lived a carefree life until the middle age; but all that is needed is to wear glasses on himself - EVERYONE - at first glance he will take him as a Jew. I reluctantly rejected the mistrust because the conspiracy kept me moving, but infallibility bothered me throughout the film. (And frankly, I didn't understand why his wife was also married to a Jew. Larry seemed to think that because her name was "Hart." And later, when he married her, I don't know why his neighbors were supposed to be in the first part of the movie I wondered if there would be elements of fantasy. Larry's dissatisfaction seemed exaggerated, almost to the point of grotesque. Why not call the police to see rape, even if the attacker was a neighbor? I thought the lighting seemed to indicate something somewhat unreal - the red from the houses seemed too red, Gertrude's entrance seemed deliberately overflowed, the colors were almost like crayons in their intensity. In credits I see it was filmed on Campbell Avenue and Wallace Avenue in Toronto, so I plan to go today (near Bloor & Dufferin) to look at the colors. Really :) It was good to remember that at that time the clergymen often led the evil of racism. (Remember, as the Pope refused to speak against Hitler, he was just trying to get protection for the Church? By the way, he was the same Pope who, when Rome was about to liberate the US troops, asked that the first soldiers enter the city is not black Check your history. It is a pity, it is certainly a great concern for every thinking person, anyone interested in American history or racism, one of the brightest illustrations I've ever seen in Bertrand Russell's dictation: "Don't go wrong with the crowd."
