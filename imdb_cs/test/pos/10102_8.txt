I watch many movies, but my genre is number one Asian horror. I just bought this DVD and originally I found "Janghwa, Hongryeon" an interesting but confused movie because I didn't understand many parts of the story. But I saw a message in the IMDb Board entitled "Explaining Masterpiece (All Your Questions Answered) Faster Load" written by Opiemar, and I was impressed by the high quality explanation that this user provided to viewers like me who missed the story points. I would like to congratulate Opiemar on his excellent work and suggest that he write the correct summary of this film in IMDb to help and help other viewers. Finally, I agree that "Janghwa, Hongryeon" is a great Korean movie, but I will not give ten in my vote, because very few people can afford to see the same movie more than once, like this movie it requires, and without the great support of opiemar, I would not be able to understand the story as a whole. I intend to see this film again in the near future. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Medo" ("Fear")
