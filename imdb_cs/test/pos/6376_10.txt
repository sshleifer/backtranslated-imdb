Deviyaan Teen is a great movie. A very fresh entertainer and a very modern film for his time in the 1960s. Music and songs are amazing, though the words Majrooh are insignificant in places. Dev Anand is a huge star and as usual has a big role in his role. Kalpana is sexy and Nanda is fine. Simi is also OK. The film has an amazing dialogue with Vrajendra Gaura, who wrote most of Deva Ananda's films as Mahal, Duniya, Warrant, Jaali Note, Manzil, etc.etc. It's the story of Deva, who attracts three women - the mod Kalpana, Simi and Nanda home. He finally chooses Nanda. The story is about OK, but his story was narrated in a grasping manner and dialogue and songs and the great Dev Anand are the highlight of the film. And they have to watch a movie for all Dev Anand fans.
