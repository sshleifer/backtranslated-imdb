I grabbed this show several times, when I was young and it was in favor, My parents loved it and now I feel what they feel in the syndication. This show showed what the original boundaries and twilight zone (new and old) couldn't do. This show used some old ideas and some truly original ideas. I still can't believe Jonathan Glassner and brad wright did it. These guys were manufacturers on Stargate sg-1. The show kept the audience rooted in the story and set a really frightening atmosphere. This wasn't in the new twilight zone. Rod serling arrived and joined the forest in a mood. The end, whether good or bad, did for awesome time. You could never predict what would happen. I'm still trying to find a season on DVD.
