A very different Jerry Lewis movie, not like all the more famous movies everyone knows. Lewis deals with the difficult task of WW II and National Socialism in Germany in a rather unconventional way. But even more interesting and important is that it does it very non-American. And as with many things in the world, and especially in the film industry, non-US resources are more sophisticated, softer, smarter, or simply better. That is why the film was not successful in the US but very successful in Europe. All in all, Jerry Lewis proved with this film that he is able to do much more than a simple slapstick.
