All right - it was in black and white and probably on a 2 "tape - which means the BBC is wiped out, isn't it? full of youth and bravery. <br /> <br /> I WANT TO DISPLAY AGAIN! You read it, the BBC? I know, I know, some of them are dead, some of them are missing in action. Where else can I see Mary Morris as a 'snake's heart wrapped in tiger skin'? Where else can I see Paul Daneman doing "Now is the winter of discontent ..."? Or does Robert Hardy make his speech about this "idol ceremony"?
