A fun and frightening critique of Russian society and culture in the transition from communism, the PARIZH WINDOW also shows the West in unfavorable light. A group of Russians living in St. Petersburg (a.k.a. "Window in the West of Peter the Great") will find a magical portal that will take them to Paris immediately. Mama's film is really jolly, and just "weird" enough to keep the tired movie viewer on his fingers. Songs, dream sequences and the deliciously disgusting margins of both cultures mingle to create an unforgettable and meaningful film. Everybody who is trying to understand the shift of Russian cultural sentiments from the fall of the USSR should start here.
