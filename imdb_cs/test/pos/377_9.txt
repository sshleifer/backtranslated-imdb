In the adaptation of Alfred Hitchcock to "Strangers On A Train" by Patricia Highsmith, Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) meet for the first time on a train journey and discuss the idea of ​​performing two murders. Relatively proud Anthony suggests that he could assassinate Haines' unfaithful wife, and Haines could assassinate Anthony's slave father. In any case, the absence of any connection between the murderer and the victim should ensure that both crimes remain unsolved. The consequence of the interview leaves Haines easier with the impression that the proposal is not serious. Complications arise later when Anthony murders Haines' wife in an amusement park and then watches Haines keep his side of the deal. The differences between the two men are clear from the beginning. Haines is a professional tennis player, decent and somewhat modest about his achievements, while Anthony's life goes nowhere and admits he was fired from three drinking and gambling colleges. Haines is in a relationship with the senator's daughter he wants to close. Anthony is characteristically interpreting it as a cynical maneuver on Haines' side to get a shortcut for a career. Differences in character are also visually enhanced. Anthony often inhabits shaded areas and travels in a boat called "Pluto", while Haines is often seen from a more heroic perspective provided by low camera angles. There are some striking visual sequences, such as: - <br /> <br /> (1) The murder of Haines' wife, manifested by the reflection of her glasses, which fall to the ground as she tries to free her by Anthony. (2) depicting Anthony himself, dressed in black and looking very small against the huge white building of the Jefferson Memorial. Opportunity, where all viewers at the tennis match move their heads in unison, after action, while one head (Anthony) stays cool in position when looking at Haines. <br /> <br /> (4) A scene where a roundabout spirals out of control and eventually fits efficiently. Frequent use is made of "doubles" throughout the story, for example, Haines and Anthony are originally introduced as 2 p air from the feet stand out from the taxi and go to the train. When the train leaves the station, 2 sets of tracks are available, each offering a choice of two forward paths. Two men discuss the murders of 2 potential victims and order 2 double whiskeys. Hitchcock's camera sees him fighting onboard a double bass train. Haines feels doubled when his wife gives up the deal she had to see a lawyer to secure her divorce. Haines' wife goes to the amusement park with 2 boys. When Anthony confronts her before the murder, she lights up her cigarette lighter and creates two reflections in her glasses. Anthony later becomes very concerned when he meets a senator's younger daughter whom he sees as double for Haines' wife. Anthony also feels double when Haines refuses to continue with the second murder. When Haines goes alone on a train that goes to Metcalf, he sees two men in the same stroller accidentally kicking their feet together in the same way as he and Anthony. The action throughout the film is at a great pace, and the performances of Robert Walker and Patricia Hitchcock (as a senator's younger daughter) are particularly strong.
