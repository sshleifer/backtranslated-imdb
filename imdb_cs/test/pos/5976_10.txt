I saw this film many years ago (along with another film Shepitka, Wings) as part of the Soviet film series at the local film archive. But none of Shepitek's films, if I can say, have ever made a video or DVD in the United States. Ascent is a great movie of any standard, with a stunning black-and-white photo, a hypnotic direction, and actors so deep in their roles that you don't feel like just giving a show. Although the details of the Russian resistance to (and cooperation with) the German occupation are very apt, the story is timeless. Two Russian partisans are captured by the Germans and interrogation examines their integrity as well as their courage. I believe that the reason why the Russians did not post on DVD (the spoiler here) is that a Jewish intellectual (and not a tough Russian peasant) is a guerrilla who resists both threats and temptations, goes to his death, and represents a heroic to the villagers example.
