This is an incredibly impressive story, with great simplicity and grace. The story itself is the subject of the film, although the scenery is beautiful. Acting is underestimated, even great, because the characters themselves experience all their eccentric simplicity. This work is unlikely to be appreciated by those who are "carelessly" watching movies. It requires work that should be brought into the story, but once you get involved, captivity is complete!
