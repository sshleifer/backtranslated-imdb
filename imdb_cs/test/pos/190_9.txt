Sergei Urusevsky's fabulous cinematography contributes to his overwhelming work. The opening scenes are as if you were looking at a photographer's album and as the story unfolds, we are bewildered by both the events shown and the beautiful looks. Everything is fine, but there are several whole sequences that are simply breathtaking. It is difficult to describe without "spoiling", but it is enough to say that one is a very intense scene during the raid and the lady who has remained, and her lover's brother are at odds with the sirens nodding and the windows shattering. Another superposes a swirling staircase and a spinning hill of trees and even evolves into a fantasy sequence. Production of the highest-level Soviet film.
