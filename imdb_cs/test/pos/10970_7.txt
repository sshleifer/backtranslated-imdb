1959 was a milestone in the film. Several of the great directors of the classical era have released a career class that was among their best. Check out the titles that are instructive, Hitchcock's North By Northwest, Rio Bravo by Howard Hawks, Douglas Sirk's Imitation of Life. Add a pair from the previous year, Orson Welles' Touch of Evil, Hitch's Vertigo and Nick Ray's Wind Across the Everglades, and you have a pretty good summary of what was possible in classic Hollywood style. At the same time, there were two films that suggested a whole new way of making movies. One was Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless, the other was John Cassavetes Shadows. Both films had certain things in common, mostly improvised by playing non-stars, cameras, low budgets, and some youthful, jazz fluctuations. But in some ways they couldn't be further apart. Godard was still a believer in the director as a style judge. He knew more about film than most Hollywood producers, and Breathless was filled with iconography of classical criminal film. Cassavetes, on the other hand, was an actor and refugee from the New York underground theater scene. His first film shows that the cinema was a little overwhelming, and a great actor. Godard's film constantly refers to his own art, while Shadows seeks a kind of naturalism. It won't get it, mainly because naturalism is a myth, especially in the cinema. But she feels powerful, kinetically, but she likes to be a great jazz on the score, which is definitely the main inspiration for the film style. In the end, it doesn't hold it together, mainly because the Cassavetes actors are amateur beaters, where Cassavetes' style requires strong, imaginative actors. His later work with Gena Rowlands, Ben Gazarra, and Peter Falko throws it out of the water. Because of the director's technical inexperience, some parts of the dialogue had to be reloaded, defeating the freshness of improvisation. It's still fascinating to watch, both for great moments (like the scene in which Leila Goldoni talks about losing her virginity) and watching a pioneering artist who finds her way.
