For those who are unfamiliar with Paddy Chayefsky, this is a very good introduction. While Chayefsky deals with a reality that is behind the myths of many things, including medicine, this work is a surprisingly prophetic path that medicine is leading today, two decades after the film was made, and more than ten years after his death. In addition, some insights into Chayefsky's view of life in general are 'slipping' into the film as well. The 20th century may prove to be the first and last century of the United States in the history of the world. If the United States' contribution to art turns out to be in the "film" dimension, it is a major example of this art.
