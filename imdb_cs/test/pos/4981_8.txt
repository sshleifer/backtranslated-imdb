An extremely entertaining western in the mid-fifties that packs a lot in just 96 minutes. Most viewers quickly get into this story and find the experience quite enjoyable. More than just a B-Western, but not really an epic, the budget was modest and cast available despite several big names. Glenn Ford was the only box office at that time. Edward G. Robinson and Barbara Stanwyck were in the past looking for work, Stanwyck was 10 years since the new popularity in "The Big Valley". Brian Keith and Dianne Foster have just begun. Ford plays John Parrish, a small ranch who decides to sell when a likeable sheriff is murdered by a big soldier (Robinson) hired shooter. Parrish is a former Confederate officer who has just moved to the West for medical reasons. Robinson plays Lee Wilkison, who already owns most of the valleys and intends to get the rest, by promising his wife Martha (Stanwyck). Lee was crippled in a ground war he fought 12 years ago; his brother Cole (Keith) came from Texas to help him run a huge spread. Lee looked in front of the obvious connection between Stanwyck and Keith, but the sensitive daughter Judith (Foster) is obviously upset by what's going on in their house. John Parrish promised his fianc√© Caroline (May Winn) to return to the East. Caroline, modeled by Grace Kelly's "High Noon", tears off the engagement at the first sign of trouble and disappears from the film. This leaves the way for John and Judith's novel to develop. Violence begins early and continues throughout the film, while Parrish is able to apply military tactics to the enemy, which underestimates his ability and determination. He has a very original confrontation with the main shooter halfway into the film. Ford plays one of its standard characters; a humble person who disarms everyone with a self-destructive way that is slow to offend, but brutal when he is finally provoked (similar to his role in "The Sheepman"). Robinson is also excellent as a man who maintains his personal integrity, albeit physically a shadow of his former self. And he gets enough lines and time on the screen to develop his character accordingly. Stanwyck has the most difficult role and is not simply convincing as a classic face-to-face woman, a seemingly loyal wife who intends to replace her husband with her brother. This is partly because it is not given enough time to do more than just superficially communicate both sides of the character. This means that a talented actress could do a much better job with these limitations. Dianne Foster is a pleasant surprise. She should remind viewers of a lot of Carroll Baker, both physically and acting. Although required to play Judith under the 1950 convention (she is allowed to be tough but then required to break the hysterics after each great confrontation), Foster shows a nice range. It raises a growing attraction for Parrish, but it does so inconspicuously that it's just in retrospect that different tracks click into place. The real problem with "violent men" is that they try to be both Western action and character study morale. Since there is a lot to be seen on the screen, a lot of action is hurried and many characters have only a cursory treatment. This is neither a fatal mistake nor a reason to avoid the movie, but it could have been significantly better with another 20 minutes running or the absence of useless characters like Caroline. Then again, what do I know? I'm just a child.
