The "Satanic Brotherhood" is one of the most underrated horror movies of all time. Why it did not reach the cult status is beyond me. It is a chilling story of horror and witchcraft that contains one of the most powerful and busiest peaks in the world. In a small American town some children disappeared and their parents were murdered violently. What is the cause of hysteria? The movie is really scary, some scenes are really angry and they are definitely not forgotten. Up, acting is really good, and the climax is bizarre and distracting. Check this forgotten gem of Satanic horror. Absolutely recommended.
