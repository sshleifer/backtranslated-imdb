I recently saw it at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, where it ended up being one of the favorite viewers. It is a spoof for the French home industry OSS 117 films from the 50s and 60s. The first OSS 117 film based on Jean Bruce's novel was screened in 1956, long before James Bond's first film, which saw Ivan Desny as Hubert Bonisseur De La Bath and six subsequent action adventure spy movies, was made by Luc with 1970 Merenda, Frederick Stafford, Kerwin Matthews and John Gaven alternated as Oss 117. Jean Dujardin is in this comedy role in the series. As the film begins in 1945, it has a French mustache and reminds Desny, but as the film begins, it really begins to look like Sean Connery in 1955. Jean Fran√ßois Halim wrote this hilarious script of a spy sent to Egypt to investigate the murder of a friend. He borrows the stupidity of Naked Gun, Get Smart and Pink Panther and uses fresh humor at current events in a wonderful combination that international audiences will enjoy and I'm sure it will be the first to come from a revived OSS 117 redesigned into comedy adventure . Michel Hazanavicius controls. I would put it 7.5 and recommend it.
