I personally loved TRIS MOVIE! My best friend told me about it, so I rented it and watched it. It's amazing! Music, acting, story depicting emotions, everything ...... except for one minor fact. Absolutely no loyalty to books at all. I saw this movie before the Vampire Interview and before I even knew the books existed, I was shocked to find out how many people actually hated the movie. I quickly picked up that the fans of the book are not at all happy with the unfaithfulness, I do not want to be hypocritical (I hate the Harry Potter movies because of the lack of loyalty to the books) I was silent. Finally, I picked up "Vampire Lestat" and immediately understood why everyone hated him. This is completely different (The Queen of the Damned movie is a combination of "Vampire Lestat" and "Queen of the Damned"). But I still loved the movie since I saw it before reading any of the books. So if you haven't seen this movie or read a book, watch the first movie or hate it. If you have read the book, you have the right to hate this movie.
