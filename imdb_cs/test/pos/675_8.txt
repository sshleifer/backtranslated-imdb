Beware of my beautiful came from the game written by Mel Dinelli and who apparently liked to write about frightened women. His first and best endeavor was the script for The Spiral Staircase. He also made Loretta Young a tension thriller cause for alarm a few years ago. The game Dinelli wrote was originally entitled The Man and it ran for 92 performances on Broadway during the 1950 season. It was Dinelli's only effort on Broadway to play Dorothy Gish and Richard Boon. The roles Gish and Boone played are Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan. For any reason, RKO thought he would remove the age difference. Dinelli himself rewrote his game on the screen, so I was wondering what he thought. The problem of fragility was completely excluded from the story. <br /> <br /> It wasn't the only thing that was removed. People are all wearing period clothing around the time of World War I, but so far there is no reference to the time this story takes place. I thought it strange and later, when a telephone company repairman comes to Idy Lupino's residence, I noticed that his car was vintage is at the same time. The film is almost entirely set in Ida Lupino's house, where she hired a traveling stranger in Robert Ryan as a handyman. The film is a great object lesson in that you hire foreigners without a link. It turns out that Ryan is a schizophrenic who imprison Lupine in his home for about one day. <br /> <br /> Both executives are doing well with the changes. Movies like Beware My Lovely are things that made a small studio like RKO. If it were done in MGM or Paramount, shiny trappings would overwhelm a solid story.
