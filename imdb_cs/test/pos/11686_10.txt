Nowadays, this was to blame for leniency, which required monitoring when I was in high school. It's a really big illumination of a blooming punk scene in LA in 1980. As the bands play, Spheeris prints the lyrics in the headlines, which is of course necessary if one really wants to know what the boy is yelling into the microphone. But it also turns the POV camera into a tourist passing through this extraterrestrial world. Band interviews reveal a sincere approach to music that no longer really exists. Then it's not that easy to lose $ 16 / month's former church toilets like Chavez Black Flag does. How many unrecognized bands do you know are not trying to get the dickens to the record store? These guys just didn't care. And who cannot love the comment of a little French dude who used to be a "singer" for Catholic discipline (of which Phranc was a member). His harsh voice brings one of the best soliloquies ever captured on the film: "I have great news for the world ... there's no such thing as a new wave." What a relief!
