It's the best movie I've ever seen about acting. All artists are old Turkish theater actors, they are magnificent in this film. Sometimes it is said that "They don't act, live it", you really see it in this movie. The director is also competent, you don't see a lot of moving cameras, but camera positions are also good. But after acting, the most significant part is the content of the film. It provides happiness, enthusiasm, desire to live, the importance of real friends to people. We all started living individually today, and in this movie you see that there is someone other than us. Most importantly, you see that the most sensitive feeling in the world is love, loving friends, loving your sweetheart. All people should see this movie ...
