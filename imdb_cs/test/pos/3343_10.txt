I first saw it on a big screen with my girlfriend. It was fun with amazing music. Kristine was on the Playboy Cover, and centered as I remember. She is really cute and energetic and has a lot of charm. The film made me see more, so I watched her in other things. She's in Steven Spielberg's "I Want to Hold Your Hand" and Barbara Streisand's "Main Event" and Bill Murray's "Meatballs", plus plenty of TV shows like a nightclub and TV movies. I and my friends really enjoy it. But her starring role in Alice in Wonderland puts her attention where she should be, right on Kristine as the spotlight, probably the most beautiful, hottest girl I've ever seen in movies.
