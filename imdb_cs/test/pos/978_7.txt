This movie was fun! Especially if yours is between 8 and 15. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes make a believable team of 8th graders returning to the adult who really deserves it. Paul Giamatti is a great adult you really want to "get". My 13-year-old daughter and her friend loved it. Parents: No really bad words or sex to worry about. Recommend it to the "right" crowd. AP
