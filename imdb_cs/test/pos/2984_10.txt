Well ..... I wouldn't like to give a lecture, but I feel the urge to say some things I consider important to this BEAUTIFUL movie. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I had 14) and then another year later. That was it. The rest was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack as the music and story got deeper into my heart. How deep? A week ago my cousin gave me a copy of VHS as a gift. (No DVD yet). Boy .... I was surprised! Poets have always endured that deep childhood and teenage experiences of beauty, love, God, idealistic endeavors, will stay with you forever. Because they are usually at heart level (yet no reason!), They define the contours of your soul as a sculptor with a stone. If we ever had no tendency to forget how we could, we should make a better understanding of the meaning of each minute, every decision, every turning point in our lives. So I admit I feel nostalgia. But the fascinating part of this film is again to watch the film and this way back in time, enriching that understanding why we, the people of the 1960s, grew up as we did. The spirit of these times is here: Genesis created far from the official world of consumer and economic success, not to love war, beautiful pop ballads, poetry of lyrics, a totally romantic look at a teenage rebellion with awakening sexuality carefully wrapped in tender and chaste love, these two lonely spirits still full Childhood innocence grows together as they learn mutual commitment and turn into "adults". I showed a film to a group of young schoolchildren who were full of such simplistic and cynical comments that it was naive and stupid. Guys, be serious! Cinema is an art and reflects not only human emotions but also historical moments. And that's exactly what "friends" do masterfully. It reflects the idyllic idea of ​​rebellion and the new beginning that we all dreamed of when we were 15 years old. I'm a musician now and I feel that some of us artists are still dreaming about it! How else could we live? This is "Friends", it is "Brother Sun Sister Moon", that is "Hair". These were the times, still alien to AIDS, foreign to explicit and vulgar texts in pop songs without melody, pornography presented as "sexuality", to this barbaric new "world order" that is growing after 9/11. What kind of heart experience is seeing Paul and Michelle again, shyly and gently examining the new fantasies of his romantic world. What a trip back to the very heart of our hearts: to Paris, to Elton John at its best, to an urban scenario surrounded by 2 CVs of Citroëns and VW Beetles. What fresh air from a quiet cottage in the Camargue, surrounded by ponds and wild horses. They made us who we are as well as Serrat in Spain, Brel in France, Peter Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, Luther King, Beatles, Early Bee Gees, Belafonte's clergy, Gandhi, Gospel Elvis. People still hope: get this picture. Start with innocence and grow from there. You'll find out what this is all about. And from there you will have a solid and truer foundation; some ideals to seek in life, a way to handle personal and world affairs. We need so much today! Give yourself a chance and maybe once the cynics will end. (I have another copy of VHS) Santiago Zuleta. Bogota, Colombia.
