I play this game just after watching a trailer in an old magazine to advertise a CD ... <br /> <br /> It's a very interesting and dark atmosphere (missing in today's games / movies). The game takes place in the mid-1990s in a haunted mysterious mansion. You play as Adam Randell and your task is to free the soul of your deadly father trapped in death. <br /> <br /> The game's look is a doom but very different type of game. In this old classic game is presented a lot of actions, puzzles, quests, mazes and many other interesting places and characters. <br /> <br /> The game will only work on Windows 98 and there is no fix for Windows. XP.
