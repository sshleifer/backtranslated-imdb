The biggest movie ever. <br /> <br /> How is it a controversy? But if we look at it purely kinematically, it is clear that the three colors red are a masterpiece. It's not enough just to say - Three colors of red are the masterpiece of world film. If you agree that a citizen of Kane is not human enough if you agree that Star Wars are not really very good if you agree that Ozu and Mizoguchi have to step back - then the three colors are the red masterpiece of all time. . As a discussion of human morality, the three red colors work on an intensely metaphysical level, with the depth that none can match. Blue went almost so far into the human psyche, but stopped when he was about to pull the rabbit out of his hat. White has forced us to think about the humanity of equality - it is even better in retrospect, but not yet. But red is the real thing. What he expresses in this film is an expression of what one should be. In fact, what he says is that he feels human. This forces us to examine to the smallest detail, the very nature of our souls, our ethical self. In red, one can find meaning on one of its several levels. On the first level, Red achieves high levels of verisimilitude - we cannot have any problems with calling Red an extremely fun story. The coincidences contained in the film and its ideas force us to examine the film as a film. It's like Kieslowski says "Ceci n'est pas la réalité". In fact, while pursuing a humanistic goal, Kieslowski can also question reality. It is a trick that Kieslowski is trying to do with Le Double Vie de Véronique, but until this latest film he has finally achieved this divine blending of fate, philosophy, and circumstances. Even actors and actresses seem to be at the mercy of greater power. Valentine's Day (Irène Jacob) is appropriately named because it seems to be almost pure love. The idea of ​​first impressions is questioned by Judge Jern Louis Tritignant Kern, who at the end of his life is an almost omniscient observer of events - a character who has the symbolic power to put the characters together - power to make people happy, the power he could reach only through Valentine's Day. <br /> <br /> We have the ability to see movies as more than just a series of pictures. In fact, films are more important than literature. Of course, this will not happen, but at least we have the power to see this film because we know it gives us the power to achieve something that we cannot define, but everyone has. The synopsis of this film reads: "A film about a woman running through a dog". Well, it is. Isn't it? <br /> <br /> -Simon Huxtable <br /> <br />
