Night Crossing captures the feelings experienced by the vast majority of East Germans in 1961-89. I lived in West Berlin most of 1967 and traveled every week through The Wall to East Berlin. Why? Excitement, crossing the borders to the Soviet government, experiencing the smells and feeling of East Germany, which is why Night Crossing is excellent, it captures the feeling and is exciting. I was arrested by Vopos at Checkpoint Charlie and I was punished by a man in his leather coat and dark glasses that I believed was a Stasi. When I watch a movie, I feel cheap diesel and cooking oil, I see obsolete vehicles, dull clothes worn by the public, and faint products in shop windows. It brings back memories of how he realized how lucky I was in a free country. In 1988 I traveled across the DDR from east to west, north to south. East Germany has changed little since 1967. Trabants, who were constantly falling apart, were still the main mode of private motor transport, there was still not much to do in the shops, uniforms were still common, but people, ordinary people were open and nice once you gained their trust. Watch Night Crossing, it's as close to the truth as any movie you see in split Germany, even closer than two other popular movies, The Spy Who Came In The Cold and Funeral in Berlin.
