I consider myself a big fan of horror movies. One night I just wanted to rent some newer horror movies to make fun of it. Then I rented Milo. This film surprised me so much. It scared me. This is not something I can say very often. Usually Halloween just scares me. Two other friends watched it with me and stayed with a disturbing feeling. Feel good when you ask me after watching a horror movie. If it doesn't touch what's on it. This movie was original. The usual horror movie instructions were not followed. That's why movies like Valentine bombed me. Of course, many are left with unanswered questions because most horror movies. It's worth the rent.
