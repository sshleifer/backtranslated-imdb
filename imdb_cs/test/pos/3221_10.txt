I didn't catch Gilmore Girls when he first came out, so I made a good finish in the first season. I've read most user comments and for the negative ones, I have to ask what show you are watching ?? <br /> <br /> This show is a classic, great lines, characters and good acting. Best of all, your standard formula is not always displayed with occasional twist of the story. Probably more women who manifest themselves in the relationship of Lorelai / Emily, then in the relationship of Lorelai / Rory. People and stories are not PCs, but they are real! <br /> <br /> If you find the dialogue annoying, I recommend you tape the show so you can play the parts you don't understand.
