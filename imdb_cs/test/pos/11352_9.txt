When I watched the movie, I told myself, "so the movie can be created like that." The beautiful poetic love story of Wong Kar Wai captured me throughout the film and beyond. I have to admit it's one of the best love movies, maybe the best of all I've ever watched. Content and form overlap perfectly. While watching the secret love we see figures in bounded frames that limit their movements and their feelings. Beautiful camera and lighting angles make feelings and blues and touch. I want to congratulate Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee on their fantastic cinematography that creates a mood for love. Also, music defines the sadness of love that plays along beautiful images of slow motion and shows characters in desperate moods. And of course the performances of actors that love so real. In the end, all the elements in the film came together perfectly under the direction of WKW, giving the viewer a feeling of love.
