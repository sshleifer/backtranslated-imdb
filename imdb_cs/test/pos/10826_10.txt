When I went to see Bon Voyage, I was expecting a good, skillful multidrama by order of the Grand Hotel (1932) and Les Enfants de Paradis (1944). It was better. With a few exceptions, none of the characters were absolutely good or bad - just like in real life. Acting was amazing, especially those who played Frédéric, Raoul and Camille. Shooting was amazing because it created this period perfectly and managed to shoot around Bordeaux at the time of new public works, but managed to "look" in June 1940. The costumes and make-up were accurate. There's so much in this movie that it's worth a second viewing. It's exciting, funny and finally touches. N.B. - Make sure you see it in a theater with a high-quality projection. It's in the widescreen view and in the theater where I saw it (Clairmont in Montclair), the first 30 minutes had subtitles at the bottom, but the actors' faces were a bit blurred! This was eventually fixed but lightened from the pleasure of the film.
