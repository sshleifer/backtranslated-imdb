Again, we are lucky to see a beautiful opening scene where the artists' work has been fully restored and we see this ancient grocery store on the street corner with fine snow. Inside are the rich colors of all the goods, from production to canned goods and boxed goods to medicines for candy, etc. \ t or cake, or even a pack of cigarettes. The whole "show" is narrated by "Jack Bunny," Jack Benny impersonator, with the music of conductor Leopold Stokowski, who was in so many Looney Tunes shorts, I lost count. A lot of humor is current, so it pays to know who "Little Egypt" and other characters. "Aqua" number of Busby Berkeley type with bathing suit sardines coming out of a can, and dancing with cans of tomatoes could be smart! All of the above and more, was in the first half of this somewhat longer than a normal cartoon length. The other half was about King Kong, which escapes from the box "Animal Crackers" and terrorizes everyone. That part wasn't too big and ended up on a somewhat stupid note. So ... "A" for the first half, "D" for the second, which is about C-plus or B-minus total.
