SCREAM's success gave birth to a new horror wave. I'm happy with it, as a big horror fan, and I like most of those new horror movies. BOC is one big pack of horror. Color, fast and original. I see this movie more like opening a new trilogy (like Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) because it comes with a new twist. Instead of focusing on a little relationship between a boy and a murderer, we have a twisted film about pairs. Unlike killer crazy doll lovers, we have nice young lovers. Very resourceful!
