This is the best comedy movie I've ever seen ... My favorite actors did a good job. Salman Khan and Aamir Khan were swinging. I hope Andaz Apna Apna Part 2 soon as I heard she will come back with Part 2 as well. I have a request for those who have not seen it before. please buy a DVD and watch it wont get bored. I watch this movie once a week. Everything else was also good in this movie. Paresh Rawal, Shakti and more Music is also good, they also have nice songs. There is some sense that kills from laughter Salman Khan has done a very nice role and also Aamir. So he has to watch the film an excellent work of actors and director.
