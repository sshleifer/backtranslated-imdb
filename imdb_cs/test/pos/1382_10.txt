You have a chance to see it at your friend's house today and was amazed at what he achieved on such a small budget. Not that it even bothered me because I like a low science fiction budget like Dr Who, Blake's 7 and Dark Star. Damn, even Outland wasn't a big budget affair, so while money helps, it takes more than throwing money on things to make them good. The story is simple at first, with a group of mercenaries paid for escorting the prisoner through space. Their ship is attacked and forced to land on the nearest planet. They then find that the prisoner did it too, it's a stone of cold matrix case, and that's just the beginning of their problems. The effects, except for shootings, are minimalist and add to the movie without overwhelming it. Computer effects sometimes seem somewhat risky, but serve their purpose and add to the story. Movies like me Robot could benefit from this approach instead of being largely styled and replacing special conspiracy effects like too many Hollywood offers. While none of the actors get Oscar material, it's hard-coded and shot, and in an hour and ten minutes he can't make his welcome. The characters do not do much, but then in the Predator, which resembles it. Big Man Mike Mitchell is a good Arnie and it's a good combination of brains and muscles. Some people may be upset at the lack of explanation at the end, but I like it. Unlike many movies and shows that leave things inexplicable, it's not so unclear that you can't get the handle at all, and I'd like to see a continuation where the nature of extraterrestrials is further explored. Cracked little movie from an enterprising team, done on a cheap but fun way to go through the hour. If that's what they can do about lacing, I'd like to see what they would do with a little money, and I hope that the film industry and critical talented Christians don't get rid of all their creativity first. /> <br /> Recommended.
