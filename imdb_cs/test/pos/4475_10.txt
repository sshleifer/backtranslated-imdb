What an incredible story and what a beautiful movie! The hat is gone by Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier and the great Honore de Balzac. This captivating film expresses the passion that the characters experience so effortlessly and at the same time. I watched it fascinate, almost holding his breath as the story evolved towards the inexorable end. The execution of this film was almost flawless: simple and pure, playing with our hearts, leading us to understand the strange Platonic, Absolute, that is, property ties between two beings not meant to be part of the Second World. Both are capable of affection, but ironically, it is the more "developed" person who becomes addicted and wealthy, unable to accept the freedom of another. It is one of the most fascinating and interesting views of many forms of love and an incredible study of how oppressive and destructive human love can ever be. This story would only link to this story with the rudimentary mind.
