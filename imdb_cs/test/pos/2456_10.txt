Estevez, Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates are excellent in this Vietnam veterinarian, but they are still haunting him. Bates plays a clueless mother who wants the family to be a "family". Sheen is as wonderful as a father trying to understand what his son is going through, but he is too wrapped up in his principles to really feel it. The setting is Thanksgiving and relatives come to dinner. Estevez, who plays a returning veterinarian, does not want any part of the family tradition and insists that he have his fatigue for dinner, explaining that this is what I wore the last Thanksgiving. Bickering and family arguments are invaluable, especially the "peanut fragile crisis," but the end is both engaging and scary. It must be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Overall, one of the best movies I've ever seen.
