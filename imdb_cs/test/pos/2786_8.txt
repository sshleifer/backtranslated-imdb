A surprising, witty, witty and absolutely engaging film captures the little-known reality: a student studying in Erasmus. The start is great because the story begins, of course it has several lulls on midsection, and the story drifts sometimes from the main character, but the viewer won't bother - the film is young, fresh, and light - You hear, even though I disagree with the idea that if you make Erasmus and you will return, you will no longer be part of this universe. But it's me. The film is deep and very light. Cool and recommend.
