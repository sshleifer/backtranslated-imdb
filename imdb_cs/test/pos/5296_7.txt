It is said to be inspired by Disney's Little Mermaid, Ponyo on the Sea Reef is a Japanese animation master, another great work by Hayao Miyazaki after the well-received Spirited Away in 2001 and Howl's Moving Castle in 2004. In Ponyo, his fantasy animation signature style Empires and children's characters are back on display. Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), a boy leads in the film to discover a 'goldfish' trapped in a glass container while playing by the sea under a cliff. She stays with her mother, Lisa (Tomoko Yamaguchi) up and up. Sosuke shakes the spring to try to get the "goldfish" out, but the little "goldfish" is stuck. Then he tries to pull him out, but he just can't relax. Sosuke then places the container on the ground before crushing a small rock and tearing it into pieces while suffering a small cut on his finger. Then, curiously, he checks if the "goldfish" is still alive. As he observes, "goldfish" reacts suddenly by licking blood from his finger. Excited, Sosuke hurries quickly back into the house and put a 'goldfish' in a small bucket of water in the hope of surviving. He did and he named it 'Ponyo' (Yuria Nara). The above scene would mean what's to come for the rest of the movie. These are the interactions between Sosuke and Ponyo. And that is what Hayao Miyazaki carefully watched with careful display. He must have a keen sense of observation and understanding of how children behave before this chemistry of communication between the two main characters appears. Children's behavior would also spread to the rest of the film in their next meetings. Affection between Sosuke and Pony grew as the film progressed from the moment Sosuke brought Ponya to school in Lisa's car. The best moment came when they both met after a brief separation, when Pony's father, Fujimoto (George Tokoro), a magical sea inhabitant, captured erotic Ponya before dragging her into a magical bubble with a deliberate intention. Once a human being, Fujimoto has grown to mark people with disgust for sea pollution and theft of his life. But everything Ponyo wants to be human and to be with Sosuke, so he escapes the second time, accidentally empties the precious store of his magic potion into the sea and creates a storm of tidal waves and engulfs the small town in the process. Follow the adventures of Sosuke and Ponyo in a flooded city. Is he happy in this? Will true love prevail? You'll find out. Looking at the art in Ponyo on a cliff by the sea, the deviation from past Miyazaki's work in terms of rendering appears. It looks unfamiliar because in addition to the characters in the game in each scene, it is not as usual in Spirited Away (2001) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004). Aesthetic appeal is discounted from what appears to be colored pencil drawings. Objects and characters are not as detailed as they were before. This is strange when it comes to face value, but from the way the story is written and narrated, a possible explanation is that Miyazaki allows the audience to look at a film with a childish shade that allows adults to remember Japan when they were younger. This move could prevent potential viewers who were in Miyazaki's work from seeing it. The trailer did nothing to support Ponyo anyway. Taking this case to Japan, it would be a different story as Miyazaki's credentials far than to overcome any marketing technique. In summary, the whole did not match its parts. In addition to Miyazaki's ability to cast live and animated characters, the film lacks elements of excitement and miracles when measured against previous work, resulting in a lack of a large screen. Ponyo and Sosuke sparks have failed. Brighten up the movie in a great way, but moments of warmth, kindness and love can still be found in film recognition as a movie that is not meant for children, but for children that everyone has been or was once.
