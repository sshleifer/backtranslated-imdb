When I was Marine, I can tell you that D.I. is so accurate to date depicting Marine Corp boot camp and how boys are converted into men. Jack Webb is excellent as Sgt. Jim Moore, a tough but fair instructor in Paris, North Carolina. The film focuses on one recruit who seems to "not get the program." The newer movie, Full Metal Jacket, also shows life in basic training and is worth a look at.
