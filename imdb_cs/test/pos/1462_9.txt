Spinning a talk show comedy by 'Garth Marenghi's Darkplace' New Series, Man to Man with Dean Learner, focuses on Garth's manager, publisher and promotional agent, as Richard Ayoade played. Nightclub owner, restaurateur, publisher, international playboy - Dean Learner is one man's brand. After his television channel Channel 4 financed Garth Marenghi, he is now inviting you to his luxurious penthouse apartment for a brand new, entertaining and extremely stylish TV talk show. Man to Man with Dean Learner will introduce all of Dean's remaining celebrities, as well as lots of live music and great fish dishes at a classroom show - but not fish! I took part in two of the live recordings in my stitch. There are distinct comparisons with Alan Partridge's 'Knowing Me Knowing' in the layout, but Richard Ayoade and Matt Holness have a unique style of writing it to a different level. <br /> <br /> If your Darkplace fan can't miss it. Catch it when it aired late this summer
