Anatole Litvak directed the 1959 film, "The Way," starring Yul Brynner, Deborah Kerr, Robert Morley, E.G. Marshall, Anne Jackson and Jason Robards. The film takes place during the Hungarian uprising in 1956 and concerns a group of passengers who have difficulty getting out of Budapest because of political problems in this part of the world. They are put on a bus to Vienna, but the Russians, led by Major Surov (Brynner) confiscate their passports and keep them for questioning. One of the passengers is Paul Fleming (Robards), who acts as an American but in fact a Hungarian freedom fighter who is believed to be smuggled from Hungary. Lady Ashmore (Kerr) actually hides him. She becomes the focal point of the Major's romantic attention. A very good film that expresses the tension and confusion of the Cold War and all performances are amazing. Brynner is extremely outstanding as a passionate major who is not bad, and Anne Jackson gives a realistic, powerful performance as a pregnant woman who doesn't want her baby born in a communist country. A good script, a good director, a good cast - that's how there should be more movies. Highly recommended.
