When I first sat down to watch Greek, I didn't expect a show with complicated characters, interesting lines, and perfect writing ... but that's exactly what I got. Greek Several college students who are in the Greek system of Rhodes University in Cyprus. Rusty Cartwright enters Cyprus with Rhodes as the leading polymer scientist who wants to be a brother. His older sister, Casey (exhibition center and early-to-be-president Zeta Beta Zeta, the most prestigious alliance on campus), is not exactly supporting his plans. In fact, none of her friends even knew she had a brother until she went to school! Besides being concerned that her dorky younger brother was forced to return to her life, Casey's friend Evan Chambers (early-to-be-brotherhood president on campus, Omega Chi) cheats her with the new promise of ZBZ (Rebecca Logan ), the evil ZBZ president Frannie urges her to stay with him, and still has feelings for her former friend Cappie (president of the campus party house, Kappa Tau). These characters are joined by Calvin Owens (athletic, intelligent friend of Rusty's who happens to be gay), Dale Kettlewell (Rusty's deceased Christian and "possibly racist" roommate and best friend), and Ashleigh (Casey's quirky best friend and confidant) \ t t). During Greek seasons (or four chapters), viewers are often warned that college life is not black and white, but "in shades of gray out". Each character makes a fair share of mistakes, but each of them has redeemable features. Casey and Cappie have a complicated but beautiful relationship throughout the series. Rusty, Dale, and Calvin's friendship are not always perfect, but they can survive any obstacle thrown at them. Even Frannie, Rebecca, and Evan (the show's "villains") are shown as human every once in a while. Greek shows college students at their best, worst, and in-between. It's a show that reveals college as what it really is: a four-year adventure where morality, beliefs and wills are tested, compromised, and sometimes even changed. Greek has at least one season left if not more than it ends. I can't wait to see where the characters will end. Greek is not your typical ABC situation system. If you want to tune into a show that shows the truth behind human motivation, Greek is a show for you.
