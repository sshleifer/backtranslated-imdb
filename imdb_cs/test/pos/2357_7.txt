"The Charge at Feather River" is a routine western about the American cavalry against Cheyenne Indians ... The film carries an ever-increasing tension with a pleasant distraction ... Guy Madison and Frank Lovejoy play officers who rescue Helen Westcott and Vera Miles of the Indians ... <br /> <br /> The outdoor scenes are well-photographed, especially the exciting Indian charge on the Feather River at the top of the spear-rain movie, the battle between Madison and Thunderhawk, sketches of Guardhouse Brigade, even and a bite of tobacco juice used against rattlesnake, and romantic breaks between our hero and Helen Westcott ... Everything is here, 3-D and Technicolor ...
