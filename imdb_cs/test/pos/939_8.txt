Brilliant Aussie movie ... A little slow at the beginning, but once you can, you can't stop laughing. When I originally saw the film, I was wrong to know the plot because I am not sure if many people realize that this film is based on a true story, and especially on the director and his mother (apparently the names have been changed). I only knew it because the director was a friend of my family. When I saw the movie, some of my stepmother was secret that we met Matthew Newton after the screening ... Such a nice gentleman (except an extremely ugly incident with his ex)! Brillian casting with Sam Neill and others! Great reason to support the Australian film industry
