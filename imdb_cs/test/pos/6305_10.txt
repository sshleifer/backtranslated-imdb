Maybe my rating was 9, but the movie totally impressed me when I saw it for the first time and my last viewing confirmed my initial faith. Stylish yes, each scene has created views, amazing angles with the perfect sound page that accompanies them. <br /> <br /> Get the most dramatic performances, especially Toni Servillo, with one of the most beautiful and beautiful women in the world. Olivia Magnani, and a great plot and you'll end up seeing this little masterpiece over and over again. Paulo Sorrentinos next film "L'Amico De Famiglia", which is in competition at this year's Cannes festival, will be eagerly awaited.
