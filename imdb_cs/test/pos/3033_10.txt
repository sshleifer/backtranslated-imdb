A great story of a dedicated young teacher who teaches minority children in an area outside of South Carolina. Jon Voight is immense as a stubborn, devoted, idealistic teacher who faces this challenge despite the principle, believes in strict discipline and has little respect for modern educational techniques as well as a crunchy old school superintendent, playing late Hume Cronyn. Madge Sinclair is a director who loves her children. As a retired teacher, I could somehow relate to this excellent movie. The ignorance shown here as well as the lack of co-operation with officials is also obvious in urban areas. The Will realizes that these children need much more than traditional classroom learning. He has to go out and experience life by learning outside. The end is a definitive downer, but so true to life. Amazing that these backward students were enthusiastic about learning and were well disciplined. I think it corresponds to my question. Behavior was there and they were motivated to succeed despite their environment. The end will just pull the heart. That was unforgettable and so annoying.
