"Lifeforce" is a really bizarre adaptation of Colin Wilson's "The Space Vampires" novel by Dan O'Bannon & Don Jakoby. A joint US-British space exploration team makes a stunning discovery: an alien spacecraft that rests inside Halleys's comet and contains three entities that look like humans, one of them is female beauty (oh-so-tempting Mathilda May). These discoveries take on their own spacecraft. Big mistake. It turns out that these creatures release life from human beings and like US Colonel Carlsen (intense, nervous, committed by Steve Railsback) and the British S.A.S. Colonel Caine (solid Peter Firth) looks in horror, attacking vampirism outstrips London, with Earth's fate in balance. This picture is definitely missing in imagination. Sometimes it moves a little slower, but it offers so many weird and fantasy ideas and visuals that it's hard not to talk. The first of three of Tobe Hoopers' paintings with Cannon Films (followed with "Texas Masssaw Chainsaw" and "Invaders of Mars") makes him something truly unique. Incorporating elements of sci-fi, vampire films, zombie movies and sagas at the end of the world, it's like nothing I've seen before. Railsback and Firth are so strongly supported by Brit actors like Frank Finlay, Patrick Stewart, Michael Gothard, Aubrey Morris and John Hallam. Mathilda May is very charming as a charming, mysterious village; It certainly does not hurt that he does a lot of his scenes in naked. It is also worth mentioning the mixing of musical scores from anyone but the composer "Pink Panther" by Henry Mancini. it may be ridiculous, but I found it also fun. It's wonderful and lively fun. <br /> <br /> 8/10
