WONDERBIRD, certainly an incredibly refined caricature, drawn in a deliciously old-fashioned manner, and sensationally old, produced in almost any respect, takes place in a kingdom dominated by the average and ugly monarch; Accordingly, it seems that the kingdom, or at least what we see? around the royal palace, it is plain, uninhabited. Several residents are from the Sun? city. <br /> <br /> Advice? to say that allegory, to say that parable, just not to say it a fable. <br /> <br /> Because IMDb supports prolixity, and perhaps for other reasons, I will add that this cartoon is the work of great Paul Grimault.
