In the movie "Dead Rail" I played Sam (porter, Lou's sidekick), who later aired as "Alien Express". And I have to say that I enjoyed watching this movie on my part. As a fighting actor, it was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, it gave me a great scene to include on my roll and allowed me to work for a dream job a month and a half (no waiting tables!) Turi (director) And Steve and Scott ( producers) were very kind in giving me the opportunity to participate in production. I made many friends (Lou, Todd, Steven) and I find myself very happy to work with these incredibly talented people. It wasn't the day I wasn't allowed to laugh. The real tragedy is not so much of a special effect that every person who watched this movie did not see what happened behind the scenes and all the talent that really came into it. Craftsmen who built the kit, champions masters, gaffers, wardrobe, make-up artists, script supervisors, cameraman, production assistant, extras, craft services, producers, directors and actors. It's because Sci fi didn't make a terrible amount of money on the film (2 million). But there was a lot of time, energy, and manpower that came into it. I now look at the film as a production that has brought a lot of talented people to a fun project that has been made without complications in less than two months. It was a spectacular cast and crew and I'm just so glad to be out of it! On another note to those of you who don't know Lou Diamond Phillips, Todd Bridges and Steven Brand. They are fantastic people who are incredibly funny. I'm still working on my Denir impression and I can't thank you very much for taking me to the "Midnight Run". Todd, every time I hear Elvis's song, I can't forget the story you told me about meeting him at his house for dinner. "Can you please hand me the perpetrators?" (IM huge ELVIS FAN!) Steven, "Mr. Brand!" You are a true gentleman and all the advice and encouragement I have received from you will always be appreciated. I miss you guys and I hope you're okay. Thanks for the good memories, stories, jokes and friendships. Oh and Miss Utah says Hello! winking winks. <br /> <br /> joe-
