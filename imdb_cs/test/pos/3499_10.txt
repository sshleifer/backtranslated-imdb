Being an American, I was not exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you were disappointed. I have nothing to compare. I found no pleasure in mindless humor in American movies, and although it is a bit similar to humor, I couldn't stop laughing. I barely laughed loudly in the movie. And usually the movie has some funny parts for me, but the movie was fun from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over. I actually buy it on DVD when I find it.
