If you like Vampire lore and you are a fan of Gothic horror, then you should want to see the Midnight Soul. I didn't know much about this movie before I watched, and I didn't expect much, but I found the movie to be fun and fun. Starring Armand Assante as Vampire Leader Simon, Soul Separates from Other Low Budget Vampire Films in St. Mythology Tissue George and Dragon in a fun new way. I'm not sure what the budget for this movie was, but I feel that if it was a little more, they could really be able to hit home and effects. <br /> <br /> If you are late at night and you are in the mood for a fun low budget vampire flick then Soul's Midnight is a good choice.
