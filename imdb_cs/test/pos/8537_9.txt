Oh my god. Obviously, if you rent or buy it, you do not expect to see a documentary about the mating habits of small rodents in their natural habitat. You expect a visual holiday of blood and gore and maybe even fear or two. Well, for those who are just as sick and twisted as me, you won't find much scary, but you'll be very close to urinating all around you in laughter. the phrases in this movie will stay with you and your friends forever. For the first time I showed it to my friends and colleagues more than 3 years ago, but I still laugh at our donkeys and use phrases. It's so addictive and funny as Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn and Peter Jackson's Dead Alive / Braindead. From the utterly ridiculous dialogue of the introductory scene, to the best works of Splatter and Gore, to Ed's amazing film cutting capabilities, you'll laugh and laugh again. As for the visual blood holiday and gore, yeah, they have it. And they're pretty damn good at it ... "The neck of the neck is connected to the bones of the head ..." This movie can also make the best nightmare / hallucination / totally spectacular scene I've ever seen. And that doesn't mean being funny, but man is well done (and scary.) Overall, for anyone who is not against lots of blood and damn good time HOW TO KNOW ANYTHING THIS FILM, START YOU !!!! it's on Netflix, I know for sure.
