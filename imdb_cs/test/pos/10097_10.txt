Let me say - I love the horror genre to the point where I see every single one I can turn to, no matter what I can (except for the high-quality horrors of b-movies I could do without) and I recently became a big fan of Eastern Horror. I knew a little bit that Korean horror would be the one that would be on my list off heavy weights, like the Japanese Ring (or American ring), or even good American movies like Sixth Sense and others, and the widely acclaimed Hong Kong horror movie "Eye". Previously, "The Ring" stood as my favorite horror movie, but it seems to me that I prefer the beauty of "The Story of Two Sisters" every day - the story is extraordinary and rather open to interpretation, allowing repeated tours, even While chances are you'll want to watch it over and over just because the movie is so masterfully shot ... the story is probably one of the best in this genre today. Acting is too much from the entire cast and frightening when they come, they have the potential to tremble you like anything in the Ring - I found myself stuck on the screen at those points that couldn't take my eyes off. I'm still glad I didn't come back to be persecuted later that Sadako / Samara made the Ring - after all such feelings are uncomfortable and the Story of the Two Sisters leaves you feeling uncomfortable, but that that will not leave you without sleep, but leave you satisfied that you have seen something quite strange. But remember .. if you do not understand the plot after first viewing, re-browsing is more than recommended. I personally didn't have time to do it because it was too late, so I ran through the scenes on the DVD, some many times until I had a good synopsis in my head and after I looked at the network it seemed like has led to a widely agreed interpretation. And the satisfaction with solving such a puzzle is amazing. <br /> <br /> All in all, a masterly horror that is unlikely to create the same level remake (bought by Dreamworks) simply because Korean content and everyone is advised to catch it in theaters or on DVDs while they can ... one of the best you get. Unfortunately due to the type of film it is, there is no way to even talk about a story without a spoiler, so it's best to do what I did - watch it without knowing a single thing except its 'two sisters' story! And be prepared for something that is unlikely to be closed for some time.
