When I first saw that it was when he came out (1994) and when I last watched it was just before writing this review. . Really the smartest Bollywood comedy ever made. This is one Indian movie that deserves its place in the IMDb Top 250. Aamir Khan and Salman Khan are probably one of their best performances in comedy roles. The thing that makes this time less classic is its comic timing and beautiful cuts ... Jokes are refreshing and not cheap. This is one movie that really exceeds its time. If you haven't seen it yet GO WATCH IT NOW !!!!!!!!!
