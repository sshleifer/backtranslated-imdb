I've seen this film twice and it's a stimulating theme. I have been on computers for many years and this film inspired me in a technological sense, as well as fresh love that burned my poetic passion in the heat of the infatuation. A very original idea, a great temptation in the way he holds you as he says it is a story of the mind that needs a release from the daily life of this life.
