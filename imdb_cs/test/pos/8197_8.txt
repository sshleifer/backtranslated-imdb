This three-hour Chinese epic, founded in 220 BC, can ultimately mean a familiar theme of the emperor's idealistic dream of peace through the unification that turns into corrupt isolation, and nothing is essential on the film, but a compelling story tense intrigues and passions and betrayals and epic events that echo in live moves. Even for those who are not attracted to such historical goggles for themselves, it is an amazing feast for the eyes: a scene depicting the attempt to overturn the marquis is one of the most remarkable evocations of physical space and grandeur in memory and battle scenes. they are unforgettable both in their scope and in their immediacy. The title sums up the use of convincing contrasts in the film - huge simple views against intimate horrors; the noblest of the motifs against the most degraded; hope for dust. If you've never seen a three-hour Chinese epic, it wouldn't be a good start.
