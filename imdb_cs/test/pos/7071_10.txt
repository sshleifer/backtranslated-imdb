Excuse me if I'm wrong, but "Cronica para un desayuno" could be one of the most gretatest films in Mexican film history for many reasons. We can get a lot of ingredients for a perfect Mexican middle-class family breakfast: a cup of surreal Buñuela themes with a small drop of Ripstenian scenarios; Pound phallus symbols around the film and difficult psychological complexity, more than the happiness of Todd Solondz and Dogma. There is a lot of sordidness, black humor, suppressed dreams (Teodor's dream of flying), incestuous lack of control (the relationship between Marcos and Luzma), parallel stories without senses, discreet violence, anachronisms and a little hint of hope ( illuminated in Luzma, husband's return and "Un poco Mas" used for the leit motif. Marcos (Bruno Bichir) is a charming character (I think it's a Bukoskijian way), a king-without crown that expects nothing but broken noses. Luzma (Maria Rojo), a nice wife, gave a lot of faces, but the only thing she was worried about was her sons having breakfast; She is a loser in many ways and sensual in a few moments, but you'll fall in love with her. Stretching the soundtrack (too many forests) feeds on the lack of technical merit, of course deliberately: sharp shots, shining shots (in introspective scenes), dizziness and sudden cuts. "Crónica" is something hard to digest, gets stuck in the throat and anything that helps. It tastes bitter, like rotten orange juice and sour as milk has expired, but you want to enjoy it. So I recommend that you choose a Melox before the show because you won't be hungry after all.
