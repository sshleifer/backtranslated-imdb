I recently discovered this fantastic series and I just can't get enough of Garner's back. The shows are constantly showing excellent levels of writing and exciting episodes. This episode, Sleight of Hand, is a bit different. Forsaking humor in favor of a more serious turn for Rockford when he searches for his missing girlfriends. The secret is great and it's crumbling convincing enough. It is based on a book (cannot remember the name) and could easily be stretched to a length episode. Garner stands out because Rockford is tough and really means trade. It has a "noir" feeling on it all the way, dark lighting and a general mood of great dark thrillers from the 40s and 50s. A really good episode in class A series. Perhaps they deserve 10.
