This film is excellent in how it portrays the reality of sexual abuse. Daughters perfectly express their opposing emotions of affection and betrayal. The local scenery is welcomingly authentic and the soundtrack is inconspicuous, yet it moves. This film is a graduate in reality that is too little recognized in American society. Personally, I am scared by the names of the characters - Lange's character is Ginny Cook Smith - my name is Connie Cook Smith and my mom is Genny Cook. The youngest daughter is Caroline Cook, who is my sister's name, and my father is Larry Cook, the name of my cousin. But sexual abuse was not in our closest family.
