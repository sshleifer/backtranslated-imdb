At first thought, the concept of this show seemed to be a joke and gag, just for the fun of Stan Lee. I expected nothing more than sleazy, animated versions of Barb Wire with low production values, just like the short bits of crap you see on Adult Swim for short-term amusement, but can never take it too seriously. The boy was wrong! Stripperella has even better production values ​​than similar Marvel Toons. The animation is very good and it seems that they have taken this series very seriously and have made every effort to become a professional production. Humor is also good, for a sexy, suggestive and slim side. It's very similar, if not exactly like the Simpsons style. You can meet clichés and lots of predictable humor, but it's fun. If it were running today, I would have seen it regularly. It's surprisingly one of the better tones ever made.
