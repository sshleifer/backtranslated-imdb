I love this movie so much. It always makes me cry. If you appreciate Drew Barrymore half as much as I do, you will love this movie. I have all the features I am looking for in the movie. She has good actors, good characters, good humor ... a lot of heartfelt moments. But the memories of the moment we see Josie in high school are crying. Every time. I'm sure you like it, not judging by the fact that it looks like a teen movie, even if it's a teen movie in a way. Sure, if you're a guy, and all you watch, movies are in special effect only in the first 250 movies of all time, then it's not for you. But if you like romantic comedies, remember after you saw it, pick it up in the video store and enjoy: Drew Barrymore is great!
