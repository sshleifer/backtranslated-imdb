Three girlfriends borrowed three Sarah movies and watched them when I was sick in bed during the weekend. I enjoyed each one. I enjoyed the last movie he saw when Caleb and his sister looked when they grew up. In addition, I liked the transmission of "Billy-boy" song, which was first heard during the credits of the first film, the title "Sarah, Plain and Tall." But one of the things I didn't like about Winter's End was the youngest daughter. She was a very cute little girl, but she had too much spirit and looked like a brat compared to other children, even when compared to the spoken but still good-natured Caleb when he was younger.
