Black Scorpion is Batman of Roger Cormen. Which is cool and there are a lot of great things in this movie. Like Breathtaker, who is a cross between Doom Doom and Darth Vader, it's a little cool. The mind control gas in the inhalers was worthy of Mad Hatter. Cormen B-film style is all over this puppy, which is not always a good thing. There are plenty of hot babes and pieces to make every action fan happy. This movie, the good one, it weighs bad. But if you're not one for comics movies, then I'd advise not to watch the Black Scorpion, but if you like comics like movies and don't care if it was ever a comic. Then look at BLACK SCORPION, just like I give it 8 STARS.
