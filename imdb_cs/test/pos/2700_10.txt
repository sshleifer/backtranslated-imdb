From the beginning I watched King Queens and I felt he was overlooked at the shows. This show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk a lot about it because I work in a company like IPS, (DHL) and we just love Teamster plugs !! Carrie is my hero, she's the best, she just puts her in there, no matter what's going on. Well, what can you say? He just tears you and really spins things. Doug, he's just so nice and funny, three characters, plus all the friends just make the show complete. This is the best comedy on TV !! I'd say Seinfeld there and hey, there's nothing wrong with it ... Excellent !! as Doug said.
