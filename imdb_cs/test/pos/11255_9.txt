Spoiler begin The film focuses on three friends, Samantha (Summer Phoenix), Chris (Nick Stahl) and Owen (Aaron Paul). The film begins with Sam and Owen as addicts and Chris, the star who cares for them. As things get worse for Chris, Sam asks what a drug is. Sam is out of rehabilitation and sober at this point and tells him he's doing everything better. Chris then catches up with Owen and starts using it. It takes chris twice until it is a "full-time member". After some problem with the dealer and confession to Sam, he gets back. So the downward spiral begins for them. Chris is when he breaks Sam's promise (I want a movie to be a surprise). She dies, Sam gets to college to become an architect, and Owen is arrested. so the story ends <br /> <br /> Spoiler ends. little spoilers around <br /> <br /> Nick stahl is amazing. One day he will have an Oscar. His portrait of Chris was Heartbreaking. He was the only one who felt real in the film about drug use. Aaron Paul, who played Owen, behaved as if he were at no speed to heroin. Summer Phoenix was fine, he's talented, but what can I say Nick Stahl stole the movie. His dazed eyes, his slow movements, everything was perfect. Writers needed to show a selection in the film. That's why people don't want to stop. Otherwise, there are merry scenes (mall scene, and backstreet boy scene, man Stahl nailed the reaction directly to his head.), Touching, sad scenes (Like the scene between Sam and Chris in her bedroom after she gets beaten park scene.). It was also realistic. I use S again when Chris wanted to flush the toilet, and Chris used it again after he went to Own's, even though he was clean for two weeks, the move was too strong. it is realistic. Watch a movie with a big cast, great music and a half-truth description of drug addiction.
