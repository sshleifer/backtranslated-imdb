Twelve oceans are probably better than eleven oceans. I know most people would disagree, but I actually liked it more. After three years it was good to see the gang return. The reason for the robbery is a little more inspiration a second time. I see why they stole Benedict (Andy Garcia) in the last movie. This film has a slightly greater motivation for the second time. Twelve oceans are more fun and cooler than eleven oceans. With a funny portrait from Topher Grace, he said, "I just went to the new Dennis Quaid movie" and other things. I think Ocean's Twelve is probably the best in the series. Plot: A year or so after Twelve Ocean is Terry Benedict (the guy they robbed in the last movie) and says that if Ocean is Eleven he won't pay him the money they stole, he'll call the police. So Danny Ocean and the gang go to Europe, where Rusty meets his old girlfriend Isabelle. After meeting him again, he begins to follow them. The Gang also learns that they have an enemy who is also a thief who is a little better than them. With many entertaining scenes like Tess (Julia Roberts) going to Europe and pretending to be Julia Roberts, Ocean's Twelve is a pretty smart movie. It's cooler, fun and fun than eleven oceans.
