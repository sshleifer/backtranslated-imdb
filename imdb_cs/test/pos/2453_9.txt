This is a little-seen anti-war film that has been ignored for too long. Time is Thanksgiving from 1972. The place is a typical suburban home somewhere in Texas. The eldest son only has a comeback from Vietnam and hell time to adapt to the life he left behind. And the family doesn't know how to handle this problem. I honestly don't think I'm exaggerating to say this is one of the most serious war movies I've ever seen. The funny thing is that there are only a few combat sequences in the entire movie. Most of the story takes place in the house in a few days. But the type of war that takes place in this house is as intense as any real battle. The film does something that is difficult to achieve; Estevez and his team have created a film that embodies the entire Vietnamese experience. And given the similarities between Vietnam and the current invasion of Iraq, the film is surprisingly relevant. Estevez has great work with the material. He gets a lot of help from the manually collected cast. Especially Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates are great as parents. Really moving movie. Highly recommended
