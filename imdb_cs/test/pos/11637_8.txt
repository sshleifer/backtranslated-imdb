(*** Minor spoilers ***) If there is something in the world of silent clowns that guesses me, it is that Charley Chase has never earned his "deserved" breakthrough in his films. Well, maybe it's not that weird, really, because he never played any feature. But when I think about it, such an explanation makes him more mysterious - because why the hell did Chase get no offer to play major leaders in positions? One explanation is that his character, no matter how fun, was simply too realistic to suit a longer story; without the burlesque features owned by Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, Langdon, and other comedians, one might assume that the comedy he created and which worked so well for twenty minutes would be repeated after several more wars. I shouldn't quite buy it, though, because Chase's gag building is spectacular and could, in my opinion, keep the audience interested for longer; at least I'm tempted to think when MIGHTY LIKE AND MOOSE starts the show. Mr Moose is not an extraordinary sight and Mrs Moose is barely a "classic beauty". He has really the biggest front teeth of any human on the planet, and she has a remarkably large nose. They both do a facelift without knowing another, and if they happen to meet each other later, they don't know their wife and they don't recognize their husband. A series of cheerful misunderstandings, with many clever gags. I don't think I can tell you anything to make tracking more enjoyable for you. Because if you are a fan of silent comedies, or even if you are not MOUSE, MOOSE offers so many unforgettable moments in such a short time that I would look at it as a total disgrace to see it; stupid really, but no less immensely funny.
