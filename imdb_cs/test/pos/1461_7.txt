This is a very special series with Dean Learner. I really didn't understand the guests. I knew they were not serious, but whether it really was was unclear because ... I think I'm just stupid. I do not know whether these classes as a spoiler, but the guests are not real like in Ali g or something that one man or so I believe. I love the serious look that is happening. It's like the program that was Sunday morning that I forgot the name lol. I also like the suit and mustache that is happening. It's pretty hot. It is insensitive, which is one of the most fun features. I also like the way the subsection of the program has it. It seems to be more authentic.
