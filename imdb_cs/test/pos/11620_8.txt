"Subconscious Cruelty" must be one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. It is sometimes extremely grim and bloody, so fans of politically correct mainstream horror waste should not bother. The film mixes many beautiful visuals with lots of sleaze and gore. \ TIt is extremely strange, vicious and disturbing, so fans of bizarre cinema will not be disappointed. My favorite segment of "Subconscious Cruelty" is "Human Larva", which shows us a twisted relationship between a young man and his pregnant sister. The birthing scene is particularly ugly and not easily forgotten. The last segment of "The Right Brain / Martyrdom" must be incredibly harsh and blasphemy with scenes of genital mutilation and terrible torture. We see Jesus Christ captured by the three naked women who disfigured him, tore the flesh out of his chest, licked the wound on his knee and annoyed him. There is also a statue of Jesus with a swastika projection on it "Subconscious Cruelty" is a truly memorable movie that should be seen by fans of extreme cinema.
