For some of the perverted reasons that are best known to them, it seems that these IMDb boards are reluctant to attribute at least two (this and Ninotchku) co-screenwriter to his early classics when each buff can reveal Wilder's hand at work. As it happened, it was the first time he was associated with Charles Brackett (who has a credit) and it was a great start. One commentator noticed how satisfying it is to see these movies in old-fashioned cinemas and I couldn't agree. In Paris one of the smaller Revival Homes shows in one of his salles a more or less continuous Lubitsch retrospective, and I am glad that the news that this played a highly appreciating audience across the age spectrum though I doubt whether any was actually alive when \ t In 1938. The famous Wilder Schtick meet-cute is here especially tasty when a millionaire, but-cautious-with-it Cooper is trying to buy half of his pajamas in a department store on the Riviera and meets sales resistance until Claudette Colbert appears and agrees that he buys the other half. Gag is even more milked when the manager himself calls the owner who is in bed after the command of the store is exhausted and lets him discover that he is wearing only the upper half of his pajamas. The film is full of visual gags so balanced by verbal joke, making it almost perfect. Claudette Colbert is just amazing and gets great support from Edward Everett Horton as her impoverished father. In the fourth billing, David Niven has some funny "business", as does Franklin Pangborn, and if Gary Cooper is not in his role he lacks, because he does the verbal dexterity and the sophisticated personality Wilder's scripts demanded at this stage of their career, I don't have everything and what you're doing is boldly close.
