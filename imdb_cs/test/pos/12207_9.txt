The surface, since his teaser first appeared in the summer of 2005, has been thrown. On the one hand, it seemed to be a conceptual concept and a conspiracy that a passerby felt as if it worked better as a film (or several). Moreover, it was as if it was an NBC attempt to "a lost killer". On the other hand, you may have realized that the story is too large to say in a movie or two, and Lost's fans looked interesting. So after one (and maybe only) season on NBC, the show is on indefinite hiatus that could either put it in the vault, on the Sci-Fi, or fill the gap in the NBC lineup in the summer or autumn 2007 or more. Her rating was a bit better in the net (which she doesn't say much), but the show was out of the air without a real official announcement about her future. <br /> <br /> Is it worth it? Yes. <br /> <br /> The surface is followed by a continuous story format, driven by a chart and without fill episodes. Almost everything that is happening at the exhibition is important for the story, just like a movie. No fill episodes that give pain to your side when you miss an episode. But the show's double edge helped it; Great things seem to become every episode, but because it looks like a movie, you'll end up with every episode that feels like a little, and you wanted more! This show feature, although it shows how great it is. The cast is solid; the three main lines, including the beautiful Lake Bell as Laura Daughtery, put in a solid performance every episode, each driven by their own reasons for finding / studying animals. The cast, including the cast of Ian Anthony Dale and a short performance by Rade Serbedzije, took a good shot. The story is slow to start (my regret, it doesn't really pick up up to 3-4 episodes into a short 15-season episode), but the second half of the season is up to it. The visual effects are overwhelming (one jaw will drop when you see one of the animal attacks). Many problems with this show can be fixed by buying to finish the first season and you don't have to wait a week (or three) to watch the next episode. <br /> <br /> In short, if you missed your first season and are curious, come back and watch it. It's not a pair of Peaks in terms of unpredictability, but the highly conceived nature puts it in the league with Lost, and other similar shows, with a sense of action and adventure. Enjoy it.
