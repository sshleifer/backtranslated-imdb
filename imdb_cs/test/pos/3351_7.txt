The adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll story is much better than you would expect. Here, Alice is a virgin librarian who falls from a rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own image. Made at a time when adult movies were creative efforts with graphs instead of just a series of sex scenes, this is a good looking little movie more similar to the low budget movies of its day. Despite what you think this movie has a really good script with funny jokes and good songs. It's a naughty adult story. If you're wondering if my recommendation is good or not, I think the movie was only available in its non-hardcore version for the better part of the past three decades, simply because the movie stood out of sex, as I first saw a movie years ago on cable television. The relatively recent release of home video on DVD returned sex (in horribly grainy embedded clips), which clearly shows that removing shots was the best choice all around. If you're an open minded adult with a taste of something spicy, I can highly recommend this little movie as a nice diversion.
