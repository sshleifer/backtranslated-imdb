When I watched this movie when I was a kid, I didn't understand the assumptions of Hitchcock and the dark comedy. Now that I'm in the mid-20th century, it's more meaningful. I think the reason I like this movie is that the comedy duo of Billy Crystal and Danny DeVit make an interesting comedy, like a grotesque (pan and car scene) and verbal (arguments / murder talks) and writing). The story revolves around Larry Donner (Crystal), a struggling writer who has his masterpiece stolen from him by his wife Margaret (starring surprisingly brilliant Kate Mulgrew, aka Capt. Janeway of Star Trek: Voyager). While shifting between a writer's block and teaching a creative writing class, he meets a student. Owen Lifts (DeVito), an aspiring writer and overgrown mom's boy who unfortunately still acts as a child. Does it have train tracks, do I need to say more? Think about the Failure to Start, only Matt McConaughey is short, fat and bald. Owen is imprisoned in his own life, with a demanding evil mother (Anne Ramsey), who can't stand. Looking for Larry's advice on how to get out of it, and when he says he'll see Hitchcock's film, Owen gets the bad idea that if he killed Larry's wife, he would return him a favor and kill his mom. Follows merriment while the two try to deal with the second problem. Owen goes to extremes to kill Margaret while Larry, who refuses to agree to make his "plan part", is driven by Owen nuts by his mother. During the film, Larry and Owen slowly but surely form a bond of friendship that is rare today in a dark comedy. One part of the movie I really loved was where Owen shows Larry his coin collection, and just lets say more of his sentimental collection than anything else. Two star stars aside, late Anne Ramsey is cheerful, Mama, and deadly with her stick. She is much more comedic verbally and physically in this, unlike her role as Mama Fratelli of The Goonies. So he curses like a sailor and seduces his son in every turn, but that's what makes her character so alive. She makes her character the kind of person you love to hate. Another experience in this film is the music of the great jazz Brandford Marsalis, who plays Larry's neighbor and friend Lester. There is a great moment in the film when he plays Larry's jazz, who is depressed and needs some good melodies to relieve pain. Jazz can do it. Finally, I would like Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito to do another good movie together, but I'm sorry for their little too old for the game. This is one of those rare movies where both stars shine in their own subtle ways. DeVito is a children's comedy and Crystal's joke made this movie for me. 5 Star Comedy.
