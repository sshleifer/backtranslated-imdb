Films are not always considered deep, provocative thoughts. Sometimes they just have to escape from reality. Out To Sea fits perfectly into your account. The light romantic comedy of "Golden Years", Out To Sea, may not be a big budget, you may be able to easily find out when they were acting in front of a green screen, but it's still a lot of film worth watching . A sweet movie that has to get a break. That's just good, fun. It's not such a deep movie. It's something worth watching. If nothing else, you have to see it for the funny stiff and honest rendition of Oye Como Va, which is for Brent Spiner Gil. He is a character you like to hate, and Mr. Spiner pulls a perfect bad comic film to two beloved comedy movie gods.
