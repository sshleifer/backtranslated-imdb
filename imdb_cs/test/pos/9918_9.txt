If you don't like Italian horror, you won't like this movie. On this note ... <br /> <br /> "Overall ... it was a terrible experience ... Many things happened. Vanessa Redgrave was supposed to be in the movie and pulled out. One of the actors I was engaged to get married but at the end of the picture that was finished, my father died while shooting ... all kinds of things -Dario Argento about "Opera" <br /> <br /> I was really impressed with Argento and the movie he made here - The whole mystic "Macbeth" and her curse on those trying to play the game adds innumerable volumes to "Opera". <br /> <br /> During Argento, he uses some of his smartest (and The young opera singer Christina is being chased by a violent psychopath who forces her to watch a series of brutal murders, tying a few sharp blades to Christine's eyelids to prevent her from closing her eyes, "Look at it. t eyes, rend them apart. "<br /> <br /> It is obvious that Argento pays great attention to the construction of the opera" Macbeth "on the screen and the hard work pays off. Add to it a few unforgettable brutal murders, an incredibly tense sequence of persecution, and the ingenious use of POV to portray a certain character (Vanessa Redgrave's role, thank God) and have one of the best Italian horror movies ever made. That said - it's still Italian horror. Why Christina doesn't seem to tell anyone about these brutal murders, she's out of someone who understands. Some scenes may be difficult for some viewers to stomach, but personally I felt more tense towards Christine and her eyes than any of the brutal murders in the movie. The final to "Tenebrae" had my stomach swirled more than anything in "Opera", but that's just me. And the last five minutes ... Argento wanted, he made it, and he fought it to keep it in the movie. Definitely nobody likes it, myself, but it's not enough to destroy the rest of the movie for me. It remains one of the best Argento movies to date. 9/10
