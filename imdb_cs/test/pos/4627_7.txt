At 14:37 in the Adelaide High School bathroom, a student takes his own life and the different worlds of six teenagers change forever. 2:37 is a brutal, honest and breathtaking film that focuses on Pain to be a teenager. The film follows one day in the lives of six teenagers who are intertwined, all dealing with their own personal dramas. While there are several stereotypes in the mix? A beautiful by-girl girl engaged in body problems, over-achiever obsessed with his mark, there are a few horrors that are so far from the mainstream as you can get, including a social outcast dealing with brutal illness and a young girl trying to get in her a devastating event. The film is interspersed with documentary interviews from characters that some viewers can find out of place in an otherwise seamless story. The tempo is also a bit slow, but it fits into the feeling of film. Young Australian actors are their own stars, especially Theresa Palmer, whose heartbreaking performance earned her an AFI nomination. <br /> <br /> The film is very well filmed, with an amazing direction. Some scenes are a little hard to watch? especially the five-minute suicide scene, but overall it is a film that leaves a lot of influence on its audience. It attracts you right in front of the shocking opening scene and assures you which of the six main characters will be in the bathroom. Finally, it is a beautiful but somewhat disturbing view of teenage life.
