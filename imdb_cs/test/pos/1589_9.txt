This is a devastating but substitute adaptation of Thomas Mann's novel of the same title. Dirk Bogarde gives his best performance on screen - he himself believed it. The dialogue is minimal, so his face must record the nuances of his anxious character - composer (novelist in novelty - the only major change) that travels to Venice in 1910. Visconti looks forward to depicting beauty, it's missing and Visconti, who has become leader disintegration, merged with Mahler's music and images seamlessly in his best movie from "Leopard" (another stunning film that greatly influenced Coppola's Sicily in "Godfather").
