During World War II, two Belarusian (Soviet) soldiers try to avoid being captured by Nazi occupiers because they weave through snowy terrain, seek food and safety. If you don't like black and white "foreign" movies, you can still enjoy "Voskhozhdeniye" ("The Ascent"). Director Larisa Shepitko speaks extremely well with the film, even though it is largely an introspective work. Unfortunately, her premature death, in a car accident, made this final movie of Mrs. Shepitka. <br /> <br /> After launching the introductory mission, it does not seem that much can happen in the snowy woods, but Shepitko and the changing setting are unexpectedly exciting. Leading players Vladimir Gostyukhin (as spiritually wounded "Rybak") and Boris Plotnikov (as physically wounded "Sotnikov") are successfully avoiding being crushed by ever-increasing symbolism, and their allegorical performance under the sharp Shepitka provide an unforgettable and thoughtful image. provoking a familiar story. ******** Voskhozhdeniye (4/2/77) Larisa Shepitko ~ Vladimir Gostyukhin, Boris Plotnikov, Lyudmila Polyakova, Anatoli Solonitsyn
