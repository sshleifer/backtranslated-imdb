I saw what is the best Australian movie of the year, Acolytes Jon Hewitt. Acolytes is a stylish thriller with the assumption of a killer. Get it? Two bullied and harassed teens appear in their suburbs of a local serial killer and then blackmail him to kill the bully who bothered them. Hewitt chose a top line-up, including excellent new players Sebastian Gregory, Josuy Payne and Hanny Mangan Lawrence, who play teens. Add to it three, yes, that's right three big psycho! Leads Joel Edgerton in Outstanding Performance of Serial Killer du jour, Belinda McClory His Outnumbered Husband and Michael Dorman as Teenage Rape Bully, with Swastika Tattoos. Once you add these teens and these menacing adults, will all the hell be released? Hewitt has created marbles for a serial thriller that is damn original and perfect. You can see the influence of Larry Clark and David Lynch on Twin Peaks, but Hewitt does it alone, in the suburban water Qld, which always rings the drones of emptiness. The screenplay by Shayne Armstong, Shane Krouse and Hewitt is tight. <br /> <br /> If this market is properly marketed, this film may be a hit for teenagers. More Wolf Creek? It could be good. It does all the right moves. Teens are real ala Larry Clark. They do not suck and have an attached PC agenda, they are not communicative, good looking and hip. The killers are dark with a terrible threat. Joel Edgerton steals his scenes as a slightly behaved local Ted Bundy, who sports a butterfly on his 4WD spare ala John Fowles collector. Dorman's gasoline head rapist pours on the threat that Suburban Mayhem peaks and provides a creepy thug that you can't wait to see a farm. The movie is fast, hard and brutal. Not only does it show the trust and overhead of the Hewitt Championship, it is surely to win him an IF or AFI nomination, if not a prize! His nuances and poetic mission en scene, brilliant sound design, excellent cinematography and tight structure are clearly one of the best directors I've seen this year. <br /> <br /> The film lets you shake your thinking and restlessness. It's a really great release to return to the Australian film genre currently. That will certainly win Hollywood interest. And did I mention he got to Toronto? What other feature films can Oz say? The world should prepare for a new author, Jon Hewitt.
