Is it a good movie? No, certainly not. But for Jolie lovers it is necessary. Her non-polished acting and semi-nudity scene delights her fans for ever to come. However, the current rating (3.2) is too low. The film might lack a good story, and not a big sf-movie altogether, but acting is good enough (and as mentioned earlier, Jolie's performances are nice and raw), the film is shot very straight, with lots near -UPS. The scenery is bizarre. Last but not least, leaving van Damme was a very good choice. Probably not Jolie's lovers would like to see that she has sex with him. This film has all the potential to become a cult film.
