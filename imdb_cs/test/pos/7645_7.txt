This is an unpredictable film that initially appears predictable until the last scene. The protagonist is a tough guy who goes to work in a small carnival where he pays for killing a woman's manager's belly dancer, Divana, and then ends up falling on her. It is tempting, delicate and deadly and constantly disappears and reappears as a magic trick. Other movie props include her polite husband / employer (played by talented Armand Assante), some ugly Dominican mafia and most important for conspiracy, a suitcase full of money. Just like the old "shell" game, the one where you have to guess which one is under the peas will guess who has the money, and like the victims of the hucksters who run such games, you will probably guess wrong. Dagma Dominczyk, as a beautiful Divana, is a talented performer and attentive, whether she dances with a huge snake around her shoulders, or works on a griff on all the unfortunate people in her orbit. Norman Reedus is fine because of a young horse that is flummoxed by the elusive beauty he has paid to kill him. But don't count it because it turns out to be smarter than anyone has. This strange movie is worth a look.
