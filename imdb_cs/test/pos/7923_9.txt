ALEXANDER NEVSKY is nothing short of a big-screen movie. The film opens a window to the world and culture that most Americans will never get to know. And much has been said and written about the thin veiled patriotism of the film in the face of the impending war with the German Nazis. According to American standards, acting is somewhat agile. The script is short on words and big on visual events. And while the action can become tedious, the visuals are often overwhelming. The direction is incredible. On the next note, Ralph Bakshi's animation fans notice that he has stolen a lot of his visuals for WIZARDS directly from a copy of ALEXANDER NEVSKA.
