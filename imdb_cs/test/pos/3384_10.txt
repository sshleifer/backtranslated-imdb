I really liked North and South. I think it's one of the best and most noble TV series I've ever seen. The cast is amazing, you have actors from the "golden age of film", people like James Stewart, Gene Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Mitchum and Jean Simmons with other actors who were new faces of the 80s like Patrick Swayze, James Read, Jonathan Frakes Genie Francis, Philip Casnoff and Lesley-Anne Down. At the heart of the story is the friendship of two completely different men, there is Orry Main (Patrick Swayze) is from the south and George Hazard (James Read), who is from the north. Throughout the series, their friendship is constantly threatened by differences in their background, especially when it comes to treating slaves in the south (especially in Orry's plantation), but when everyone needs another, he forgets his arguments and goes and helps his friend. I really liked the chemistry between the two men and I was really interesting if their friendship could survive the war. I liked the way the show showed how it was before the war, so viewers could see what were the factors that led to the war that happened at the time, then the devastation of the nation that was torn and then had to rebuild the country. The war scenes were very choreographic and very realistic for me. I think it's great that it has so many elements that go through it, romance, history, battles that would interest most of them. viewers, there's something for everyone. I especially enjoyed the romance between Brett (Genie Francis) and Billy (Parker Stevenson / John Stockwell), especially when she first stood up to Sister Ashton. The other romances were interesting because they weren't all the same, each of them had something different than the others that followed me in particular by following the story of Madeline and Orra to see if they'd be together. It's one of America's best mini-series I've watched, the story has the right balance between romance and the more serious historical side of the country, but it's a good way. The characters are very attentive and the places are beautiful and the music especially at the beginning and end of the episode is so good that it works and works with the mood of the story.
