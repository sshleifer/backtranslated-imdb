I honestly have to say that CAT IN BRAIN is one of the funniest and unintentionally cheerful movies I've ever seen. This film is full of stupid dialogues, ridiculous scenes and self-conspiracy, in which legendary horror director Lucio Fulci plays alone. An ordinary story is about an aging director (Fulci, who is also named Lucio Fulci in the movie ...), who is starting to go crazy and hallucinate for all the evil things he has left in the film over the past few years. He goes into diminishing who hypnotizes Fulci, and tells him that he will believe himself to be a murderer, but that shrinking will actually be doing killing. The rest of the film is made up of footage from the "movie" that Fulci controls during all these actions, scenes of shrunken people killing all the time as they smile like f! Cking moron, and some of Fulci's hallucination sequences. Oh, and a few breasts that fit into a good scale, just as good ... <br /> <br /> CAT IN BRAIN is absolutely crowded and ridiculous in every sense. Gore's Classic Fulci - Ugly and powerful with some really decent scenes. The female dead body chainsaw is just as cool as a small boy's chainsaw. Lots of stings, gougings and other cool kill-scenes make this one pretty non-stop carnage. Sensual dialog (LICK IT !!!! LICK IT !!!), as well as some insanely goofy scenes (Nazi orgies, opera singing slap-fest and running innocent hippies easily attack ...) to make this fun like hell. It's not as dark as some other Fulci films - CAT is more than a benevolent horror / comedy that, if it's not funny, is actually a little sad. I say to catch a fifth of the cheap bourbon and settle in this. I watched CAT with some friends and we laughed all the time. This is a good summer feeling ... 8/10 recommended
