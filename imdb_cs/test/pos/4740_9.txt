There were many documentaries that I saw in which the law seemed to be on the wrong side of the fence - Thin blue line and paradise lost come to mind in the first place. But this is the first film that angered me after I saw it. It seems quite clear to me from the evidence presented in this film that what happened at Waco was at least an unprofessional and sloppy mess on the part of the FBI and the AFI, in the worst case of murder. Like most people, when the siege in Waco occurred, I assumed that David Koresh was an evil madman who led a violent cult. After seeing it, I think Koresh was rather a mildly unbalanced and confused man who inadvertently caught the attention of the US government through his eccentric actions. Sure, there were plenty of weapons in the Davidian compound branch. But none of this was illegal. It was absolutely heartbreaking to see videos of people on the premises, all of whom seemed to be very kind and harmless. And they got angry when they saw the ruthless testimony of the men who were in charge of the government forces in Waco, the clueless testimony of Janet Reno and the guerrilla defense of the attack on Waco, a defense led by several Democrats of the committee. . Most of my mind was a NY representative and a current US Senator from NY Charles Schumer. I voted for the man when I lived in NY - I'm a Democrat, quite left-wing. After seeing his steps on this committee, I wish I could come back in time and vote instead for D'Amato! It is a very important film to be seen for anyone who is interested in distance government. I even think it should be shown in classes - it's so important.
