I loved this movie! Markie Post is really great at that. I've seen it for a lifetime and it's in the same fun class as movies like: "The Betty Broderick Story", "Locked Up: The Rage Mothers", etc .... It's over the top of the drama, about a single mother trying to break away from her middle, predictable personality. This movie is just pure fun! It may not be a realistic view of heroin addiction. But it shows how every "ordinary" middle class man (and they!) Can be heroin addicted. There are no homeless people on the street. By the way, if you look at it, look at how the boy bosses his mother! Spoiled!} 8 out of 10 stars.
