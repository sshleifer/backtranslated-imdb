I would like to thank you for giving me the chance to be one of the first to see the movie. Really grabs you. Eventually, John Paul gets to the light and makes life for himself not to be tied to his mothers apron. I imagine that in these days so many families must be in the same position (especially with children leaving older children, but I don't think they are wiser) with very sad parents who don't have their own lives, and who make their lives miserable. I think this movie should definitely have a wider audience. I would also say that other actors also played brilliant parts. It's such a deep movie and very mobile.
