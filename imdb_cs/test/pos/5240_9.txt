I recently bought "The Big Trail" {1930}. It's an amazing, amazing movie. I knew it by legend, but I never expected it to be so spectacular. My version is one shot in 35mm and I'll talk about it later. When one thinks of Western myth in film, the names that come to mind are John Ford and John Wayne. You only have half of the team here, but the whole Myth is present. Raoul Walsh gave us a remarkable epic in which the struggle for the nation's expansion to the west is a real conspiracy. There is a conspiracy focused on romance between Breck Coleman {Wayne} and Ruth Cameron {Margaret Churchill} with the main villain, Red Flack is unforgettably played by Tyrone Power, Sr. But it has almost the quality of the car moving forward against the incredible obstacles both natural and human. Examples are river crossing, Indian battle, and passing of the burning desert. The consequences of the battle are given by a picturesque touch when the doll is placed on the grave of a child killed while the loyal dog lies on the grave of his master. <br /> <br /> The spectacular panoramas are filled with energy and activity. The opening scene, when the train is preparing to leave, a stop on Dance Square and a large herd of buffalo are some to be remembered. Amazing use is filming throughout the territory. Another feature of this wonderful film is the fact that men and women receive the same reward for their parts in their great Westward struggle. Women work, fight and confront terrible suffering with the same strength and power as their male counterparts. The finale has a very uplifting experience when Coleman and Cameron meet in the vast enormous Sequoia Forest to begin their new life. The action is quite acceptable. I have already mentioned the performance of the Tyrone Power scenes. Tully Marshall is excellent because Coleman's Sidekick, and Marguerite Churchill convincingly portrays a woman who develops inner strength when she encounters her own problems as well as those outside. The comic-relief is the weakest aspect of this film, but these scenes are not common and are swallowed in the vast motion of the film. <br /> <br /> Did I read much of Wayne's criticism? Even so far that blame his "wooden playing" for the film's failure at the box office. I think it's unfair. Wayne was in his first starring role and certainly did not develop his performance stance in Stagecoach. But he still does a real job in a role that will surely play a second violin to a big exaggerated topic. After "The Great Way", Wayne played in a large number of low-budget B Westerns. I have several of them and you see developers in them. When "Stagecoach" came, he was ready for it and "The Big Trail" was an important part of this apprenticeship. <br /> <br /> I already mentioned that my version is one shot in 35mm. It's still impressive, but to get an idea of ​​the 70mm version, I set the TV screen to 16: 9, which doesn't cause any distortion. Although they did not have the full effect of the Grandeur version, it was good enough to wish. {In addition, the 70mm film has several extra scenes that are not in the form of a regular theater performance}. All-in-all, this film deserves to be in every list of the biggest movies. The Westerns sometimes did.
