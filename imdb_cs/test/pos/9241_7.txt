Anyone who has ever wondered how to make a film without a budget should see this document. The determination of anyone he portrayed in this project was very moving for me and should be linked to those of us who have ever embarked on any part of the show business, be it film, music or writing. I think filmmakers could do a better job of heralding the events that led to the film becoming a documentary, perhaps using a narrator; Other than that, the movie comes as a real example of how a show business isn't about "show" but rather "business". I hope the real planned project, "Repo Man II", sees the light of day. I think the filmmakers did a great job with it, what they had to work with and everything they had to overcome to finish it.
