I like Tom Hanks and is one of the few actors who will draw me into the theater regardless of any film-related doubts. I'm afraid Mr. Hanks will return to the "light comedy" because it's the arena where he changed from television to film - remember "Big"? Well, "Charlie Wilson's War" is not a light comedy. It is a political satire and a very well-written political satire. The screenplay is the star of this movie, and the word-smithing of Aaron Sorkin is one of the best in the offer this year. Mike Nicols holds the entire escapade together, bringing a movie that zips in a very fast 90 minutes (timing is all in comedy, and nothing is ever funny if it pulls). Nicol's choice in sets and lighting is also very reminiscent of television in the 1970s and 1980s, which is deliberately used to root the work in the period. <br /> <br /> Returning to Modeling and Taking Pictures via Photo Digital Special Effects also enhance retro look and credibility. A note for the designers in your footage selection: I know the difference between F-16 and MiG and Bell and Hind. But it could also be part of a joke. I saw this movie in Philadelphia. It was interesting to watch and listen to the audience NOT to get historical links to your own history. History has a tendency to repeat itself because the repeat offenders have forgotten what happened for the first time. Kudos Mr. Hanks and Chameleon Phillip Seymore Hoffman. Sorkin's screenplay comes to life with these actors and the entire production team is at the top of their game. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
