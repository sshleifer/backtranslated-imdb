This is a special movie if you know the context. Antonioni was crippled in the 1980s. Mute and half paralysis, his friends - who, by the way, are the best film world - have arranged to "direct" the last major film. The idea is that it can conjure up a story into being by simply looking at it. So we have a film: about a director who tells stories through simple observation. The (four) story is about how visual imagination defines love. The film appears by giving us the tools to take it into our own imagination. The result is a pure film world: every person (except the director) is beautiful in aspect or movement. Some of these women are ultralight and exist in the dreamy foggy world of sensory encounter. There is no nuance, nor a hint that there is anything, but what we see; No desire is at work different from what we create. I know of no other film that would successfully manipulate our own visual desire to create the world we see. He understands something about not touching. Nobody visually understands Van Morrison. Morrison's Celtic space music is based on exactly the same concept: a sensual touch that suggests, but does not physically touch. Antonioni's red-haired wife is apparently appearing as a merchant and also directs the faint creation 'movie that is on DVD. Ted's rating - 3 of 4: It's worth watching.
