I'm sorry that many people are rated as low. The series started very well and after the first season it was not so good. People tend to forget the beginning of something and just look at the end. It's not good to do, you should look at the overall, not the end result. Sadly, many "usual" characters died, but damn, we had a lot of nice new characters. <br /> <br /> Please do not join several characters, but join the series, plot. Please understand that I didn't like Boone's death when Augur died, but well ... you have to do it. Can you imagine that everyone is living the whole series when they are always in danger? Come on, you face it if they didn't die, they would be invincible. This way you will always maintain tension, survive, die? I realize that people are joining their characters. My favorite character was Augur, the one who could get into every computer he wanted. It was the one who was mysterious, could do things with the computer no one else could do. I would like to make one statement for all people who vote negative, doing a series that started so well deserves to have such a low rating? Should we look at the final season instead of the overall season? Shouldn't we see how good the series was when it started? Shouldn't we see how much we enjoyed it?
