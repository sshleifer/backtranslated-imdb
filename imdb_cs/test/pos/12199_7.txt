Again, there are terribly government agencies stopping for anything to prevent public knowledge of some major events. In this case, it is the discovery of a new undersea species that could threaten the planet's ecology. Although this being is not E.T. Does he seem to be friends with one juvenile who protects him at all costs, not realizing that he is just a child of this kind and gets much bigger? a badder This 2005 series went a lot. It's a family drama, a science fiction, a thriller with more than a few comedy moments. The characters are believable, well acted and well photographed. The show holds attention. Of course, as with any sci-fi show, distrust must be achieved. And I think it's here. Unfortunately, the series crashed after the first season, so we never get the resolution. Angry .. There is a general comment that seems to me to be here. Many television networks and / or film distribution companies abolish, at will, seemingly superb TV series? especially sci-fi. Now there may be some very good reasons, even if the audience is treated with utter contempt and seldom explains. This in itself is annoying. What it actually gets my goat is that after canceling the series, then it issues the thing if it has it, on the DVD, in an obvious attempt to milk the dairy cow as much as possible. For the previous audience of the series, that's okay, they know what they are, but ?? many of these unfinished series end on the cliffhanger. Two that come to mind immediately are "Surface" and "Odyssey 5". If you have heard good stuff about the series and have not seen it go and buy a blasted DVD and end up with an unsolved conspiracy problem? that makes me very angry! Did I enjoy the "surface" immensely and did not realize that poor characters would end up in a situation that seemed totally unsustainable? and we never know what happened next. I think there should be a prominent warning about all such DVD issues that the story is unfinished. I'm currently reviewing TV series purchases (IMDB is an excellent starting point of course) to see if the "complete" series is really complete or not. Buyer Beware.
