Just as Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) is about to break in his professional life his frustrated wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) finally gets the courage to leave him, leaving Ted to look after their five-year-old son (Justin Henry). Being the only family seems to be a complete chore for Ted, and he suffers professionally, but he also learns that there is a lot more life than a career when he always associates with his own son and really knows him. But then Joanna returns and intends to get her son back, leading to a harsh detention process. Kramer vs. Kramer Kramer is a superbly written and beautifully played human drama. he ignored the viewer. Hoffman's growing relationship with his son is so well portrayed and the film never takes an easy way out. It always feels very realistic and makes the impact of the film even less impact-free thanks to the low-level approach of the film and can easily work on multiple perspectives, with the dramatic impact of the film not diminishing. <br /> <br /> Easy to recommend; 10 of 10.
