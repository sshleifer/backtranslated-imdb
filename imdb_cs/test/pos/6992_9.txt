People who thought that CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK was sucking harder than the black hole that devoured EVENT HORIZON probably did not see a movie that would start with Vin Diesel's murderous killer, and it probably doesn't. Too bad because PITCH BLACK actually digs the main ass. Direction of the veterinarian David Twohy, (WARLOCK and excellent but underrated BELOW) and written by siblings Jim and Ken Wheat (LIES, SILENT SCREAM), PITCH BLACK begins with the prologue "ALIEN". When a combined cargo freighter / passenger ship is severely damaged by a strange meteor shower (which also captain is killed), co-founder Carolyn Fry (SILENT HILL'S Radha Mitchell) has an important decision: passengers? In the vicinity of collecting ore over passengers, a crash landing derails its ultimate course of action. Regardless, because the catastrophic landing was done on the pre-rock that once held the mining colony. Among the survivors are several settlers, Shazza (FARSCAPE Claudia Black) and Zeke (John Moore); Imam (Keith David) and his young followers (can you say "red shirts" boys and girls?); antique shop named Paris Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald); The 'young boy' named Jack (Rhianna Griffith), and the most controversial members of the band: Marshall named Johns (super slimy Cole Hauser) and his prisoner ... a dangerous assassin named Riddick (Diesel). <br /> <br /> How group dynamics are shaking to get a lot of dramatic tension, especially with concerns about Riddick and how many people could slice and dice if they ever get away. But nobody comes out alive here, as they say, and the biggest twists have less to do with how they get than they survive when they find out unthinkable. They are not alone on the planetoid. Things that are hungry, tense and fast move only where they don't see them, live in the dark, where they can survive and thrive. They want the meat of new entrants to take on appetite, but they can't come into daylight to feed themselves. <br /> <br /> Does the phrase "total eclipse" have something more interesting? ? You betcha. Therefore, there is more than a suitable title. Vin, more monosyllabic than Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry on his roughest day, dripping more testosterone than sweat, has a field day with a character that really looks worth the sequel or two, and Hauser, The radiation of threats and bile is every bit as good as his father Wings was on the screen-villain. Surprisingly, however, Mitchell holds his own and can be strong and compassionate as Fry. You would expect nothing but a strong performance from Black, which was once 'Aeryn Sun' and will not disappoint. (Too bad her role wasn't bigger, but that's all I will say.) And David makes his usual indelible impression as a holy man whose faith will actually be tested in the pit of hell. Tempo moves faster than Riddick, which slips behind its prey stalk in its teeth, and as soon as the darkness descends, terror and tension never stop, as in other classic sci-fi / horror movies that imitates. However, if imitation is truly the most honest form of flattery, Dave Twohy and Wheats deserve a significant backward for taking this right with revenge, and for giving us the end that is at its maximum against Hollywood. I do not want to spoil the surprise, so I will not say much more, except that if you first saw CHRONICLES and were not very happy, give PITCH BLACK a chance as well. And if you haven't seen it, be sure to start with this. I don't know what Vin is now, but it certainly could do worse than calling these people back. I'd like to see what they would dream ...
