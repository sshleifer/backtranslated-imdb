For the first time I saw this DVD, I wasn't just happy because it was the first time the band had released anything but also because the DVD itself was extremely loud. Of course, Jimmy Page cannot live with silent music, I think. However, I must say that during the concert at the Royal Albert Hall, they have expanded 'How Much More' and 'Moby Dick' too long. Otherwise it was excellent. My favorite song of all time is now on this DVD. Trampled under my feet. It's either that or 'In my time of dying'. In that song, Jimmy really plays the thing well. Did you see Randy Rhoads? Jimmy plays the same way he does, except the guitar is lower.
