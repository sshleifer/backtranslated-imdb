It is less visceral than the only other Tsai movie I have seen ("Vive L'amour"), but the notion of entrances (holes) in emotions and the existence of others is vividly depicted here, because Tsai sets out for a long time after a long shot. , usually with long shots, suggesting a sense of alienation in Taipei. Music interludes inspired by Grace Chang are confused but welcome mile-markers that add new dimensions to the slowly evolving relationship between a young man upstairs and a woman downstairs. It's not an easy movie to watch (though it's not difficult), so I would warn all casual viewers looking for some "indie" fun (like Tarantino or Guy Ritchie). But if you want to know about isolation between Taiwanese residents and something more versatile about city alienation and romantic desire, watch this movie immediately.
