This is definitely an excellent show. I don't have a cable, so I started renting it because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a teen soap, you know who this dating guy is, kind of stuff. But it wasn't. It's surprisingly deep. He's also very funny. It moves at a very fast pace and every time you look at it, there are more and more jokes. It's a comedy-drama that's rare when it's done well. It's about the relationship between Rory and Lorelai. Instead of the classic mother-daughter relationship, it's the story of the best friend relationship - about mother and daughter. The characters are perfectly cast and everyone is doing a great job. It's definitely the best TV show I've ever met.
