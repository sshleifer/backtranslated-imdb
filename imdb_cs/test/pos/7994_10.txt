I always thought Batman was coming back to the great sequel to Batman. The story was interesting and Danny Devito, Christopher Walken and Micheal Keaton gave a great performance. Plus lets face it, Tim Burton was a genius and did a comic character more justice than Joel Screwmacher ever did. Plot: Oswald Cobblepot also known as Penguin (played by Danny Devito) is abandoned by his parents as a child for being deformed. It uses it as an excuse to use the gooes (Red Triangle Gang) and the very shady magnate Max Shrek (played by Christopher Walken) to massacre a sinister plot to kidnap the first born children of Gotham. Max Shreck later makes Penguin Mayor of Gotham. Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) is pushed out of the window by Max Shreck and is animated with cats. He later develops cat quality and tries to destroy Max Shrek and Batman. Her reasons for wanting to destroy the dark knight are not explained. Opinion: Batman returns is a classic. It has a darker feel in terms of atmosphere. Tim Burton has always had the talent to look appealing. Micheal Keaton is still as sharp as Batman. Danny Devito steals the show as Oswald Cobblepot / The Penguin. When you think about it, he would make a better Violator for Spawn than John Leguizamo. Michelle Pfeiffer gave Catwoman more personality than Halle Berry ever could. Max Shreck is one of Christopher Walken's best roles. The main reason I like Batman Returns is its fun. It is not only creative but also fun. A lot of big movies about the budget are missing these days. The Batman series goes to dogs after Tim Burton decided to do no more. You don't trust me, look at Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Thank God Christopher Nolan breathed life into a series with Batman Begins.
