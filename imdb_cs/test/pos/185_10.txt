If you think any war movie can really make you feel war, you have to see "Letyat zhuravli" ("Cranes Fly" in English). It tells the story of Veronica (Tatiana Samoyl) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov), who are in love on the brink of World War II. They walk along the waterfront and watch the crane fly as the war begins. Boris is immediately sent to war. Veronika hides with her family and ends up marrying a son she does not love. Meanwhile, Boris continues trotting through the countryside, fighting the Nazis and experiencing all the horrors of war until he gets energy. When Veronika - working in a military hospital - gets this message, she refuses to accept it until Boris's body comes home on one of the trains. At the same time, the radio announces that Germany surrendered and the Allied forces won the war; The Soviet Union has lost 27 million citizens but it is the beginning of a new era. This film did a very good job of showing the human impact of war not only on the battlefield, but also on how it affected the civilian population. This is definitely a movie that everyone should see.
