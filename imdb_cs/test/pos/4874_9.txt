The first film at Fangoria in Vegas and the most challenging. It's not a movie for everyone. Many of the films that followed have used predictable classic horror patterns to tell predictable stories. This image seemed determined to do its own thing. Tom Savini has shown some comic chops as one of the best villains. He dominated every scene he was in, and slung his cloak like Leslie Neilson playing Dracula. It was great to hear his explanation after the movie. He had such a good sense of humor about the role. <br /> <br /> I was glad I didn't have too many prejudices because the movie offered a lot of surprises. The story was humorous and profane and unusual. There was a lot of love on the look. Most importantly, she had a strange strange edge on it. Unlike many movies that followed and tried to use a similar classic horror style, it was a movie that used its appearance for a particular purpose. There were a lot of films with bigger budgets at Fangoria, but no one who dared to be different.
