My mother is like Gone With The Wind as I can. She has collectible plates, Rhett and Scarlett dolls Madame Alexander, GWTW Christmas decorations, even GWTW cookbooks! My sister and I saw only pieces and pieces of GWTW, but we knew the whole story with the heart. My sister bought a miniseries on a whim because my mother wanted it, and we were interested in it after we went through the novel a bit. We decided to watch both Gone With The Wind and Scarlett yesterday. We started GWTW at about 2:30 pm and ended at 6:30. We started Scarlett right after that. My mother usually goes to bed at 10:00, she has finished with us until 1:30 to finish it! We were riveted! I like the way the movie starts at the Melanie funeral, where Scarlett left and said, "I'll think about it tomorrow." Scarlett won't stay in Georgia for long, running to Charleston and trying to get him back. Rhett is not happy to find Scarlett in his house, so he leaves for the family plantation. Scarlett, being Scarlett, follows him, and they finally agree to postpone their quarrels for some time in order to keep the gossip at bay. Rhett starts enjoying his company again and takes it to the ship. A storm appears and sinks. It helps her swim to the shore of an island. Scared to die she is nervous to wake up. When they do, they both get tangled up and love each other. Scarlett wakes up back in Charleston the next day, but Rhett leaves and says he thinks it's best if he never sees. In this case, Anne Hampton is seen going up to the hotel room alone with Ashley. Nothing happens, but her reputation is colored, so Scarlett goes to Savannah with her two aunts. She soon finds out she is pregnant and decides to wait for the right time to tell Rhett. While in Savannah he meets with many of his relatives O'Hara and grows as one cousin, especially Father Colum. Soon she would receive her divorce announcement from Rhett and then decide not to tell him about her child to leave him. Typical Scarlett. She decided to go to Ireland to make sure that Rhett could never discover her condition. She meets many other relatives and buys a beautiful home to Ballyhara's ancestors. This time Rhett worships Anne. It's on Halloween when Scarlett gets the announcement that Rhett got married again, goes to work at night. The film jumps a year later and Scarlett is very happy with her beautiful daughter Kat. He is persecuted by Lord Richard Fenton, who is a truly evil man and forces a young girl named Mary Boyle to sleep with him. Scarlett meets Rhett and Anna again at the horse fair. After a riding accident Scarlett has an interview with Anne and learns that she and Rhett have a baby. Scarlett leaves again and leaves with Fenton to Dublin. There he cultivates the relationship with him, as I said, doing stupid things when the heart is broken. Mary Boyle found out she was pregnant and went to Colum for help. The priest urges Fenton to help the girl, and Fenton murdered him after Colum threatened to tell Scarlett. Fenton convinces Scarlett to go with him to London to escape her grief at Colum's death. Mary asks her to go with her. Back in Charleston, Anne died of Yellow Fever. It is clear that Rhett never bored a child. Scarlett sees Fenton's true colors in London after hurting her when he's not in the mood. Fenton rapes her after telling him he never wants to see him again. He falls unconscious and when he wakes up, Fenton was stabbed to death. Scarlett is charged with his murder. Rhett hears about it and rushes to England with Sally in tow. Scarlett is afraid of the gallows, has no choice but to tell Rhett about their daughter. Rhett is angry at her for keeping such a secret, but she will help her. Mary Boyle, the real killer, can't be found. Scarlett is found guilty, but Mary finally comes to declare her innocence. After Scarlett promised to help Mary, Scarlett leaves Rhett to Ireland because, as he says, "It's time for me to meet my daughter." The scene where Kat sees for the first time is absolutely beautiful. In Ireland, Rhett sees how much Scarlett has changed, and both have finally completely reconciled themselves and admitted they still love each other deeply. After seeing GWTW, I will say yes, Vivian Leigh was better Scarlett, but I liked the character of Scarlett in this movie than in the first one. The reason is that at GWTW you don't know why you like Scarlett. She's so cruel to Rhett and haughty and spoiled, but she likes her lively spirit. At Scarlett you see how much she has changed. She's still in the lap of luxury, but she's no longer proud. You see Kat becoming a true mother and a generous person to the poor people of Ireland. Joanne Whalley is doing a great job playing this new side of Scarlett. Timothy Dalton is not Clark Gable, but sometimes you swear that you can see the original Rhett in it. If you just sit down and don't compare Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton with Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable, you're sure to enjoy this movie. It's a chance to compare Scarlett yesterday, the one that happens after "tomorrow".
