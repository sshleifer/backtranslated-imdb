When I was a kid, I loved "Tiny Toons". I especially loved "Tiny Toons: How I spent my summer vacation". I thought it was a laugh on the floor. A few years later my friend made a video for me. And I thought I'd watch it in good old days. I was still on the floor and laughing. My opinion, Plucky and Hampton Skit is the best. They decide to go to "Earth of the Happy World". And they end up with a crazy adventure to get there. All the parodies are funny. Still looking for a video. So, if anyone has any tips. Please write me. This is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
