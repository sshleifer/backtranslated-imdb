with that we carry the same dark weaknesses that we all unfortunately have: lying, deceit, laziness, the list goes on. However, as an American, I was shocked to see that corruption and racism existed in today's police force, as reflected in the horrible detective and police in the Sheriff's District, the police are working with the murder of a white female tourist and a 15-year-old black accused. I shook my head in shame that the detectives were protected from their disgraceful work, while the young man LIFE hung in a crooked balance of justice. However, there is also a story of hope with our judicial system, and how badly paid ombudsmen got stuck in their weapons (irony intended) and forced the truth from the detectives. I wanted to fly down to Florida and tell anyone who has a big Ombudsman team in Duval County; these lawyers take care of the "little" man, and most importantly, the justice. Another story is about faith and family. He praises the defendant's family and their strong Christian faith and wonderful family values. I hope they win the trial against the sheriff's department of Duval County. <br /> <br /> Bravo for Justice !!! Bravo for a little guy !!!
