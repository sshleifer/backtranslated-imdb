Okay, so there are always people who seem to be a place that doesn't like movies because they're good, but instead they choose movies based on how depressing or boring they can be, or whether they're from a foreign country. . All that is out is one crazy summer a perfect example of what a big American teen comedy should be. Jokes are a good combination of slapstick (a la Bobcat Goldthwait), surrealist (Bobcat under Steve Holland's inspired direction), and dry (John Cusack, one of the most morosely dry and witty actors in the American cinema), and there's no sign in this movie, who doesn't deliver at least one fun line (ok, except Demi Moore). Yes, it's immature, yes, it's a screwdriver, yes, Bobcat dresses up like Godzilla and scraps the scale model of a seafood restaurant. It's also funny. Bach.
