Watch it with an open mind, it's very different, there's nothing wrong with it. A very well-executed realistic story of Tarzan. Chimpazees animatronics are well done for '84, Christopher Lambert was brilliant to mimic the chimpazee language and behavior. I wouldn't be surprised if he learned from Jane Goodall.
