This film worked on two goals: to create a political point and to tell a terrifying adventure story. It is often difficult to make a political point and keep telling a good story (consider the very political, but rarely entertaining, final season of Ellen). Behind Rangoon he finds a good balance between politics and narration. I already knew that Aung San Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 and knew something about the oppressive political situation in Burma, so the film's political message was primarily a dramatization of what I already knew. But I thought the movie did a good job of telling about Aung San Suu Kyi and mostly without the face dictators who had been trying to silence her for years. A device that presents an unknown environment through the eyes of a person with whom viewers can identify is quite common, but in this film it is quite well done. Of course, the real measure of the film was its fun values. Arquette was excellent as a young woman whose sister took her to a distant, unknown place to pull her out of depression over the violent deaths of her husband and son. It is convincingly separated and depressing. Her sad conditions give her a clear reason for her diffuse wandering into a thick, dangerous situation she doesn't understand, something that would otherwise be too intelligent to hit. Obviously, through them he can see through the cloud the grief, being trapped, without escape. This leads her to the adventure path where she needs her intelligence to survive. Writers deserve great credit for making her smart and resourceful enough to deal with many dangerous situations, while still finding an acceptable reason to be foolish to get in trouble. The direction is also strong, keeping tension throughout the race to escape the forces of dictatorship. This film had another impact on me and my wife for other events in the same time period. We were preparing for a trip to India and we heard news of Western tourists who were captives of a terrorist group in India. Avoiding isolated terrorists in a peaceful democratic country is quite a different matter than escaping an oppressive dictatorship. However, the film and news shared the element of avoiding danger in an unknown country. This common characteristic gave the film a sense of strength in its own skillful narration. The film illustrates the worst nightmare of an international tourist.
