What are the movies? What are the movies for? Shooting? Kill? NO. They are made for life stories, and that's what this movie does. It represents how life has changed between two ages. Father and son, father needs work and asks son for help. Although there is another generation, there are certain characteristics that include caressing the family. br /> <br /> In my opinion, the main theme is the love of a son to his father and vice versa. The film consisted of only one dialogue, but this dialogue is more than I've always wanted. This film is pure art! Again, after Marfa's Bania, Cristi Puiu brings us another beautiful movie. Great !
