When I just got back from my third review of The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit, I decided to jump on the IMDb and find out what others thought. I noticed that many Brits love it, while those in America just didn't get it. It really doesn't come as a shock, because America doesn't get what it is. Wallace and Gromit are very English. Central European English, in fact, with a hint of idiosyncrasy fit for good action. The film is much like our two heroes; simple and easy. He has a nice and gentle conspiracy to keep the kids from getting lost, but there is enough beef to entertain the adults. There is some light allusion (which seems to have had to offend the Gospel - oh noes, drama!), But for a brief moment there is nothing coarser than the bottom. When people get insulted by plasticine anus, you know that the world is tainted ... One quick note to those (all Americans I have seen) who think Chicken Run is a better movie: Chicken Run was made to go for your sense of humor, and I think it was because of it. The curse of Were Rabbit is funny, English and intelligent. The Thomas Tank Engine was destroyed because he was pleased with the Americans and I am glad that Nick Park did not allow it to become another big British institution. Summary: You Can Keep Your Chicken Running, Your Shreks, Your Madagasga's - Such a kind of raw, crass, grotesque comedy just doesn't compare to the wit and grace that is Wallace and Gromit in the curse of Were-Rabbit. English to the kernel, and long, Wallace and Gromit can stay that way.
