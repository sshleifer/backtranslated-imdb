Very strange, psychedelic, esoteric, (and I said weird? :) experience. But at least on one level - he did exactly what he was supposed to do. It bridged the gap between a stupid, made, Hollywood look at the teen pop idols that were Monkees' television program, and the adult, musically growing and emerging, yet a little silly Monkees of the 1970s and more. The most important line in the movie is Mike Nesmith, "If they think we're plastic now, wait for them to see how we do it." That the Monkees were tired of all the negative comments about their image and their work is a matter of record. They said it again and again in conversations. They needed to do it again, and what better way to de-bunk and lampoon itself the machine that created them. At the same time, they commented on our entire company (news, movies, art, everything) and said, "Hey, why choose us - not all of these things are made in one place or another." These are Orwellian "proly" (Monkees featured persecuted "everyone", even in their deadliest TV series), pulling "Big Brother" pants and kicking him in his well-deserved ass. Beloved Ideas, Loved Music, Loved Effects, Loved Movie! But then, as Peter Tork says in the movie, "But why should I speak because I don't know anything?" :)
