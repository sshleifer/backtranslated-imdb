Beautiful little movie about the introduction of movies to China. It captures the amazement of the first movie viewers as described that they were all over the world, and uses most of the current Lumiere films. I disagree with other people about misbehaving on the British party - I thought it was fine, but the Chinese chief really stole it. Anyway, I found myself with a smile on my face over most of the movie. People who worry about headlines may notice that a lot of the movie is in English (which for some reason is on titles, just like Chinese on DVD).
