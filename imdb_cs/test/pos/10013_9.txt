I saw this film at the Rotterdam International Film Festival 2002. It seemed to be one of the less popular films at the festival, but as it turned out, it was all the more interesting. The story, an actor who, after leaving drug addiction, tries to cope with his environment and surroundings, is based on real facts. In addition, characters playing in the movie are real people who live this experience again, this time for a movie that is partly set as a scenic game. Not only do they all become good actors, Jia Hongsheng's parents are also real-life actors, the methods used to emphasize their relationship with Jia are very effective. Jia Hongsheng is the actor of some Chinese action movies beginning in the late 1980s. You can see him later in big movies like Frozen and Suzhou River. Between these two career paths, Jia becomes addicted to drugs and loses all her efforts to act, or even do anything productive, except for trying a little futile attempt to become a guitar virtuoso. I like the way the writer script decided to emphasize on his behavior after downloading more than horror drugs. We really feel that Jia's pain and struggle is in. At the same time, we hate him for the way he treats people around him. The film draws the viewer into a tiring pattern, dragging along with his parents and a sister trying to take care of him. Since there are personal "conversations" with characters that we consider to be Jia not only through ourselves but also through others. <br /> <br /> The film has a tough feeling, but the Jia Bejing bike scene and party with friends will brighten the tone. This is how bitter humor happens at many events throughout the film. The music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while. This is a movie that may not be easy to appeal to many people, but it is a strong recommendation for those interested in more serious and modern Chinese film.
