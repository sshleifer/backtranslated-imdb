To be honest, it's probably the best version in my book as the Jazz Singer audio version. The 1927 version is a really silent movie despite its build as the first talkie. Danny Thomas is a great comedian and sings very well. He makes Jewish things with feelings. Peggy Lee is great and every movie she has is always fun. Allan Joslyn is not very funny and we could do it without him. One question: because when cantors live in such luxury homes ???
