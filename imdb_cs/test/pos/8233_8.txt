This one is a very solid Randolph Scott Western. He plays Bat Masterson and goes to Liberal, Kansas to clear the city. He becomes good friends with Robert Ryan, who has played a very direct lead role. It was after this that Robert Ryan started playing a much darker role. In fact, in 1947 Randolph Scott made one other film that was not western and never did anything but westerns after it until he retired in 1962. This film has good stimulation and builds on top steadily. I can't say it would give up a conspiracy. Make sure this. 8/10
