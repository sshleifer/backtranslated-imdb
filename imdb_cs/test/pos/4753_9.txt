While both this film and the persecution of autographs have shown that many critics are not respected, they are both above average. Roy Scheider has a great job of his best type; a tough, courageous policeman who works hard to do the job despite table drivers and politicians who should support him rather than defend him. (He played a suburbanized version of the same role as the chief of a tourist town police officer in Jaws. Not nearly as brave, but the same "did work regardless of politics") and gutsy approach. Scared of everything in the water on an old ship with a guy Achab and a nerd to face a huge shark killer, he is not gutsy, then tell me what he is ...). Tony Lo Bianco is good as a surprisingly complicated villain; Most villains actually have a certain depth and complexity. This is one of those films that repeat better with repeated imaging. Overall, it captures the atmosphere of NY City: bold, clumsy, often dangerous, but full of energy. The story is empty, tight and gentle; work is done without foreign elements. It doesn't have to be one of the best times, but it's an extremely good movie. Everyone has an opinion on car chases. Mine is that this is right there with a Mustang vs Dodge Charger chase in Bullitt. The Pontiac Ventura / Chevy Nova was similar to a Mustang as a compact car chassis with improved suspension and a powerful small V8 packed into the engine compartment for the insipid. but with appropriate suspension modes, they made affordable performance cars that could handle both road and track. The ravage of the GM V8 as it unfolds is music for ear enthusiasts. I heard this chase criticized "imitating" Bullitt's chase. The truth is, they are two works by the same master, Bill Hickman, who also choreographed and drove on the French Chase. In addition to driving most of the haunted car scenes, he created a tense, malevolent presence and a good match with Richard Lynch as a pair of cold evil killers. Yes, the pursuer often has mistakes in realism, such as the use of 3 different NY roads to represent the Palisades Parkway, the end of the chase in a crash with 18 wheeled vehicles on the road for passenger cars, and the miraculous timing that allows everyone walkers to escape damage. It's out of it. Let's face it: film car chases are by nature "unreal". In Bullitt, a French connection, and seven Ups, however, Bill Hickman and Phillip D'Antoni created chases far more realistic, and therefore more exciting than flying, rolling, exploding fantasy chases so common in recent movies.
