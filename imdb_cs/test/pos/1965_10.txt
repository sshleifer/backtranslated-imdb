One of the best films released in the 1980s tells the story of a disturbed high school student who murdered his girlfriend, leaves his naked body on the river bank and later treats him. . What is just as bad is their inability to feel anything about anything. live the lives of rebellion and recklessness. This drama will hit hard and it's impossible to forget it. Young cast does a good job - even Keanu Reeves, in one of her oldest roles, is better than usual. Of course there is no reason for Layne (Crispin Glover) to be as crazy as he is, but that's just Glover himself. Veteran Dennis Hopper has a particularly good role as a loner who, despite his own sordid past, is saddened by the attitude of this group of children. I would like to draw attention to the freezing performance of Daniel Roebuck as a young murderer; He is a low-skilled actor, and besides Hopper, his film is probably the best performance in the film. <br /> <br /> I first saw "River's Edge" when it first appeared on cable TV channels; however, I did not capture it all; For the first time in my history, I saw it for the first time, and now I saw it again for what is probably the definitive time. Some highly influential moments include Madeleine's (Constance Forslund) collapse, when she laments that she might leave her children as much as their worthless father. I also liked the scene where Matt (Reeves) faces his disturbed younger brother (Joshua Miller), and when Burkewaite (Jim Metzler) regrets the fact that the girl has died and that none of his students are involved. . I'll never forget this movie until I live. It's too sad. <br /> <br /> 10/10
