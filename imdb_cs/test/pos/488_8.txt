The real life case of the innocent First Nations Chief (Indian) officer of Winnipeg (Cowboy) is the basis of this television film. The real case caused his fair share of racial tension in Canada, a small thing by Martin Luther King. The inaccuracy of the people of the first nation becomes the foundation of the Canadian diet. What this film is worth attention to is the focus on family responses. The father, played by Gordon Tootoosis, demands forgiveness and brother, played by Eric Schweig, demands justice. The stars Gordon Tootoosis and Adam Beach (WINDTALKERS, SKINWALKERS) have a smaller, almost portrait appearance. Star star Eric Schweig will make a powerful performance in this movie. Honorable Mention goes to veteran actor Gary Chalk, who has recorded more than 100 films in his credit. His depiction of a troubled soul Inspector Dowson was a worthy Gemini Award (Canadian Emmy) along with Eric Schweig. Special effects (jump to jump, succession of dreams) are occasional and not too big. A couple with this beautiful northern Canadian scenery and recent ongoing events involving police officers and people of the first nation, such as the Neil Stonechild case, and you have a very interesting viewing experience.
