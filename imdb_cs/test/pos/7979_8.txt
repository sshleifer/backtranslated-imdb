For a long time it was my favorite movie, Batman. It had the best cinematography and nervous feeling with two wild characters - Catwomen and The Penguin - along with the always-interesting Christopher Walken. However, after the last scan, it eventually slipped into my ratings and frankly, I prefer the last Batman: Batman Begin, with Christian Bale. GOOD - However, it is still the most interesting five recent Batman movies. Stylish cinema here is the best of all Batman movies. Director Tim Burton is renowned for his films, which feature stunning visuals because this is a great example. The three characters above are very different and very interesting, almost fascinating. From the villains, I preferred Catwomen, who changed her before and after the change. Violence is not exaggerated here, as it was in several other Batman stories, but nobody gets bored of it. Michael Keaton, as in the first film, plays a great job with Batman / Bruce Wayne. BAD - For a comic-based movie that mostly reads kids, I still think these first two Batman movies, both made by Burton, were too dark and profanity was definitely not appropriate. Although, unlike the first film, there was no futile use of the name of the Lord, there was still a mess and both rascals made too many sexual notes. That would be okay if the film was not put on the market for children and adults. Danny DeVito's "Penguin" is downright rude in points. I can handle "grotesque" but who wants "rude". Few guys meanwhile complained about beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer playing Catwoman. Too much darkness and some cheap Christian-bashing shots have also led me to reconsider my previous high rating for this film. serials, but too dark, too rough and too many anti-religious prejudices, I finally turned off after half a dozen views of the film. I'm sorry, but I prefer the more kind movie Batman. After all, it's just a cartoon. Most of them disagree, but I was glad that the series was brightened after this series.
