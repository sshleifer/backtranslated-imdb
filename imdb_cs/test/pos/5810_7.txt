Hammer House of Horror: The Witch Time is set in rural England at Woodstock, where the live musician David Winter (Jon Finch) lives with his wife Mary Mary (Prunella Gee) and is currently preparing horror music. One night, looking for his dog, Billy David finds a mysterious woman in her barn called Lucinda Jessop (Patricia Quinn) and claims to be a witch who has been transported for 300 years. Obviously, rather skeptical, David has a hard time believing her, so she locks her in a room in her farm and calls her doctor Charles (Ian McCulloch) to examine her, but as soon as she arrives and enters the room, Lucinda disappears. Charles drinks too much to David, but strange and disturbing things start to appear to David and Mary over the next few days ... <br /> <br /> The Witch Time was episode 1 of the short genre of the British anthology horror series produced by Hammer Studios for TV and originally aired here in the UK during September 1980, the first two Hammer House episode horrors are directed by Don Leaver (episode 13 Mark Satan being different) I actually prefer this. The Hammer House of Horror series dealt with different themes and not all of them, except for the name and, surprisingly, Watching Time is a sinister and effective witch story, Anthony Read's script benefits from its tiny 50 odd minutes and moves at a nice pace. The character is pretty good as well as there is a dialogue, there are some nice scenes here and I liked the way she never fully reveals whether David & Mary are crazy or not. I think it's a well-structured, entertaining and reasonably scary horror thematic TV show that I enjoyed more than I thought. Being Created for British Television meant that the Hammer boys had a lower budget than usual, if it was even possible, there is no wonderful time, as in their most famous films, Frankenstein & Dracula, i when the current English environment gives him a certain atmosphere, with which you can take a little more care. Another limitation on television is that usage levels are lower than you might hope, there is some nudity and gore, but not much, even though I didn't mind much, because the story is pretty good here. It's good for what it is & Hammer's experience on their feature films probably helped to make these look pretty good, acting is good, as well as the popular genre of Ian McCulloch making a bit-part look. Witching Time is a Good Beginning of the Hammer House of Horror Series, as a 50-minute piece of British TV, that's pretty damn good, why aren't they doing shows here anymore?
