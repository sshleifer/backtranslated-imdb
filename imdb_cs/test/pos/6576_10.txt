almost 4 years after the 911 events, if someone asked them what they thought about the day, most people would probably comment on things such as looking at planes that hit the plane and the collapse of two towers. and terrorism mixed, etc. Everyone who was alive at that time will never forget that day. for most of us, though memories are moving, they are not on a personal level. now comes an extraordinary movie that gives everyone who has not lost a friend or family member a chance to engage in a personal level in what we have lost to 911. it is a film to be seen.
