Vincenzo Buonavolunta, a man who has spent several years in a steel plant, as a handyman sold to Italian by Italian owners, comes at the end of a meeting where the purchase is organized, because he wants to tell the new buyer the error he discovered and thinks he has a solution. He doesn't have to admire the Italian old management or the new Chinese owners. He even fights with a translator for the exact term he wants to use in expressing his interest. Another thing we see is that Vincenzo arrives in China trying to contact new owners. To his amazement, someone who is in charge of how Mr. Chong, the man who tried to warn in Italy, was fired. His next task is to get to a woman who was a translator, Liu Hua. He finds himself working in the library, but tells him, in uncertain terms, accuses him of being fired from his position. Liu, who sees Vincenzo's despair, agrees to accompany him to find his steelworks. So Vincenzo and Liu are starting a cruise through some of the bleak landscapes that include traveling by train, steamboat, bus and truck, to distant parts of the giant country. Finding the right factory will prove to be elusive at best, but Vincenzo reveals to him a life that is totally alien to him, as well as finding a kind soul who does not hesitate to help an Italian man, despite his initial resistance to him. . Gianni Amelia's film is a travelogue. Bring the viewer to an unknown territory. Some comments compare Vincenzo with Marco Polo, a great Italian traveler, although the similarities are not entirely tangible. The film keeps our attention in the early stages of the journey, but it becomes somewhat less enjoyable because Vincenzo gets stranded after the separation from Liu. Mr. Amelio is an interesting director who clearly demonstrates with this film, for which he worked on the adaptation of Erman Rea's novel, which we didn't read. Sergio Castellitto is the only reason to watch the movie. This versatile actor brings a lot to the film, which is a way for him in some way, as can be seen in almost every film. The combination of Amelio and Castellitto proved to be a winning combination. Ling Tai, who debuts as Liu Hua, has a few beautiful moments and shows good chemistry with her star. Luca Bigazzi photographed the Chinese landscape in all his bleaknesses. We see that China is not a nice postcard. Mr. Bigazzi captures all the grayness, so typical of the areas where the film is. Franco Piersanti's musical score serves the film well.
