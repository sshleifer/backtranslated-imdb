The young and talented Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar clearly shows us that he is a serious filmmaker. Anyone who doubts it should look at his latest movie "The Sea Inside". It is a film that has been rewarded with a number of awards, not only in Spain, but worldwide, wherever this wonderful movie has been proven. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie, you might want to stop here. Ramon Sampedro is a man who is confined to bed. Being quadriplegic, he depends on the kindness of aliens for everything. From his accident, Ramon thinks only one thing: how to end his life! This is a moral question in the middle of the story, based on Ramon Sampedro's real life. Mr. Amenabar tells the story from Ramon's point of view. There is nothing false or manipulative about him. After all, he relies on the facts that were well known in his country, because this case has become a "cause of celebrations" for the benefit of euthanasia, a subject that no one in this country wanted to deal with in Spain. With his background being a predominantly Roman Catholic country, Spain evolved into one of the most democratic societies in Europe, a distinction that is more notable because of its long years dominated by the dictator. Yet, despite advances in this society, the idea of ​​one's life is something that most of its citizens do not clearly understand, who still regard the matter as something that cannot be done in their country. Ramon Sampedro was a man who loved life. He lived an intense life as a young man when he enrolled himself as a sailor to discover the world. Without money it was the only way to see other countries, to experience other cultures. Ramon's love affair with the sea is something that people in Galicia learn to love from childhood. Imagine that the same friendly sea is what removes Ramon's life as he knew it! In a second, Ramon goes from a living young man to vegetables! Ramon's family is shaken by the experience. All of a sudden he has to leave everything to take care of him at home. His brother and sister-in-law are stoic people who actually deal with the situation. Their lives become something extra, because Ramon's life comes first. They tend to be sick without protesting, or accuse Ramon of the sacrifices they have to make to keep him alive. That's why in their minds Sampedros can't understand Ramon's desire to end it. All. Didn't they give up normal life to take care of him? This moral matter weighs heavily on these uncomplicated and simple people, because in their minds they do what came naturally. The second theme of the film is the legal issue of euthanasia and well-meaning people who suddenly enter Ramon's life in their desire to help him end his suffering. There is Julia, a lawyer who is herself affected and has a rare disease. There is Rosa, a canned fish worker who becomes infatuated by Ramon. Javier Bardem is a great Ramon Sampedro. His transformation is complete. At one point we have no doubt that there is no one else but a crippled man on the bed. Mr. Bardem can only use his face to convey all the emotions trapped in Ramon. Mr. Bardem makes this man real. This is perhaps the best part of his career as Javier Bardem. He overcomes his own award-winning performance as Reynaldo Arenas, a late Cuban poet he displayed in "Before the Night Waterfall". In supporting roles, Belen Rueda, she looks impressive like Julia, a woman fighting her own physical problems. Lola Duenas is also effective as Rosa, a soul mate who loves Ramon deeply. Celso Bugallo, as Ramon's brother shows a man at the crossroads of his own life. Mabel Rivera makes compassionate Manuel, a sister-in-law who never asks anything about life, but tends to Ramon without questioning why she has to do it at all. Mr. Mr. Amenabar also composed a spooky musical score for the film. He is a man who will never cease to surprise. One wonders what his next project will be, but wishes him success in what he might decide in the future.
