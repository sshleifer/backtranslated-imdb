"Idiocracy" is the latest movie from Judge Mike "Office Space", and it is a continuation of a similar theme to this film in fact that it is a stupidity observation and how mediocrity can overcome adversity ... relatively talk. It's a story about Joe Bauer (Luke Wilson), who is literally the most average guy in existence. Joe, and a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph), will become test items for a military project in the hibernation chamber. They were to stay suspended for only one year, but due to lack of supervision, Joe and Rita are forgotten and wake up accidentally for 500 years in the future. Here's the scary part: This film explains, in a very realistic and credible way, how the entire population of 2505 has become completely retarded. Without natural predators, the evolution of the human species does not necessarily favor the fastest, smartest and strongest people to develop genes ... just the people who do the most. Unfortunately, these people become crazy idiots who act like rabbits. This abundant reproduction of stupid people has adversely affected social growth, and now Joe and Rita are the two smartest human beings on the planet's surface. If this helps, imagine the entire population as a hybrid of trenches, athletes, cholos and hoochies. When Joe looks at this terrible dystopia, he learns and tries to watch the time machine to see if they can come back with Rita when they arrive, and that's basically the whole plot. -dimensional I can sound this movie is higher than eyebrows. Nuances are everywhere, and everyone can see flashes (warning signs if you like) of modern daily acts penetrating into everyday life and transforming them into a train wreck on display in "Idiocracies". The film has some really amazing realistic retardation showcases placed on the pedestal. I don't want to give you anything and destroy jokes, but let's say it's pretty thorough. I see some say that it's just a lot of toilet humor, but how it may seem to have its purpose; Show how stupid and cool these people are. This film, unfortunately, is destined to see the same fate as its predecessor, "Office Space"; no one will see it in theaters, but everyone will boast of discovering this amazing / fun movie when it comes to video. My only complaint about the film would be that the flow of the story sometimes breaks, so they can make a Hitchhikers-to-galaxy-type exposition about how things are where they are, but it's a necessary evil and better implemented here . Other than that, good characters, funny jokes, and a better-than-average social commentary wrapped in a funny bow. Final Note: If you can see that our youth becomes a gang-banger want-to-be, it acts like garbage from the ghetto / ghetto and proud of it ... if you are in any case educated and cultivated and you see our country getting out of control into the abyss of stupidity, for God, watch this movie.
