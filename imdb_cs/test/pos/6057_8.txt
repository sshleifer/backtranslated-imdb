I was Marine at Camp Pendleton when D.I. came out (1st Naval Division, 11th Naval Regiment, 3rd Battalion, I-Battery). I still remember standing in line with other Marines to see a movie at "Star" in Oceanside, California. <br /> <br /> We didn't expect the movie to show everything we had in the boot camp, but we were all pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was. The idea of ​​using real Marines in the movie was a great idea (I believe it was all true instructors). As a good actor like Jack Webb, he just couldn't "call cadence" as a real Marine Drill instructor. We all laughed when the "problem" recruitment mother came to camp to talk to the captain. It would never have happened in a million years, but it is Hollywood and we did not allow this episode to let us enjoy the movie. In the summer I went to a camp at MCRD in San Diego during the summer of 1956, and at that time there were virtually no limits on what DI could do for you. The "Ribbon Creek" event on Parris Island has not yet affected the boot camp, at least not MCRD - San Diego. <br /> <br /> I agree with what many other reviewers commented on Sgt. Moore's "stiffness" around his girlfriend. I believe it was only Webb's acting style, and although they could erase this part of the film, it didn't hurt much. One small note, the character (uncredited) "Pvt. Rodriguez" was played by one of my instructors, Sgt. Peter J. O'Neill. Sgt. O'Neill told us that one day he wanted to be an actor. We laughed secretly, but surprised us all. He was a great exercise instructor and I thought he was doing well in his bit part. He also really enjoyed throwing knives. He often showed us that we could do the summer in the training camp. I often wondered if he's still alive.
