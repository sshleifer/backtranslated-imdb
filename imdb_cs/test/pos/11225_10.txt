It is a rare and subtle spectacle, an allegory of death and transformation that is neither preaching nor macaronic. Northfork is a work of mature and courageous insight and avoids arthouse distinguishing by refusing to belong to any kind. Unlike the most memorable and most successful film to bring an apparent comparison, Wim Wenders' 1987 Wings of Desire (Der Himmel Ã¼ber Berlin) maintains ambivalence in a narrative spectrum that extends from secular to supernatural. This story of terrestrial and celestial significant domains in the American West hampers the fairy-tale literature that marked its German predecessor in the ad hoc genre of angels who shed their wings with obedient sentimental attitude. His heavenly transcendence, whether inspired by sad faith or sweaty by a zealous dream, never leads to works of brute and rot. This solid grounding will bring great acclaim for writers and directors Mark and Michael Polish.
