On this day and age, in which almost every other news story includes a discussion of waterboarding, images of Abu Ghraib, or stories of Guantanamo Bay forced prisons, "publishing" Gavin Hood is "like" up-to-the-minute and timely . the movie as is sometimes likely to come out of Hollywood mainstream amusement mills. It is not a segment of imagination, a perfect film, but it does not deserve the kind contempt that it received in the hands of critics from across the ideological and political spectrum. The term "publishing" refers to the CIA's ability to arrest all those suspected of terrorist acts and then secretly divert them to a foreign country to hear and torture them indefinitely, all without the proper process of law. Anwar El-Ibrahimi is an Egyptian man who has been living in the United States for twenty years. On the way she has an American woman, a young son and a new baby. He seems to be a very unlikely terrorist candidate, but one day, without warning or explanation, Anwar is confiscated and taken to an unpublished place where he is subjected to brutal torture until he admits his involvement in a terrorist organization that Anwar says nothing nev√≠. On the negative side, "Rendition" occasionally in its narrative ability, often biting a little more than it can chew in terms of both plot and character. The seeming focal point is Douglas Freeman, a newcomer to the CIA agent, who is led by Egyptian officials to observe Anwar's "interrogation." The problem is, as conceived by the writer Kelley Sane and published by Jake Gyllenhaal, Freeman seems too naive to "angry" Scout Scout agent who should be dedicated to a very trusted agent. as a character. At the beginning we know little about it and it seems to be still at the end. He "goes through the movements," but we rarely learn a little about the man inside. Thus, without a strong focus to keep it all together, the film occasionally feels as if it falls apart in seams, with story elements flying away in all directions. A similar problem occurs with Anwar's agitated wife, played by Reese Witherspoon, a woman we will never know except what we see on the surface. Gyllenhaal and Witherspoon both proved to be great actors in other circumstances, but here they are surrounded by a restrictive scenario that rarely allows them to cross one repetitive note in their performances. <br /> <br /> What does it do? Rendering "ultimately a mighty movie, however, is the extreme gravity of the subject and the way two concurrent lines of conspiracy combine together. It could be for a somewhat more inventive story than we might like on this subject, but hey, this is hollywood and the film has to pay SOME respect for the expectations of the mass audience if it is to get green, let alone see the light of the world as a finished project . Two of the supporting performances are particularly convincing in the film: Omar Metwally, who makes the tangible horror of a man captured in the real life of Kafkaesque a nightmare he can't awaken, and Yigal Naor, who makes the main investigator / torturer surprisingly complex character. Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard also make their mark in smaller roles. Special mention should also be made of Dion Beebe's warm and bohemian cinematography. Probably. Is it a deck deck for the benefit of torture victims and against evil government forces? Definitely. (One wonders how the movie would play if Anwar really was a terrorist). Still, the film has the courage to step on controversial ground. She is not afraid to ask questions or risk disapproval of some of the political attitudes. He is openly thinking about how the nation holds firmly its hard-pressed principle of "civil liberties for all" in the face of terrorism and fear. And how much courage does it take for people of goodwill to finally stand up and say, "Enough is enough", even at the risk that those in power will be very terrorist and insane? (The film does not in any way deny the reality of extreme Islamic terrorism). Therefore, refusing to "release" from hand would allow perfect to be good at enemy. "Rendition" may not be perfect, but it is good and has something important to say about the world in which we now live. And that alone is worth seeing.
