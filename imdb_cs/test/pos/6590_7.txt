So far, Miguel Bardem's career has been one of Spain's worst cinemas. He did nothing but garbage. "Incautos" was quite a surprise: it is a reputable film, with rhythm, with great cast and very fun. The art of robbing, that's what "Incautos" is all about. The film is much like David Mamet's "house of play" and so on. Thousands of twists in the script and a story where nothing like it seems. The weak points of the last Bardem movie may be the so-called American Language, which makes some characters somewhat unnatural (especially Victoria Abril, he's a heck of a actress, but in "incautos" she looks a bit forced). Ernesto Alterio is not so bad, but he is not half as good an actor as his father ... And what about Luppi? Well, it's MAN. In short: a good movie. The best Miguel Bardem ever did. I hope this is the start of a whole new stage in his career. <br /> <br /> * My measure: 7/10
