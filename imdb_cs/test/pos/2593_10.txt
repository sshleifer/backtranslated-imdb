In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is out of the hunt and Daffy is trying to get him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, the bugs have their own program. In addition, "Rabbit Spice" makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it could just cheerfully and royally spoil your speech). I think probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by Bugs and Daffy. One of them looks like it was risqu√© for 1952 (especially in cartoons), but they do it perfectly, as they always did. All in all, it's just to show what the geniuses were behind the cartoons.
