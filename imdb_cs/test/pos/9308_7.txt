It was a fascinating story waiting for an interview. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY takes us into the trials and tribulations of a group of top American scientists who have given a noble task during World War II: they have beaten everyone else on an atomic bomb. Brain brains, which are under the influence of a heavily guarded new Mexican blend, are slowly transforming the idea from an ambitious concept to a huge reality. <br /> <br /> HOT MAN AND LITTLE BOY is one of those movies that need your attention. It is a film of true human thinking, not only from the scientific point of view of the development of seemingly impossible weapons, but also from the moral consequences contributing to massive killing. Characters are constantly torn between this reality and war duty as Americans. The film is never preaching about it, but it leaves us free to admire the immensity of the inner confusion these men face. The performance also deserves special attention. Paul Newman adds one of his great, undervalued performances like General Pattonesque, who is in charge of delivering a top-notch for Allied forces. <br /> <br /> Where FAT MAN and LITTLE BOY lose much of the traction, it's a useless romantic ingredient. As a scientific team leader, Dwight Schultz struggles with his family affection and his tireless obsession with his big project. Director Roland Joffe seems to have felt the need to explore the more human angles of this story, but romantic undertones serve primarily as a distraction. In addition, it is the interaction between scientists and their military hierarchy that gives us the greatest insight into the thoughts and feelings of these brilliant men. Yet it is difficult to recommend FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY. It is a very forgotten gem that puts the human face on one of the most interesting stories in human history.
