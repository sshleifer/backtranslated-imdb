Okay, so I'm crazy for a good documentary, especially where he tells the modern story of Don Quixote. Warning: I met Mark Borchardt in the winter of 1995/96 while he was still working at Coven. But I'll save the story later. The American film, which began production long after, accurately captures the person I knew, though at a greater depth than I expected or believed to have existed. This is also a very funny and very sad movie and is brilliantly executed. Mark comes as his own worse enemy: his childish ambition and optimism - which I admire - is undermined by his apparent artistic incompetence, as well as his bizarre fiscal expectations. But he's also a charismatic guy. His loyal Sancho Panza sidekick is as sympathetic: loyal to the core if it is lit. Like Don Quixote, American film is often a neglected ineffective aspect of freedom - people will be attracted to professions they are not particularly suited to, regardless of repeated failure. It's a great movie.
