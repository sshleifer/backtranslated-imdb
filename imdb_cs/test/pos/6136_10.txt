I've been looking for this mini-series for a long time. I saw this film when I lived in Russia many years ago. I wonder if anyone who has a recorded copy of this movie can send me a copy. I am willing to cover all costs and pay for additional tapes or DVDs. This is one of the best TV series I've ever watched. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the history of Israel and world history after World War II. I'm also trying to find a book (I heard it's even better than a movie), but the new prize costs about $ 50 on Amazon and I've never used a used copy. my email address is yurets777@hotmail.com Thank you for your help.
