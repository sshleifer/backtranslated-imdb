This film is excellent. Not because it does something special or new, but because it is always big in all its parts. No part excels as "breakthrough" or "stellar", but all parts are far above average and that's an excellent movie for me. <br /> <br /> I own a few copies of this movie, and can buy it on collectible DVDs or Blu-Ray, one day (right now because of high blu-ray prices, and of course a face that doesn't have a blu-ray player). .. but this is next to the point of this review). The stars are based on some ordinary, but they quickly turn into a drama filled with tension, some action, heavily portrayed characters, and a well-designed storyline that interests you until Wait, no, it doesn't usually start. <br /> <br /> Qun is starting. Tar. the film wants to be. With an amazing scene when it comes to trying to buy coffee and donuts ... very, very badly. At the end of the movie, there was nothing like that, and a few people are dead, and a few people are very rich. I won't tell you who ... watch and enjoy! Overall rating: 10/10, A **, Excellent!
