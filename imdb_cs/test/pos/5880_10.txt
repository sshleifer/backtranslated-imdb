When I saw "The Best Years of Our Lives", I was blown away. The director, actor, screenwriter and director William Wyler (winner of the best director in 1946) is brilliant. This film is about three World War II veterans who returned home from the war and met their loved ones, but had to deal with the difficulties coming home from the war. The first man Al Stephenson (played by Fredric March in his Oscar role) comes home to find his wife Millie (played by Myrna Loy). ) and the children of Peggy and Rob (played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall) are grown up and different from before leaving for war. The second man Fred Derry (played by Dana Andrews) has to find a good job and return home to the woman he married only 20 days before going to war. He starts to find out he's not the same. Homer Parish (played by Harold Russell in his Oscar role) has lost his hands in the war and has to deal with Wilma's family and fianc√© (played by Cathy O'Donnell) on the hooks he has instead of his hands. All these men and their families meet in different scenes in the film. The stories of these men are beautifully interwoven together. This film really defines the meaning of "classic". This unforgettable drama (winner of best shot in 1946) is a movie that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> If I was asked to choose a favorite movie, it would be! <br /> <br /> Out of 10 I would like to give "the best years of our lives" 10. 10. <br /> <br /> So the next time you go to a local video store to rent this movie you won't regret it! NO inappropriate material good family movie.
