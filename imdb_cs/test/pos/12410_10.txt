My wife and I loved the movie. Smart dialogue, great characters, smart building. Stimulation in this film is continuous. I couldn't even get to the kitchen for some munies. We've never seen Corey Feldman funny. Taylor Nichols plays a good FED ... my wife loves him on the show "Married Man" HBO. The cast of the file was strong. The turn at the end encouraged us. That's why we're giving this movie to "Standing O."
