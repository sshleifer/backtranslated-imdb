I think Mario Van Peebles Posse is a very important film. It is an excellent entry point of the film to the side of history that many do not know. This is the story of early black settlers, cow boys and infantrymen returning from the Spanish-American war with the golden vault. The main character of Peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father. The racism applied to the new black settlers and pawns is explored in this film with an excellent casting including Melvin Van Peebles (Father Marios), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin, and Big Daddy Kane's wonderful performance. One feels that Peeples tried to use as many remarkable blacks (and some not so remarkable - actors) as possible :) Perhaps too many, some prominent figures (Issac Hayes, Pamela Grier ) are just scenes in portrait, others briefly such as Tone Loc. The mood and the pursuit of Peebles' efforts to uncover these actors will be understood by some. The great cast (performance for each director) works well and does a good job of telling the story in the classic "revenge and fight against justice" of the West. Most notable was the amazing narrative role of veteran actor Woody Strode (from Once Upon a Time in the West), who was a life barrier barrier, faded from memory in the context of a previous era that was not yet completed. No other actor could do this better. Read the mini-bio on Woody Strode here as a primer: http://imdb.com/name/nm0834754/bio <br /> <br /> The film does a good job of balancing the action with a bit of sardonic humor. The dialogue was excellent if it was a bit contemporary! And as others mentioned, this period was not accurate. The sex scene was a little more - in fact, not needed. There are some historical inaccuracies such as the apparent electronic branding of cattle etc. But Posse is a good effort to hopefully open the door for more historical and creative work reflecting other unconventional stories and events. Real photos of real cowboys at the end of the credits were very nice.
