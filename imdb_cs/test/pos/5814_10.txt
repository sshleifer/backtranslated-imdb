I would recommend it to anyone who is an admirer of the late John Cassavets. And for those who never knew about Cassavetes. It's an excellent movie. I really don't have time to go into details about why this is my opinion, but if you are looking for something gutsy, with lots of scenes that could start, then this is for you. Cinematography is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the film and the story itself. This "review" doesn't make movie justice. It is an experience one has to see for himself. LOTY CHARACTER. VERY GENUINE.
