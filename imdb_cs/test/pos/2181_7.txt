This remake of the inexpensive amazing finale of the five stars suffers from a terrible act. Humphrey Bogart plays the role of manager of a sleazoid radio station that is desperate to support downward ratings. The owner decides that a number of moral games will be written about the famous murder case 20 years ago. So they hired a fake preacher (Harry Hayden) to track down a liberated killer and live quietly under a false name. The preacher comes to the day of the daughter's wedding, but a ruthless radio station refuses to withdraw from exposing the mother and destroying their lives. Bogart is always good. Hayden is a good slimy preacher and Henry O'Neill is a good father. All the others are just terrible. Helen McKeller doesn't win any sympathy (crucial for the role), Linda Perry is a lousy actress, Beverly Roberts is fine, but always looks old, Claire Dodd and Hobart Cavanagh have no parts, Carlyle Moore is a hero as a friend, Virginia Brissac's Robert Middlemas surpass as a station owner, which is a bad performance as a station owner. This one is coming in an hour, but it is a pale copy of the original, which boasted the dynamic performances of Edward G. Robinson, Aline MacMahon, Frances Starr and Boris Karloff. But it's always worth seeing Boagrt.
