I have made many international trips, both on business and as a tourist. For both types, I assure you that the best advice is also the oldest: Always drink country wine. In this film, Michael the Archangel comes to Earth on the store, quickly packs it and decides to hang on a small tour. Boy! "He drinks wine from this land." Could one be drunk forever with alcohol, love and duel? nights. These are things you can't do in heaven, so they enjoy them when they're here! Of course, it turned out that he had a few other tasks to deal with, and if he was less direct about them than he was the first, he was just as successful. The last scene is a bit schmaltzy, but it's also amazing. Jean Stapleton dances with John Travolta.
