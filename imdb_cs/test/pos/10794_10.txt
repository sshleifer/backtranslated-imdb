"Talk Radio" is my favorite movie by Oliver Stone, though he made many great ones including "Salvador", "JFK", "Natural Born Killers" and "Platoon". But I like the intimacy of "Talk Radio", a movie expansion by Eric Bogosian's podium play, which was based on a real life Dallas talk show host account. In collaboration with cinematographer ace Robert Richardson, Stone turns to what might be a very limited exercise to a visually arresting ideological battle that represents a radio station as a war arena. Bogosian is devastating as the tortured on-air spoiler abuse Barry Champlain and passes the conflicting, destructive nature of his character with conviction and generous benefits of self-resistance. Alec Baldwin, as his head of the Alpha team, will hit the perfect note as a man driven by a guy whose monstrosity has helped raise. Ellen Greene is fantastic as Barry's sweet ex-wife, who is the next target of his evil personal vitriol. Stone and Bogosian fill each frame with interest and every line of dialogue with sweet poison and ambiguity of cutting. John C. McGinley, as well as Barry's longtime screener / technical producer Stu, turns into a hilarious, crisp performance as well as the great Michael Wincott. The film is a flawless, underrated masterpiece of outstanding writing, amazing acting and brutal, uncompromising direction. Stewart Copeland's score is also brilliant.
