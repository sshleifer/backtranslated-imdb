It doesn't matter if the "National Velvet (1944)" is a bit shabby and sometimes unconvincing, Clarence Brown's equestrian paradise is a cute and very sympathetic story with good morale. Having achieved a modest success through her appearance in "Lassie Come Home (1943)," young Elizabeth Taylor, 12, landed on her first leading position as Velvet Brown, a passionate horse-drawn schoolgirl. Although the film was shot in California, the story - adapted to Enid Bagnold - takes place in a small town in the English countryside and Technicolor's photographs are fully used to present the lively and pretty landscape of blue sky and green bushes. Mickey Rooney takes top billing like Mi Taylor, misleading an ex-jockey with erratic intentions, whose relationship with young Velvet revives his sense of dignity and opens up a new, optimistic chapter in his life. Although apparently struggling in one sequence when he has to confess to the traumatic experience that led to his fear of horses, Rooney is pleasing as a passionate but passionate young man who has to prove his worth. It may be a good thing that Elizabeth Taylor had those fascinating purple eyes because her acting skills were rather limited at this young age. Its more emotional succession, in which it shows courage and integrity in the face of adversity, strikes one that is rather hollow, and the touchingly naive idea that it simply "believes" will accomplish everything is what has been practically repeated since then ad nausea virtually every unforgettable inspiring sports film ever made. However, Taylor is bright and enthusiastic, and works well with Mickey Rooney, who was not an alien to be a baby star. Anne Revere plays a very important role as Velveta's mother, once a famous sportsman who not only sailed the English Channel, but was lovingly trained by anyone but Mi Taylor's own father. I liked that he didn't tell me about it until the last seconds of the movie, and Mrs. Brown rightly decided that the young man would first have to develop his own sense of decency rather than use his late father's memories of financial gain, no doubt he would do it on the beginning of the film. The film reaches its peak at the Grand National Sweepstakes, where Velvet decided at the last moment to go on his own horse, Pi, in the world-famous competition. Under the veil of a Latvian man, the race continues, as expected, but is later disqualified - either because she is a girl or because she has fallen from a horse before she was allowed to dismount (which is a silly rule!). This widespread race sequence is extremely well executed, effectively capturing the nervous tension of those nerve racks that precede races, and the confusion of an event that puts us in the same position as Rooney's character, stuck to high audiences and anxiously waiting. someone who provides an accurate update. It doesn't matter that it is a sensational double that makes most of the difficult ride - we can clearly see a scary-looking man in a wig in several scenes - but the positive message remains the same. I bet 'National Velvet' has brought up the ideas of millions of young girls over the past sixty years, and its power to inspire has diminished over time.
