This is basically a goofball comedy, with somewhat extra stimulation due to some dramatic elements. For Michael J. Fox and Paul Reubens, it was their first film (Fox was previously in a short TV series and television movie). Given that the film is basically a race / hunter-type hunter movie, like "Cannonball Run", "It's a Mad Mad Mad World", or more recently "Rat Race", aren't there no main characters. Instead, there are groups of characters that divide screen time and allow lots of mini-charts. Usually, these kinds of films are a way to mimic the maximum number of stars (or post-beds) on a film. This one has teams, one of which is the primary team Fox belongs to, the only characters to be developed. Their plot is rather a stereotypical Disney affair that a college boy does not pay attention to his younger brother, who he thinks is a lazy punk. Because they are forced to work together with their older brother's girlfriend, they are forced to work together. Because it is the main plot, it gets the most time on the screen. Some of the other stupid graphs stand out. The blue team is about an obese, rich child whose dad wants him and his friends to get out of the house. They end up with a cool custom van that had a onboard computer (in 1980!) To instantly solve puzzles, plus play video games with time saved! One member, Stephen Furst, went on to play Dr. Axelrod on "St. Elsewhere ", and later was on" Babylon 5 ". I also admit that he was still laughing when Barf came up with an attempt to decode a'la Scrabble, "Fagabefe?" This is much more fun than Bart Simpson's "Qwyjibo", in my opinion. The other three teams have land that is somewhat connected. The green team is a bunch of frat boys, mostly beer jokes that culminate in the collapse of one when hunting leads to the Pabst Blue Ribbon Brewery. They get a chance to bother the red team with two feminists and two fun twins. The white nerds team is headed by Eddie Deezen, who was previously in "Grease" but continued to play a critical computer geek role in "Wargames" and later Tim Conway sidekick in some "Dorf" series. <br /> <br /> If you grew up in the 1980s, there are some classic moments that bring memories. The first video arcade, from the back, when they were cool, is always in my mind. Look at Paul Reubens and his Thursdays. There is also a miniature golf course and a disco disco. The film is actually a family movie just because vulgar is almost non-existent, and a small amount of sexual humor is completely innocent. Strange stimulation due to the raw yellow moments of the yellow team will give parents to sleep while their children giggle on the huge melons at Fat Burger (oh, do they have a special melon plate? Must it be, right?)
