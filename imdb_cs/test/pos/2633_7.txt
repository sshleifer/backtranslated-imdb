For some reason, some shows just fail ... some deserved, some not ... Buddy Faro was a clever series with interesting characters and dark humor that was nice to watch ... Maybe it was never intended as a big hit, but it had "weirdness" about enjoying it ... that it seems that I was the only one to watch .... Dennis Farina and Frank Whaley were perfectly trapped in their roles ... production quality and writing was great and Vegas was the perfect backdrop ... hopefully the first and only season will be released on DVD because I think they deserve some notoriety ... maybe at least you make it on TV Land ... cheers
