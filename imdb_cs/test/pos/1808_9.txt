Valley Girl is a definitive film from the 1980s with phrases captured in this beautifully-feature film. The characters are so convincing that you forget that it's a movie and not a video of a real "day in life" of any US high school. This film is up to the 1980s, which is the Brady Bunch television series until the 1970s. If you don't like it, then "Gag me a spoon."
