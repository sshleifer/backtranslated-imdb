Amazing movie, I just saw it and I want to see it again. I've never heard of Derek Jarman before I saw the movie, but now I'm, I can't wait to see his other guys. The film has a whole new perspective on Shakespeare's The Tempest, I am sure it would appreciate Jarman's use of the game themes of love, magic, darkness and atmospheric tension. Well, OK, there may be a bit of nudity in the movie that I didn't really anticipate, but it offended me, it just surprised me and the movie was unpredictable. One Spoiler (for those who have a nervous disposition: A flash scene with a flashback with Sycorax and Caliban and Ariel as their slave, her pretty graphics. All in all, if you start to find Kenneth Branagh in Shakespeare's flaccid and monotonous performances, you have to see the movie unreal, throws you away, but only if you let it have an open mind - and then let this film spell on you.
