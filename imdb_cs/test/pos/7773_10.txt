This is a must for all but especially for African Americans. It's time to have a film that expresses concern about African American relations. It also allows other cultures to see in a fictional humorous way how positive African American relationships are and the results are instead of an undesirable stereotype that plagues the African American community. I love this movie has to be seen!
