The main reason for watching this picture is to enjoy the great performance of S. Ephaty Merkerson. Mrs. Merkerson dominates this film with her enormous presence as a nanny, a woman who believes in doing good, no matter who, without any strings. This actress clearly shows a series that is amazing. We thank director George Wolf for bringing this outstanding performance of some of the best Black Americans actors together. This file group, under its fixed direction, helps create the right atmosphere in which the action takes place. Of course, none of this would be possible if Ruben Santiago Hudson did not write his amazing game. In collaboration with Mr. Wolf, perhaps the best theater director of this generation, they have opened the game by evoking the fact that it is not a very distant past when a child lives under the influence of Mrs. Crosby when his parents are not around. take care of him. Mrs. Crosby becomes the adoring mother of little Ruben; in a way, it represents its reward for losing its own daughter. Unfortunately, there is no time to develop some characters because the action focuses only on strengthening the relationship between the nanny and the young. Ruben, played with such a magic young Marcus Carl Franklin, who is natural. The only thing that could be done differently was the voice over the narration, which is sometimes intrusive because it does not explain or justify what one sees. Frankly speaking, just by watching players interact, it is self-explanatory. <br /> <br /> Music is always in the background. No matter what time these people go through, Nanny's house is full of laughter and the famous music that brings us back to that time. In addition to Miss Merkerson, other remarkable performances include Terrence Dashon Howard, one of the rising stars of the moment. Mos Def, Jeffrey Wright, Marcy Gray, Louis Gossett Jr., Delroy Lindo, Rosie Perez, Carmen Ejogo, Jimmy Smits and others. Mrs. S. Ephata Merkerson deserves to be seen by a wider audience. In "Lackawanna Blues", he clearly shows that he can do anything he wants because of her huge talent and charisma.
