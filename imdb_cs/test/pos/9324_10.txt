For those who are too young to remember or too old to be part of the "humbug", Michael Jackson's shot in the early 1980s was in a fever - like the Titanic hype, except that it just didn't relax. Every song, every video, every word spoken by Michael was important. Nothing like that has been seen since the Beatles flourished. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this video for the first time, on the ice rink. Everyone stopped skating. There was no doubt whether you were a Michael Jackson fan or not; You have been. Everyone was driving around the screen and watching the video ... <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the longest music videos ever made and certainly the best. Permanently gets # 2 on the annual MTV 100 best videos (# 1 is always a taste-of-the-month, and somehow what was # 1 of all the time slips around # 2 to make way for the new # 1. Thriller has become a phenomenon in itself. <br /> <br /> If you ever get a chance, you need to watch the video; not just excerpts shown on MTV or VH1. If necessary, you should search Thriller in a video store. Hey ... your parents probably watched you the Beatles and Woodstock because "that was important" ... well, that's also important.
