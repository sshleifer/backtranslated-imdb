This film is a sought-after member of my film library. Although it is not a mainstream film, it is in my opinion a highly effective film noir, in which Eric Roberts is totally underestimated as an actor. (I would consider him a much better actor than his sister, Julia, who is overrated, but that's another review ...) Roberts plays a former reporter who has a great mix of narrative accuracy and tired. idealism: two components that are an integral part of any effective noir movie. Roberts' first person narration increases the quality of the film and keeps us guessing about the real crime motive. <br /> <br /> Set in Palm Springs, everything about setting up in the movie is progressing slowly as a metaphor for the subject of oppression: Asch (Roberts) is oppressed by his past; the police are oppressed by the wealthy Palm Springs residents who treat them as servants; the rich are meanwhile oppressed by boredom (watch the classic performance of Johnny Depp as a remarkable rich boy who wants to be loved ...); the isolation of each character is ubiquitous and is further expanded by the heat and isolation of the desert. There is an audience for this film if they are looking for a more contemporary version of the film noir. While there are elements of film that might be tighter, I suggest you make a copy of this movie and place it right between The Big Sleep and Chinatown in your movie library. (The film is based on Arthur Lyons 'book, CASTLES BURNING, and if you like Roberts' acting performance, you can get a copy of the Ambulance showing your fun, lighter side.) Only fools ignore the strange warning of women in the outboard park.
