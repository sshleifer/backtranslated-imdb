During the first 30 seconds of this movie, you'll be able to see if you want to watch it. The film opens images of airplanes landing at the airport, one plane after another diving on the runway full of mirage. You will be able to accurately estimate that this film is not about a "story". It is even easy to imagine for the first time that the opening images are repetitive shots in the same plane. The initial drama is in the sharpness of your perception that is based on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images. If you want to see a movie after this opening, you won't be bored. You may even be fascinated. Film can be an emotional experience; it may be an intellectual experience; it may be both. Judging from the DVD's commentary, which was necessary, Herzog was, above all, an emotional experience, and at one point he expressly expresses himself on how the film is a collaboration between the filmmaker and the viewer. There is plenty of room for the viewer to do exactly what he wants to do from this film. Take your gambling?
