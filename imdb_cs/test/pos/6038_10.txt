This is another of my favorite Columbos. It sports top cast, including John Cassavetes, who was never handsomer or sexyier, Anjanette Comer, Myrna Loy, and Blythe Danner. Here's something I've always been interested in - Gwenyth Paltrow was born when the episode was shot, or was Danner pregnant then? Thanks to IMDb I have an answer - she was five months pregnant. Now I can really feel ancient. Cassavetes plays a great conductor whose marriage to Danner has obviously taken advantage of his mother's social relationships (Loy). On the side of Ms. Anjanette Comer, a prominent pianist, but announces that she wants more. She's sick of being back on the street. She gets rid of her at night from the concert and looks like suicide. Columbo immediately captures several problems. One thing he notices: "You have a beautiful woman - eyes in the bedroom - has money, body and career. It's amazing to see Falk and a good friend of Cassavetes together. There's a very funny veterinarian episode with Columbo's Bassett. Everyone in the cast is great. This is one of the episodes that made Columbo a classic series.
