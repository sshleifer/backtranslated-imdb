CHRISTMAS IN AUGUST is the perfect movie. Flawless film about all human shortcomings. Outside it might look like a movie about death, but in fact it's a film about life. I just can't recommend this movie enough. And don't worry, dear readers, it's not a depressing film. As already mentioned, it is a movie about the brightness of life trained under the guise of death. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You realize that life is fragile and short. You are viewing with a better understanding of how precious life is. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (see www.nixflix.com for more details)
