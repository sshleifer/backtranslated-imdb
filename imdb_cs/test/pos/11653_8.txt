This is the most human and humane movie I've ever seen. Irony abound, Susan Sarandon as a nun, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon in a film that does not preach, but does not condemn it. It's the best of the cinema, and yet the story is fictional from several real events. <br /> <br /> Which one is more amazing, Sarandon or Penn? It's easy to say who's more sympathetic, but it's hard to tell who's more convincing. they are simply magnificent. You may think that all murderers should be killed, or you can claim that life without release is not life and that death is more merciful. Whatever your personal feeling, this movie gives you the chance to pause and reconsider. In the end one just wants to sit in silence and think. This is what makes a great drama, gives catharsis, creates a moment in time, a common memory that touches our humanity.
