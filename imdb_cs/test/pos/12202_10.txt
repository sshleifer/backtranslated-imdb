I thought it was a very good TV series and I'd like to see it go on. In the end it's really interesting and I really want to see where it goes from here. Sometimes we have to kill a series quickly without giving it a chance. I think this needs a chance to go on, and I'm sure I'll wait for it. The ocean is one of the places you know so little about, and I think it's a secret in itself. What awaits us under the waters of the world. It is even said that many millennia ago a man got out of the water or spilled out of it. Is this a new development? Are we going to go down the food chain or fight for our position?
