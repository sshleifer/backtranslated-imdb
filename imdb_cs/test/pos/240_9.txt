In Brooklyn, dance dancer Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) in a nightclub has a simple but happy life dance in McGuire, owned by her friend Danny (Gene Kelly). Rusty, Danny and Genius (Phil Silvers) have a ritual on Friday night: they order oysters in a bar and try to find a pearl. Rusty's life changes as he participates and wins a competition that will be the cover page of Vanity magazine. She is invited to work in a huge Broadway theater whose owner proposes her. He loses his luck and starts drinking in his new lifestyle, missing the love of Danny and her old friends. 'Cover Girl' is a wonderful romantic comedy, very naive and with wonderful works such as beauty and talented dance by Rita Hayworth, singing and acting; Gene Kelly, especially in two scenes, is dancing with herself and with Rusty and Genius on the street; the songs and choreography of the dance are also spectacular. Danny, the character of Gene Kelly, is almost shocked by his chauvinistic behavior. Rita Hayworth surprised me with her talent: I found her in Gilda amazing, but she is stunning in 'Cover Girl'. In keeping with the information on the cover of VHS, 'Cover Girl' was the first musical where songs were part of the plot, giving the story continuity, instead of being 'thrown' in the movie. My sixteen-year-old son saw this film with a friend of the same age at the recent Gene Kelly festival and loved 'Cover Girl', so I dare to say that this classic is recommended to any film lover and not just the old generation. .
