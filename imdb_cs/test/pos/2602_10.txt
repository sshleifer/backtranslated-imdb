This is my favorite Looney Tunes cartoon. It's a joint plot: Daffy Duck tries to convince Elmer Fudd it's really a rabbit season and shoots Bugs. But your rabbit never beats! In addition to the usual cartoon comedy, this cartoon is supported by a great word game that will keep you rolling on the floor.
