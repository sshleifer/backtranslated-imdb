Hilary was great as Julie and Pat was again magnificent as Mr. Miyagi, but there should be more links to the other three movies! I mean, come on! First, where is Daniel!? Miyagi mentions him very briefly, and that's it. Daniel was his best friend and should at least appear in the film. He could have helped Miyagi train Julie-San! On the other hand, the music remained true to the film though, with a little more instrumentation (Fretless Bass) to accompany the wonderfully played Pan-Flute! He doesn't feel like a Karate Kid movie unless you hear Pan-Flute! Thank you Zamfir! Overall, a decent movie! We miss Noriyuki!
