Lucio Fulci was one of the most prolific Italian directors at the time of his death in 1996, but his career has long since descended into a downward spiral of increasingly futile genre inputs that barely stood in the shadow of his earlier work. For much of the 1970s into the mid-80s, he wrapped such stylistically expressive horrors as "The City of the Living Dead," "Outside," and the brutal giallo "The New York Ripper," kindly remembered fans as. My self. And while "Cat in the Brain" falls into a period of Fulci's decline as a filmmaker, it's a shocking, darkly cheerful headtrip that, while clearly inferior in work (framing, effects and gaming), proves an interesting, open meditation on pop psychology and ability numb the film. Don't be mistaken: "Cat in the Brain" is a total gorefest, and just like Fulci's previous films, he deserves credit for trying to be more. Fulci plays alone in a deliciously touched tongue: the director in the midst of filming another fierce horror movie that comes with perverse / killing hallucinations; after visiting the shriveled who puts him under hypnosis, his dreams and reality begin to intersect, to the point where the viewer cannot discern two. A recent DVD from Grindhouse Releasing mentions "Cat" as an heir that is seen as "Eraserhead" and carries a similarly disturbing, awkwardly humorous quality associated with the best Surrealist art.
