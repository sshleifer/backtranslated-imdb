When I was about 10 years old, I first saw Princess Nile. Now I'm 63 and I never forgot about the movie. I didn't even get through Egypt through my fascination. I searched the internet trying to buy a movie but were unable to find it. I wonder if it's one of the lost movies in Hollywood. I loved Debra Padget and Jeffrey Hunter together. They have such a charisma together. If you asked me about the film, I could tell you nothing but the one who was in it. I vaguely remember the Nile scene with Debra Padget a lot of other women. I always wanted to see it again. I never thought of it as an escape film, but now I see where it was probably. I hope they put it on DVD and I'll see it again before I die. It was an amazing movie.
