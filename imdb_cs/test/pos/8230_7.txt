I'm a fan of Randolph Scott Westerns. While some of them are incredibly clich√© (as is the case with most Western years), its easy delivery and style really enhance movies to classic and almost classic status. While this film is one more example of real life, Western heroes are exploited after the death of Hollywood (in this case Bat Masterson), the film works with it as well as excellent support characters. One of them is always the strong work of Robert Ryan - an excellent actor who is unfortunately almost forgotten today. The other is the ubiquitous Gabby Hayes, who has one of his best roles as a crisp and very varied representative. Here is more fun than in his many side roles for Roy Rogers and John Wayne - mostly because his part is better written and has more work to do. The land is quite half Westerns have ever done. There are some baddies who hire a lot of robbers to run roughly through the local and it's up to do-gooder (Scott) to restore peace and kill the bad guys. However, as the plot is done, it is much better than average, making the film a watchful pastime. Don't just expect a lot of innovation or uniqueness - if you don't want to see Gabby Hayes' best performance.
