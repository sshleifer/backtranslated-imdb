All the characters in this cartoon were merry. Norman, the Viking Guardian, had some unforgettable phrases, and a skull master, an evil man, would always promise to kill Max with some mad hoarseness. Writing is best. <br /> <br /> I was stuck to the set when it came when I was younger. If they came out with the DVD of all the episodes they did, I'd be forced to buy it. This and Conan cartoon of Conan are the ones most missing from my childhood. I think these cartoons are the most prominent of all the great cartoons. I was looking at these cartoons on Channel 13 in Los Angeles. I remember that the owl was always afraid, warned Max that he was in trouble and that he was chosen. Max didn't believe he was the chosen one, and he always had problems with the owl. Norman was less talkative, but his simplicity was fun. He said things like "I eat monsters for breakfast" when he fought them. And then, when he fought with the zombies, he said, "I eat zombies for ... never." Classic cartoon comedy and action. I vote for surrendering Mighty Max.
