Donnie Darko creator brings you a dark story with a strange fashion. The film focuses on a middle-aged young couple living a paycheck in 1976. One day a mysterious red button box appears. Later that day, a haunted gentleman appears and tells them that they have the option to press a button and get a million dollars, but someone they don't know will die. It is a disturbing and provocative question, which is outlined in the trailer and TV spots. But let's know that you just don't know what you're up to until you see it. In times of demanding and somewhat melodramatic film is ultimately effective because it's a good performance and an interesting theme. It would be unfair to destroy one of the plots for you, but let's say that the film adds to the aspects you expect from it, and does not fully fulfill the others that it begins to sketch. There is a lot of obvious symbolism and subtext in the film, which is both interesting and unpleasant, because in his other superior film, Donnie Darko, he was not so evident. There is not much to say without destroying the film. he wanted to inspire a lot of coffee moments. However, I would also like to say that he is well shot and has an appropriately old look and worth watching. Check it out.
