I guess everyone, no matter if we're car fans, luv the Dodge Challenger as he grows up the road, the noise 57 Chevy does as he screams in ecstasy when he rips around a corner and most of all, a blast of sound like a classic vehicle it bursts into flames as it explodes. I'm not the biggest car enthusiast any part of the imagination, but some of the above facts really make my engine! There is no doubt that it is important to have traffic in the cinema. It was even said that the invention of the train was one of the greatest influences on early cinematography (viewed from the window almost as a moving image and the idea of ​​transporting it to another time / space). But the car remains the most popular and distinctive, even has its own genre: the carsploitation genre. A genre that focuses exclusively on the beauty of cars. In fact, it's just porn! Auto porno! And I'm not talking about the somewhat ugly documentary about Channel 4, in which men actually had sex with cars. Whatever your car ... floats, I think. Move on ... while RUNNING ON EMPTY is not as pornographic as VANISHING POINT (Richard C. Sarafian, 1971), for example, with his close-ups of the car moving, all his wounds and curves (!) This doesn't mean the car is not the main the theme of this film. In fact, cars themselves become characters (more on that later). They are objectified and fetishized as well as women in fact, maybe even more. And holy holy, these cars are something! Every car in this movie (except those in the background) is just beautiful? works of art, no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> As I said, these incredible cars are, in a way, the character itself. In fact, you start sympathizing with the car! RUŠIČ VZTLAKU ?? Most notably during the scene in which the car is broken and the burned SpOiler over. This became almost a convention of the genre carsploitation; The Bad 1978 Plymouth Fury of CHRISTINE (John Carpenter, 1983), Satan's Own Lincoln Mark III in CAR (Elliot Silverstein, 1977), a handy little Mini Coopers from Italian JOB (Peter Collinson, 1969) for a friendly Volkswagen Beetle LOVE BUG (Robert Stevenson, 1968) and of course every car from DEATH RACE 2000 (Paul Bartel, 1975) and even WACKY RACES (1968-1970), which had their own character. However, it is ironic that this car emphasis often exceeds (!) Human Characters! And this is certainly the case with RUNNING ON EMPTY, in which it has only one human character (blind character that drives its car with its hearing rather than sight) any size, the rest are very large characters. These are all your stereotypical Australian 1980 teenagers; big hair, annoying accents, and none of them would look in NEIGHBORS, especially Kylie Minouge. But who gives damn? It's all about racing and car crashes! And it is done! If you don't like that you're really watching a bad genre. <br /> <br /> Car repair services are definitely the point of sale for this movie and the best thing for it. They are fast; very fast! And we're not talking about a somewhat unpleasant technique that some movies seem to use where they record a car at a speed of about 40 mph and then speed it up. Oooh no! Not with this movie. Do these cars increase in real-time along the top speed? No editing tricks here. So we have speed. Control. What about the crash? Check, check, check! While in the car ALL HOW TO BECOME THE BLUES BROTHERS (John Landis, 1980), when cars crash in this movie, they will surely fall! They would seem to use gunpowder or something similar to build cars as one small hit and KABOOM are on fire. It reminded me THRILLER: CRUEL PICTURE (Bo Arne Vibenius, 1974) in that sense. There are quite a few scenes between these amazing scenes (especially at the very beginning and at the very end) that slow down everything and do not add much to the movie. Note: need more exploding cars! However, are there a few exceptions that are great scenes? SPOILER especially experimental rape scene. So, it's all a human movie! Boy's movie! Full of cars vroom vroom vrooming around the hinterland and a couple of tits threw for good measure too. Would I recommend this little movie to anyone, even if they are keen cyclists (!) ??? It's a great movie that you can just turn off your brain, sit in a leather chair and put it in full! I'll give it a 3.5 luvs out of 5 luvs ??? Bruuuuum! P.S ?? Amazon sell it for just over £ 2 ??? it is a real advantage, even though the DVD has no special features.
