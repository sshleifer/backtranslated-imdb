I was lucky to have seen this sequel before the original because I am not sure I would get out of the way to see it if it was the opposite of the truth. I found "Mission Cléopâtre" better than its predecessor for various reasons, but the main thing is: it was almost a word for the word adaptation of one book not amalgam as the first film. The physical similarity of some characters with their animated self was very funny, especially the bad one (who disappears but is the second architect). I don't know how this movie played in English; My first language is French, so I didn't have a problem ... I imagine that some jokes were not so easy to translate. I learned something with years that it's better to watch a movie with subtitles than dubbing, maybe you won't understand what they say, but you won't lose rhythm and I think it's also important. I would recommend this movie to anyone who really loves "Astérix et Obélix".
