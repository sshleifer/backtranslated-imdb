It's fantastic! Everything from score to final role. This film is a masterpiece. It's really creepy and its effectively hysterical setup is enough to get horror. Obviously the film was not in a hurry, and that David Schmoeller (who would later work with Fullmoon on a puppet master series) had a clear and concise picture of what he was trying to do. The professional aspect of the film is amazing because of its relatively low budget. It relies on fear without effects (mainly because of budget constraints), but still creates an atmosphere full of tension. Stephen King said it was one of his favorite movies and I really can't blame him! It is one of my favorite horror movies and will always be. This is my favorite Fullmoon movie and has been since I first bought a good couple of years ago. <br /> <br /> He spent the money! I own both VHS and DVD. <br /> <br /> 10/10
