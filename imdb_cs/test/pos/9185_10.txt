Last night I had a remarkable pleasure to see Hitch. I was impressed and impressed. Will Smith has done phenomenal work in a role he is not always associated with. Once and for all, he proved that he did not have to hold a gun to be a film actor in the film. Kevin James was also very impressive. I admit I always liked him on "The King of Queens", but this role really brought him into the light and I hope to see him on the big screen in the near future. The film was funny and adorable and I recommend it to anyone who imagines the best film. A mixture of comedy, romance and drama gave me a sense of completeness. It's nothing like most "chick flicks" in terms of tears and sadness, but it keeps its own and I think it can be just like men and women. I encourage all couples to see this movie, but even if you're not interested in someone, you can pick up some great ideas from Hitch. <br /> <br /> TWO THUMBIC PROCEDURE !!!
