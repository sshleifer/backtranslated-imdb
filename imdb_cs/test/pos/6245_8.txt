"Tourist Trap" is a special thriller that was released in the 1970s, it's about 5 friends Molly (Jocelyn Jones), Jerry (Jon Van Hess), Eileen (Robin Sherwood), Becky (Tanya Roberts) and Woody (Kevin McDermott) who came across the clousd down museum SLAUSEN'S LOST OASIS, a curious and scary road museum. This gold mine of dilapidated but strangely life mannequins is run by Slausen (Chuck Conners), eccentric but seemingly harmless. Slausen has one warning for minors: Stay away from Davey, Slausen's reclusive and disturbed brother. The curiosity of minors is getting the best of them and exploring them. The trap is cushioned! In the midst of flying objects, banging doors, scarves that themselves strangle, empowered by some hidden power, the traps are slowly closing in the group. "Creation" Davey and his army of murderous mannequins make friends quick and brutal until only one remains. Although not the film Slasher "Tourist Trap" still contains elements of the movie slasher Chase scenes and persecution and the fact that the killer wears a mask. The seemingly telekinetic ability of a killer to block screws and animate wax figurines. Perhaps the scariest thing about this movie is the dummies, which are quite scary to get started, but there are scary rallies. The film will succeed despite, or perhaps due to, an apparently poor budget. These wax figures are extraordinarily plastic business mannequins - but it just goes to make it even more frightening when their eyes move with an incredible man. Acting is actually pretty good, Chuck Conners gives a well rounded and scary performance as Mr. Slausen, Jocelyn Jones is great as a female lead.
