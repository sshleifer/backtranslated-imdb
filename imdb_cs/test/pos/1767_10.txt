This is the unknown and forgotten movie that dreams of discovering old videos. It is a great comic gem with brilliantly humorous writing, embedded in a wonderful line of characters, a beautifully inventive and witty musical score and a humorous, lightweight direction from Montgomery itself. This is the one I look at again and again. Montgomery is a bit of an actor assigned to his military reserve to penetrate the home of a young debutant to find out the identity of his former beau, a suspicious jewel thief. While the assumption is rather absurd, the results are merry. Montgomery is a confused plant, Ann Blyth is a miracle as a romantically obsessed, terribly serious debutant, and a show of comic book characters from veteran actress, mother mother Jane Cowl to Lillian Randolph's service - they are amazing. Oddly enough, it just earned an Oscar nomination for Sound when it deserved a top nod for direction, script, and music score. IT IS NOT MISS IT - it's one of Hollywood's best.
