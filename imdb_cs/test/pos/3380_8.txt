I just watched this movie on his premiere night of curiosity and utter nostalgia. I liked (doesn't love) "Mork & Mindy" as a child, mostly for the performance of Robin William. This movie remembered me why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin was definitely. Which brings me to this movie. I was pleasantly surprised and expected nothing more than painting by numbers chronologically recounting the show (which was the case). But of course, the real focus was on Robin. It was interesting to see Robin's journey from a street jester to a national t.v star and how this drastic difference affected him and his long-suffering wife. And my hat is gone to see Chris Diamantopoulos when he portrayed Mr. Williams integrity, sensitivity and heart; Not just a cute impression, though it was even dead. (On an unrelated note, I noticed that Robin's matches were in some ways similar to Andy Kaufman, who was underestimated on TV and creatively held, but that is "Taxi" behind the scenes. Br /> All in all, it was a very nice movie in which I felt that I knew something more about the man behind the Orcans, the work was solid thanks to all who had never been melodramatic, as I expected - and the story moved well. Garry Marshall and John Belushi (the scene in which Belushi heckles Robin was fun!) It's not a great masterpiece in any way (I'd like to see more about Pam Dawber), but be attentive, especially for those Robin Williams and "Mork & Mindy Nanoo, nanoo!
