Good movies, acting was amazing especially from Eriq Ebouaney (Lumumba) and very well directed. It also shows how Lumumba was driven off by the Belgians, the US and the UN, and as a Communist. scare people like they did to all honest African leaders like Nkrumah, Kenyatta, Nyerere and many others. It shows how Western countries preach democracy while having something else on the back of their minds. It is a story of injustice, struggle and brutality. It shows how Lumumba couldn't control his people, yes, it was his people, but before we blamed him, he was getting enough when he did. of the people he named in his government as Mobutu? Or his colleague had other things in mind to find out, go and see the movie! Certainly Mobutu did, continued to loot the country for the next 35 years, before he was overthrown and fled the country. He died a billionaire. Some Flaws: There was too little explanation of how Lumumba got first. There should also be more explanation about the country, Congo Kinshasa (after independence), now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo formerly known as Zaire when it was under Mobutu. There was an explanation for why (Lumumba) could not keep the second largest country in Africa in one piece. And what's going on with Tshombe and Katanga. Only if you look at the Tshombe movie that directed Katanga, which (if I'm not mistaken) is the number one in the world. <br /> <br /> In all, it's a good movie you can see. You will learn something new about Africa, it's leaders and people and will probably open your eyes to why this continent is being waged.
