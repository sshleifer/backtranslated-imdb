Because of his acting roles in the 1940s (Casper Gutman, Signior Ferrari, Mr. Peters, Jerome K. Arbutny, Grodman's Ex-Superintendent, Count Fosco, Titus Semple), many of his fans are surprised to learn that Sidney Greenstreet was originally made a name for himself in West End and Broadway comedies. He was usually such a total villain, or a serious actor to the public that his comic talents were ignored. In fact he made four comedy appearances (one spoof of his villainous portraits with his villainous partner Peter Lorre in a cameo appearance). His best overall film appearance in comedy was probably that of magazine publisher Alexander Yardley in "Christmas in Connecticut" (although his autocratic, half mad soap mogul in "Hucksters" is near second). Despite some scenario issues, it is a good movie, and usually animated in the Christmas season. Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) writes a column in the "American Housekeeping" magazine for Yardley, where she gives home tips and cooking recipes. She is a 1945 version of Martha Steward, except that Mrs. Steward is a cook and homeowner, and can vouch for trying and testing what she defends. Stanwyck can't. Her cooking recipes are her friend Felix (S.Z. Sakall), a gourmet chef and a restaurateur. The house he describes as his home (model estate in Connecticut) is one of her unofficial friends, architect John Sloane (Reginald Gardiner). Gardiner wouldn't really mind taking Stanwyck, but he's not fully prepared to think of a final commitment to him. As the film begins, the American is shipwrecked by the Nazis. This is Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor. He spent two weeks on a raft before he was saved. Greenstreet, who sensed the value of publicity, decided to give Morgan a wish to have a real old-fashioned Christmas in Connecticut. Basically, he tells Stanwyck that he will entertain Morgana and himself on a vacation farm. Stanwyck cannot explain that the columns are in themselves (along with her ability to flip the flaps and raise a child she supposedly had with her husband) is a lie - if she does, she'll be released, just like her immediate boss, Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne) . At the moment of depression, he accepts Gardiner's proposal for marriage, and then Gardiner discovers that his home in Connecticut is dragooned to become a "real" home to Stanwyck and himself and "their child". Of course, aside. Stanwyck and Morgan found they fell in love with Greenstreet's curiosity, and therefore they think they fell in love (unlike Gardiner's horror - in fact, he expects Stanwyck to marry him). The complications are followed by complications lying on the lies, and as the neighbor's children follow the neighbor's children, before Greenstreet starts to wonder if he is missing something. But it's comedy, so everything works fine. Even Greenstreet, in the end, is amused with all the madness - his famous heartfelt chortle reflecting Santa Claus for a change. This is not a classic comedy, certainly not a great, but amusing enough to keep the season in December.
