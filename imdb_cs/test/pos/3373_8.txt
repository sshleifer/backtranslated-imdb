Forget Donnie Darka. I will open it up because it seems that the great part of the reviews I read on The Box is a simple but weak argument that Darko doesn't have a candle. It is not that I do not necessarily agree with it, I feel that this film is a completely different animal and deserves its own analysis. There are points of comparison to be sure, but they are marginal fears when you think the key to the heart of each movie is different. In Darko, the driving force behind the story is existential. In The Box, the driving force behind the story comes from a moral dilemma. Believe me, when I say I understand the tendency to compare innovative filmmakers'movies by looking for trends and patterns, but for me it is more important to first approach each new movie as a separate subject, and then widen your view. The box is one of those movies you have mixed feelings about because it seems to be in some identity crisis. It is not always certain what it wants to be. Twists are numerous but easy to follow, if not predict. James Marsden and Cameron Diaz play a fairly credible pair of newlyweds who are in financial hardships. Boxes containing a "buttonhole" come to their doorstep and are informed by a terribly burned man that if you press a button, they cause the death of one person they don't know and receive one million dollars. One of the things Box accomplishes is to conjure up this invisible fear that somewhere outside our actions has moral consequences. Before the button is pressed, it has a frightening and seductive quality, attractive but ominous. Once it has been pushed, events are set in motion that make two conductors question their own morals and deeply regret their fateful decisions. The idea that Box is an experiment is interesting because it provides the film with a paradox for me. If there are external beings who develop an "altruistic coefficient" based on the data collected by the pairs that press and do not push the button, then as the conspiracy collapses, we notice that ultimately it is forced altruism: being selfless or being destroyed. I believe that couples do not know the consequences of their actions when faced with decisions but have no reason to believe that The Box can do anything, so why would they choose altruistically? Is altruism devalued by taking care of it only when we have a problem in our lives? The psychological obstacles in this film are everywhere. Press the button or not, it's probably someone who's playing with you. Take money or not, nobody gives anything for free. Finding the truth, the answers you find slowly reveal your demise. I suggest that Boxing be ironic because it offers a false choice of free will while revealing that we are trapped in many metaphorical boxes. You can only decide to be free at the expense of another's life, is it freedom? No, it's just another box, because then you find yourself trapped in the consequences of your own morality. There is no escape for us because we live on earth and that is another box. That is why external beings in the film are ultimately antagonists. They demand that we conform to moral standards that rob us of our freedom. We did it on Mars and we were burned for it and became a slave in a sick game. Links to Jean Paul Sartre illustrate this point quite well. "You can only enter the finals for free or not." Sure, but no matter what form we enter the chamber, it's a chamber. Trevor Nemeth
