Like all other Mel Brooks comedies, Men in Stockings are merry. But when I see it as an outrageous comedy, I think many don't realize that the reason the movie is so funny is that the characters themselves behave so well. Elwes is a well-spoken former British nobleman, Lewis is an eternally angry king (I hope it's all NOOOOOOIIIISE!), DeLuise is a FANTASTIC godfather, Roger Rees is a worried and cynical sheriff .... that jokes are easy. Yes, we've seen this kind of comedy, but the only comedy to achieve better character development is The Big Lebowski in my opinion. Very funny.
