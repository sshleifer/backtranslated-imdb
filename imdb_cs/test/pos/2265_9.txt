SPOILERS Jewish Frodo? Yeah, it's Elijah Wood again. From the end of the final part of "The Lord of the Rings", Elijah Wood as Frodo has found it increasingly difficult to get out of this lead role. Playing football hooligan, psychopath and now a young Jewish American, Wood has tried any route he could escape from this type of broadcast. Now, with "Everything is lit," he could finally achieve it. He plays a role that is not as radical as other endeavors, he really gets into the soul of his character. Still, it's not like Wood alone. With the help of the spectacular adaptation of director Lever Schreiber and the spectacular performance of the newcomer Eugene Hutz, Wood found amazing production to expand his wings. "Everything is illuminated" is an amazing, moving piece of cinema. Jonathan Safran Foer (Wood), a young American Jew, sets out for Ukraine to find a mysterious girl who saved her grandfather and helped her get to America. Jonathan comes to the country and meets all the talking, dancing Alex (Hutz) and his racist grandfather (Boris Leskin). Traveling around the country, three slowly learn more and more about the history and relationships that Alex and Jonathan never knew existed. It is a strange feeling when the film progresses to its second chapter (it is actually divided) overall. The first part, though sometimes a bit funny, is mostly serious and intense. So when we got a brief history of Alex and his family in the second part, going from serious to cheerful is a special step. It is not quite a job, but as the film progresses, it certainly learns that it is a lesson because this blend of humor and sadness connects more well with time. For the ultimate acknowledgment of all involved, as the story continues, we begin to fall on the characters more and more. Elijah Wood is magnificent, Boris Leskin is so intense and strong that he raises questions why Hollywood never noticed him properly. Most notable of all, however, is the newcomer Eugene Hutz. Hutz is absolutely brilliant. He shows the division between his relatives and the real world with almost perfect skill, and when his character communicates with Wood, you're really connected to him on a deeper level. Without Hutz, the story is so strong that the film would be even more spectacular, but it will hit another level with it. As a debut work for actors with director Liev Schreiber, the story is also a Brilliant Piece to Begin. The work of passion (Schreiber's grandfather is an immigrant to America) can truly capture the emotions of the content, and by showing us really beautiful scenery and some wonderful shots, he can really hit home. Especially the last half hour is so beautifully created that it is a challenge for tears not to form in the eyes of the audience. It is a moving story and, thanks to Schreiber's help, becomes even stronger. With love from a passionate director, "Everything is illuminated" is a beautiful piece. The story of the road with a difference, it is wonderfully acted and wonderfully written. It's a movie everyone should see, and it's the perfect way Elijah Wood finally puts Frodo to rest.
