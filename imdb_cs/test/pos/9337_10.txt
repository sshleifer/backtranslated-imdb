The video will open with a scene from a horror movie in which you propose to your girlfriend. She starts telling her she's "different." When the full moon rises, it turns into a werewolf. Then it is haunted by forests and taken to the cinema just before the attacks. Inside the theater are Michael and his girlfriend. She's too scared to look, so they're leaving. When they leave the theater, they start teasing her. ("It's close to midnight, something evil lurks in the dark ...") Michael then sings and dances his way down the street with his girlfriend. This scene shows Michael's ability with the camera. He never once acts "aware" of his presence, as many other artists do. As they make their way around the graveyard, the graves begin to open ... Once they reach the alley, they are confronted with a horde of undead. Then we will see the horrified face of Michael's girl. Who wouldn't have a horror hit if their date turned into a zombie? Yeah, he's one of the undead. (Very bright and shiny, though.) He and his zombie colleagues will then begin what may be the most famous dance choreography of any music video. To say it would end. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite music video ever! You don't want to miss it! I give him 10/10. (Yes, I know you can see the curtains at the back of the sound stage, and the werewolf looks a bit cheesy by today's standards.)
