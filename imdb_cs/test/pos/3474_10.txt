Damien O'Donnell has good results and handles a very sensitive topic with sensitivity in this movie, but he won't let the film turn into a schmalz. It's a fantastic movie, its funny sad movie bits and it makes you look at things differently. Tell everyone to know that you can see it now - FANTASTIC! Acting is excellent and Dublin plays a major role. This film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night at the cinema. I can't wait to come out on DVD.
