I thought this movie was great if you didn't take it too seriously. Just sit down and enjoy Hilary Swank in all her sizes and laugh when the monks go to Boston, MA. I also think that this film has a great message of self-control and inner strength. And Mr. Myagi was so sweet he would teach me karate!
