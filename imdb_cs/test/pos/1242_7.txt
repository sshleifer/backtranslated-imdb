Maybe I was in a very good mood while watching this movie. but for some reason I really liked this movie. Was it really original? No. Was it a little predictable? Yes. So what? It was still a nice movie. I always liked Bruce Willis (almost always, always was a Hudson Hawk and Fifth Element), and he perfectly portrayed a selfish, sarcastic expression. Maybe this movie isn't an Oscar material, but it's definitely a good material. Go rent it.
