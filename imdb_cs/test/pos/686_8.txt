This one is a jolly diamond. Acting and conspiracy are not so impressive, but the lines are still appearing. This catch a lot of flack because it seems at first glance like, good, bad movie, but it's so eccentric that you can't help but be amused. The fragile lightning fast dialogue and unpredictable characters keep him running ... I was especially fond of Sharon, Canuck on Shrooms eh? However, the one who really stole the show was Richard's little brother Andrew (Ira Heiden), his high laughing whine was somehow cute. The whole movie shuddered.
