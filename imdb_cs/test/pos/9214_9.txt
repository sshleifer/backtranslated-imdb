I have to admit, I am a fan of the caricatures of the 80's, but that's one of the best. Rainbow Brite and Star Stealer is one of the most watched and entertaining Rainbow Brite cartoons and is much better than the TV series. I especially like the relationship between Rainbow and Darian and it's very fun. But my favorite character is Starlite, who is definitely the most beautiful horse in the universe! I also recommend Rainbow Brite: New Beginnings, which tells the story of how Rainbowland came. Have a rainbow day!
