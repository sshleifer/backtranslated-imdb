It is an interesting fact that the metaphysics of Plato and Aristotle, formal logic and abstract ontology make up the sciences most people do not care about. But about a thousand years after Aristotle, the computer began to boast of human thinking. people who refused to reflect non-biological, physical, and chemical questions suddenly felt paralyzed because they couldn't cope with the consequences these computers would bring "overnight." "Welt Am Draht", along with Tarkovsky's "Solaris" and Godard's "Alphaville", is probably the first film to take the philosophical issues of emerging computer science as the basis of a story to be told in the film. Confusing questions about identities and realities are cleverly embedded in a variety of interwoven crime stories that viewers seek to address because they are interested in dealing with cases. Fassbinder was a master who sold abstracts to the public and put theoretical knowledge into practical, appealing forms. The basic problem for understanding is that identity defines reality, but on the other hand, reality also requires identity to be perceived. The idea of ​​a person with multiple identities is only known to us in terms of psychiatry. However, logically speaking, the only reason we have only one identity is that our logic has only two values ​​(true and false). Now take the logic with just one more value, ie with three: Then, as you can easily see, you already have three identities. What happens now when we say Dr. Stiller is killed? Then it is entirely possible that only one of the three identities will be abolished and the other two will remain and be able to save the individual from death. Another question is whether a person with multiple identities actually feels these identities at once. The idea, however, of displaying such sets of identities up-down or down-up in the way shown in a scene with an elevator in a hotel is misleading because of the identities and hence realities are not structured in the Hierarchical, but in the Heterarchical way. Strictly speaking, there is not even an "artificial identity" because every identity is defined by two objects that share all their properties. Therefore, the idea of ​​assuming that each individual has only one single identity is nothing more than the result of an ancient two-valued logic (the second identity would mean that a person exists and does not exist at the same time). But now we look around and see that one and the same object (which is identical in its own way) is perceived by each subject in its own way. So, if every object sees an object differently, why should it not be possible for an individual to open the boundaries of his two-valued individual corset, with different individuals exchanging their different individuals? Five years later, Fassbinder would pick up this topic in his masterpiece "Despair. A Trip to Light".
