After that, he does just a few movies with his life Late Great Chris Farley. Farley died at the end of 1997 and will miss his teammate in Tommy Boy, David Spade. From the lame police academy 4 Spade, his career in films is truly successful. Tommy Boy is a classic and we will always remember Chris Farley when we watch him. From Saturday Show NIGHT LIVE to Tommy Boy, Black Sheep, Beverley Hills Ninja, Almost Heroes, Billy Madison and Dirty Work. I think Chris Farley had a short and successful career. Tommy Boy was his best in my case and I'd be looking over and over again and laughing on the same part every time. Thank you Chris Farley.
