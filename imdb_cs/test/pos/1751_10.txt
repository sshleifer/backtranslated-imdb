Well, I can be biased as I grew up watching VHS copy of this movie, which is now ready to snap and just spent the last couple of hours watching DVD copies as birthday presses for my father. The film is so harmless and harmless that it fits all ages .... much better than anything Disney has done in my opinion (and I was working at Disney Store !!!). The characters are pleasing and the prize for the best scene is a tie between a disturbed wedding (especially Swat's musical talent, fly and smack the mosquito) and an amazing nightclub scene. Music numbers still roared for 20 years after the first track. There is no other film that I can better recommend for babysitting, and in fact every child I know (thanks to my parents who love Hoppity) has seen this film many times. It will always get the best marks for his fabulous love story, brilliant baddy and above all originality.
