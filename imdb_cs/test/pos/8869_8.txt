"Throw Momma From Train" is a simple dark comedy with lots of laughter. Billy Crystal plays a frustrated writer on the verge of collapse; Danny DeVito plays a man in one of the Crystal writing classes. Crystal's ex-wife is * hag * to make it pretty, and Crystal hates her. DeVito, when he sensed it, offered Crystal one night: DeVito kills Crystal's wife if Crystal kills DeVito's mother accident. Of course, Krystal refuses, but later, corruption deep in his heart makes him say yes. And as things happen, we see what happens when you try to throw one's mom off a moving train. This story is an interesting character study; the story of evil, greed, revenge, ego, trust, what is right, but above all corruption. We see that Crystal's white-collar is becoming increasingly accentuated by the events surrounding him, and since DeVito is constantly annoying, he says "yes." But in his subconscious we know deeply that he wanted to say "yes," and he's glad he told DeVit. This film is a bit of a dark spoof on Hitchcock's immortal movie "Strangers on Train," and plays a tribute to the movie soon when there is a theater playing "strangers on the train." light bulb appears. He'll get an idea. Throw Momma off the train! Billy Crystal gives another convincing and strange comic performance as a hassled writer on the verge of collapse. He was so beaten by everything around him that his inner-emotions come out and he agrees to throw DeVito mom away from the train. Danny DeVito has greatly directed this film. To create a world of corruption and illness, he uses only the right touch of comic darkness. Everything is demented, but not as extreme as in other dark comedies. It only has the right touch of darkness that shone through the "Roses of the Roses." Not only is "Throwing Momma off the train" a simple story about corruption and morality, but it's also an interesting character study. Definitely worth catching on TV. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 5 stars - John Ulmer
