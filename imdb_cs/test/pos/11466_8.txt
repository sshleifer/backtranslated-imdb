The 1980s were overcome by all those HALLOWEEN / Friday the 13th slasher-style horror movies, so it's something like relief. Ten incredibly annoying teenagers (would you like to hang out with these jerks?!) decide to throw a Halloween party at a local former funeral parlor called "Hull House". During a "past life session", the demon is accidentally released, and each person becomes obsessed and kills others. All this sounds very bad / DEMONS-ish, but Tenney lends some overhead style in the management, there are some good one-liners, music is excellent, Steve Johnson's prosthetic makeup FX are scary and Linnea Quigley is pretty fun as a boy-crazy bimbo who sticks out his eyeball with his fingers and makes an amazing new thing with a lipstick tube! <br /> <br /> Great fun at unjustifiable level! After logging out of the voting schedule and other published reviews, I don't understand how only 4 out of 10 (?!) <br /> <br /> got it, 8 out of 10.
