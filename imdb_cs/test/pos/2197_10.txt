I own this video as well as the concert versions of the musical with Patti Lupone and George Hearn with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. George Hearn is fantastic in my book, as is Angela Lansbury and composer Stephen Sondheim. This musical is operative in scope and shows great inventiveness in composition. I'm sure that this VHS will be available on DVD! Hearn's performance is very sympathetic. The only unpleasant performance is a young woman singing the role of Joanna. I believe this show was at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, rather than the Broadway scene, and I'm not sure if the minimalist set was used in New York as it was in this production. But I found that the scaffolding that stretches across the stage is effective enough to "portray" the streets of London. I highly recommend this movie.
