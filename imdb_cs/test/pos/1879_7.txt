The Screaming Man is definitely not a perfect movie, but I'm sure it should never have been anything but a stellar vehicle for Bruce Campbell, which means it works like a kind of summary of his career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings . Campbell, as a writer, is uneven - there are a lot of things in the story that don't make much sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts because a female brain has been implanted in it), and some scenes feel like aids to other, better incarnations (scene in a restaurant where Yegor and William are fighting for control of William's body is right from Evil Dead II). But there are a lot of tiny touches and non-sequiturs that feel more brilliant than when William is at the height of his panic and screaming at the statue, "What are you looking at?" The film looks like the original Sci-Fi channel, probably because it was. Acting is actually pretty good. Especially I enjoyed Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, but at some moments she seemed to have tragic air that never explored the story. Ted Raimi has mastered the standard "bumbling assistant" role admirably and Bruce is funny as an arrogant, sardonic, condescending American jerk. (Now that he writes his own movies, you think he would have a role he no longer had.) A Screaming Man is a bizarre, nonsensical B-movie that should be enjoyable for anyone who can avoid having the film experience got too serious.
