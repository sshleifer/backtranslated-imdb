It is a wonderful film that takes place during the romantic period of civil war. This film is to be seen for Eastwood Fans and Eastwood claims it's one of his favorite movies he did. I couldn't agree more. Be careful! This is a spoiler - Eastwood will eventually die. Eastwood and director Don Siegel rightly claimed that the end should be unexpected and unfortunate for several reasons. They wanted to keep books, for one. Second, there can never be a happy ending. Third, it was written during the Vietnam War - they wanted a negative statement on this terrible warfare, where people were dying unnecessarily. I agree with everything. It is a beautifully shot film and I like most of the movies that involve civil war. It is rather a portrait of how deceptive women can be - that they can be more dangerous than men, and therefore has a name to do with the claim of BEGUILED- to be cheated. The song sung by Eastwood at the beginning and end of the film is another statement against not only the civil war, but also the Vietnam War and perhaps indirectly the women he encounters during the film. A wonderful story of love and fraud and many unforgettable scenes - NOTE: This movie is rated R for no reason. There is hardly any language, it is probably a matter of sex, but there is no nudity. Excellent movie- 9/10.
