By the time he opened, the "Heavenly Gate" had become more of a cultural phenomenon than film. At a time when fears of excessive budgets and overhead arrogance had risen, this was an appropriate goal because it was the far-reaching budget work of the last "auteura" that hit Hollywood, which has not yet recorded results. gave him the benefit of doubts between critics and industry. As someone pointed out at the time, no one took any more of Warren Beatty because he was "more expensive and darker" Reds because Beatty was "one of us" while Michael Cimino did not reach that. But the "Gate of Heaven" was also influenced by the cultural change that occurred at that time, the political move to the right, and towards the undeniable patriotism and anchoring of the Western myth (and Western). A few years earlier, Cimino's demytologization of the border might have seemed timely, fresh and necessary. But in 1980, in the wake of the Reagan Revolution, it was thought of as almost un-American. What a shame, because the film, seen from a point of view for decades away, is a fascinating and provocative provocation looking at the particular time and place as the world where life was, according to Hobbes' words, "ugly , brutal and short ". Kristofferson plays James Averill, an Eastern European native who becomes a sheriff in Wyoming in search of adventure, where he found himself at the forefront of the resistance of settlers and squatters against the attack of a mercenary unit hired by wealthy landowners. , including Averill's lifelong best friend. In a more innocent time, Averill and his "army" are falling apart; but this is different from the traditional western, and when the American cavalry joins the battle, it's not on the side of "good guys". Just like the "deer hunter", Cimino's previous film "The Gate of Heaven" spends a lot of time building the details of his principles, giving the film a timeless pace that leads to a conclusion. With outstanding acting performance, good musical score and visual structure that convinces them that one really sees the "old west" through new eyes, "The Gate of Heaven" is a film that rewards repetitive views. I just want MGM to release a new DVD with improved Cimino conversion and commentary. However, the current version is sufficient to allow viewers to see what critics in the 1980s, perhaps blinded by the cultural subtitles of the film, have missed ... that "The Gate of Heaven" is a great movie.
