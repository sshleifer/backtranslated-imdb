This lesser-known film, starring Roy Thinnes (from TV Invaders), is what I think is a lost gem. It was done at a time where the story was more important than special effects (though the effect is quite good for its time). The scientist believes that there is a different world behind the Sun in Orbit Earth. Since the sun is always blocking us, we never see it from Earth. Roy Thinnes is chosen to go on a mission to get into this world. I don't want to say the rest of the land because it'll be the rest of the movie. Let's say there are some real surprises. The film is British and has a good British taste of acting that has been on TV shows like The Avengers.
