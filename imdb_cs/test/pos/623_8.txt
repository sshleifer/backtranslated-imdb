Great crafted low budget thriller with more twists and turns than you can shake your wand and lots of ghoulish humor on the way as well. The cast plays very well, though Richards' self-director of middle film is sometimes hard to take. The tiny double stage work of Sir Alek Guinness, which poses a threat as a criminal line of Moscow, is simply the icing on the cake. Well worth repeating, but not in a dark night when you're all alone!
