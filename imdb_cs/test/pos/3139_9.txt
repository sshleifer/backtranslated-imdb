Wagon Master is a very unique film between John Ford's work. Especially because it's the only one based on a story written by John Ford himself, a story that Frank Nugent and the director's son developed? Patrick Ford turned into a screenplay and thanks to the director's personal opinion he was interested in, the Wagon Master is a movie that John Ford described as "coming close to what I wanted to achieve" to say it, he didn't say a bit But how Ford once confessed to Lindsay Anderson, but his favorite was my Darling Clementine and not any other. <br /> <br /> The Wagon Master has all the ingredients you can expect in a John Ford movie. Wonderful cast that brings the best, aren't you any big stars except the funniest of all the actors? Ben Johnson. Very peculiar little characters that provide binding comic relief, and the Wagon Master carries quite a few of them, such as the horn that blows sister Ledyard (Jane Darwell), but very inspired concerts. Last but not least, the legendary Monument Valley with John Ford's fifth passage through Stagecoach, My Darling Clementine, Fort Apache, and She had a yellow ribbon. The film begins with two cowboy friends, Travis Blue (Ben Johnson) and Sandy Owens (Harry Carey Jr.), hired at the Wagon Masters or a guide for the Mormon Settlers Caravan heading to Silver Valley, a place that's for them as a promised land. Along the way, a very special dr. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) with two beautiful women who are allegedly his wife and daughter and who are called actors. They headed in the same direction because they were recently expelled from the nearest town and had no other place to go. Nothing particularly unpleasant will happen until he encounters Cleggse, a dangerous family group composed of his father and his three sons, who are fleeing the city's marshal, where they have recently committed murder and bank robbery. Overall, the Master Master is no more than a less precious pearl in the necklace of John Ford's exquisite westerns. You must see. 9/10 <br /> <br />
