When I first saw the ad on it, I was like 'Oh here we are. He did High School Musical, but he can't coast along on it, so now he's making appearances on other Disney shows'. Personally, I like The Life Life and I'm a big fan of Ashely Tisdale. But for some reason I'm not too excited about Zac Efron, even though all my friends think it's the best thing ever since Jesse McCartney. But I'm really worried. Anyway, I was watching the show (break from the English course) and I was pleasantly surprised. The performances were good, especially from regular characters at The Suite Life and Zac Efron wasn't as bad as I expected. All in all, quite a good show.
