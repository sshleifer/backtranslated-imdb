Much of this movie was beautiful. Acting, scenery, and no doubt, Aaron's cinematography background has shown beautiful shots. Certainly worth watching because your attention will be captivated all the time and end up in the right place. The newcomer Jonathan Furr was excellent because he thought he was a professional actor ever since. He was born. He continued with other feature films, but this lead role will always be remembered. The film has this academic award at the time when it's slow and scenic and quiet, so it's not a movie that could be added to kids can sit. However, the country feeling of East Bend and Yadkinville played well as the 1940 era movie.
