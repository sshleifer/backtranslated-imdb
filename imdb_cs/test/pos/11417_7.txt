I liked this movie. I'm not a big horror enthusiast, so I couldn't comment on the similarities between this and other genre films, but I found this movie quite captivating. The story, though a bit obvious, had some really scary / tense moments and acting (especially the main female role) in any case wasn't bad <br /> <br /> Overall, I'm a little surprised by the low rating this movie got. I'm looking at a lot of movies (working in a video store tends to help) and it's really not as bad as people think. But I have some criticism. The last call from the policeman was a terrible, almost flooded, dead girl in the bathroom seemed to like sleep (probably from the amount of tequila she mentioned she drank), and the children's reaction to what was happening instilled. I hope they were finally killed <br /> <br /> I hope it will help some people
