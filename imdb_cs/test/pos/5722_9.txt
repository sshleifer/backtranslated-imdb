It is definitely not a film that would revolutionize the industry or introduce new techniques of filmmaking, which is very nice and solid production. It's miraculous that we can look forward to great DVD quality today - most viewers have seen a black-and-white copy about 100 years ago because a stencil of toned de luxe edition was only available at the best theaters. Although you are not fascinated by this film or its subject, you cannot, but admire a copy published by Image Entertainment (along with another jewel, From Mangera to the Cross, 1912). It is virtually impossible to see a film that is more than a hundred years old, but it shows so little damage. The stencil dyeing process was very effective, and the colors are sharp and well defined compared to the occasional blurry and smudged images of hand-held color film. Filmed in the filmmaking scene, which was already known in 1902 when filming began, can now be considered almost intentional, meditative and solemn. Tables are constantly moving, so the movie is never interested. You may not be fascinated by this film as a work of cinematography, but it is sure to be nice as a work of academic, picturesque art. If you are a religious person, the fact that you are watching anonymously has long contributed significantly to the mystery long since people leave long when characters leave. Proper viewing for Christmas or Lent. <br /> <br /> P.S: I checked the "contains spoilers" box just for fun. As you can see, I did not reveal the end.
