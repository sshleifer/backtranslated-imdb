I saw the movie yesterday and I really enjoyed it. Although there were a few clues I could realize after the second observation, I was unable to wake up the Dow-Dawn case. Maybe it was my carelessness. The woman's subconscious became specific to personalization. â€œLet me go out of the key phrase of the film. Let me go out of the deep inside of your brain and we will both be free. a film that forces the boundaries of human consciousness and brain. Anyone who has seen 'Machinist' would realize the similarities with the breaking of dawn. A man who could not escape from his conscience (again a psychological and abstract concept), it fulfills a person's body. And he will simply be without receiving and realize that there is no way to escape. Despite the fact that he does not have much experience, from actors and actresses, the director all exhibited independently a performance that created synergy that would enhance the quality of the film
