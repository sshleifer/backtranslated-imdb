I think this round is making some cuts. The copy I saw was heavily focused on Joe's erotic movies and pointed out his horror output. In their X-rated fame, numerous X-rated films are presented and the legendary EMMANUELLE IN AMERICA in the legendary "snuff" seam (breasts cut off) is dedicated to generous time on screen. Interviews with the very likeable Joe is informative and honest. He is unassuming, articulating a gent and discussing his interest in a shocking audience, why he wanted to mix eroticism with horror, and how he could have been responsible for one of his artists turning gay. His friendship and working relationship with Indonesian beauty Laura Gemser touches as well as his indifferent attitude towards filming hardcore. Joe D'Amato presents an incredible period in continental cinema that has passed. It's great to see a documentary dedicated to him and his subtle, unique job. RIP, Joe.
