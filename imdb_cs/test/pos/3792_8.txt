In these modern times (as it is well known that the director of the short film that the German Earl is talking about), they are politically correct films a "leitmotif" of modern young filmmakers' projects. "Shoulder Arms" directed by Herr Charlie Chaplin during WWI (the film was released just weeks before the ceasefire) is an obvious example of why early film pioneers were brave people! To direct a witty movie inspired by the horrible, bloody World War I was a difficult matter that few directors were allowed to do these dangerous and courageous ideas? doing business on such a delicate business and with success was reserved only for geniuses. As this German earl said, "Shoulder Weapons" were made during World War I, at a time when the whole world had lost its innocence (fortunately not the German fat heirs of this aristocrat?) and it is merry , an inventive social satire about it and any war. The film is full of great gags and fun movie continuity for a story in which this hiker will live though risky and brave adventures at the front - be it an ally hero? or not. <br /> <br /> To ridicule war trenches, unhealthy, frontal attacks and Germans (how dare you! ... By the way, there are a lot of inaccuracies in the movie? German soldiers at that time had mustaches and longer beards about it that Kaiser lacks a lot of medals in his uniform?) In an elegant, witty and delicate way, a film miracle is still impossible to overcome today. Given the terrible circumstances of war, a difficult task is only possible thanks to a lot of creativity and talent. Of course, Mr. Charlie Chaplin had the power. And now that you allow me, I have to leave temporarily, because this German earl has to go back to the Schloss Trenches.
