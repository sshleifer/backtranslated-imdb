* Could contain spoilers, read only after last episode period 2 * Think about it. Guys at the North Pole? Middle of the country? Are you looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something about: "Did we miss it again?" Was there another abnormality? Of course it was when the plain crashed! I think the whole island is setup. Her dad prepared it. She found out and was looking for Desmond. How else can he know what to look for. So basically it's an island in a magnetic shield. It's all fake. All signs are there. False beards, fake doors, fake medicines, fake observation stations, false air shafts that don't lead to anything. It's really a project and given the final scene in the finals of the 2 season I know it has to do something with Desmond, his baby and her father (and probably Libby, she's weird, maybe she has something to do with a plane crashing on a plane). , OK, I'm gone now. Also in this episode, Henry Gail tells Michael to go to some coordinates, and he finds their salvation. This is probably some kind of door in the magnetic shield. "once you are gone. not the way back". I think it's pretty obvious, despite the many questions I have and I hope to get answers next season. If you think about what we've learned in Season 1 and Season 2, we'll definitely get a lot of responses in Season 3. <br /> <br /> Don't wait. Can anyone agree on this theory? I hope to hear from you ...
