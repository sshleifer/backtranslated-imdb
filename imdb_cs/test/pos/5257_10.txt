Yes, this movie is another remake. Yes, this movie can be considered a movie. And yes, this film is not perfect. But women are a clever modern update about the social behavior of all women, with the impressive cast of A-Listers, including Meg Ryan, Debra Messing, Annette Benning, and Bette Midler. The film revolves around four main characters, Mary (Ryan), her best friend, editor-in-chief, Sylvie (Benning), Alex (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Edie (Debra Messing) and an extraterrestrial female being, which is responsible for most of the film's drama, named Crystal (Eva Mendez). Mary tries to deal with her cheating husband (who has never seen in the film), following the instructions of her friends and mother (Candice Bergen). Besides Mary, there's Sylvie, who is her social life and her professional life. She has a decision to do so to test her moral and ethical values. Then there's the writer Alex, who is a lesbian, with lots of spunk, but knows her way through words. And finally Edie with four girls and another child on a path that loves children and has a heart of gold, with a hidden secret revealed at the end. Together women live for revenge, relying on everyone else and giving each other life lessons. But they are portraits of Bette Midler, Candice Bergen, Cloris Leachman, Carrie Fisher and Debi Mazar, who show the cruel and usual behavior of women. Bergen plays Ryan's mother, is hard, silver, experienced and yet she feels she can become what her daughter does later. There is Fisher who shows how to blackmail and try the boundaries of selfishness, morality and betrayal. Mazar, the little girl who shows no mercy for what she says and to whom she says it. Leachman, who plays Ryan's handy housekeeper, knows her place when and where she needs it, and how to deliver a good single-layer ship. Finally there is MIdler, who plays Leah Miller, a crazy eclectic but wise Hollywood agent. It is the only character that gives Ryan Mary the revelation of who she really is by discovering "what I want." Despite the fact that Midler's scene steals performance and unforgettable quotes, it has been underused. But back to the film, women together show the audience what it means to live in the 21st century without knowing exactly what you want until they see what you want. Time will come when you answer this own question. It deals with feminism, what it means to be a woman (wild, ruthless, bad ass, cheap, clever, clever, clever, clever, shy, proud, shameful, confident, careless, beautiful, strong, independent); and also what women want, why women are as they are. It is a funny, modern and not masterpiece. The bottom line is that it is worth the money and time to see a veteran and younger actresses teach us all about women.
