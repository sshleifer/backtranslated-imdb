Crossfire is a fantastic film noir, which is also the product of time and timeless classics. This film achieves this goal by solving problems that were not screened before its release in 1947, and by being a high quality movie that holds up to date with a good script, great looks and fantastic performance from its actors . The first American film, based on anti-Semitism, stands on its neck in a classic position. In America after World War II, it develops every time a murdered Jewish man is found. The story is great, its anti-hate theme wrapped in a dark thriller of many-character crimes. and along the side of the anti-Semitic angle is some great post-World War II dialogue and themes as well. Unlike other mysterious thrillers, the viewer is alerted to who the offender is almost immediately. However, the story of the film is still somewhat riveting, because the struggle of all the great characters involved goes through while trying to understand the situation. In addition to a great overall story and themes, the entire script is simply smart, full of meaningful messages and exchanges between razor-sharp characters. The charming story of the film takes place thanks to its excellent cast. Robert Young is fantastic as Captain Finlay, the main murder case investigator. Finlay is my favorite movie character, it's just a great character - dry as a bone and hard as twenty-four and stopping for nothing to kill the killer to justice. Robert Mitchum is also great in the movie, very alive in his soft-spoken army sergeant character due to his excellent screen-presence. Gloria Grahame gives an unforgettable performance in her small Oscar nominated role; George Cooper also does a good job as a sick and desperate Corporal Mitchell; Paul Kelly gives a scary portrayal of a bizarre character; and Steve Brodie, Sam Levene, Jacqueline White and William Phipps also give strong supportive performances. Robert Ryan ended up being the most talked about film performer who gives cool performance like Montgomery while being nominated for an Oscar. Crossfire has an amazing look. Director Edward Dmytryk performs extraordinary work with the execution of the film, and cinematographer J. Roy Hunt manages masterly work with a black and white picture. The image of the Crossfire is dark and dank as its motifs, covered with a shadow with an almost shiny undertone, but also very raw. Ironically, the great appearance of the film was not the result of hard work - or intent. Dmytryk wanted to spend more time and money on actors than on lighting - so he did. Less light, less preparation (around 6 hours a day), and this has resulted in a fantastic looking movie. Crossfire is a great example of a cheap movie that ends in a rich classic.
