I've always been fascinated by silent movies. There is something about how actors and actresses attended 100 years ago. In today's high-tech special effects, I always try to imagine what it was like to watch a particular film at the time of its original release. Helps appreciate the crunchiness of the early film. "The Life and Passion of Jesus Christ" is a very enchanting production of Pathe, originally made in 1902, but expanded and finally released in 1905. Imagine a series of famous religious paintings coming to life, separated by title cards , and you will have a pretty good idea of ​​what a film is. For example, the scene in which Mary and Joseph are resting while escaping to Egypt is almost identical to that of Luc Olivier Merson of 1879 "Rest on Flight to Egypt", right down to Mary sitting on the famous Sphinx. While some might find these "live images" as unimaginable hoofs, I found them to be very charming and very nostalgic. Sets and costumes seem to be outside the stage production of Christ's life. Maybe from a sophisticated passion game of the day. The make-up for the cast is very theatrical, so much that the detail of Jesus is almost comical. Again, where others could bother their kindness, I was quite enchanted. The biggest drawbacks are in the casting changes made at that time. The characters of John the Apostle and the twelve-year-old Jesus change in the middle scene, much to the viewer's surprise! The best unintentional humor of the film is the scene of the Birth of Jesus. The LITERALLY child appears as if in magic in the nursery between Mary and Joseph. Maybe it was just my mind when I looked at it, but I laughed loudly! If only the baby was so easy !!!! Above, the actress who plays Mary looks bored through the whole scene (in fact, through the entire movie) as if this kind of thing is happening every day! My, how the times have changed! <br /> <br /> As this film is so simplistic compared to today, it's really a wonderful window of the past. I recommend! <br /> <br />
