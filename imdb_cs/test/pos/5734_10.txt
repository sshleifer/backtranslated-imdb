I can't believe somebody gave this movie 1 rating !!! And it's just the 3rd average ... What's not to love about this movie? It's original, it has a lot of frightened scenes that actually jumped out of my seat and has some great special effects. The story is fresh, there is some nudity, and that's very campy. The killer was frightening in his own demented way and the end is very unexpected. I have to admit that I love this movie, one of the best Spanish horror movies. If you consider yourself a real horror fan, you have to get there and try to find this movie. You will be so pleasantly surprised.
