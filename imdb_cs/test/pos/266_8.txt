He inherited it from my DVD collection when he left with my best friend (he said enough), watched it one night when nothing was on TV (nothing new there) and I got a very pleasant surprise. Very British (hardly have any budget, no faces you know, you haven't seen yet), the accents were a little thicker for my taste, but after a worrying start (in my case too close to home), it started to grow on me. In addition to some unnecessary funny cutting that really didn't add anything, I found the movie to be uplifting, very real, a natural performance letting me want more from the end that came too soon. Highly recommended!
