I thought it was the most interesting movie JCVD ​​made in a very long time. I loved his character and the whole rabbit thing set a different tone for this movie. IMHO, JCDV can really be something that goes forward. A little lighter kindness, some obvious tribute to other movies, mixed with some great dueling ... I'd like to see this filmmaking style from him. One of the other posters thought the bar scene was a Desperado. I immediately saw the connection of R. Rodriguez, but I thought it was very clever and that I wanted to see the film again to find more subtle impulses from other films. JCVD Rocks !! Other things after reading more comments: <br /> <br /> No music in the dungeon fight? At first I didn't like it at first, but then I thought it was interesting because it got me out of balance by giving us something we didn't expect. It seemed to be real. I also always laughed when directors were crying like two years old that their film was "stolen" from the studio. Directors are paid for work. Studio is the boss and they want the product they want. Very few directors have an absolute final cut on the film. In this case, JCVD ​​is a talent and the only reason everyone is watching this film. I'm sure he got a movie he was happy with. I have a relative who works in a post office who knew something from the story. PRESUMABLY, the director worked on his film. Everyone who saw it said it was a disaster ... then JCVD ​​and the studio edited the movie. This is happening all the time. He also saw the final cut (which he claims he didn't) and his "gentle genius" ego was severely bruised because they hated his delivered cut. If this director was clever, he should take credit for it because it would be his best.
