Dr. Bock teaches in the hospital and is pretty good at it. The point is, he's depressed. Dr. Bock and his wife have separated, his children are deviant, cannot play in the bedroom and feel as if he has not done a good job with the healing people. He becomes suicidal but meets Barbara who changes her thoughts for the better. All around this story there is a mystery of murder and a group of angry protesters outside. The film is well done and the character of Dr. It's kind of sad, somewhat funny and somewhat drama. It was good to see a few stories wrapped around the hospital, though they were somewhat unrelated to what Dr. Bock was doing. Great movie.
