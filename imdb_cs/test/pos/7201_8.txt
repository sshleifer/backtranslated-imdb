Wow! The French will really get it. Looking at their first Asterix movie, we see a good story with nice actors (especially thanks to Gerard Deparde), but a very lame special effect. In a fantasy story like Asterix Special Effects are really important. Well, this time they did it right! It looks amazing. I personally think Cleopatra is the best Asterix story he has ever written. There is not one moment in the movie when you are bored. Go and watch it! One thing! they didn't go exactly according to the scenario, which in my opinion is a little sad. For example, in the comic book Obelix breaks the nose of the Sphinx, all the small warehouses begin to break the nose of their miniature sphinx. (really funny to see) .. But they didn't do it in the movie, instead they buried their nose under the sphinx. Asterix: "They'll never find it here" (guess again). He was funny, but not as good as the original. Another thing I don't like was their choice for music. The film made a film for children. But never less ... It's C! Grz Da Jean Holland
