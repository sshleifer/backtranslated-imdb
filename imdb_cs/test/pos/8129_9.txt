The bedrooms and corridors were one of the most entertaining films of the 1999 Melbourne film festival. Much of the humor is centered around the new-agey men's self-help group where they pass by various instruments like 'rock truth'. They also go for a 'hunter collector' weekend with cheerful results. Trust me, you'll laugh at your teeth.
