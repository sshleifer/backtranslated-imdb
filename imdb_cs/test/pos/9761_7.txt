If you love a book just like me, stop watching the video after Jean and Joe meet in Australia. Until then, it's a fairly faithful rendition of the book and the visuals are great. 10 out of 10 to that point and enjoyed it many times. Then the story is seriously rearranged and revised in ways that truly destroy the key part of the book, ie How Jean creates a city like Alice (Springs). At an early stage, the main change is to Strachan 40-bachelor instead of a seventy-year-old widow. This story of love is rather distorted, especially when there are also small changes that contribute to being more selfish and greedy, such as: in the book, Joe on the ship turns out to be more than a letter waiting for him. Australia, but in the video Joe gives no idea of ​​where Jean is or his intentions. Last hour of 5-hour video scrunches and mangles last third of the book. I don't see any reason to throw in a fight between Joe and Jean - that is quite out of character and it just seems like it's just Aussie digging at Pommies for what he says to them. Then they bring Strachan to the wedding (instead of three years later) - and let the toast read! - very strange, especially in relation to the relationship between Jean and Noel in the film. The whole wedding scene is the invention of the screenwriters. These abominations take up time in the last hour, which was no longer long enough to make justice to the fascinating story of how Jean recreates Willstown as a place where they can both be happy with Joe.
