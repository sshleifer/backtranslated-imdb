Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I've ever seen: much better and deeper than Luhrman's Romeo & Juliet or Spielberg's Titanic. Gerda's love has impressed me every time, her search, her battle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the film. Kay is the poison of the dark forces: temptation. This story encourages me to fight as Gerd for ONE ONE, for the love of my life, for Mr. Right. Patience is one of the key words of this film. I cry every time I realize that the suffering of Gerdy and Kay. And I wish it would end soon ... Snowqueen tells, though my life, I deeply identify with the story and the characters. Thanks at least to Hans Christian Anderson and the director.
