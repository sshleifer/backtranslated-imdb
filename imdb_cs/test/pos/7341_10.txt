Thank you for making such an amazing escape. That's what I love about movies. I am so impressed with aviation, the way they were shot, and the timing was so dynamically perfect with the music. With a dancer, and when I was part of many dance movies, the choreography is usually chopped, sliced, and sometimes even rhythm ..... "Showgirls" movie. The relationship between the ladies has always been so present in the movement. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is last when it's dragged. I saw the movie earlier, another version. This time I was a little sorry for him. It is changing how I feel about female loving birds. It's all so magical.
