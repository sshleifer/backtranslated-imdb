The harsh police detective suspects the French duke that he is the infamous thief of ARSÃˆNE LUPINE. John & Lionel Barrymore played for the first time in the TV series in this interesting dramatic drama. Similarly, and yet so differently, they are a perfect counterpoint to themselves. John plays his part with breathtaking sophistication (when he is not disguised) and Lionel is earthy and ordinary in his portrayal, each of them having a great time trying to deal with others. The result is a generous scenario, the result is quite a draw, with the viewer having a clear winner. Karen Morley, even though she is both male stars, is interesting because of the mysterious woman John finds naked in her bed. Tully Marshall gives a colorful performance as a stupid nobleman with many losses to a criminal master. Henry Armett and George Davis are very entertaining as two seriously awkward security guards. John Miljan provides a firm presence in his small role as a police prefect. The film singers will recognize the unrecognized Mischa Auer as a guide to the Louvre during the climactic scene of the Mona Lisa.
