I love a cute heartfelt movie with a happy ending. This film could be considered a drama, but two characters who realize true love, but the story is so touching and so sweet that it's my romance in my mind. It is true that acting is not so great (it is yi did not give it 10), but they do the job, and they do not overact (thank God) plus they are cute, but the story is powerful and just plain adorable (some of the pansies will choke)! !!!!! its a great watch for a love story but if ur homophobic, STAY AWAY! for everyone else, I loved the movie, its soo sweet! I felt his brokeback was on a smaller scale ... but with a happy ending .... so enjoy !!
