The big thrilling thriller acting is the first speed and action assures you. This well done and directed film is based on a true story and worth it while Joe Penny is cast very well and Ann Gillian is convincing as a worried and frightened sister. Joe proves once again that his acting ability is amazing and well done. It's worth watching, I hope they will repeat it on every channel soon, I'm sure I'll record it. It is worth your time for Penny and Gillian fans. Rent it if you can still try to buy it. Great thriller in the early nineties watch this <br /> <br /> movie is great.
