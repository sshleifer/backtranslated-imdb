I'm watching a lot of movies. Lots of movies. Getting a graduate degree in a film forces one to watch 2-3 flicks a day for years. All this is very exhausting. Mostly because I feel I've seen it all. It's so rare when something surprises me, mostly I hope to see something as good as I expect it to be. The deathbed is so unlike anything I've ever experienced, I actually have to stop the DVD to emerge about its genius. The rhythm of the work is psychotic. It is structured in a way that forces the viewer to stay out of frame. It's not like something like Halloween with all its elegant adjustments and POV shots; The deathbed actually meets such a dreamy. The most obvious way I can say this is Samuel Beckett, who makes a haunted house. I think it's a manic depressive bed that eats people! And fried chicken! Out in the middle of nowhere! And there are bone hands! I can hardly express my feelings for this film. And yeah, copping it liking it will open you to mock. But after a while, things get right. It's hard to be cinephile and consistently stay in touch. I can honestly say that this is a totally unique movie up and down. From what it is, how it got together. We need such movies, movies that will rid us of our satisfaction. Consider it an existential camp. It's fun and it's silly but also brilliant in its strange little things. The worst horror thief ever? Maybe, but at least he's not a masked man.
