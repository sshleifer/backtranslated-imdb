Writer-director Dean Bell offered many surprises and engaging moments in this modest yet convincing road movie. His dialogue was elegant and his use of very short flashback sequences was particularly effective in the narrative structure of the film. The heart of the film is the character of Alice, who runs away from her new England in a desperate attempt to get to Florida. Along the way, she travels with a pair of eccentricists, Bill and Sandra, who strive incredibly to make Alice pay for a prostitute to make money at truck stops. As a newcomer performing in his first role, Emily Grace as Alice is sensational. There is no false comment in the character elections. But the film is especially worth seeing the sensitive character of Sandra, who was masterfully created by Judith Ivey. Every moment Ivey is on the camera, the subtext is particularly compelling. As a viewer, I found that I stopped the tape, beat the rewind, and scanned her scenes to try to discern the psychological subtleties. The film raises the following question about characters: Are Bill and Sandra Good Samaritans, or are they a bad pair of Dickens predators who feed on young Alice? One of the strengths of the film is that it never answers this question completely. Alice seems more confident than her experience with Bill and Sandra. But is he really a better person? A part of the comedy, a partial picture of the journey and a partial addition to the drama, this carefully crafted film succeeds in engaging us on many levels.
