iv was a fan of Rik Mayall and Ade Edmednson since I remember the weather of my young or at the bottom. and I just have to say I never laughed in my life! Pension Paradiso is bloody brilliant! I know it won't be every cup of tea (with vomiting, slapstick comedy, violence and dishonest language), but then just don't look if it's not yours. its not like nobody knows what sick and twisted things, rik and ade come when they work with each other! I think its unfair that this movie has received such a grate from critics because, and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks this movie is 10 out of 10! :)
