I thought Rachel York was fantastic like "Lucy." I also saw her in "Kiss Me, Kate" and "Victor / Victoria", and each of these shows has developed a very different and very real characterization. It's a chameleon that can play (and sing) anything! I am very surprised how many negative reviews appear about Rachel's performances in "Lucy". Even some bonafide TV and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her display. So many people focused on Rachel really not looking like Lucy. My answer to that is: "So what?" I wasn't looking for a superficial personification of Lucy. I wanted to learn more about the real woman behind the clown. And Rachel certainly gave it to us in great depth. I also didn't want to see someone who just "makes" Lucy's routine. That's why I was very pleased with the decision of the producers and directors to tell Rachel Lucy in the rehearsal for the most memorable of these parodies - Vitameatavegamin and The Candy Factory. (Some reviewers don't seem to realize that these two scenes are supposed to be trials and not real scenes). I thought this approach brought innovative sketches that many of us know from the heart. I also thought Rachel was amazingly fresh and fun in these scenes. And absolutely nailed the routines that were re-created - especially Professor and Stupping Grapes. There was one moment on the grape scene when the corner of Rachel's mouth had exactly the rise I remembered Lucy. I couldn't believe she could catch it - and so naturally. I wonder if many people who criticized the show expected to see Lucille Ball "I Love Lucy" around the world. the whole film. After all, those of us who only met her through television would have no idea what Lucy really liked in her early film years. I think Rachel showed a natural evolution in a character that was brilliant. It has given us the right seeds to see the clown waiting for it to appear, taking into account the right situation. Lucy didn't fit into the old studio system. In her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical film star of the era, she was still suppressing what would turn out to be her ultimate gifts. I believe Rachel skillfully captured comedy, drama, wit, sadness, anger, passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sexiness, self-absorption, childhood, and stoicism all in one complex American icon. And she did it with authenticity and freshness that was absolutely cute. "Lucy" was a star bend for Rachel York. I hope this will bring a flood of big roles in the future. I also hope to bring her an Emmy.
