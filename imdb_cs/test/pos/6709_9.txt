A lot of people say the end doesn't make sense, but it did. With a female vampire who was dead, the reference to Earth was broken and the ship took off when she took a lot of Lifeforce from hundreds of thousands of souls. Enough for these hexagon cells to recharge their energy and create new bats. They seem to have no carnal sex, like vampire legends. Vampire bats from the universe can be ridiculous, but killing them with a shot at the center of the heart is consistent. Just consistency is enough. The viewer must suspend distrust, even for scifi. The only problem must be a sword or a strike, not a bullet. This puts it in a supernatural twist that doesn't fit with science fiction. That's a problem. The only major irregularity I have found is killing the vampire men with the sword, but the girls' souls and Carlsen go up to the ship. I suppose the male souls also went up to the ship, but they didn't show. And what all people killed? Are their qui forces ("souls") going to ship as discrete entities, are all life forces merged into one, for use, how does the ship consider it appropriate? In other words, all human souls that went to ship could be reincarnated as bats. The basic concept is no more ridiculous than "War" or even re-incarnation. This movie was up, the kitchen sink (Dawn of the Dead meets Alien meets Dracula), but in many ways profound. It was also a beautiful love story. The beginning and the end were ethereal. It started ("what's happening to me") and ended up being a love story. Most film criticism is about being bizarre. Bizarre is an art form. If it is ridiculous, everything fits. The concept of plague is much more interesting and subtle than strangers who only kill people. Maybe they didn't need Patrick Steward's blood to create an image of the girl, but it was a very distant, unreal scene. Another reason the film hates is the end. But the end fits perfectly into the beginning. People are so wrapped up in a naked girl that they lack the core of the film. It's a lover's story, from start to finish. It starts with Carlsen and the girl on the alien ship and ends in the same way. So it fits perfectly. Most people are fixed on a hero killing a monster and this movie is not over, which is exactly why I love him. Instead of having a happy ending, 2 of them are returning to the ship to be born again. The road colder than the hero kills the end of the monsters, but that's exactly why he bombed. It was not a direct horror or even a scifi / horror movie, but a love story with a beautiful start and end. All those souls flash on the ship. And the crystal room is pulsating with new life. Most people can't deal with a love story that also meets Dawn of the Dead to meet Dracula.
