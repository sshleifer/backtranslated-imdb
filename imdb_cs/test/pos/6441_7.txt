This is the movie I watched when I was a young girl and never forgot. It's definitely not the best movie ever made, but there's something very special about it that I can't give a finger. I love it. I am the kind of person who likes everything that has been explained to me, and that is why this movie has gone crazy. Exactly what / Who is the mysterious witch and what is her relationship with Tom? WHY and how he became a water child ... why was he raised on earth? These are the questions they ate on me! I thought if I read the book, I would get answers, but I read the article that the book that this story is based on is very different. So I'm not gonna know what the writer thought! Nevertheless, I love this movie and recently I watched it with my two-year-old niece. She also loves it, though she insists she calls it "Baby Water" for reasons that are not known to me. He loves the part where he jumps into the water and then declares me to be "pure". (You must understand that my niece is the purest 2 years in the world!) We've seen the scene over and over. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad we can enjoy this movie together! There should be more films like that. (But what about homosexuals?)
