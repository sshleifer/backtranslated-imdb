If you have nothing better to do, then go ahead and rent this movie, it's smart, funny that it will surely pay attention to you. I find it by surfing through boring dunes, it was on the rope, and on the faces I saw, I thought it was worth a try, it made me laugh and for the movie in Sunday with nothing else on TV, it was fine. Liv Tyler looks amazing in the movie, although her performances aren't what I expected, it's kind of bad acting and I like the rest of the crew in my role as Dr. I found an interesting look at a guy from the sitcom "What I Like About You" playing an almost homosexual lawyer. As for J. Goodman, I found it as always a very good performance, Michael Douglas plays a small role, but his characterization was hard for me to identify him. It's also a good movie you're looking at.
