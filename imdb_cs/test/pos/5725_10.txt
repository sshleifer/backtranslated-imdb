Following my personal research into the waiting "end of cycle" time of 2012 presented by the Mayan calendar system, I believe this movie should be seen every bit as well as "What Does The Bleep Know?" While some may believe that top-level issues of science should be only communicated in a doctorate level "talk," the "elegant universe" breaks such obstacles. The visuals and selection dialog box make it easier to understand this walk through the history of physics. There are many messages in this film, the least of which is academic science always ready to revise what is being taught. True, pure science of discovery is beautiful because there is always something more and more exciting to get to the courage to look for it in the face of "established" science.
