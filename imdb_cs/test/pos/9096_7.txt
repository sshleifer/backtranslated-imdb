Originally I was a fan of Tenacious D's first album and naturally I listened to a few songs from The P.O.D. and he was rather disappointed. After watching the movie, my look changed. The movie is pretty funny from start to finish and found my own engagement in it, though it was a really stupid story because of the attitude that KG and Jaybles portray in the movie. Much more fun and entertaining than the movies I've seen in theaters lately. ex. Saw III (dull and tug-of-war), Casino Royale (the way to homo-erotica) that I really enjoyed in previous installments <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed Borat, you'll enjoy the Greatest Band on Earth
