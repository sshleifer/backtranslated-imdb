Extremely good film story of a gay, angry former teen star, now waiting tables. Sexual ambiguities are examined realistically and with a real human face. This, and plunge the serial killer off, and you have LOVE AND HUMAN CHANGES. Well-portrayed drama, a strange sense of humor and mystery. The script is fluent and believable. The performances are significantly above average and the tales in the story are sharp. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not the ideal idea of ​​a movie for everyone, but for those who appreciate something different and writing, it's a lot of time. Highly recommended.
