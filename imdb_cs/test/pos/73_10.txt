Yes, I'm a romantic who likes musicals and comedies, and that's the fact! Julie Andrews gives a fascinating performance at the beginning and end of the film with the production number "Whistling in the Dark". A sedentary-to-inflammatory figure that stands out in the middle of the story when he thinks Rock Hudson has seen a dance / call girl's eye-popping and will definitely make you giggle. <br /> <br /> I just wish this movie could be found in a video or DVD because I would definitely buy it in my home library!
