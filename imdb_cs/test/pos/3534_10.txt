1981's Just Before Dawn is one of the best stories of wilderness horror. It's one of the best 80's puppets and easily blows movies like The Final Terror, Don't Go the Woods or The Prey from the water. Young Adult Group Come and see a mountain property one of the groups has just bought. However, they are not alone in the wild. The shouting killer, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hating scammers. Director Lieberman, who has given us such great B movies as Squire (1976) and Blue Sunshine (1977), has a great job with this clever thriller. The film is pretty atmospheric, with a creeping feeling of tension and strong tension. This film makes the wilderness wildly claustrophobic. Oregon places are beautiful and well captured cinematography. The musical score is a true original and amazing contrast with picturesque visuals. Deborah Benson makes a great lead, her presence was captivating. Gregg Henry performs well because Benson's lover and Chris Lemon provide occasional charisma. Supporting cast, especially veteran actor Kennedy, also quite well. A real gem of the slasher genre that doesn't need any rage to thrill. Definitely worth looking for slasher fans and horror enthusiasts alike. You see it! <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
