I saw this movie in September with my mother. I was expecting a good movie and I saw excellent. This is my most valuable movie now. She didn't leave me when I left the theater. The situation in this movie reminded me of my late grandmother. Meryl Streep and Renee Zellweger were just as incredible. This film made me realize how important family relationships are. Lease. I can't recommend it.
