Okay, when it comes to conspiracy, this film is far from believable and a little stupid. In spite of many shortcomings, however, the film will work - assuming you turn off your brain and let yourself be carried away by its neglect. If you don't, then you don't like this movie very much. In one of the strangest charts of the 1930s, Robert Montgomery plays a guy living near the Arctic. wireless stations. How precisely he came to such a remote base is uncertain, but there is a constant chain of guests coming into this very, very lonely and isolated existence - even though it was years since he saw someone other than the Eskimos. <br /> <br First, Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy arrive when their plane crashes. They are reportedly on their way to Montreal - how they got that far away is out of faith! Reginald is a stupid and boring guy who was really worried about Montgomery because Robert didn't see a woman in a very long time and Owen seems to be in constant fear that Montgomery is for Loy theft. As for Montgomery, that's exactly what his plans are! You will never understand for a long time why Loy is busy with Owen - because he is as appealing as he has wet bread. from the blue AGAIN, Montgomery's old fiancée comes to announce he's there to marry him! Since she had never written and refused to follow him for more than two years, Montgomery naturally assumed that the relationship had ended - but the chipper and annoying fiancée was a sudden arrival to destroy the plans Loy and Montgomery had made. <br /> <br /> As all this is resolved, there is something you can see for yourself. As for the film, the plot is very stupid and fictional - I can't defend it. But it's also pretty funny and charming and I see this movie as a hideous comedy that is just a step or two under contemporary movies like BRINGING BABY. Silly, mild, but also very charming. It is worth seeing, though not particularly believable.
