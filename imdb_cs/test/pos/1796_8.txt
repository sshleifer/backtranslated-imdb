The businessman of the four seasons is a film about the lack of love. The film begins with the main character; Hans Epp returns from the spell of a foreign legion. He returns to his mother, not to be told how much he loves him or how much he is missing; but to be said to be worthless and even worse to favor the man he went with to come back. It is a relationship of character to women that makes this film so hateful; the fact that his wife is taller than him is a symbol of his relationship with another sex; they are consistently humiliated by them, and their relationships with them are not as great as they could be. It also clearly shows how he drinks his wife after drinking. He lost his job as a policeman through lust for a woman and even his wife; a woman who should love him, in fact, has no affection for him. Even in the end, his wife is more troubled about what her and her daughter will do than her husband's condition. The merchant of the four seasons is a totally unpleasant film. There is no scene in the movie where someone is happy, and not just that; but the film seems crazy to be absorbed in the suffering of its central characters. The film is definitely not recommended to anyone who has a hard time at the moment, that's for sure. Despite all the suffering, the film never emerges from the boundaries of reality; Every event in this movie can - and probably - happen, and it just serves to make the film shocking. Of course, the film is supported by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; a cult German director who committed suicide in 1982. This is just my second taste of man, but only two films make it easy to get an idea of ​​the type of art he creates. Both films are oppressed and bold - yet realistic. His characteristic in this film is subtle; we recognize characters only through their situation and not through their character. It is a very clever way to show the audience that it is their surroundings that define people in the film, not the people themselves - and that almost everyone who sees the film knows what lives in the urban society, it is not difficult for most people to be covered by them. The merchant of the four seasons is not a movie that is easy to forget; The film is of a high level and low style, and it is for a very memorable picture, and one that everyone who considers a cinema fan should experience. With this in my mind, I give this film my highest recommendations; It's not sweet and it's not pleasant, but you won't see a more realistic depression view, and that's definitely a movie that will stay with you.
