I gave her seven just because acting is good. And of course I mean Wilkinson. The other two directors were "decent". But the characters themselves ... what on earth was so bad about Wilkinson's character (James Manning)? I didn't see him acting like a martinet Emily Watson accused him of being. Bill Bule, on the other hand, was an unbearable jerk I prayed to meet with an extremely brutal and long-term demise. Who was I kidding? Tom Wilkinson isn't Paul Bettany. So what did Emily Watson (Anne) figure on EARTH? She admitted herself that she was largely offal in his treatment. Why would she even want to be in the same city as he did not say anything about the same "room." witnessing James's tragedy. ??? CO tragedy? You mean the loss of an imbecile who finds someone like Bill Bule. Give us a break.
