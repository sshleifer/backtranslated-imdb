This, which was presented in Italian in Italian cinema (not as bad as it sounds), is a very artistic film and festival film that gives its audience the charm and pleasure. style, humorous humor; the ability to draw comedy from the suffering of others; attractive, cheerful music; spot-on performance; paramount sweetness and humanity - but doomed, due to its strangeness and lack of convincing stories, to make the average audience wonder what they're looking at, and why someone admires it, how it even happened. Andersson gives us almost a whole series of dry parodies. Various topics pass through them. Money: one guy at the next table (Waldemar Nowak) cuts a rich screaming wallet, talking on a cell phone in a restaurant over a glass of brandy, then goes and orders a set of classy suits to order; the dead son calls his famous father away from the complicated congregation begging him for another loan. Reducing worries aloud about his exhausted investments, while his wife beats him into bed wearing only a shiny Viking helmet. Depression: The Basic Teacher (Jessica Nilsson) breaks down in the classroom because her husband called her "The Robber;" carpet husband's husband (Pär Fredriksson) collapses before clients because he told her. Several men have dreaming dreams. But hey - this is Sweden. Isn't everyone depressed? Problems with love: a fat Czech couple is constantly falling apart; girl group has fantasy about lead guitarist, Micke (Eric Bäckman). Wives slam their doors when their husbands begin to practice their tools. (Music is, of course, a unifying theme. In addition to the lively guitarist, there is also a tuba and drummer who is in Dixierland's band playing marches and funerals. the heavy rain, the people in it, the thunder so loud it sounds like the raging on the ground, which also unifies the tone and gives the impression that there are different scenes taking place in the same horrific day. is a master of visual composition and static mid-range photography, and the film has a hazy gray color, and the green look was designed by DP Gustav Danielsson, who is perfect because it evokes the darkness of Swedish winter, but also glitters with the subtle colors of the director's joke that ends every scene with a smile. You almost never knew that roughness could be so beautiful (or maybe one: Alexcanr Sokurov creates such effects sometimes in very different contexts.) Within the scenes and in the film as a whole, there is a kind of silence that comes from the visual style, the stimulation of scenes and the separate humanism. overall outlook. There's something about a fully mastered style that is soothing, soothing. <br /> <br /> Not everything works just as well. One may feel impatient with the succession of barely related scenes, which have read too much sometimes as a Saturday night's live writer's work needing Prozac. Since some scenes simply move or draw laughter, it is clear that others are falling on a small apartment. But some scenes are real zingers and one apparently triumphant peak of pure magic is a dream - described and then visualized dreams are another important thread in which a girl group presents themselves in a wedding dress that is newly she married her ideal guitarist ideal, playing a subtle series of riffs while the crowd of admirers gathered outside the big window. The viewpoint switches to the outside, and the window moves slowly, as if the dream-newlyweds' building looked from a train coming out of the station to take them to honeymoon. It's a fresh, subtle and somewhat noble effect. Finally, one can feel that everything in you (Du Levande) is a dream, including a recurring scene where the bartender always hits the bronze bell. notification of the last order, after which all shooters emerge from their tables and go upstairs to have another drink. An Italian reviewer called it "a small, great movie" and that's true. It is limited by a dozen ways, but there is generosity. Roy Andersson is a small master (like some medieval miniaturist) of Scandinavian twilight comedies, and that's a film unlike others. This year's edition, which was selected as a selection from Cannes "Un Certain Regard", is also a Swedish entry to the best foreign Oscar 2007. It's hard to say what Bergman thinks, but Andersson worked with him; is renowned for its sophisticated TV ads, some of which you can see on YouTube. Bergman called them "the best ads in the world". It will be interesting to see if this director, whose craft is as subtle as his perspective, will start to work in longer segments for some time. Meanwhile, every good movie enthusiast really needs to look at it. <br /> <br /> "Schadenfreude" is not exactly the right word. This means the joy of suffering others. Andersson teaches us to rejoice in the suffering of all of us.
