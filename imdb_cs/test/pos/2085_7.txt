Zachary Scott does what he best, ie, plays a worm, in "danger signal," a 1945 B movie also starring Faye Emerson, Mona Freeman, and Rosemary DeCamp. Scott plays a writer who kills women after he gets their money. On her last murder, she rents a room in a house owned by the Fenchurch family, Hilda (Emerson) and her mother (Mary Servoss). Scott throws himself at Emerson and is brilliant. Mid-romance, her younger sister Anne (Freeman) comes home from a medical treatment. When he mentions that he is Uncle Wade's favorite and left her $ 25,000 (big money according to 1945 standards), Scott loses interest in poor Hilda and plays for Anna. Anne looks like Rebecca from Sunnybrook Farm until she swims with Scott - overnight, 10 years old and becomes absolutely ugly for her sister. Finally, Hilda approached a psychiatrist (Rosemary DeCamp) to send him a message that her tenant was not good. Scott has a great job as a smooth sociopath. It was his forte - as a weak sheriff at "Flamingo Road", he showed no real presence. As for the two times, we saw him in "Mildred Pierce" where he proved to be particularly good at it. Emerson is a book stenographer with her hair off her face and big glasses but after a few hours she is beautiful and gives a powerful performance. DeCamp has always been an underestimated actress - here she has a soft German accent and is beautiful. This is a very entertaining movie that is a very routine story. Acting it really increases.
