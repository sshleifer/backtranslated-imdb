This film is one of the most amazing examples of compelling and refined filmmaking I have seen. Herzog seems to capture the almost transcendent tragedy and beauty of Dieter's story, as well as his personal character. At the end of the film, I wished I had the opportunity to meet Dieter before he was handed over. <br /> <br /> On a technical note, cinematography is intimate and amazingly beautiful. The story is intricately woven, with a great consciousness of the subject and its ability to revitalize and re-activate traumatic events. Few documentary directors have such a strong ability to invest the audience in character. This movie is to be seen !!!
