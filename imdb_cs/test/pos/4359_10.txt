We see at the beginning of Little Dieter the needs of flying Dieter Dengler, the subject of the film, obsessive-compulsive. Or at least it is, by constantly opening / closing the door and with a large supply of food in the cellar. Director Werner Herzog addresses the central question of why Dieter is such. Well, in fact, it's not necessarily obsessive-compulsive as it is, well, ready. And why shouldn't he be after a life that lives? In addition to the mildest, darkest, and exciting and scary, and just downright scary story of survival that is at the heart of the picture, Dieter's back story is also fascinating. Dieter's own childhood, for example, was from the beginning a slogan, in the post-war Germnay, poor in the family without much food or prospects, to eat wallpaper for "blue in the walls". But enter the passion, the unconventional desire (which is, of course, part of Herzog's bread and butter and the love of man in his films) that flies, and there was nothing else for Dieter to do. What ends up leads to more than he could negotiate after becoming an American citizen. a man who has a memory is scarred by brutal memories of his time as a Vietnamese prisoner of war, though at least providing some of the most compelling narratives in every document of the past 20 years. Ironically, narration comes in contrast to Wild Blue Yonder - mostly on a lot and a lot of Dieter's exposures that relate to the most beautiful details of his time in various prison camps (tactics of torture, error, brutal, pathetic violence and threats, as is the case with wedding story), and leading to the most interesting and saddest portions of his best friend Duan. Together they escaped from prisons, but found that their journey to Cambodia would not be so easy. Now, through most of this, speaking does something that is fascinating, which is that as Dieter goes through his stories and occasionally makes re-enactment (in Herzog fashion he could only do, with Dieter already middle aged being led in handcuffs and all through the jungle) one can imagine all this in mind. All this becomes even more vivid when we try to form these little details and the intensity of everything together into reality. It is all the more important that Herzog keeps these portions simple and knows when to keep Dieter in his answers. He's not exactly "normal" at all, but unlike Timothy Treadwell, you don't think you ever think you would laugh at him. So, along with your hero (whether it's war or not, it's hard to tell how Dieter denies that claiming that those who die are real heroes, typical but maybe quite true) , Herzog stylizes his film with a mix of old footage, detailing Dieter's early life (period footage of World War II scenes and post-German rubble). he is always a captivating sight, with Herzog getting into his timing and assembly with music) and capturing Vietnam records in jungle and field aerial views. Herzog is also very wise not to inject politics into the process, there is no "Americans", or anything that is thrown into the mix. There is even a feeling that Dieter does not hold too much resentment with everything that has happened to him, that it is exactly what happens during the war (and of course, he has bombed people on the plane). Now, despite many of these fearsome and even smaller pieces that relate to what's going on in prisons, bathrooms, and food remnants, it's always a terrible luck. One of my favorite scenes in the movie, where Herzog breaks away from Dieter for a moment, is when he shows a "trainee" movie that is used for American soldiers to show what should happen if only the jungle leaves in the jungle. With all the equipment they could have, including a knife, a casting gun, and a very fast helicopter that should be approaching (and that is due to cheerful directional work). But even the moments of laughter just remind us of moments of absurdity in a time of absolute crisis, and how one cannot even imagine what it is like to be alone in a strange territory surrounded by people who will do anything to keep said person as a form of detention in wartime. Dieter, in addition to knowing that flying and airplanes are the only way he would ever want to (and Herzog ends the film in a wonderfully dark, elegic tone where he flies over a large plane of aircraft), knows what it is. must survive at all costs. But just as in many of Herzog's protagonist films, there is an almost unchangeable spirit that will persist if one is strong enough, despite the terrible moments (Dunae's fate) and trouble to rescue. helicopter (he's an American or a spy asking for a helicopter). Dieter is such a man with a ghost, and he is given through Herzog a fantastic, tragic, creative, well-shot, though perhaps too short, tribute to his life. And of course it pumped me even more on the upcoming dramatization of Rescue Dawn.
