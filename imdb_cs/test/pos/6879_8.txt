Notorious actor HK CATIII, Anthony Wong, is on one (well ... not really once - he was a cop in DAUGHTER OF DARKNESS and a few others ...) he's not a psychopathic enthusiast in EROTIC NIGHTMARE. Usually acknowledged for his role as a complete wackadoo in such CATIII "nasties" as UNTOLD STORY and EBOLA SYNDROME - this time, Wong is at the receiving end of ugliness ... <br /> <br /> Wong game guy who goes to the wizard who promises to give him really good dreams, at a price. The conscience of his words, the dreams that Wong involves, have crazy asses sex with smokin 'hot schoolgirls - but dreams come with a price that's more than money. The sorcerer can manipulate dreams and use the sexy spirit to blackmail Wong from his cash and trade, killing his family, and finally killing Wong ... Wong's brother comes to town to find out what's going on, and finally finds out that his family's murder is evil The Sorcerer - But as it turned out, Brother Wonga is the wizard himself, who is very harsh, and with the help of the wizard's abused wife - turns the tables into wizards and his plans. .. <br /> <br /> EROTIC NIGHTMARE is one of the more enjoyable CATIII movies I've ever seen. The bold and dark feeling of some of the other CATIII items, such as RED TO KILL, UNUSED STORY or HUMAN CHOP CHOP - EROTIC NIGHTMARE, is absent, though it is still ugly when it comes to sex and the subject is more "fun" then some of them. more serious movies of the genre. More comparable to ETERNAL EVIL OF ASIA - the more "carefree" CATIII entry that brings a lot of nudity and good gore without being too comedic. Certainly worth a look, especially on genre enthusiasts. 8/10
