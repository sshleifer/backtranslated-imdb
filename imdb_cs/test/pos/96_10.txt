When I was raised in Canada, I saw it many times mostly at CBC. I've seen it many times, in many ways in my life, and every time the reactions are the same. It is a joyful, bitter, beautifully animated film that stretches into the heart. I'm sure I have some VHS tape somewhere around. <br /> <br /> Every child can grow up to relate to the situation, and want them to fit into their favorite idols. The scene and the view of the children face when his mom fills the Eatons catalog and his jumping around the room is priceless. I haven't seen anyone capture this carefree youthful mood on film, just like this little short film. Of course I'm a fan of the Montreal Horns, and that's a special mention to me. But ultimately it's a nostalgic look and feel of a pond hockey, and the memories of your family tell you that you should be great for what you get, even if it's not exactly what you wanted. And oh yeah, the animation is also beautiful;) <br /> <br /> Rating 10 out of 10
