Watching this strange little adventure movie, it's hard to believe it was directed by the same man who brought us such high-quality Giallo classics as The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh and The Case of Scorpion's Tail, but in spite of being low The quality of production, Island of Fish Men is a fun ride and one that certainly deserves more praise than it is to get. Like many Italian films from the 1970s, this is a rip from a successful American movie, this time it is a critically pitched Dr Moreau island. The film by Sergio Martin takes ideas such as mutation, greed and adventure and transforms him into one mildly impressive film that complements what is lacking in coherence and logic with lots of most interesting ideas. The central plot follows a ship that crashes on a small island. It turns out quickly that not everything in this place is normal, and it soon turns out that half of the population has turned into "fishermen" - a cross between man and fish that exist for purely selfish reasons ... <The truth about this film is that it is much more fun to ignore fragile production values. The central monsters look totally ridiculous, and much of the film takes place on files that look like someone's worth a few pennies - but the film is still shot, even though underwater photography is a special highlight and the film is well made in that movie never is bored. The way the conspiracy connects is not exactly a genius, but it takes a lot of ideas and I saw movies on land with much less thought than this. The biggest place in the movie is definitely the lost city of Atlantis. To be honest, I am not a massive fan of adventure films, so I do not see this lost city becoming known - but it's always nice to see it in the movie. The central island location is good at providing apt settings for the story and also providing a movie with the right amount of secrets as Martino makes good use of the voodoo theme. Overall, it's not exactly a classic, and there are definitely far worse kitschy adventure movies outside this.
