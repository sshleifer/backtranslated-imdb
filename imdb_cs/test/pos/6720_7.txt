Like several other reviewers, I am surprised to see many negative reviews on this movie. Dan O'Bannon's earlier efforts were a pioneering "Alien" of 1979. Since even "Star Wars" have introduced the stylistic approach "Used" or "Dirty Space" in the artistic direction for these kinds of functions, that doesn't mean he was the only one the way to make them. Rather than reject "Lifeforce" as a kind of schlock and primitive exploitation, it is important to note that the film draws on the "esteemed" tradition of British horror and science-fiction - specifically Hammer and American international features as Quatermass (specifically 'Quatermass and Pit', 1967), Doctor Who and 'Day Triffids' (1963), if not Gerry Anderson's work ('UFO', 'Space: 1999' and 'Thunderbirds'). But none of these influences would be a surprise if other reviewers recognized the genre-scientific recognition of writer O'Bannon as "the queen of blood" (1966) and "that!" Terror from Space (1958) - Immediate sources for 'Alien' (1979). Granted that this film has some 'legacy' elements, but perhaps it is worth comparing this film with its more immediate peers - 1981's 'American Werewolf in London' and 'Society of Wolves' (1984) - Other 80 movies that share a 'reverse view' while they adapt those stories of the 80s zeitgeist. All three films drew on earlier incarnations of the same but substantially sexed-up themes (because they could), while recognizing language-in-face, humorous aspects of their projects. Neil Jordan's 'wolves' played on many of the psychoanalytic memes floating around during the 1980s, while 'American Werewolf' twisted his theme as 'coming-to-age' film. This is called an artistic license, and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the last day of the drama, which is part of the series "Scream", "I know what you did last summer" and "The ultimate goal". However, these teenage films seem to be part of the trend at the box office, while 80's films as 'Lifeforce' belong to the canon of British science fiction - even though the film was written by an American. In many ways, this film will last much better than the last day of the catastrophe and extraterrestrial invasion ('Armageddon', 'Deep Impact') in that 'solutions' are not in arms. battles, weapons and testosterone. At the far end of the field, it is unfortunate that Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron have not examined Tarkowski and Lem closer than they reworked 'Solaris' ... <br /> <br /> The aim of this film was fun, not stupidity or stupidity. <br/> 7/10
