Decalogue 5 can be considered a violent charge against the death penalty, according to the fifth commandment "You will not kill": it does not accidentally place the concept of the state fully in line with the provisions of the unjust law on the same level as the murderer. "But the law would not imitate nature, it could correct it," says Piotr, a defense adviser, a real catalyst character, "punishment is a form of revenge aimed at bringing evil back for evil without preventing the crime." in the name of whom the law will take revenge? Really in the name of the innocent? â€œ. The horrific and detailed succession of the last half-hour of a man sentenced to death gives the uselessness of a deterrent to the death penalty to intimidate all potential criminals. "Desperate duels do not require desperate medication," Kieslowski says in his message and teaches us how unjust the behavior of disobedience to God's commandment, which judges punishment as well as a crime, can be. There are three different moral attitudes: the innate sense of rebel MURDERER, which aims to awaken enemy torpedoes in the surrounding environment; the strong sense of chronic indifference VICTIM tended to laugh at the demands of other people; the deserved behavior of the DEFENSE COUNCIL is always ready to fight the adversity of fate for the benefit of human life. The struggle for life is ruthlessly revived at all times; the characters are immersed in scenes of suffering and anxiety, in the urban landscape accentuated by greenish tones and seen in their own reflections through the cab windshield. Everything in "Decalogue 5" expresses horrible feelings of alienation and isolation: descriptions of the waste undergrowth of violence and madness, scenes of precarious working conditions, ominous appearance of buildings immersed in an anonymous aura of despair, aimless wandering through a disenchanting environment. The main character is forced to fight a stronger opponent than himself: a city completely wrapped in deep indifference, apparently hostile, deaf to all its muted calls to help, while a faded photograph of a little girl in the first dress of reception goes to bite his soul. She irreversibly directs her steps to the detached path of damnation that is seen through the 18mm deformation. A wide-angle camera lens focused on distorting all details, changing reality, preventing distant and foreign echoes. Kieslowski does not bring mitigating circumstances flavored with melodram honey tones in favor of the accused, differently from some Hollywood stereotypes as "I want to live" (Robert Wise). It does not slip on the banana peel of unnecessary pathetic scenes to alleviate the guilt of Jaz and alleviate the brutality of crime, not interested in close psychological motivations, to justify any manifestations of extreme or violent behavior and refuse to include any unnecessary court proceedings. management. In other words, according to Kieslowski's opinion, "crime is always a crime": according to the "par condicio" principle, the prosecutor will be placed on the same plane as a convicted person who uses many signs or symbols to represent the society seen in the most ominous light. And we can't stay indifferent: although we disagree with him, Jazek's cries of anxiety touch our hearts with kindness in the same way Terri Schiavo's attractive eyes do.
