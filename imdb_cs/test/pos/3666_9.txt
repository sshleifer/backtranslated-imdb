The film is by no means perfect, yet it's very fun and fun to watch. I am the first to agree that Victor Fox is not so appealing and his music and style are quite cheesy. I also agree that the film has some special distractions and some scenes don't work well. So what? If it smiles and you enjoy it? Does every movie make sense? Must every film be perfect? No. One could get rid of the confession that they love this film. Again, so what? It's nice characters, it's well done, acting is mostly good, never becomes too maudlin or dramatic, it's unpredictable. See how many people love the dream of Jeannie. It's perfect? Damn it! And while it's very different, I say, look at it and you'll be in a good mood after you see it.
