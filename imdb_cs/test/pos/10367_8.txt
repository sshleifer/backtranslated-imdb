Richard Abernethie, a very wealthy man, died and his relatives gathered for his funeral. The funeral party is Abernathie's youngest sister, Cora Galaccio. While none of the families saw Coru in at least 20 years, everyone agrees that Cora has always been a little different. So when Cora says something about Abemethia being murdered, most of them laugh at him as one of Cora's idiosyncrasies. But someone is taking Coru seriously. The next day Cora finds herself dead in bed and has been forcibly defeated. Is there a connection between the two deaths? It's up to Hercule Poirot to find the killer. After the funeral is one of the most popular episodes of the entire Poirot series. I've always been a fan of this particular Agatha Christie book, and from what I remember, the film is as faithful to Christie's source material as any of the Poirot installments. The secret is the top notch with lots of tracks, suspicious and reds. And as I wrote before, I always enjoy the story of Christie, where Hercule Poirot collects all together in the salon for the latest revelation. It could be old, but I like it. Beyond, technically and artistically After the funeral is the winner. Sets, adaptations, direction and cinematography are as good as you can find in one of these films. The effect is equally impressive. I have come to expect a pleasant performance from David Suchet as Poirot and will not disappoint. The rest of the cast is equally powerful with Monica Dolan, which gives a particularly remarkable performance. Aside from the little quarreling with quick fire as the characters are introduced, I have no real complaints. It's a good show.
