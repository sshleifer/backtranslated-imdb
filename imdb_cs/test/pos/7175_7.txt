How important is the director? In this film, created in the politically turbulent times of the late 1960s, when social organization issues were major conflicts, he asks this question by making a film that turns the camera into action and just begs to uncover director William Greaves. This is an important work because it shows that no other film shows the difficulty in blocking, organizing and setting up the scene; it reveals the role of the crew, something most directors honestly want to disappear completely and that invisibility is necessary to suspend infidelity; and also takes into account the role of performance and scripting and how they match / do not correspond to reality and what they have to say about how the director ultimately affects reality (if at all). a documentary, or pseudo-documentary, or fictional story (whichever you prefer, through your interpretation of themes) has its brain in an overly educated, overly intellectual staff, its guts in lost performers who He tries to understand the vague and ambiguous directions and his heart in a director who stands as a desire to portray, represent, express without any idea of ​​how to do it or why he wants to do it. It is a film that repeatedly repeats banality just to see if it can become more than banal. It is a film that sometimes shows several shots at once, just to leave the viewers editing and also to reveal how disturbingly the views of the different shots are changing. It's an important job and something that everyone interested in the industry and the process of making a movie should follow and understand. Like many experimental films, it has no real mass appeal - it's not for them. It's for the industry and its for the 60s, asking what to do with the media group effort that still relies on one "voice" and "author". <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
