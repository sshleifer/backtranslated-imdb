This short film aims to address one question sociologically known as cultivated shock. the film presents the state of average Rumuna in democratic Romania, which finds that life and problems are no different from the communist period, and if you want something, you have to bribe to get it. So, our main character is fired after a long time, he is about 50 and needs to get a similar job, but the only available place is one lower. He is forced to marry her because of lack of money. My opinion is that you have to live in Romania to make this film as real and tragic as it seems.
