As a big Dostoevsky fan, I was always disappointed with the humble efforts of Hollywood to get into the Russian Romantic Aesthetics - the case, Yul Brynner as Dmitri Karamazov. I thought the whole problem was a bad casting decision, but then I saw Yula as Major Surov and changed my mind. When he got the intelligent script he was suddenly working with, he suddenly came to life and was so noble, sexy and inconsistent as you ever wanted him to be a neurotic Russian officer! So was Dmitri as Major Surov than Dmitri was. But this is because the writer Tabori actually gave Yul, as a conflicting Russian officer, a kind of conflicting Russian line officer who is worthy of real literature and who have real meaning and pathos in them. For example, the design of folk music, he says wisely, "You hear a man cry in the dark. And if you listen carefully enough, you know what he is calling. You look surprised, Lady Ashmore. , tractors and Marxism are not the only things that Russian interest cares about, it's always time for music. "<br /> <br /> Brilliant !!
