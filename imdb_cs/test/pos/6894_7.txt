A grave robber sits in his cell, awaiting execution, visits a monk who wishes his last words for offspring and as a warning to others about terrible life leads. At first reluctantly, the young grave robber soon tells his story, full of dead, undead, and things he encounters at night, with a tongue-free drink. The New York lens horror movie (shot in part on Staten Island, which has undoubtedly brought Andy Milligan's ghosting ghost) is one of the better horror comedies. This is often a very funny movie that just spins your story in every way. The cast is the first speed. Dominic Monaghan plays Arthur Blake, a grave thief who tells his story. Ron Perlman is the father of Duffy, who the monk took the statement and maybe too involved in the story. Both men clearly have a great time and it shows it. The rest of the cast is just as good. Jeff Grace's music is excellent. The effects are perfect for this kind of ghoulish silliness. The film is a great fun. If there is a problem with the movie, maybe it will fit your network a little wider, so the result is too much. I don't want to give too much, but I don't think we need a foreign body in a mixture. It's still a lot of fun and his first one is sure I'll be back at IFC in theaters where I saw it for the first time, and later I'm sure I'll take the DVD. > <br /> It's worth a look.
