I've been an Amanda fan ever since, and he's still funny. Too much, it's so simple. If you like Bynes, you will enjoy this movie. It's fun and funny. His ugly Sebastian's accent and mannerisms are completely unrealistic, but on some points I almost laughed. And whatever the teen readers of Shakespeare gets (maybe) is a good thing for me. <br /> <br /> On a shallow note, Tatum Channing is quite * ahem * crazy hot. He also does a good job with some of the harder scenes of the movie. Some of the side figures are very wide, but they are wide in "Twelfth Night" so it's fine.
