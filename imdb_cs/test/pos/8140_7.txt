I'm so happy I don't live in an American small town. Because whenever I showed a small town in the States, it is inhabited by all kinds of monsters, among which are hungry zombies, evil aliens and sinister spirits harmless. In this film, a former physician who just took the time to accidentally kill his wife in a car accident directs his steps to the nearest small town - he has never seen a film about small towns in his life - which becomes being purgatory. And, of course, once they arrive, all hell is released. She meets a blond baby who is the most cow-like creature of all creatures in both facial expressions and brain function and immediately falls in love with her. But there's a little handicap, she's already married to a very small drug dealer who gets a minute's shot woefully not dead. If you want to know what's going on, you should watch the movie. I'm just going to tell you that it reminds U Turn Oliver Stone a bit, but it's a way down in all the artistic qualities.
