Biggest effort and finest cast in the film by Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn at the front. Someone said this movie is good because it was directed and written by Tim Robbins, but I convince you that Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon gave me a really great performance that I cried out. Their actions are so real! There is no doubt that this film is rated 4 and 3/4 of 5!
