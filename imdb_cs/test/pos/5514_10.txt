Strangeland seems to have a relationship of love and hate with many of his viewers. I personally loved the movie and everything about it. Action in some places could be improved, but filming adds an atmosphere where acting cannot. In some areas, dialogue is a bit cheesy and dramatic, but really, what do you expect from the late 1990s? Dee did an amazing job of writing what I consider to be one of the most scary thrillers I've ever seen. It plays the fear of many age groups - adults, parents and children. Every parent worries that their children will be too involved in chat rooms and meet strangers from the Internet. And it happened in the real world. And every child and adult are afraid of being kidnapped and tortured against their will; this is also happening in the real world. What is what makes this film so sensitive to many people. My only warning is if you know you're sensitive to things like strong violence, visible torture and gore, then you do * not * want to see this movie. If you're not sure whether this movie will entertain you, then read as many reviews as you can, ask the people who saw who saw this movie, and whenever you should be ready to turn off the movie if you are concerned.
