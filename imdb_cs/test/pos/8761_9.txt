"Traffik 1989" is an Emmy Award that won a six-member miniseries from the UK that inspired Oscar "Traffic 2000". The five-hour film breaks the opium / heroin store for the poppy handcasting viewer in Afghanistan's "sudden rush" of a Mainlining junkie in an apartment in England. Traffik offers not only fun value through interlaced dramatic stories, but also provides an overview of international drug trafficking at all levels, answering questions about who, where, how and why age and unstoppable narcotic supply issues. Synergically fun and educational, "Traffik" turns out to be a time well spent for teens and up. (AND)
