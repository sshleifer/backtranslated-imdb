"Stripperella" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives as a stripper in a gentleman's club known as "Tender Loins" and as a sexy criminal-fighter known as Stripperella, aka Agent 69, who works for the organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and evil forces, such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cents of stores, and makes his two followers share arms. The character creator and series is Stan Lee of Marvel Fame (and creator of Spider-Man). Back at the end of June 2003, Spike TV (then known as The New TNN) premiered Thursday night block of three animated performances. These shows were "Ren & Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoon"; the new adventures of classic children show the characters of Ren and Stimpy for adults, made by the original creator John Kricfalusi, "Gary the Rat"; about a lawyer who turned into a rat of human size, starring Kelsee Grammar of "Cheers" and "Fraiser" of fame and "Stripperella"; a stripper adventure that doubles as a superhero voiced by Pamela Anderson and created by Stan Lee. I remember seeing all three premieres. I wanted to see Ren and Stimpy because I like the original show. I was a little released. It was all right, but he seemed to take things too far; seeing two having gay sex together was a bit too much. Although Gary Rat was not bad, the best of the three was easily Stripperella. The animation was really good, it had an amazing intro song, it had some good talent for it and it was fun as hell! The show was so stupid, I don't even know how to start explaining it! After four five weeks (if not less), the animation block disappeared, which was strange because I know it has a good rating and has been advertised everywhere. I was disappointed when I saw Stripperella go, but a few months later I learned about new episodes that aired at 1:00. All I saw was fun, but it was a pleasure to see the show after that time, something seemed a bit ... <br /> <br /> At the beginning it's a short run, "Stripperella" had a great animation . It was dark, moody, realistic and somewhat sexy. The Stripperella costume also looked good, the figure was well drawn. After a long hiatus and during the rest of the episodes, the animation was very different. Instead of a dark and realistic look, everything was originally really colorful and cartoonish. However, Stripperella received the biggest changes. By the time she had normal long hair, her hair was bigger than Peggy Bundy (Married to Children), if possible. The eye mask now also shows her eyes; Before it was just white, you saw what was awesome because it was more of a superhero. Also, the top of her costume was like a vest with a collar, and the costume was dark blue; It turned into her costume to be a bluish-purple color and her top costume was really lousy looking in comparison. In short, the show was cartoon and very over the top stupid in advance, but the other half became more cartoonish looking and though still laugh-out-loud hilarious, it became more zany as well; for example, there was a later episode about being-beaver ... yes, was-beaver. "Stripperella", instead of complaining about the changes in the series, ran only one season, but it was a very good show. Like the stories from Crypt "Bordello of Blood", it can be really campy, but it's really fun. As long as you don't, you'll find yourself on this show repeatedly. I haven't seen every episode because I haven't received a DVD for two reasons: # 1. Paramount has released and they have this scalloped policy about not including any extras on almost all released TV shows, even though this was the whole show is maby to explain the change of animation and interviews with Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee) and # 2 the amazing song Kid Rock during the opening was replaced. I'm not a fan of him now, but the intro sang the theme for the show! If your don't pay to make some extras, at least pay to make the original intro song you jack-asses. The show also had a few interesting guest stars such as John Lovitz as Cheapo and Mark Hamil as a plastic surgery that hates models. Also Tom Kenny (SpongeBob) was at the show as a strip club owner in most of every episode. Stan Lee also has a portrait in one episode. Breakdown: <br /> <br /> PROS: He had a great look at the first, FUNNY AS HELL, a very entertaining show, great voice talent for the most part, Chief Strogenoff (watch the show and see some the things he does) and was easily the best of the three animated shows mentioned earlier. CONS: Medium series animation change and crappy DVD described earlier. Except that some of the humor may be almost silly at times, I have nothing negative to say about it. TOTAL: Stripperella is a huge guilty pleasure and it's a shame just ran one season. It was a very funny, sexy, iconic collection of cult series that I hope to see air Swim once with intro intro and maybe give it another season as Family Guy. Look at it even if it's on a bad DVD. You will laugh stupidly. <br /> <br /> Rated TV-MA: Raw and Sexual Humor and Boredom, Runtime: About 25 Minutes per Episode, Score: 9/10
