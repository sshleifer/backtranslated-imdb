What a great movie !! It is a moving story about four high school friends who grew up in the sixties. Over the decades, friends have been somewhat separated, but sometimes they admire. There are many tragedies, but there are plenty of happy moments that make you laugh and smile. It is a story of life, love and friendship filled with heart. They must definitely see theater fans.
