Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) is unjustly accused of sabotaging a peg that makes airplanes for war. He goes on the run, meets Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) along the way, and she joins him to find and bring true criminals to justice. There is a lot of things wrong with this movie. Robert Cummings was a good actor, but he is completely wrong in this role; Priscilla Lane is beautiful but she has never been a good actress; The story does not make much sense (and runs longer than needed); it wears its patriotism a little much (but this was done while WWII was in full swing) and there is no ending. It shouldn't work, but it does. <br /> <br /> It's full of bizarre lines and characters that will surely attract your interest. For example: Lane tells Cummings (while they are in love), "I wish I could meet you a hundred years ago" (???? !!!!); Lane BEACHES the villain for getting her lunch, and Cummings and Lane join the group of circuses shortly on the run. Also, Hitchcock's direction was (as always) simply great - throwing in some really amazing shots and sequences - especially the top of the Statue of Liberty. This is not one of the classic Hitchcock movies, but it is still very good and worth catching.
