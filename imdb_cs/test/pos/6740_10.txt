How many of us read the book or saw the game and then, when the movie version came out, we were terribly disappointed? Well, maybe it would be one of those movies for those who also saw the game, but as someone who had never seen her on stage, I was very entertaining with this movie. The characters were funny, the music was great and the story was interesting and you felt real empathy for characters, mistakes and everyone. Jonathan Silverman has such good comedic timing and especially his lines are cheerful. I'm not going to give any spoilers, it's just a nice, funny movie showing the inner workings of a middle class family during World War II. So if you have never seen a game and if you have enjoyed other Neil Simon movies, do not be hampered by several negative reviews that are seen here. On his own, Brighton Beach Memoirs is a great movie. I guarantee it (no money back).
