That was my first movie, Gaspar Noe, which I watched and I must say that I was shocked. I don't mind, but this isn't gore, it's a real butcher shop. For some of you it may be impossible to see several scenes and I mean really disgusting. Leaving these aspects aside, the main ideas revealed here and the dialogue are absolutely brilliant. When you get a strong argument against putting a new life into the world and the way it is given, you can't stop and think about it for a while. The actors did their job well, the general handpick masks were a few people who were at the bottom of a sick society. The film is full of metaphors, but I allow you to invent them. Don't look if you want to have lite, relaxing time. I recommend this movie to all of you who want to think something or just watch something else you find in your average cinema.
