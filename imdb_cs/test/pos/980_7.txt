I saw this movie on my flight from Philly to Denver. The screen was three rows ahead of me and about 12 "x 10". So I really didn't want to watch it. But I like Malcolm in the middle, so I thought I'd just watch for a few minutes. The next thing I know I am sucked in has a great time, and I was glad how good it was and how fast it seemed that time goes by. I agree that acting is very good for this level of entertainment. Being one of the older baby boomers, I was also pleased to see Lee Majors with a role in the film as well as with several other actors who were famous (Jamiel?) "Yesterday" but are out of focus today shoving fun at themselves. It's your basic "child is hurt, the child gets (and then some) and everyone enjoys the process". No hard thinking, no big analysis needed. Just a good fun way to pass the time. <br /> <br /> 3.5 out of 5.
