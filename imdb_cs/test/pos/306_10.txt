Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) was sent on a clandestine mission to Cambodia during the Vietnam War to assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) when he became completely insane and no longer accepting orders. And because Kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces, it is hard for Captain Willard to understand how Col. What could this great man do to the top? Through Willard's long jungle journey to find his goal, he tries with some success to understand why. But what will he do when he finds it? Any movie that can start with The Doors 'The End' is a great movie in my book, especially when it can flow with mood and images displayed with the song. Apocalypse It does it perfectly. I can't think of anything better than it could happen, the Vietnam War and the insanity in the minds of the soliders she created. AN is a dark and brutal story of a long journey through one of the nicest jungles in Vietnam, whose ultimate goal is murder. By using music and scores, we are thrown into the dark world of mystery, violence and madness. The perfect example of how to set your mood with music is this movie right here. Great overall cast, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne, whose Sheen and Brando give us more than enough game skills to spread through our film yearning for bread. I just don't like Fishburne, since I've found out that Cowboy Curtis is in PeeWee's house, my contempt and hatred for this man has grown ten times. I realize the pettyness, but I don't care. We need Gary Oldman sick for him. Brando is great as Col Kurtz and I can't think of any other actor who could play a good man who went crazy and held such a presence on the screen. Sheen is also fun to watch like Willard and we can identify with his interrogation of his mission and war in general. My favorite movie character must be Lt. Colonel Kilgore Robert Duvall. I've never seen Duvalla as a cowboy before this movie, but honestly, it's my favorite of his parts. He simply nailed his character, who is one of the best in the film, as the commander of gung-ho Air Cavalry who likes to surf. Maybe a little over the top, but still brilliant. I also love napalm in the morning. The storyline is quite simple and doesn't take too many brains to figure out what's going on. Willard's job is to kill Kurtz, simple and simple. But it is the path of the film, which is really the heart and also the desperate situation of the war itself. In the Redux version, we are forced to sit on the expanded French plantation scene and on the Playboy bunny scene, which is nothing but a longer journey to film. I don't feel like they're carrying anything, it's just a question of whether you want to watch a three-and-a-half-hour movie or an original. During this journey, the film points to the sheer futility and insignificance of the war against the Americans and the enormous effect it had on the soldiers who fought it ... in fact, it is a whole point. In addition, the soldiers were not supported by the public, and it might very well have helped cause the figure like Kurtz 'to go completely mad. Big War Movie Lover, This Is There With Platoon and The Deer Hunter. Sometimes I try to compare films of the same genre, but in the past I got into trouble because I had to go back to what I said. All three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the Vietnam War .... so to really say one is better than the other, it's pretty useless ... though after the last AN look I think it's a bit better. Finally, Apocalypse is now a true classic in one version and deserves the status that has been given. As a fellow reviewer has said earlier, AN is one of the most ambitious movies ever made.
