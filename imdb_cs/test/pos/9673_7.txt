I own all the family guy seasons so far and I have to say Vol. 6 is the biggest disappointment of all. There's still a lot of laughter, but I think Vol. 6, as well as the last few volumes, laughs slowly and less. At least for me. The biggest anger I had with Vol. It seems very difficult in left-wing politics. I am a great believer, if you can laugh at other people, you should be able to laugh at yourself, but it seems that this volume REALLY throws their political views to your throat and I think it takes far from the show. All the conservative statues raised are terrible places, Encouraging we need more weapons, Insinuated school is under funding, Violent religious people are mad, Bush is friends with the devil .. I could go on and that's just the first three episodes. Certainly, some of them were funny, but it becomes a point where you don't make a comedy, and you really take political views of other people.
