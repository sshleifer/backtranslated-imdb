Often, music videos are completely ignored in any film discussion, and most people consider them to be less artistic. While the vast majority of them are merely spectacular clips that promote the popular latest hit single, rare ones will really grow over others and become works of art (all that director Spike Jonze or Michel Gondry is always worth watching). While "art" is not exactly the word I would use to describe Michael Jackson's Thriller (1983), it is an intensely sympathetic hybrid of schlock horror and music and a tremendously short film that remains remarkably close 25 years later. The 13-minute music video, the longest and most expensive at the time of its release, was directed by director John Landis, a film director I am not very familiar with, although The Blues Brothers (1980) is a classic. and I hear that 'The American Werewolf in London (1981)' is a tremendously entertaining horror / comedy. Whether Thriller qualifies as a music video, it is definitely in the debate, taking into account its extensive length (though Jackson improved this effort with 1997's 'ghosts', at 38 minutes}) and the fact that the title song includes less than half of the total run time. The video opens with a short film in the movie, as Michael, on a quiet and brightly lit night, tells his girlfriend (Ola Ray) that he is "different" than the other guys who turn into a nasty werewolf. part of the night clouds revealed the full moon. As he probably decapitates an unhappy heroine, we meet Michael and his girl in the cinema, actually watching this drama develop in a horror image. When the girl gets scared, they both leave the cinema and start going home, at that moment Michael starts singing the opening lines of his last song "Thriller". But when a heap of bloodthirsty zombies emerges from the local cemetery (their inputs are gently narrated by Vincent Price), the situation is beginning to be interesting. It's hard to put your finger on why 'Thriller' is considered one of the biggest music videos. Can't it just be that the song itself is a lot of fun and Michael Jackson? although he has since become the butt of all comic jokes for his special personality and doings? There is no doubt that he is an excellent singer and performer. Perhaps a decent explanation for the film's popularity is the incredible amount of work that had to go into it; nothing like this has ever been seen before, and in the world of music videos, something special remains. The fearsome monster makeup effects were created by Rick Baker, and are surprisingly graphic for a music clip, though it's all done with a good sense of fun. A few moments makes for some really exciting tension, successfully capturing the atmosphere of movies that is parodying them (though always with a kitschy twist on the usual patterns). Simply put, you will never watch a zombie movie anyway!
