I watched this movie during a special advanced preview in Reading, Berkshire. Michael is amazed to find someone who can finally understand him, because until now his brain pal has made people think he can't communicate. Rory introduces Michael to the life he lacks. Rory is a wild character who won't let his condition (muscular dystrophy) reach him. <br /> <br /> Combine and ask for independent living and find a beautiful apartment and assistant and have fun they could ever dream of. Go see this movie if you're willing to see something a little different. The storyline is strong, the actors are fantastic and despite the sadness that comes with the movie the mood is uplifting. /> <br /> I highly recommend it. Although, if you are something like me and prone to crying - take your tissue as you need it!
