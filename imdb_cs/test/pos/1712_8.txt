Harry Langdon's "Saturday afternoon" is often one of the biggest silent comedies, at least where it is a short theme, and for some of them it may be something like that. Unlike some other acclaimed classics, such as Keaton's "Cops" or Chaplin's "The Immigrant," this film is in some ways a familiar, conventional sitcom movie and does not offer many abdominal laughter; he may even wonder if Langdon belongs to such a rare company. However, in my opinion, it's a totally charming comedy in its smaller-key path, and Harry is fascinating to watch. For the modern viewer raised on television sitcoms plot "Saturday Afternoon" can design Honeymooners or his many spin-offs: two fat guys, one of whom is married and very under the thumb of his wife, trying to sneak up having a couple of good girls for a fun afternoon; But everything goes wrong and ends up having to fight the boys. Sounds familiar? And maybe a little brash? When this film was made, it was assumed that it was already a business, but besides that, nothing about Langdon was typical. He was strange, starting with the fact that he looked like a middle-aged child who slept. Every Freudians who catch "Saturday Afternoon" will have a dirt day with scenes between this shy, pudgy-faced baby-man and his stern, gently domineering mom-wife. When Harry tries to hide the money under the carpet, but grabs it into action and brings it to hand it, you swore to watch the interaction between a six-year-old boy and his mom. . . and maybe that's why Harry Langdon gave some people mold and still does it. But it's a convincing screen, and that's not what it does as it does. For example, in the coin scene under the carpet, Harry finds the coin by placing one leg in front of the other, carefully, like a pedestrian on the rope, counting down his footsteps until he finds the right spot and his technique is hypnotic. Langdon moved like no one else. Whether he makes you laugh or not, the man is fascinating, seemingly in his own world. As for the storyline of his films, Harry is curiously passive and almost never moves the story himself. In the finals of the "Saturday afternoon" when a big fight takes place, Harry's co-star Vernon Dent is in action, but Harry is stunned most of the time and returns to some kind of blow. drunk between two cars (sitting aboard one, but with feet on the other) as they race through the streets. It's an unforgettable picture, and as critic Walter Kerr wrote, it perfectly captures Langdon's personality on screen: it's a passive character who somehow finds himself in the middle of frantic action, blinks sleepily while the world rushes past. It is also worth noting that Langdon and Dent, who have often worked together, have a relationship in this film that suggests that Laurel & Hardy could prepare for the next year when they join. Langdon's style was probably an influence on Stan Laurel, especially here. "Saturday Afternnon" and his star may not be for everyone, but the film is well worth a look, and you may find that Langdon makes an impression that is hard to shake.
