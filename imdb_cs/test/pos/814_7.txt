The story is about a working girl (Ann Sothern) who has a pretty thoughtless friend (Paul Kelly). This friend is so busy trying to start his own business, which is forgetting the data over and over again or appears late. The last straw is when Sothern's birthday and Kelly says he's too busy to take her to the party. So, because she doesn't want to stay home, she goes to a blind day with what turns out to be a very rich young man (Neil Hamilton). Sparks fly, but it also becomes obvious when Sothern shuts down her relationship with Kelly that a new friend Hamilton is "love 'em and let' em" a kind of guy. It is not too difficult to predict how everything is finally settled - all you have to do is say that in the end everything works so well. <br /> <br /> This is a very modest little movie from Columbia Pictures - with a relatively small budget as well as second-level stars. It is obviously a "B-movie", although they are small roles played by Mickey Rooney and Jane Darwell - as they have not become famous yet. Now this does NOT mean that it is a bad actor or that production is not good. In fact, given the value of production, it's a pretty amazing movie because everything seems to work so well, though it has a pretty ordinary and somewhat predictable chart. This is because actors and director did a really good job. In addition, writers did a good job of humanizing and caring for characters. The end, in particular, is really sweet and virtually had my tears flowing! Because of these factors, the film earns 7 out of 10.
