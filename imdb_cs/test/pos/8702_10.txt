the subspecies series will always be the best vampire films ever. There is something that makes them special, I think it's the feeling you get when you look at them. they are set in modern times and yet feel as if they were taking place in 1700 s or 1800`s they think it has something to do with the set that is used, if that's the case Then it works so that it makes a guy. :) <br /> <br /> In a quick round what happened in the first part - Father was reportedly fired from his home years ago by his father and decided to go back and marry what he thought was his birth ritual. Bloodstone and his whole father will kill his father, who is played by Angus Scrimm (tall man from Phantasm). and take a bloodstone that has a powerful power to the one who has it, because who never needs to kill anybody because the stone intends to drip the blood of the saints and every time the Council takes a drop of it, it slowly goes mad. (that's all we need a mad vampire, as if a normal vampire was bad enough). Brother Stephan tries to stop his evil ways while trying to stop to fall with the tourist who is staying in his friend's house / fort. Well one thing leads to another and two brothers clash and well you have to see the movie to see what's going on here in. <br /> <br /> I'll review / comment on the next sequel soon. The difference between this and buffy is excited, it's too commercial, and it's not that it won't appeal to everyone, but it has an atmosphere far better than Buffy, though the Council doesn't look as good as miracle full of Sarah Michelle Gellar :). <br /> <br /> Rating this movie 10/10 A great example of how a vampire movie should be done :). <br /> <br />
