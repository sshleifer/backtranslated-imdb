I absolutely loved this movie! It's my favorite number one. Although there were several shortcomings (what does the film have shortcomings?), This film was very well written, directed and produced. The characters in this movie are very real and believable. All characters fit into a specific role. I think the most obvious thing about "Here On Earth" was the love triangle, as well as the other emotional situations that made it into the movie. It's not one of those movies where you just don't seem to be involved in something because there are situations in which everyone is or has been. There are many different things that happen in this movie, it's hard not to get involved. I'm only 18 years old and I can even cover it. It was a heart that was warming and quivering. "Here on Earth" will make you laugh, scream and sometimes get angry. I give this movie an excellent review and recommend it to anyone who loves romance and passion!
