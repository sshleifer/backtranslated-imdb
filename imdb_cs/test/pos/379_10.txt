This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films and one of his most valuable films. I believe it surpasses 'Psycho' or 'The Birds' for technical art and brilliance. It is a horrible, tense, darkly humorous product that will leave you in awe for some time. Most boys of Hitchcock's villains mums?) Bruno. It's a disturbing, overwhelming performance that illuminates the entire movie. His character is obsessed with, apparently homosexual (look at those who deliberately made bonds and heard them as "European"), strangely charming and dangerous to cross. Farley Granger certainly knows this when he gets involved in Brun's dirty net after the couple meet on the train. Bruno, who knew about inside information about Guy's affairs, proposes two "murderous" murders for each other. Walker kills Granger's slutty, a pleasing woman who defends his marriage to beautiful Anna, while Granger kills Brun's father, whom he hates so intensely. They're all happy, right? Win, as Bruno claims? Poorly. Granger forgets the rude proposal, but does not possess Walker. He commits his murder and is determined to pursue Granger until he completes his deal side as well. 'Strangers' becomes a thrilling, thrilling cat-and-mouse game in Hitch's capable hands. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock was absolutely amazing in creating interesting little characters and building scenes. We have Miriam bitch, Granger's estranged wife pregnant to another man. She lasciviously glides through the phallic ice cream cone while eating Bruno openly with her eyes. Anna Morton, Barbara Morton, is a deceptively sweet but clever and cunning young girl who comes up with the toughest notes you'll hear from the encircled girl in the 1950s. Senator Morton is authoritative and self-absorbed. This is one of the most daring films Hitchcock has ever made, and is typical of the film Hitch, subtly sexual in detail. This fits into the category of film-noir with its focus on murder, lies and fraud and shadow cinema. Walker's nut is one for ages, and Granger is a compelling problem protagonist. Perhaps Roman is weaker than the other two, and I never believed her relationship with Granger. Yet the overwhelming positives are negating the negatives and can safely be said to be one of America's best films ever made. <br /> <br /> Look at what Hitch does - originality, technical skill. We see Miriam's murder in her broken glasses. The tennis game turns into one of the most exciting, intense scenes you'll ever see. The innocent fairground becomes a place of murder and foul. Walker sets off the young boy's balloon (Hitch apparently liked what he saw in 'The Third Man!') The joy of driving on the carousel turns into a gaudy, fast-moving. Hitch subverts normal, everyday events like no other. The camera-work here is among the best ever seen in Hitchcock film, and the premise is to-die-for. It's neat, radiates sophistication and evil magic. The cross-section between the figures of Walker and Granger is spectacular. Granger's do-or-die tennis match is just as important as rescuing Walker's thief incriminating evidence that has been lost in the canal. Hitch rebuild his villain into an ugly, repulsive yet compassionate and strangely charming (Did anyone else think it's strangely attractive, more than Granger?) A piece of work - we're just as tense as Walker in our hope of getting a cigarette lighter . We need it anyway. It is the key to the story. <br /> <br /> After seeing this movie, you'll never see the stranger's approach the same way. <br /> <br /> Amazing. <br /> <br /> 10/10.
