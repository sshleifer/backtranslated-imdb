Lackawanna Blues is a very moving film depicting an era filled with various emotions and characters seen by the eyes of a young boy. The film unequivocally supports "the need for the community to raise a child", and recalls the important time in black history and culture. I got an incredible amount of respect for Macy Gray as an actress. Her character was a little crazy, yet nice; clearly we all knew someone like macy's character. S. Epatha Merkerson is absolutely fantastic as a nanny. I never realized that Epatha was such a big actress. Law and Order has never shown the depth of Epatha's acting skills as Lackawanna Blues. I was pleasantly surprised and overwhelmed! Music and characters reminded me of my own childhood ... it was a sweet nostalgic walk in memory. I really enjoyed the film and wait impatiently for the release of the DVD I will add to my collection.
