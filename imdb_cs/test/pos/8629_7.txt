So I think Bud and Lou just wanted to play classic stories (even if they had some interesting results). In this case, they are watchdogs and Lou is trying to read him "Jack and Beanstalk", but he falls asleep and dreams of being Jack and Bud butcher, and beanstalking to save the prince and princess from the giant (Buddy Baer) . I think my favorite scene was when Lou tried to make a giant omelet and ... well, I'll let you see what happens. Because it was Abbott and Costello, they had some useless songs, but otherwise it was pretty funny. For other interpretations of the classic story, "Bewitched" and "Gilligan's Island" both had episodes portraying it.
