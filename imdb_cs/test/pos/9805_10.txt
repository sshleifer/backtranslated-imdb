I rented the movie and I really liked the fact that I bought it. Elijah Wood (Mikey) and Joseph Mazello (Bobby) are excellent as two guys. Their new stepfather is physically abusing Bobby. Abuse is largely implied, unseen, and has created a lot of passion in me to help abused children. The film has magical quality because the imagination of boys helps them find a way to deal with abuse. You have to try to understand the story from the perspective of the child. I'm still thinking about the end. I watched the film three or four times and every time I was thinking about possible new meanings. I'm not sure what Richard Donner intended to think about, but this is a great movie! Joseph Mazello and Elijah Wood will hug you.
