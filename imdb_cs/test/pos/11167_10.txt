The Life Version of the Later Pope ABC: It was only slightly ahead of CBS and could suffer, but the program itself was excellent. He moved quickly because he had only two hours (also taking time with the ads) to cover this great man's long life, but Thomas Kretschmann was admirable. He did a remarkable job of passing on the emotions and disputes that John-Paul on-unlike the CBS biopic- played a role from youth to old age and managed to seem "realistic" at both ends of the scale. His credibility never hesitated. It has amazing range and depth. It is a pity that the program could not be longer and more detailed, but it worked in the time frame they had, I think they did a great job that brought it to a small screen.
