How would you describe perfection? In the mood for love! Maggie Cheung and Tony Leong practically dance on the screen and give stellar performances that will stay with you several hours after you left the theater. Each scene in the film resonates with a powerful combination of excellent cinematography and image selection, top acting and sensual soundtrack. Nat King Cole sings in French perfectly determines the tone for the whole movie. Maggie and Tony look amazing when Maggie slipped through some really famous cheongsam and Tony always looked faster. I've seen this movie several times and every time I see it, I found something new. I love it!
