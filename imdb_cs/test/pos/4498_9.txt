one of the best and most inspiring films about another culture I've seen in years. tragic and moving. worth the watch. maybe several times. We all know how brutal children can be. From my own and my fraternal experience, I know that children and this film will hit a nail on their heads. perfectly! Kite running is amazing and I need to do research on the validity of this event. Although it is done in CGI it is still amazing and very interesting. Maneuvering a kite of this one-chain type seems impossible, but makes it believable. Likewise, this movie has many twists and turns that are, I'm sure many, probably easy to figure out, but they hit me before I can. which is a great movie for me! when you find that the whole movie in the first 10 minutes is a wreck. but this makes it so smooth it is hard to guess, even if it happens ... I'm a guy and I don't mind tears flowing in more than one place in this movie.
