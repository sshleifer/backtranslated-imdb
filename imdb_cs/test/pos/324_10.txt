Mani sir, as usual, brings another amazing story with Kannathil Muthamittal. Such a wonderful relationship between parents and child is brought out in a beautiful way. Mani, sir, as usual, without great special effects and not much outdoor shoots (in fact it was the only movie he went outside of India sometimes ... that was just Sri Lanka). add to it ARR .. which is just amazing ... Vellai Pookal is one of my favorite songs ever ... Maddy, which is what's in the film industry, has impressed a lot. Starting with alaipayuthey, up to kannathil ayutha ezuthu guru .. Mani ratnam showed the world what Maddy is a universal actor. Simran was good too. She showed that she could act in unusual and character roles. In all the amazing movie. Sadly, the Tamil public could not appreciate this gr8 film and bombed it.
