Errol Flynn's knightly charm in this fun and exciting but historically failed biography of the famous (and some of the infamous) General Custer who follows his career from his first day at West Point, through the Civil War and West to West to sunset. Battle of The Little Big Horn, all for a head shot with rival Arthur Kennedy and romancing nice Olivia de Havilland. Some might say that Flynn, who delivers great, wonderful performance as a general, is basically playing himself with Custer! Rich production (which was supposed to be at Technicolor), directed by Raoul Walsh, is dying with their shoes, contains some really well-staged battle sequences. It's also a real experience to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse. Last year, Flynn starred Jeb Stuart opposite Ronald Reagan George Custer in the Santa Fe Trail (also with de Havilland), another action-packed Warner Brothers production designed to make you fail in the history class!
