"Traffik", despite its name, is not really about drugs. In the best tradition of crusading British television drama, 'Traffik' analyzes and moralizes about his apparent subject, which is not some mythical disaster, but a matrix or process with identifiable social, economic and historical roots, causes and consequences. There is something almost scientific in the way the film takes four sets of characters from the spectacularly separate global and class environment - poppy growers forced into the Pakistani underworld by poverty and cynical government; English, former Olympic swimmer Wife of a drug baron at a trial for trading; two ruthless policemen, whose determination to condemn the other police officers, arise out of class anger as any belief in the law; and the conservative junior minister, whose daughter Cambridge-student became addicted. 'Traffik' is unknowingly didactic - from Jack Lithgow's early scenes in Pakistan, exploring the success of the government in eliminating drugs before sanctioning more British aid, we are bombarded with facts about the problem. But these "facts" come from different sources - postponing government officials; left-wing lawyers with an interest in (ideological and domestic) corruption; poor farmers who need to grow poppies to survive. The facts, normally soothing marks on the map, are clearly not enough - the more facts we get, the less the situation will be. Only after Jack, the moral center of the film, the person who connects all narrative threads, actually travels into the heart of the darkness of drugs, learns to shed his cruel hypocrisy (condemnation of drug use but refuses to give some serious money). conditions, through various free market initiatives where drug trafficking is successful, as well as anti-heroes of old Warner gangster films were actually American capitalists. Thatcher and Reagan) that at least the reality of the problem can be recognized. As I say, "Traffik" is not about drugs. As Jack finally realizes that after being fired as a Tory Minister, drugs are not really a problem. It is a woman dismantled that said that such a thing is no longer (as Jack's non-existent family life proves), systematically prepares the vast majority of people for hope and happiness, with more and more people turning to drugs. The most frightening thing is that "Traffik" is not a graphic, numbing image of drug abuse (whose technical detail ironically reflects the presentation of more "legitimate" verbal factual information), but the Britain vision dystopia free of any joy, beauty or community , desolate wastelands of abandoned flats and soulless modernity, a society of defeatists who are ready to start smugglers and barons. This is not just a contemporary British story - it is experiencing a decline in trade-based empire limited to drug trafficking. It is certainly significant that the other places in the program are Germany and Pakistan, key players in the decline of the Empire. Here, the old imperial immorality returns home, the former enslaved victims, their bodies abused by the powers of their masters, the return to the imperial center of London, the seeds of their decline, literally carried in their bodies, embodying the fear of all those late 19th century Gothic novels. 'Traffik' is one of British television's greatest achievements and is in many ways better than the recent Hollywood remake. The political focus is obviously sharper - Jack's decline is much more effective than Wakefield's because, as a government policy agent, like a bad father, he is largely part of the problem, while America's only real political flaw is satisfaction. Almost in any case, characterization is stricter and much more credible (cf. Lindsay Duncan's Steely Helen, who has already been absorbed by experience and failure, and her unusually superficial counterpart). Unlike the dubious racial traffic "Traffic" (which makes Mexico dark and others; the final WASP horror is sex with a black man), the portrait of Pakistan is richly, tragically drawn, with worrying arguments about drug protection interrupted by scenes of severe violence. An inseparable link between the public and private sectors is an expert. Visually, the film is remarkably resourceful, without ever being flashy or 'cinematic' - especially in the last episode, where buildings and decor seem to move as the system closes. If 'Traffik', like his remake, feels the need for shards of coast, then the prevailing feeling of waste and loss is much more damned, Jack's speech bitterly desperate.
