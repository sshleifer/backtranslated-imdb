I always loved the Muppets. Though most of the children's entertainment was not so likable, Muppet was. Muppet is very, very funny. They are probably the most enjoyable children's characters ever. <br /> <br /> Not only do the Muppets have their own shows. They also played in many movies. of Christmas Carols Muppet on Muppet Treasure Island. Muppet's first film, Muppet, was also, like the show and other films, excellent. The movie Muppet is about how everyone started. Kermit frog lived in a swamp. Until one day, the film manager tells him that there are frog auditions in Hollywood. So Kermit starts to Hollywood. Along the way to many people like Fozzie Bear, Gonzo and Miss Piggy. Also the evil man tries to capture Kermit. <br /> <br /> All Muppet movies are very enjoyable. I think they're all very fun. This film has many film appearances. Like Steve Martin, Mel Brooks, Elliot Gould, Carol Kane, Richard Pryor and Orson Welles. Muppet movies are very enjoyable. I heard Jason Segel will play in one. I can't wait to see it.
