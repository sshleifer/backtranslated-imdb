Challen Cates has a great job of capturing a conflicting bride, torn between the challenges she is waiting for her professionally, her memories of the freedom she thought she would have been if she were in college (inspired by a famous author) and the security of her pending marriage man. She doesn't really love. This film is definitely worth seeing - as predictable as it can be, acting is inspiring and real chemistry exists between Challen Cates and Malcolm Jamaal Warner.
