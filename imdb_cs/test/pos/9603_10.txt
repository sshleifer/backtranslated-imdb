... it might be that ITV wouldn't want to release this absolute classics, because their current series, Mike Bassett, would show up for what it is? When I talked to Mike Bassett with some of my work colleagues, I mentioned the Bostock Cup as a much better offer and I was surprised to find myself the only person in my office that actually saw her. It can't be right for a movie to be the funniest thing I've ever seen. Let's face it, ITV doesn't have the biggest record for making comedy, so you think they'd jump at the chance to at least repeat something that is really funny. Maybe it could be combined with a lucrative telephone contest where we think the coach driver will go on, then it might be of interest. <br /> <br /> Come to ITV, some of us who would like to watch original, quality comedy / drama. Do a decent thing. Repeat it and then get it on DVD.
