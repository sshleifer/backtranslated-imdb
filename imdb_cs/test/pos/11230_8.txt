"It all depends on how you look at it. We're either halfway to heaven or halfway to hell," says Rev. Harlan in "Northfork". The Polish brothers' film is ambitious, allowing every intelligent viewer to sit down if he has the patience and basic knowledge of Christianity. The layers of entertainment that the film provides will take the viewer beyond unreal and absurd images, which is evident from the less obvious socio-political and theological commentary that should provoke an American who is willing to think about contemporary social values. The film has received surrealistic (coffins that emerge from the depths of artificial lakes to float and disturb living, settlers who almost "crucify" their feet on the wooden floor of their homes, angels who need to read more glasses, etc.)) and absurd images ( half of the animals, half of the toys that are alive, the bells that make the most sensitive musical outputs of the harp, the blind angel who holds the written illegible surfaces, etc.) could familiarize the viewer with the surrealistic and absurd tradition of literature and the art of wondering what the film is un-spooling as fun. Although European cinema has better credentials in this area, has Hollywood really made such films in the past? In "Cat Ballou", Lee Marvin and his horse leaned against the wall to take a nap, decades ago. "Northfork," on one scene of citizens leaving the city in cars, seemed to pay tribute to a number of cars in "Citizen Kane", with Kane and his wife from Xanadu on a picnic. The film is difficult for an uninitiated or impatient film visitor - the most interesting epilogue (one of the best I can remember) can be heard as a voice towards the end of credits. The directors seem to leave the most beautiful moments to those who can stay with the film to the end. If you have the patience, you will enjoy the layers of film - if you swallow or swallow what the Polish food eats, you will miss many of its tastes. <br /> <br /> What's this movie? ? In the most obvious layer, the city is freed to create a path to the dam and hydroelectric project. Even cemeteries are dug up so that the deadly remains of the dead can be moved to a higher burial ground. Real estate promoters are on the lake shore qualities for 6 people who can move out townspeople. Of those six, it seems that only one has a conscience and therefore is able to order a soup from chicken broth, while others do not serve them. In the next layer you have Christianity and its interaction with the townspeople. Most of them are devoted Christians, but in many lurking instincts survive at the expense of true Christian principles that are an example of a priest. Many want to adopt children without taking on the responsibilities associated with such activities. In the next layer, you have a world of angels who work with close angelic people and with each other. You realize that the world of an unknown angel who holds a comic about Hercules and dreams of a mother will find in the androgynous angel called "Hercules Flower". While the filmmaker gives the clue that the Flower is an extension of the delicate imagination of a young angel, the subsequent activity of the Flower casts doubt on this possibility. You are truly in the world of angels - not gods, but pure spirit, and not in the living world. The softer focus of the camera is evidence of these shots. On the next layer, Irwin's toy plane becomes a real plane that carries him and his angels to heaven 1,000 miles away from Norfolk. <br /> <br /> The last layer is social commentary? "The earth is divided into two types of people. Fords of people and people of Chevy." Is there a difference? They think they are different, but they are both drinking. For religious, the film says: "Pray and receive" (Fr Harlan's words quoted by Angel Flower Hercules). For the consumer, the film says "its what we do with our wings that separate us" (each of the six evacuators also wings-one duck / goose feathers tucked into their band bands, but their actions are often far from angelic as was designed) based on different car scratch reactions). The film is definitely not the best American movie, but it's definitely a remarkable work that is breakthrough - excellent visual effects, remarkable performances (especially Nick Nolte). ), and a loaded script that offers several levels of fun for mature audiences.
