A child actor certainly deserves a lot of credit. That year was pretty weak for Best Picture. I think "Apocalypse Now" should have taken it, but the Academy probably felt it was too violent and strange, and Vietnam was still too recent. Meryl Streep was great, as she always played a very unlikely character. I usually don't like directors, but I liked it at the elevator door. Grade: B
