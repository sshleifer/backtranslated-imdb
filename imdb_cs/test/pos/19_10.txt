This is one of my three favorite favorite movies. My only argument is that the director, Peter Yates, had too many cuts that showed the actors individually instead of a common scene, but the performances were so great that I forgave him. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are absolutely amazing; brilliant. The screenplay is great, giving a very good picture of life in the theater during World War II (and therefore what it was in the 1930s). Lots of great, gentle touches, plenty of wide, replaying moves, all done perfectly. The scene after the scene blows me away and then there is a peak.
