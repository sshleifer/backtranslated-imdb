Hitchcock's remake of his 1934 film worries about McKenna's famous story of marriage (James Stewart, Doris Day, in the first version of Leslie Bank, Edna Best) along with their 11-year-old son traveling through Morocco during the holidays. They know the sympathetic French man (Daniel Gelin, in the old version of Pierre Fresnay) on the bus. While they are in Marrakech, they also know the couple (Bernard Miles and Brenda De Banzie) and suddenly become the killing site, dying whispering a political message. Then the child is kidnapped to ensure their silence and McKenna gets help from Morocco's Inspector Buchanan (Ralph Truman). This is a great movie about a family that comes across an unknown international conspiracy and then is forced to action by James Stewart and Doris Day. This exciting film depicts the tensions, intrigues, tensions and interesting drama well written by John Michael Hayes and Charles Bennett. He packs an ordinary theme of a tense wizard: innocent people find themselves in a web of intrigues and mysterious, intelligent villains. Color and flash cinematography, shot in Moroccan and London studios by cinematographer Robert Burks, though it was too transparent with the Marrakesh scenes. Common sets of Henry Bunstead, Hitchcock are customary, and work until his recent death. Of course, the most interesting are the events of the famous Royal Albert Hall in London, where Reggie Nalder priests attempt to execute while composer Bernard Herrmann leads the orchestra. In addition to singing Doris Day ueQue sera, Que seraÂ¨, meanwhile her son suffered risks, the song won an Oscar for Ray Evans, Jay Livingstone. The story was fiercely rated for its double characters, but today it is considered a classic movie and quite entertaining. Rating: better than average, Hitchcock's enthusiasm will undoubtedly be a pleasure.
