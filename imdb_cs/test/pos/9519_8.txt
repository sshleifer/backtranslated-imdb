Wow ... it's been a long time since I last saw a jolly movie like this !!!!! I've never been a big fan of French movies, but since I fell in love with the beauty and acting skills of Catherine Deneuve, I've decided to see all her movies ... but I didn't think it was as fantastic as it turned out . Lucky I bought it, even though I had some doubts! This is really a "good feeling" movie with class and quality. There are some great social themes and moral drama is involved that are very close to today's modern way of life, which are shown very beautiful and realistic. I also liked the dance scene in a man's room! But my favorite is rather a shy attempt by Catherine Deneuve to sing ..... it brings it as it is, with lots of grace and modesty at the same time ... very tempting! Furthermore, I would like to express my respect and admiration for the Renaud Line, which played a fantastic role (I didn't even know that it wasâ€¦ I know only her music). So don't wait anymore and go see the movie ... you'll be surprised in many ways.
