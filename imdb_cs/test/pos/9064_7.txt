This film was original in a non-original way. Although many films have dealt with the topic of suicide and mental institutions, it has always been the treatment of patients and their improvement through the help of a doctor, but in this film we watch a depressed guy who falls in love with a suicide girl and stops for nothing to happily, when she doesn't care about happiness at all, she just wants to die. This was a very interesting romantic comedy that was nothing less than a pleasant one. That's fun to look at if you've ever got a chance, just keep in mind the material. Overall, I did 6.4, I just voted 9 to get a rating higher :)
