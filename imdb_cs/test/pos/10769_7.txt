Surprisingly, the Independent Film Channel showed this film one week after showing KARATE BEAR FIGHTER - although the bear movie was the second in the trilogy and this movie was the first !!! What did they think?! While all three of these films are allegedly based on the life of this great master Kyokushin Karate, you can't help but think that this story must have been a little shortened - especially in this first movie. Sure, the guy obviously fought the DID and killed the bull and later the bear (in fact he fought and killed MY bulls during his career), but in this film, which took place in the early 1950s, at the end of the film, the hero actually fights about 60 boys and many of them brutally kill. I can't imagine it really happened. So I did some checks and found that although many details are correct, some of this movie are pure bunk beds! Yes, he killed a man in self-defense and YES followed a widow and her son and spent a year working for them - trying to get them to forgive him. But the end of the movie is great to watch, but the pig. When one of his rivals gets his head in the head and all the other bloody details couldn't happen, otherwise the Japanese government would lock Oyama to protect the company! The movie is fun and the fight is excellent. There are no complaints about action or action. The only small complaint is working with the camera - which is negligent in some battle scenes. Despite this minor complaint, this is the most enjoyable movie. In many ways the traveling karate master theme is quite reminiscent of Zatoichi movies - which are also a lot of fun to watch, but many of them are really impossible. FYI - is an English dubbed version of this movie called "The Champion of Death" and I saw it too. It's not a bad dubbing and it was a letter box (big plus) but I still prefer the subtitle version.
