Does anyone know why this movie is called a trip on the couch? I just watched it and I'm still not sure why this title was chosen the movie was very funny and its probably my favorite performance Dan Aykroyd's even beats his performance Ghostbusters I've never heard of the movie before I saw it in the Sears store I read the back and I thought it sounded good, so I bought it and when I finally got the chance to watch it, I thought it was better than what I had originally expected. This movie awards as good as an animal house and a national lampoon vacation in my mind, I wish the comedy that came out recently have been written, just as this was nothing sad going on in it and the bad things that happened are also funny parts if someone else feels this way and would like to read a comedy movie script that doesn't have a sad situation in sending me an email to killer2511@hotmail.com
