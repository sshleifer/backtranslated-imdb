I freely admit that I didn't see the original movie, but I read the game so I had some background with the "original". If you get rid of the fact that it is a remake of an old classic, this film is smart, funny, fresh and cheerful. Yes, casting decisions may seem strange, but they work. I'm a persistent feminist and I have not touched this film in the least - despite what other women say. This is not a movie for a man to see (so please, ladies, don't pull your boys to see it with you, that's just cruel); women get jokes, situations and relationships. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by the depth Annette Bening brought her ... she did a great job. Debra Messing was lovely and Candice Bergen was fantastic. Meg Ryan impressed me less ... brought emotion to the table, but her comedy shot was less powerful. The whole women's cast is strong and it's definitely a ridiculous comedy. I enjoyed this film very well and I wanted to see it again with my mother. Women will understand.
