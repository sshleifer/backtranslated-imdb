I'm a HUGE Tenacious D fan and I think it's not the funniest movie in the world, but the funniest. It's not a laugh-minute, but that's not what D intended to be. I entered the movie where I saw all the HBO shows, remembered both albums and made it even more enjoyable. Lots of jokes from Tenacious D and HBO shows. Since I already had a new album, I knew 40 minutes of the movie because it was a musical comedy. I would say he has the best first 5 minutes of any movie and the best last 5 minutes of each movie. Hands down. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie!
