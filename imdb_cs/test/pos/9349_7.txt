I've seen this movie more than once. It's not the biggest scifi movie I've ever seen, but it's not a bad movie. Acting is good and the characters are more "real" than most sci fi. (At least it's not full of stupid bimbos like so many other low budget scifi.) I especially like Elizabeth Pena. She's a good actress and she's worried about a single mother, like everyone else and better than some. <br /> <br /> Don't let nay sayers run you. You see it yourself and judge for yourself.
