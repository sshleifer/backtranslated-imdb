A lot has been said about this film and its significant importance in the creation of the film language. If you are interested in film history to truly understand the innovations that Eisenstein brings to the media, you can try to watch Potemkin alongside most of the movies that were made before the D.W. Griffith. Eisenstein should not be allowed to be the only splicing theorist, and the principles of editing would probably be discovered at another time. However, even today, few directors have come close to the skills with which Eisenstein has created meaning through a combination of images at such an early point in media development. <br /> <br /> If you're not interested in this kind of interest, Potemkin is still one of the most beautiful and moving movies ever made. You should see it, buy it and tattoo it in the chest.
