This is a typical Sandra Bullock movie in which she wisely (but profane) plays a woman who has trouble but finds a way to survive and be a hero. Sounds familiar? There's a lot of holes in this story. Things just don't add up and some of the tension is a little scaly. But - that tension is very good. There is a lot of tension in this story that flows through strong paranoia. The story starts slower, but soon starts digging and stays so it's an interesting movie for the viewer. That's why I give him a pretty good rating - the movie will get you involved. Bullock is more cute than annoying, which is usually for me, so it's my highest rated movie with her in it.
