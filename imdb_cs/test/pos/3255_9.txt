Slight Spoilers <br /> <br /> .... and that's the 'top 10 of all time.' Suddenly I came across "Two Hands" (maybe it was all the more strange - no exaggeration) to IFC and I couldn't believe I didn't hear anything about it. Now that Heath Ledger is more famous in the US, I'm sure it's more affordable. At that time I was telling friends about the movie and no one could find it anywhere except the occasional IFC show. Anyway, in the genre of black-comedy / gangster, it's good for my other. The favorites, and everyone in the movie really seems to end up with what they deserve. Bryan Brown is cheerful as the main gangster who makes origami with his little son and plays scrabble with his followers. Also hilarious is a quick-editing fate of a casual car thief. Even Heath was good at it. At that time, I vaguely remembered him from a short-lived series on Fox called "Roar." Hopefully Gregor Jordan will make another hit, but for me it's his best yet.
