I watched this movie with my mother. She is 81 years old and was raised as bigot. It even recognizes it. I don't think she really understood what was happening, she thought she was guilty. Scary. I felt for this child and his family. What torture they went through and remained faithful. This is true faith. Back to the movie. I was disgusted by the police and their disrespect. I am so glad that this Ombudsman was chosen to work in this case. It was very happy for this family to have a man who made sure he saw the bullshit that had been given to him. I could have said when a cop was lying. He wouldn't see the defender in the eye. When he answered the questions, his eyes moved to the side. It is unfortunate that a black man must be punished for the color of his skin. I read a book about a black man pulling them by a truck with three white men. After many years they were finally found guilty. I can't remember the title, but it was the same assumption. White people do what they want with blacks. I'm sure the baby in the movie will be traumatized for a long time, if not forever. I pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and pedophiles are white. No comments from her. I want to commend the director and producer of this film. I feel that the exposure they gave to this obvious injustice was a necessary project. I am a passionate movie viewer. I feel that they are well written and have the essence. I'm glad I caught this movie on the shelf. I felt I had to write a comment because I felt the film and the prejudices that still exist in our modern society.
