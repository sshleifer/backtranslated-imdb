If you value your freedom! First of all, I was really interested in The Branch Davidian's debacle after reading the article in The Fortean Times. When I wanted to learn more, I rented this document and after watching it I was amazed at what I saw. This film culminated in my interest in the subject and since then I have read several books on the subject. This film needs to be seen for people who know the facts, as stated in the so-called "Mainstream" media. False lies, double talks and contradictory statements by officials and politicians shown in this film will think twice about calling people who question government actions in this "purple" looni and "kooks". What is frightening is that I know that some people who consider themselves "intellectuals" and the freedom of loving "liberals" who are still convinced that the government in Waco has done the right thing and refuses Watch this movie, read one of the books on the subject. They still insist that they are not worth their time, because all their propaganda from loving weapons, Clinton hates, religious fanatics, right-wing anarchists. One publication from an organization composed of many so-called "big minds" claiming to support "reason", "common sense" and "rationalism" condemned a film that claims it would poison people's peoples and strongly suggest this film was suppressed. . They even suggested that the Davidians should come. I'm not going to mention his name because I'm a coward. If you are one of those who read it (of course you wouldn't read it anyway), I can only say that it is a pity not to open your mind.
