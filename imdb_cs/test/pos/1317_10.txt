Mishima - Life in four chapters is, in my opinion, the best film by Paul Schrader to this day. Mesmorphic cinematography, accompanied by mystical musical score by Philip Glass, has added a magical aura to the story of one of Japan's greatest writers, whose originality and picturesque story are beautifully rendered in this picture. Like every talented character, Mishima was troubled with heavy self conflicts, the main of which was the conflict between "pen and sword" as the director puts it in his final chapter, or a fight between a sensitive poet with homosexual feelings, living. in a notoriously male society with many years of warrior traditions, thereby deepening the gap between the sensitive and militantly traditional side of Mishima itself. All Schrader's films (and those he wrote) are essentially stories of an inner conflict in a person who does not belong to the environment in which he lives. This also applies to Misha, who, in addition to Japanese military education, is educated with love for theater and words. His demise consisted of both of these key points in his life, it was about words and theatrical ending in a lifelong play. The film comes like this once in a long time and most of them will have to wait a lifetime to achieve this beauty. 20 out of 10 !!
