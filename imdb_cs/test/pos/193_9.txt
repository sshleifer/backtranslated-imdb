The film, as in a circle, leads back to the starting point, the image of cranes that cross the Moscow sky. They represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish, so that we can strive for the fullest possible fulfillment. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Veronica and Boris are enjoying such a promise of happiness, and their eyes follow the path of the cranes with enthusiasm. They seem to live by their dreams. But man is not a bird. Life creates its own rules, of which no one can escape and which we cannot change - not even by making the greatest effort. The war breaks out and without much hesitation, Boris logs on to the front to fulfill his patriotic duty. She can't say goodbye to Veronica because he's late for a rally from which the soldiers are sent away. Surrounded by a joyful crowd, all her attempts to attract the attention of Boris must inevitably fail. Boris finally kills himself in the war without Veronica knowing about it. His brother Mark, an energetic musician who has been freed from military service by corruption, is willing to take his place. Veronica resists at first, but in a terrifying night of bombing she eventually becomes a victim of her spell. There will be a marriage that the family will never accept. Soon, Veronica feels guilty and realizes that Boris's return is the only thing he desires. She therefore releases her bad conscience and despair by sacrificing the sacrificial work in the field hospital. When the war is finally over, a crowd of enthusiastic people will gather again to cheer up the victorious soldiers. Again Veronica is among them, forcing her to pass through the walls of the bodies. She carries a bouquet of flowers in her hand until she finally gives it to the complete strangers, because one of the homes has just beaten up hopes by confirming the sad certainty of Boris's death. Again, cranes attack heaven and stretch. But now Veronica is watching them alone and the look in her eyes is different. She had to accept the impossibility of living according to predetermined plans, following the instructions of her dreams. For all people there is nothing but helpless puppets hanging on the erratic strings of fate. <br /> <br />
