Mr. Bug Goes to Town was one of those movies I grew up with, but the copy could never be obtained. I just watched this movie on DVD and I thought it was a wonderful and charming movie with amazing animation, good conspiracy and great songs. If this movie was made by Disney then the movie would be considered a classic, but since it was made by a little-known film studio that is long gone, the film slipped through the cracks. The film was made by Max Fleischer Studios in their Miami, FL studio and was released through Paramount Pictures. The film premiered on December 7, 1941, the date of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Although this probably made a wounded release of the film, the film did play at some cinema for up to a year as evidenced by doing any research. The film was called the family favorite of most major US newspapers. The film continued to be re-released about every year or so, usually around holidays like Easter, at least in major cities. In the mid 1950s, this film was re-released under the new name "Hoppity Goes to the City," named after the leading character in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film is a true period piece , which captures a piece of America as it was back in the late 1930s and 1940s Animation is great and many characters are very cute.The animation of people in the movie is through the rotoscope process, meaning that the actors were filmed and then the footage was traced through animators, giving the movement a very real look. Fleishcher Studios was one of several animation studios that animated animated films in the 1930s and 1940s while some of Fleischer's characters like Betty Boop, Popeye and Superman cartoons they are better known, the studio's work is more or less forgotten. <br /> <br /> Nearly all of Fleischer's work is in the public domain. All Superman cartoons are public domain, all but one of the "Color Classics" series are public house Ain, and the film "Gulliver's Travels" is also in the public domain. This movie never seems to be released in the US on VHS or DVD, but it was released in Europe. However, some looking around the internet can make a very quick copy. I recommend searching.
