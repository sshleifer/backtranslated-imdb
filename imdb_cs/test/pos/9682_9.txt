"Family Guy" is probably the freest situational comedy he has ever produced. He relentlessly creeps into everything he thinks of him, from television to family drama. Best of all, it's one of the few TV shows that are really funny today. Lois, the mother who is more or less the head of the family, though Peter thinks it is. Chris, a fat teenage son who has as few brains as his father. Meg, the black sheep of the family who is the joke of everyone. Stewie, a child who has plans to kill her mother and take over the world. And Brian, a family dog ​​who is often the voice of reason, but is often damaged. <br /> <br /> "Family Guy" uses many tactics to make the audience laugh. Most notable are the frequent cuts that spoof what was just said. They are effective thanks to perfect timing and how they are played. "Family Guy" uses spoofs to make humor as well, most of the 80 TV shows. What really makes the show so big is that one doesn't have to be familiar with what spoofing is. I'm sure it would help, but the material itself is quite amusing. But the show is not over. Not only does it spoof just about everything that skewers your own spoofs! The show is full of colorful humor. The only reason people aren't in the show is probably because they make fun of every race, sex and other generality as well. There is nothing sacred and no one is immune to the satirical "Family Guy" riots. <br /> <br /> Deploying music numbers in a movie takes a lot of time and effort and is a very big risk. But "Family Guy" has some great songs. All well written and executed, and of course they are cheerful (perhaps the best known, "The Freakin 'FCC" is both catchy and hysterical because it hits the rankings of the hurts). Voice characteristics are right on the money. Seth McFarlane is extremely gifted. He provides voices for Peter, Brian (which is his own natural voice), and Stewie. Not only are voices consistent and creative, can they change their pitch at will, so it seems as if they are being spoken by three different actors. Alex Borstein brings Lois a nasal drawl that's perfect for the character. Seth Green is unrecognizable as Chris (if I didn't look at IMDb, I'd never know it was him). Lacey Chabert created the character Meg, and while she was good, Mila Kunis really elevated the character with her sharp voice. Kunis gives Mega a new, sharper edge she didn't have with Chabert. "Family Guy" has been compared to "The Simpsons" and it is completely understandable (and not just because it is being produced). FOX). They are both satire blue and while "The Simpsons" is good, "Family Guy" has a sharper edge. The show is absolutely fearless. There is no real sacred cow. Disadvantages of show (physical and mental), ethnic groups, TV shows and movies, celebrities, politicians, religion (especially Catholicism), drug use and addiction, sexual humor of all kinds (including S&M), and some that are out of description . Not everything Family Guy throws at the audience, but as a whole, the show is always fun and often cheerful. sometimes too long. Especially with the "unpleasant moment" jokes, the sequences are stretched so long that they not only become funny, but become so uncomfortable (and long) that fast rewinds are guaranteed. These can be effective in about 10 to 15 seconds, but the show sometimes stretches for two minutes. One could argue that the show rewrites its rules to suit the plot, and it often does (for example, Brian often acts as a person, but he still acts as a dog when the story requires it). But this is not a problem because the show is still working. Some people have argued that the show has ceased to be fun. While I agree it's not as nervous as it used to be, I think the fault is on FOX, not McFarlane and his crew. The show came from FOX, but after some dim score and audience participation was canceled. However, selling DVDs was big enough to be picked up by Adult Swim. The show became an instant success, and it was again bought by FOX. However, because the show is so big now, FOX is afraid to let the writer experiment and try new things. Although it is still funny, humor is not so fresh and nervous. <br /> <br /> Be sure to check this show out. It's amazing.
