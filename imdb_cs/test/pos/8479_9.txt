Lecture on the life of tortured magician Ray Charles. His pianos on the piano created a fire and his nostalgic voice created exciting, cool melodies. Every barrier that Ray faced never kept him, and he found his way through the conflicts. A real lesson. A great team of producers helps to rebuild the era and armed with large costumes, hair and settings. The frosty music freezes and the audience with the clever sound cuts out. The most important part of the film is Jamie Foxx. His acting is really excellent, the most diamond polished acting ever seen. He lives his role. He is a ray of light.
