This movie starts badly. The incredibly scaly monologue is followed by a brilliantly executed, really amazing spacecraft crash. Then things get lower again because you realize that all the survivors are a) bad actors (except docking pilot and psychopath) and b) almost all of them are too suited to the role of monster feed. To hell, half of them don't even speak English, preventing viewers from getting to know the characters. You feel as if you are looking at the "Deep Blue Sea" meeting the "Silence of the Lambs", minus good bits. And unfortunately, the whole thing is trying hard to be "Crashed on the Desert Planet with Hannibal Lecter" during the daylight scene. Vin Diesel is a great actor - but he's not Anthony Hopkins, and sincerely bothered as an intelligent hyper-cool psycho. There is at least one very good scene involving an unexpected survivor - but besides that you could also equally cut out the first thirty minutes or so ... <br /> <br /> But then things turn around. I can't pinpoint the moment, but soon the movie gets a lot better. It also feels less chopped - scenes actually begin to follow each other with a consistent story, and Vin Diesel becomes much less annoying and soon he is show-theft. By the time the first monsters appear, the film is really enjoyable. It is great at a time when night falls. Exciting, frightening and exciting. Even the development of the character of most of the main characters is well done. If you can just sit poorly at the start, you're in some great fun. Besides the visuals are eye-candy, and I honestly admit: I love the color and tone of this movie. 7/10 (could be only 9/10 if only ...)
