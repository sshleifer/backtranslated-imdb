I am really impressed by how little fame this movie had. I think it has to do with distribution companies and so on. <br /> <br /> Don't be idiots - if you're looking for good fun, take this movie - this is a very nice movie that goes through a few hours with music being great. It's about ..... even girls and boys and what among them is not too many stories, but not all movies should be PULP FICTION should they? It's nice and cute and gives a good time. The girls are also very good looking and it makes the whole movie even more fun. Why did I give him only 9? The story could be a little more convincing from the center and on. at some point you will begin to see events that are somewhat less reliable. Little boy: The baby cries and the father goes in and tries to relax him. now I'm not talking about a little crying, but no - a hysterical scream and 30 seconds after my father goes out and "baby sleeps" - sorry when and how exactly you calmed and slept and was able to leave his room in 20-30 seconds. but to ignore this kind of little picking because the film itself is not Docudrama - it's fun and that should be overlooked.
