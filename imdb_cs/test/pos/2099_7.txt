Like another poster mentioned by Ch. 56 (a local Boston TV station) showed it several times over the years on Saturday afternoon. They paired it with the first sequel "Return of Ginat Majin". Now I haven't seen it since ... but it never left me. In addition to harsh dubbing and faded colors, it was a pretty good fantasy. Technically, it's not horrible ... until it comes to life at the end of the statue. It's just a village controlled by an evil man. There's a huge stone statue that the villagers pray to help them ... to no avail. But things go too far, status comes alive and destroys those bad guys ... but then it starts after good guys! Good work with some great special effects at the end (LOVED getting rid of the main evil guy). Also there was an enchanted forest that was also interesting. No masterpiece, but an unusual fantasy combo / horror movie. It's worth catching - but not if it's dubbed.
