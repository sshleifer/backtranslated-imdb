It starts a little slower but gives a chance. In the spirit of "Wackiest Ship in the Arm" and "Pink Sub", this film is about a not so orthodox group that does not participate in such orthodox methods to outsmart everyone. Rob Schneider is invaluable as LT, who takes it too seriously, resulting in a failed rebellion attempt and a "pirate" crew force him to walk on a board. In contrast, Kelsey Grammar (like Cary Grant) does not take anything serious except work. This film is more about lines than conspiracy. From the "touted" fisherman in Charleston Harbor to the "whale" bait, their opposites surprised me and laughed aloud.
