He caught this movie as one of the five-for-5 store from the local video store, and it was the most pleasant surprise. It is a collection of four interrelated stories built around four children who have just wrecked a car and are waiting for someone to pick them up. They call each other these stories to kill time, and are occasionally surprised by the flickering lights and funny sounds that all gathered in O. Henry-esque end that left me joyful. A real discovery. Blood (and a lot of it), breasts and beasts will break it all down ... Jacinda Barrett is worth the price of entry itself. This one is a breeder - Jim Bob says, check it out. Oddly enough, "Pumpkinhead" was one of our five choices too, and IMDB recommends that for anyone who likes "Stories of Fire". I'll watch as soon as I get a chance to sit down and watch it. Joyeux Samhain!
