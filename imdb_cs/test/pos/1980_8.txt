This film is breathtaking and stunning. But I think it can only be appreciated by hard RPG fun. It's like a game. One problem is that the plot is too gaming and has too many twists. The distortion is excessive. Jude Law gives a very good performance. I really like it in this movie, like Jerome in Gattaca and Gigglo Joe in A.I.
