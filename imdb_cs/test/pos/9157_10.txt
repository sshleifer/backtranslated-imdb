Hey, you're not alone! I remember Nichols! I was only 17 when it was. I remember James Garner was one of the best actors and Nichols was such a great show. I couldn't believe it was in such a short time, I wish I could remember the last episode, I probably didn't see it ... there was no vcr at that time, so when it was up to you, you saw it and if you missed it the episode it was gone forever, if it returned to summer reruns. Surely it would be great if it came out on DVD, but I don't think many people know about it. Damage. Garner hit him a few years later with Rockford Files and brought his friend Stuart Margolin of Nichols to play with Angel.
