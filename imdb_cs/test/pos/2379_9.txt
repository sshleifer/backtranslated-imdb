My son Adam (5 years old) is a big fan of Scooby Doo. He likes this movie a lot. He particularly liked it when the monster Loch Ness tried to attack Shaggy and Scooby. Voting a score is his choice and reflects his love for characters. When he saw the movie "Vampire Rock" first, this, no wonder, was very similar because they repeat well worn basic plot in different settings. Few adults will encounter this without their own memories of the TV series, and fewer will watch without children. Either you like it or love it. I loved Scooby Doo for half an hour as a child, I'm glad my son loved him, I can deal with it now.
