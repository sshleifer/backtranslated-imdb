I loved this movie! Yes, it is quite cheap and I'm sure there will be a lot of reviews about it. But my goodness, what a lot of cash. It reminded me of Sam Raimi's early work. Yes, it's rough, but it has good energy and a lot of fun. Acting ranges from very good in Scott Ironside and Shawn Paul Hasser, to not so good in some smaller parts. Is it a cult movie? Well, she grew up on me. I liked it for the first time, but I loved it during the third viewing. The film is about 7 out of 10, but I give it 8 for a total face. Anyone who can pull it to eight big ones is worth watching. Almost makes me visit Scotland!
