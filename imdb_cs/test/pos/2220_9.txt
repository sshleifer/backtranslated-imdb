For anyone who has ever sought happiness, "Half Empty" is a must-see. This original multicultural musical comedy has cheerful numbers that make "Producers" seem boring old. Writer Bob Patterson gives his soul to share his thoughts about life, wisdom and happiness, even scribbling inspirational comments on index cards when his girlfriend spills his heart and ends their relationship. When his book on Happiness, "North Star" finds no successes in states, his publishers send him to Germany for a book signing a tour. While explaining their decision to Bob, the meeting room explodes into a lush song that would make Monty Python proud. Since his arrival in Hamburg, Bob's complete ignorance of the German language leaves him at a distinct disadvantage. However, he soldiers, impenetrable his hosts true feelings to him, until a wildly devoted fan arrives and changes the reactions of each to him. The original songs power the film, often describing the story of the story in the accuracy of the lateral division. The cast, led by Robert Peters, shows a perfectly dry sense of humor and occupies his characters as if they were not actors. See: case study on how good intentions are irrelevant; How Fierce Americans Are Perceived Abroad; How little reason it takes to burst into the song, and above all for the stupid, funny, unconventional laughter.
