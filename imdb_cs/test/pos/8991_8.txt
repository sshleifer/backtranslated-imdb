The film forever strong will never be nominated for an Oscar, it will never be nominated for Best Actress for Best Film. But this film has things that other films don't have. In a nation with so many scandals, so many problems, movies are pouring out with little thought on the morale of society, at least this movie supports good. What is wrong with standing for something that promotes happiness? We should support films that tell our American teenagers that there is more life than sexual drugs and alcohol. As for this Haka debate, as previously mentioned, Hakka is not exclusive to New Zealand. All blacks, various football team teams of Utah and colleges perform this ritual before the games. Including Hawaii, BYU etc.
