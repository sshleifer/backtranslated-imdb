If it were two years later, it would be BANNED! Number 1 MUST SHOW THE DAY! Best movie Rouben Mamoulian, which I saw so far (but not yet seen J + H). No wonder why this film received less than 200 votes. Larger greyzone, who couldn't care less about what was right, would not see her again until the sixties. As morally ambiguous and dark as the 1970s, but with some magic. Of course, it must have been low in the last 30 years, and unfortunately they don't seem to be rediscovered. <br /> <br /> Seriously. This has everything. Great actors: Gary Cooper, Sylvia Sidney and this time not so nice Guy Kibbee. A powerful good director. I haven't been the biggest fans of RM yet, but I really liked his films, so he joins a new league. One of the best 30 movies I've ever seen! This is something I never thought to exist! 9.5 / 10
