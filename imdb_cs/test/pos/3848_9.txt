Aristocats is really charming and is rated too low on IMDb. Songs are not as memorable as those in the Jungle Book, but they were not bad at all. The animation is really beautiful, the best sequence is the landscape of Paris in general. It looked beautiful. This is probably Disney's most comfortable animation, as I think, and as another reviewer quite rightly said who doesn't love cats? Another great animated film was O 'Malley, who was looking into Duchess's eyes because their romance was so believable, though it wasn't obvious (a good thing) The story (about greedy servant and wealth, reminds me of Bailey Billions) it worked very well and the script was really fun, especially fighting between kittens. They remind me and my brother and 3 sisters, they always fight. My favorite scene was the persecution of Edgar with two dogs who always fought for the leader. Voice talent was a pleasure, especially Phil Harris, whom I knew from the book Jungle Book and Eva Gabor from the rescuers. Supporting characters, specifically Scat Cat, were also well-executed. Finally, a really nice movie that is definitely underestimated. 8.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
