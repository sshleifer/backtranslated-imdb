What Bergman has here is: "What if bad things happened in Sweden?" And what it gives us in the Swedish language to Swedish actors, in Swedish places (and to use what appears to be real Swedish military vehicles), is what was known from war films that take place in almost every other country in Europe . invasion and anti-invasion, political lies, internment camps, false confessions, summary executions, torture, tropics, "coworkers" and so on. As in a modern story, it is done in abstract, without real names, cities or countries. But stronger factions are "Nazis": they care for themselves and some wear shiny shoes. One even whips things with riding crops (ok, it's actually a cane). The sacrificial couple is called Rosenberg. Except for the shame she feels in finding a dirtier way to survive - and who wouldn't do what they did? - What follows from the above is that the title is clearly intended to refer to Stockholm's actual complicity with the Nazis. What we have shown is what Sweden might look like if Germany asked for more than the mining concessions. The first half plays as a black comedy. We see a "fog of war" from the point of view of a comically passive couple who ignores soldiers all around, long convoys, bombed buildings, news reports, and c. They don't even bother to find a working radio. They are final in "not in my backyard". They talk about wine and cranberries; Meanwhile, mysteriously secret friends and a growing number of soldiers appear in the city. They do not show any curiosity about the war that has been around them for many years. the woman (Ullman) is somewhat impulsive, passionate and outward looking. There is a beautiful scene in which one talks about his violin: the producer, he says, fought in the Napoleonic wars, but his own interest stopped with a cultural artifact in his hand - more precisely, his own warm feelings about his possession and security, which this property assumes. Not in my backyard! But when the war finally falls apart into their idyllic idyll, the man's shyness, the irritation in good times turns into responsibility, one of them ends up excessively - as is often the case - when Bergman demonstrates gently and beautifully. Definitely worth seeing.
