Tempest and his characters (according to which I mean admirable) are like old friends to me. Since I started playing the game through the game classes (I played Ferdinand), I immediately found myself in a fantastic world created by Shakespeare. I can clearly remember one student who decided not to play Ferdinand after all, so I went on stage and had the privilege to play against excellent Miranda. One of the advantages a big friend has is that you can never fully recognize them - there is always something you can discover about their nature. Thus, the film production of the Tempest of Quality is like a visit to an old friend, dear to the heart: every visit represents a person with a new look at the memory we had for work. Prosper's books highlighted the ritual and elegance of the game, the exuberant celebration of art in art. Here we see a vision as an esoteric mystic, with lovingly created interiors full of candles and chalk diagrams on the floors, more Aleister Crowley than a Neapolitan nobleman. It also made me rethink - why was Prospero occupied from Naples? His magical power is so tangible in this production that he wonders whether it was politics that condemned Prosper to exile, but rather the fact that he was different from his peers. So he suffered in the real world. He was driven out, helpless to change wrong to the right. All the villains in this game, whether or not they are aware of it, act in harmony with the creation of a more painful, hellish world - it is always in the interest of the oppressor to bring life on Earth closer to hell. But Prospero can bring these earthly villains to his island, to an area where he has (absolute) domination. Shakespeare brings his audience to the theater, to the area where Shakespeare dictates events, words, results. Shakespeare's, of course, Prospero - but what this film adaptation does really honors the text is to make Prospero so sympathetic to such a figure of reason, despite the fact that it is surrounded by what society calls irrational (astrological texts, alchemical symbols, magical diagrams) etc.). Is it more rational to be a man of substance and murder, or to be a heretic and work to correct wrongs? Prospero is a heretic because he is abandoning his magic, not because books lose their value in Naples, but because they are no longer necessary - the world itself has become the magic of books. In Hamlet, Hamlet represents a game for its peers. The game accuses its colleagues of plotting against others for their own progress. Audience reaction differs: while Ophelia is confused, Claudius reacts with a stunned shock. This happens within the game, and then Shakespeare plays this game for the men of his time. Did Shakespeare watch their reactions? In the storm, the Prospero game is being built and we live with it. How do we react? Do you react with a simple pleasure to a happy ending? Are you angry and shocked by the strangeness of this production, which is completely adapted to the source material? Do you feel sad that this little life, a game, is rounded by sleep, as temporary, how eternal is it? The tragedy is that Shakespeare creates a paradise of reason and hope for the life of mankind on Earth, but man is weak and unwilling to realize him for the benefit of small power struggles. We have Claudiuses. <br /> <br /> Like a good friend, this movie is not without its mistakes. I do not agree with the choice to paint some scenes completely in blue. The sailors dance is more tangential. But in the heart it is really a Tempest, and one of its many faces.
