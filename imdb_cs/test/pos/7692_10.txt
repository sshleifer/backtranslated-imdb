I've seen this movie when I was a kid and I've been looking for it ever since. It's up there with a cabin in the sky, stormy weather and Carmen Jones as they must see in the movies that have shown the amazing talent of African Americans. The 1960s local television station in Los Angeles will have a film of the week and some stations will show the same movie for 5 days. and The Sound of Music are all music classics that you can pick up in every video store. It would be a shame to let this collection of the best talents America has offered, forgotten or locked in a vault. Please make the movie available to the public.
