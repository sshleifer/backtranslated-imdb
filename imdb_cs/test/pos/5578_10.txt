I heard about this series in 2001, which my friend recorded every week from television. I never bothered to watch the series through a magazine I was looking at in bookstores. I recently bought one DVD show and became addicted to this fascinating and original series. The characters initially seem unlikely, but it's amazing how fast they grow and evolve into a unified force. As they take care of themselves, it is easy to take care of what happens to them (given that they are just a TV series and are fictional). But it's not the world for PC Star Trek, and while every character has a good character, everyone has their own mistakes and demons to deal with. Unusual storylines combined with an overall multiple story arc make it one of the most complicated and exciting TV experiences I've ever enjoyed viewing. I enjoyed watching each of the characters interact with each other. This strange new world we are introduced to is brilliantly portrayed by the eyes of the astronaut John Crichton and how he learns and adapts to being on the other side. the side of the galaxy, strange alien creatures, different cultures, hunted by a character who wants him dead and his friends considered inferior, can easily relate to what must be. As accustomed to his surroundings, the audience and his compassionate, strong will and brave character are pleased to watch. I've only watched seven episodes of one Farscape season and look forward to continuing the two-four and mini-series seasons. Maybe one day we can all look forward to season five. We highly recommend viewing and well worth the time to watch. Shop and Enjoy! 10/10.
