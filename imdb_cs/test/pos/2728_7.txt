As everyone knows, 15 Park Avenue is the story of a schizophrenic girl and her half-sister. There are also those who, however it may seem, when it is shown in the film, thinks that the disease manifests itself as the result of some supernatural influence. I think Ms. Sen deserves a lot of praise for "15 Park Avenue". She did a good turn not only for the general public, but also for those involved in schizophrenia ... relatives, social workers, psychoanalysts. In fact, the film helps to dispel many myths and misconceptions about the exact nature of this psychological disorder. I am told that the film is largely based on one's own personal experience with a person very close to her who suffers from this mental disability. To this end, I am sure that none of what has been shown is deflated ... on the contrary, it is a true representation of the facts. The performances are good, whole, as expected. Konkona Sen Sharma, Shabana Azmi and of course Rahul Bose are really very good. They appear as very "real" characters ... trustworthy enough to identify with them from time to time. People may consider me very weird, but I think there are times when one can identify with Meethi! I think that each of us has the madness of madness inside us. Those are the people who are chosen. After all, we don't have all our secret fantasies and dreams? Sometimes impossible? Would we be dubbed "outside our rockers" if people could look into these areas of our mind? Would a person with low self-esteem be considered a schizophrenic because he avoids society ... prefer to live in his own world because that is the only place where he feels safe? Konkona, like Meethi, is excellent! Her performance is so effortless ... her part lives. She has proven her ability to attract viewers and forget the gap between reality and acting! An example is the part where Saddam Hussein's arrest is desperate on the scene that appears on television. Her reaction seems so intrepid and intense ... as if she was really broken in this tragedy! Her Indian English brand is also spontaneous and natural. The same cannot be said for at least several other actors. Kanwaljeet and Waheeda Rehman, both great actors, seem to be fine when talking in English. Their diction is less than perfect ... affected and affected, the fact that they make the most effort becomes more than obvious. Delivering their dialogue is unpleasant and tends to break through the smooth development of the story. I feel that any other incident would do just as well. The point is that something causes an extreme manifestation of the disease. As the psychiatrist explains, one cannot say with any modem of belief or certainty that the rape incident has helped to bring the latent tendency to schizophrenia to the fore. So why are we exposed to a scene where Meethi is bleeding and unconscious. Mrs. Senova tried to make a social statement about the state of politics in our country, where the mass of the masses is silenced by a handful of people who resort to violence to remain in power? If so, the rape scene is justified, but not strictly in the context of the main body of the film. The end seems somewhat sudden. Is the audience expected to find a solution? Where will Meethi disappear? Does Mrs. Sen want us to feel that what a psychiatrist says, which reality is more real and therefore more plausible, is true? In other words, he tries to say that we are not without bias when we judge who is on this side of the subtle line between mental health and madness? I'm not sure. The idea of ​​provoking a film on a whole and well worth watching. However, if you are the kind of person who likes things to be neat and tidy ... all cut and dried, with a waterproof solution for every problem that comes ... this movie is not clearly meant for you!
