Oh, man, this movie is amazing, it's very good, it's a story about a man who doesn't recognize blacks, sits at a bar and sits at night on hippies who are anti-war and how blacks and hippies don't received control. This movie is very realistic because it shows a guy "Joe" who represented a lot of guys then and now too. The story looks like this ... Joe is in the bar shaking his shoulders with a rich guy who just happened to kill his daughter's hippie boyfriend. And this rich goes to the bar to rethink what he has just done, and when he does, "Joe" is in a bar that boasts of hippies and people who are against war. A rich guy randomly tells Joe he killed a hippie; And apparently Joe applauds a rich guy because Joe hates hippies, Amazing movie watch what happens next. I like this movie because it resembled those days in the early 70s, I liked the way the movies were shot in those days, very good things, it's not like today's movies. The film gives you an inside look into the mind of the lead character "Joe". I like the theme of the movie ....... about a working man who beats his ass and tries to make a living
