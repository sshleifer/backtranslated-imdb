This is in my opinion the masterpiece of Clive Barker. The film has a great story and some amazing makeup and effects. One thing I would like to see is the sequel. The film was created to continue, and with improved technology, the second movie could be incredible. David Cronenberg must appear in the sequel, just like Craig Sheffer. But this particular movie was a great original, creative and fun idea and I could watch it again and again. Cronenberg was perfect in this film and Sheffer added an interesting spice to the film.
