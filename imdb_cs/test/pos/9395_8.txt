OK, it's easy that you can't confuse it with the limp movie Stuart Gordon called "Death Bed", which came back a few years ago because this is "The Bed That Eats". And how do I describe it? Well, for beginners, of course, is the bed that eats. It is due to the demon's tears, which obviously affect most things, I think, negatively. The bed is in the quarters of an old servant or something, and is responsible for the disappearance of a relatively small number of people in their time. We have a narrator who is a ghost who sits in the wall behind the picture, and collects all the inedible goodies (jewelry, etc.) that bed passes. He died of consumption, one of the few people lying in a bed that didn't eat, probably because he was sick, theorizing how we see him hacking blood into hankies ... bleah. The thing about this movie is that it's a very special sense of humor, but it's all played pretty deadlock. The film is divided into several "acts", I mean, "Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, & Just Desserts". For fans incredibly strange and bizarre, well, it can just be up to your alley. All I can say is that you have to see that you believe it. 8 out of 10 stars.
