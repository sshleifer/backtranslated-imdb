I saw "The Reader" at the Manhattan Film Festival this week. She touched my heart in a way that made a few short films. In ten minutes he tells an annoying two-digit story that resonated with me deeply. Duncan Rogers did a great job of capturing very real, tender moments on the film. I really admire this film that the director has chosen a story suitable for a short format. These are really interesting characters and their story is told in perfect time. This is not a small performance. We all haven't seen shorts that are simply longer stories squeezed to fit in a format or stories that haven't been properly adapted to your screen? I applaud "The Reader" for doing it right, and I encourage everyone who is interested in film and narration to take a serious look at it. It's worth every moment!
