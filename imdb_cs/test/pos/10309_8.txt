I saw the Bandit Queen in 2005, more than ten years after it was made amid widespread debate in India. Language, harsh treatment and natural behavior (relatively unknown cast at that time) could be even more shocking at that time to the Indian population, who would be more familiar with the fantasy cinema. Film, cast and Shekhar Kapoor deserve awards for breakthrough efforts. The storyline is not much different from the typical revenge of a drama in various forms in India. In fact, there have been several fictional accounts of this particular story itself. The reason it stands out is that it is the first person's account of someone who went through it, and much more that doesn't find a place on the screen, and survived to tell the story. He survived long enough to see her story at least in the movie. Phoolan Devi didn't live very long after he was released from prison in 1994. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in several places. The camera is great. Music is apt. The cast, many of whom later became more famous names, is very good. But the scenario is unclear. Things sometimes move too fast and jerk. However, it is understandable because there are too many sources that need to be combined to make everything coherent. Or maybe I felt that I was reading the book Mala Sen, which is more detailed and better, though apparently not as shocking as the visual description of Phoolan Devi's paths and which is considered to be one of the main sources of the film. <br /> <br /> There are some factual uncertainties. According to Phoolan Devi, she was not present when the Behmai massacre took place, and through claiming to be dictated by the account of Phoolan itself, she is shown to attend, and in fact initiate, the massacre. Then the last scene in which Phoolan surrenders shows how he touches the head of the chief minister, while in fact giving up the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. Only a symbolic value, but shows that Phoolan did not want to show a living to an ordinary person. It would be nice to show the Chief Minister that he has some resemblance to Arjun Singh, who has often remembered CM Madhya Pradesh. These are but small pieces in this superbly made film, a rare gem coming out of the mainstream Indian film industry, made by a man who before it was best known for the ultimate masala movie of the late 1980s - Mr. India.
