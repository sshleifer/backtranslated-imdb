I think anyone who is stupid enough to risk being a wax figure to go to a football game or not wanting to leave their car to "get rid of" deserves what happens to them. That guy, Wade, who "went to the barbershop and asked for a He-Man haircut" wasn't my type, but it's a really cute scene of his eyebrows and facial hair. This is a little too high maintenance for me. Also fun, but not my type is a fat guy in big sunglasses who look like Elton John just gayer, but the whole story is not going anywhere! Blake was hot, I saw him if he wasn't into his girlfriend who is a fake Paris Hilton in a bad wig (there is no Chihuahau in his purse, but that should be really expensive). I don't think girls who look like this go to football matches. Nick car thief is the sexiest one! One of the best parts is where it is a football field, and instead of throwing it back, it lit a cigarette and burned football. See, this is just the kind of guy who is. She has a sister who looks stupid and borrows her white seamstress. Her bra straps are shown for, as well as 1/2 film! Mostly you'll want to just wax your feet and never go to football matches after seeing this.
