Great book, great movie, great soundtrack. In this film, Frank Sinatra shows that he could act when he wanted to put in the effort. The end is a bit schmaltzy, but so far it is understandable that the studio wants a happy ending. The graphic nature of heroin dependence (breakthrough for the period) is a plus. Add an amazing soundtrack and you have one of the great American movies.
