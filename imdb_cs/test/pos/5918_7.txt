Biographical story of the life of Charles Lindbergh, the first man to fly solo non-stop across the Atlantic in 1927, aboard his plane The Spirit of St. Louis. While Billy Wilder's best films do not boast very impressive production values, especially for a film made 50 years ago. The story is well said and the performances are also good, though not excellent. One particular limiting factor for narration is that Lindbergh flew alone and without radio, which meant that he had no one to talk to. This required a few different story techniques such as inner monologues, talking with the fly, and occasional bouts of talking to each other especially once exhaustion sets in as well in order to avoid a prolonged sequence of famous flight, it is scattered with flashbacks from its life and methodical preparation for flight . Charles Lindbergh was a huge hero of his era, but his controversial belief somewhat distorted his legacy. Despite this he would continue to contribute to the aviation field and assist as a civilian aircraft advisor in the efforts of the US in WWII. Jimmy Stewart definitely had a flying background to back up his view of Lindbergh. He rose to colonel rank in American Air Force during WWII and while in reserves after the war would reach the rank of Brigadier General.
