Before I saw this movie, I didn't expect much from him, even though my friend recommended otherwise. Because of my friend's request, I decided to really watch the movie. The moment I sat down to see the movie I was blown away. From the credits I fell from my seat; I just couldn't get it. The film is about Hitler in all comedy glory. Hynkel is an absolute double for a Jewish barber who returns from fighting in the war. Thanks to the barber's heroism, he manages to save one of the Germans and gets on board the enemy who helps in the fight that the Jews had. But things went wrong, and Stolz was arrested, but only then, to escape into the Jewish surburb "Ghetto." As a result of this escape, the German army began to investigate, which meant that Barber and Stolz were arrested, but escaped again, only to be mistaken for the hynek and then took his execution. ***** SOLUTIONS THAT CHECK THE END OF END, IS FANTASTIC, ARE COMPLETED BY MORALS THAT MAY BE CREATED ON THE COMPANY ONLY. THE IT CONTRADICTS SPEECH CHANGES THE FILM WHEN THE SIMPLE AND SINCERENCIES ARE OBTAINED AND ARE DEFINED WORK IF I HAVE CALCULATED A HEAVY NUMBER ABOUT US THAT OUR LIVES WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE LOWEST THAT ARE IGNORANTING SOMEONE ON THE BIGGEST, BEST BEST THINGS HOW ARE A WAR.
