Many people have a movie they think is their favorite movie. My film will always be John Carpenter The Thing! The main reason why this film is a cult film is that it is possible to spray effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin, and this is the film that Kurt Russell made what is today (along with Escape from NY). it is not a great movie for effects, it has to do with story, atmosphere and of course acting. I've watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day for the past 10 years), but none of them has an impact on me like this, or the great "Das Boot". <br /> <br /> Here's My Suggestion to You Who Likes Sci-Fi and Horror Movies: Place in the good chair of your home. Make sure nobody interrupts you. If you do not have a projector, sit down to the TV and watch this movie miracle. Let yourself be absorbed and you'll see it's my way! <br /> <br /> Best time to view: Late February 5 to 9 in the evening.
