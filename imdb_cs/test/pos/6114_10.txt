I can safely say I'm human, Wong. And I didn't fire it. I laughed. And he laughed. If this movie made you throw up, there's something wrong with you. But this movie is incredible. I bought it four days ago and I watched it five times. The cruelty of animals gets my heart, but not so long as I am guilty. The film is shocking, disgusting and vulgar. Negotiations are scary. What else do you want from the movie? I'm an artistic film maniac. Pink Flamingos is amazing. It makes Rocky Horror, as someone said, look like teletubbies.
