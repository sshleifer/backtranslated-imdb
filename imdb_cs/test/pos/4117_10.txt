It was an amazing movie! I want to watch it over and over again. The actors were amazing. The film held me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I wish Lifetime put this movie on DVD. I would definitely buy a copy. This movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get. You may think you know someone, but you never know. Daughter was watching the movie with me. She thought it was great. All I know is that I watch this movie every time life sells it. It's the kind of movie that keeps you stuck to t.v.I wish Lifetime by redo the movie but use the same actors and bring it to the big screen.
