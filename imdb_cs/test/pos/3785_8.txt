This film, as it is now, is much shorter than it was ever released in 1918. In fact, it is now more available with two other medium silent Chaplin features (DOG'S LIFE and THE PILGRIM) released by Chaplin in the 1950s. . On his day, SHOULDER ARMS was a big hit because it is a humor in a unified approach. It's still very funny (Chaplin disguised as a tree, spying on the German, he's so ridiculous, he's hysterical), but he's suffering from being set in his own age. Charlie deals with the First World War, a vile conflict that killed 20 million people, but not the worst war (terrible to say) of the 20th century. Chaplin would have lived such a war, too, and many of her chief architects would have succeeded. But the other one is more accessible to modern viewers because the film is a talking image. Also Hitler as a target for viewers in 2008 seems more important than Kaiser Wilhelm II and his general staff. SHOULDER ARMS was to bring us to the tramp preparation, his training, his use of the trench warfare and his real struggle against the "Huns" in the Western Front. Much of it is now gone - one segment (when Albert Austin is a doctor examining Chaplin in his office in the design center) is still in existence and has been completely shown in the unknown CHAPLIN document. This is unfortunate because the film is now about forty-five minutes long, and these gaps seem to fill the gaps. What remains is the first speed, but one does not want more ... and the feeling that the little thing is being cheated. Previously, he did this in a brief interview with Charlie for the sale of bonds, which gave a militaristic speech before he was annoyed by a tramp with a huge "War Bonds" hammer. Here we see that the hiker succeeds in capturing Wilhelm and the General Staff. It was only topped by Stan and Ollie to capture the German army with a tank and barbed wire in PACK UP YOUR FAULTS. The funny thing is that Chaplin actually had a big crisis as a result of his war activities. He was not a naturalized American - not in 1917 or in 1952, when Attorney General McGranery publicly announced that Chaplin could not return to the US because he was an enemy alien (Chaplin and his family were on the road in Europe - in Charlie's anger he settled in the rest of his life in Switzerland, except when he went to Hollywood for a special Oscar career in the 1970s, because he wasn't an American, he couldn't design the US, so he sold (with Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Mary Pickford) US War Bonds But in the UK, tens of thousands of people died in World War I battlefields, and the public was upset at Chaplin, who they thought was "slacker" and cowardly. Chaplin eventually overcame it, but the remnants of resistance followed him until he died. SHOULDER ARMS as a movie, but it suggests why Chaplin did not make another modern war film until 1940, and a more valuable goal.
