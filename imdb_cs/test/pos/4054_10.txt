I first saw this movie on PBS. Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. Every time I look at it, I can get something else out of it. It is a real proof that he wants to live good, but now the world is changing. But you don't have to be older to stick to the past, even young characters, like Charlotte doesn't want things to change. The overall tone and mood is excellent. The cast is excellent with all stars like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy. And his fun to see the upcoming stars before they hit more recognizable feature films like Kevin J. O'Connor (Mom) and Vincent D'Onofrio (Black Men and Law & Order: Criminal Intent - one of my favorite concerts) . It's just one of those movies that stay with you.
