An apt description of Spock from the omnipotent fop that the Enterprise crew falls into. This was one branch of the universe that our starship would avoid: the first Sulu & Kirk would simply disappear from the bridge; the landing party follows them to the surface of an unknown planet and meets Trelan, a seemingly aristocratic man dressed in clothing from many centuries past. But he demonstrates the abilities of someone or something far beyond the person and does not register with McCoy's medical tricorder. Officers manage to escape back to the ship, but like some bad cosmic penny, Trelane still jumps. It brings them back, including some female company, to continue their games. The dilemma now takes over the elements of the "Most Dangerous Game" in the universe, and there is irritation, even an angry aspect of the total helplessness of the crew against such unbridled force. unforgettable performance by guest star Campbell as an exorbitant but not omniscient alien. His character is probably an early version of Q, which was introduced 20 years later in the TNG pilot series. Trelan's confrontational scene with Spock stands out among all the strange dramas that unfold. As usual, Kirk quickly begins to look for possible weaknesses in his new nemesis, despite being quite outdated. Answers to exactly what Trelane is right in front of us all the time, so when we learn the truth, it's perfectly meaningful with regard to Campbell's perfect acting. He is always engaged, lecturing in front of an unknown audience, noting things that are contagious, but not quite right. Every few minutes his tone becomes sinister and the crew now appears to be in serious danger. You can't tear him off in a way, you always wait to see what he'll do next. Actor John de Lance captured a similar tone to Q on Next Generation.
