I was surprised that I like this movie because I am from "checking my brain at the door and having fun" school watching the movie. But this film touched my heart. I have friends like mentally retarded Emily. I have friends as unrelated Evie. And I was in Evie's shoes, casting the opportunity out of fear and loyalty to others. Disappointing Amy Madigan in her daughters was almost palpable on the screen and the uncomfortable moment she was trying to bridge the gap with Evie was crude and painful to watch. And maybe I'm denser than most, but I've never seen Evie's father appear. I usually get these cotton things quite quickly. <br /> <br /> My bookings are similar to others posted here. I thought Christopher Lloyd was a wonderful, sympathetic character (a very different role for him, I thought) was underused. What happened to him when he realized what was going on with poetry? Would he, like James, try again? Second, it seemed that the end, as it was, would not solve or do anything. I didn't expect the bits to rise, and all the ends would be neatly tied, but I felt that I was in conflict with the characters that there was no real healing or any real healing effort. Br /> <br /> Otherwise, excellent and lyrical and intrusive and for some very, very true.
