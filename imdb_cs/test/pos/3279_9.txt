I thank Mario Van Peebles for informing us not only about the existence of black cowboys but also about the fact that it is a convincing story that can be easily followed. It was great that you used so many African American artists to tell the story of a black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Does a good kid ever play? <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to expand their way of thinking. It's an excellent movie and I feel privileged to see it. Hopefully you will feel the same way.
