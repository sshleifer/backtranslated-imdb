I saw this movie at a special screening. At first I thought the movie would be like a typical Amanda Bynes movie, but I was wrong. The film is based on Shakespeare's The Twelth Night This film tells the story of a girl who lives playing football. Well, when a girl's team is shortened, they have to go to great lengths to get into a team of boys in another school to avenge the team of Egyptian boys in their old school. On her journey she finds herself in a long, intricate network of love, lies and deceit. This movie is this year's Mean Girls. I think it shows some great new actors skills and there are defiantly some big stars to be featured in this movie.
