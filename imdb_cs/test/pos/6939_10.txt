Governments are elected for three years by terms, as Reg Whithers said in 1973, Liberals were determined to continue to force Labor to vote until they were defeated. If you ask me, this is portrayed in the docuudrama, but anyone who says Kerr has acted correctly does not recognize the self-service and costly strategy of Liberal Party Australia. On the show, though Max Phipps was a poor Whitlam, his voice was too scary. More key political actors on both sides should also be used, although this could reflect the budgetary constraints at that time. However, I recommend it with caution.
