John and his wife, Emily, accompanied by her child Edward, set out from the pleasant suburbs to the village where her husband spent part of his childhood. There was death in the family, and John had to start the proceedings to take control of the old shack, which is located by the sea and once inhabited by an old man who apparently committed suicide. Skeptical about the circumstances of death, John divorces himself from his family and from reality, puts his life in danger and puts on the clothes of an old man who is now dead. The film is now changing - nothing is what it seems - the people of his past appear in full Gothic / hilly fame - his wife fears for his mental state - and his son disappears into the reeds. John found that the old man did not commit suicide, that his death was much more mysterious and strange. In the final of the chill chilling we learned that the film's events had never really happened and that the little boy Edward, who was trying to cope with his parents' divorce proceedings, had imagined the whole story. Modern Love is a mysterious piece of high art cinema, a mysterious and perverted piece of arrogance, full of vague designs and unexplored red-yellow sequences. It is without humor and seemingly does not concern contemporary Indian trends, which both confirm its creators, but it also makes pass√©. But the weakness of this Australian film is far outweighed by its sheer muscular film vision, its bloody, easy-going, uncompromising accuracy, and its strange Euro horror. The Bardardia of Scenario Standards and the lack of smooth dialogue remain insignificant in the background of the noir background and the leadership that needs to be seen to be appreciated. One of the most aggressive Australian movies ever.
