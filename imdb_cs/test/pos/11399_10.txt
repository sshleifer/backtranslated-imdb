One of the things I like about PT Anderson is that she has the courage to make a talent that most people push to the side or push to the side and make them stars. Case on the spot, washed out ... Burt Reynolds brings great performance in this movie. And if you can prove that Adam Sander can be a great actor (Punch Drunk Love) wasn't enough ... Mark Whalburg will come ... like you've never seen before. I think many people go upstairs "Boogie Nights" cause them to be anti-porn or just hate the adult industry and can't overlook this aspect of this movie. But below that is a great story about the characters who lose everything and fight to regain it. There's a beautiful movie ... and it's too bad to see enough people.
