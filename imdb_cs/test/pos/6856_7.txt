"Anatomy" is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. I don't think "Anatomy" was primarily intended as a horror movie, but a film challenging the ethics of science. If you look at it with knowledge, it turns into a really good movie. The only unpleasant piece was the horrible dubbing for the English version. How can you expect one of the Germans to listen to these intolerable German accents for two hours? Let native English speakers speak or use subtitles instead !!
