Beat was an exciting movie about a couple of young punks trying to survive in 1980 in New York. This includes fighting with another street gang that directly shares high school s, trying to stay at school as well as go to local shows that include bands that look like Dead Kennedy and have the name Skulls for their band name. Rex (played by David Jacobson) He plays an autistic boy who begins to have a long life with all these species, and begins to show them that poetry is really beautiful, and if it applies to what these kids do in life, it can do things. for better! Billy Kane (played by William McNamara) and Kate Kane (played by Kara Glover) are brother and sister. Though they roll with this crowd of criminals, these children are not the same type of people as this group. They care about Rex and take care of others, and they really show the enlightened side of themselves. While his sister sleeps with the head of the Gang, he falls in love with Rex and tries to show him he is not a whore. Finally, at school, teachers finally get to him and want to place him in a psychiatric hospital, finally feeling it is time to end their lives while the sound animals were playing without it. But they like to think he is not dead, that he lives all his life, riding sharks, and that he is happy to live in the ocean. This movie was one of those movies where I was glad to watch him. Although it was extremely fun, she also had a great message. Something long that these children had no direction, no future, no character to look up to, but because the child was troubled with it, they all realized that life was more important than fighting with local black children, or was it destructive to everything. Rex showed them the beauty of angry music. Rex showed them the beauty of rats, diseases and murders. Rex has shown that beauty is almost everything, while some of these things have no beauty, but they can still see that when used in poems, these poems speak to people. Rex played an important role in this movement, which changed the heart from depression to see that there was hope for them and therefore began to show them; Beat.
