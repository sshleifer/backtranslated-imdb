This is one of the many technophobic films that sprouted like mushrooms in the mid-1990s, after the Internet became the mainstream. <br /> <br /> Hollywood movies have always made their way by "beautifying" the arrival shown, looking better and more attractive. The same happens when Hollywood tries to show us some hi-tech stuff. The result of such attempts varies from being very far-attracted and ridiculous (see Hackers (1995), Johnny Mnemonic (1995), etc.) to being quite realistic (see Sneakers (1992)). "Network" is somewhere between these extremes. Nitpicking may end up with quite a lot of technical inconsistencies and a lot of cases that seem to be much more "sexy" and graphic than the way things are in real life (as usually happens in movies). Br /> <br /> However, on the lookout, the viewer will end up with a pretty solid, fun movie. Characters and acting are compelling, and the film does a good job of putting you in place until the end. The plot is fine (fairly standard, really - based on good paranoid design, but this time with hi-tech edge), and quite convincing (again, if we don't respect technical issues). However, the plot's development is somewhat slow, and at times you can expect to see some of the supposedly surprising turns in the plot. The bonus is cutie-pie Sandra Bullock, who, besides being cute, seems to be easy, also shows a solid act. You can really feel her character - her despair, her emotions. <br /> <br /> In the bottom line, the movie is fun and interesting, prizes about 7 out of 10 on my scale. It is worth to rent a video library or even watch in the cinema. Whether to buy it or not is up to you.
