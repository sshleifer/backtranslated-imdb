Not surprisingly, this short (91 minute) B / W movie, produced 50 years ago in the Soviet Union during a short period of "ottepel" or "melting", has won so much love and admiration among film lovers around the world. It's amazing and beautifully shot. Some scenes feel like they have gone on a journey before their time. Sergei Urusevsky's photographic work and creative discoveries have been included in textbooks and widely imitated. The film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by the ruthless war, but eternally alive in the memory of a young woman. It is also a film about loyalty, memories, ability to live when it seems that there is nothing to live for; it's about forgiveness and hope. The film won (absolutely deserved) Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival and Tatiana Samoilova was selected as the recipient of a special award at Cannes for playing Veronica, a young girl happily in love with the best man in the world at the beginning of the film. After separating with her beloved, who went to the front, losing a family in a bomb and marrying a man she never loved and just wished she never existed, she turned to the shadow of herself. Her long journey to redemption, finally receiving her beloved's death and learning how to live with him, is fascinating and heartbreaking, and she simply does not leave any viewer indifferent. For me, the film is very personal and dear because I was born and raised in a town where his characters lived and were so happy at the beginning. I walked the streets, squares, and bridges across the Moscow River. Every family in the former Soviet Union has lost at least one, but often more than one family member to fight or to a concentration camp or ghetto, or to hunger, cold and disease during World War II, and my family is no exception. My mother and grandmother knew the horrors of war and never hurt the pain of losing not only movies and books. "Cranes fly" speaks to me clearly and honestly and touches me very much. It's a masterpiece of making a movie, but it's part of my life - my background, memory and past.
