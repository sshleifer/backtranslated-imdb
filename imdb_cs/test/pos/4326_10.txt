Libby was talking to Desmond in remembrance of memory and if someone is confused about her past (as if she was in the same hospital in which Hurley was), then you should know that Libby's dying in Season 2, the character will be explored more in Season 3 and we get answers to questions around it. BTW, a great episode. It had a really cool cliffhanger and some interesting questions ... like what happened to Eco and Lock and what to do with four toe sculptures? <br /> <br /> I can't wait for season 3, Lost just rules !!! I hope that all unanswered questions will be answered. I loved how they explained why the plane actually crashed. Desmond did it when he failed to enter the numbers in time. 4 8 15 16 23 42
