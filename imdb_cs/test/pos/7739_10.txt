What will Prospero be in the twentieth century, what is his life? Why would a man have to decide to live on the island with his daughter and girlfriend? Because it is too hard to live and love in good conditions in civilization. This man (John Cassavetes) is a broken giant, can control a storm. He has power, strength, but he is human. Deep love of life is the subject of this extraordenary film. Acting is incredible, all genius John Cassavetes, Gena Rowlands, Vittorio Gasman and Shakespeare and Paul Mazursky of course. Don't miss out that this will be a bug this movie is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. and I've seen a lot of movies.
