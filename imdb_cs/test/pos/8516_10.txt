There are many similarities between Never Say Never Again and Thunderball not only on Sean Connery, but also on the story and plot. Except for the actors, all the others are the same as abducting atomic bombs, asking for ransom, trading with atomic weapons in the ship, etc. Only the difference is the place in the thunder ball conspiracy that is in the Bahamas at Never say never again, is over North Africa. And in a thunderous NATO / RAF ball, it loads its nuclear weapons into the plane itself, and never say Never, it's a "rouge arm of Ax" and the air has dropped across the US and stolen in the Caribbean. Almost 99% are the same.
