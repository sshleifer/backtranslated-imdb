I loved this movie, but then I'm a big fan of Cronenberg again. If you haven't seen David Cronenberg's movie then it's not a good place to start. Scanners, Fly, Rabid would be the place to start, and then work on Videodrome before you check it out. This is certainly one of his best and takes interactive games phenomena one step behind. <br /> <br /> In this game, players engage a bio-engineering game pad through a jack inserted into their spinal cord and get into play directly through their nervous system. It is very difficult to tell you more without giving away the story and storyline, but just say that it is a game you will not forget. It is full of Cronenberg's slimy body work, dark foreboding scenery filled with great casts, including Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law and Will Dafoe, who take a very serious position. These people will do what they can to find out the game and then win it. Like other films, there is no lack of imagination or parts where you sink into a seat, but as a car accident you don't look any further. If you liked any of the above movies, then by all means go out and get this.
