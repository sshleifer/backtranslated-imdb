Darr was a Super Hit movie that was loved by many nations. It tells the story of Shahrukh Khans innocent obsession of Juhi who loves Sunny Deol. Honestly, it was a fun movie, but if you look carefully, it's not very realistic. Shahrukh Khan keeps on calling Juhi and tells her he loves her too. He announces in college that he loves her and gives her some nice surprises such as beautiful pictures of her. Unfortunately, instead of flattering him that he loves her too much, he gets very scared. I personally know that 100s of people get angry, and these people enjoy it because they play long. Yash Chopra gives us a good movie that is fun, especially thanks to the character of Shah Rukh Khan. It is believed that Sunny Deol will be the main actor, but Darr belongs to Shah Rukh Khan, who delivers outstanding performance. Shah rukh Khan is literally a villain of the movie, but I would love to get the girl because she loves her so dearly. The Sun Deol gives a decent performance, but defeats all those guys on their own and survives the brutal attack on the knife. Juhi Chawla is as cute as ever in fairly good performance. Some good songs including Tu mere alone are the best.
