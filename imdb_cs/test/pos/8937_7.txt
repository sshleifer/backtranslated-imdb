2002's "Surf Areas" is a beautiful little comedy, just like the British did. The sense of film humor is slightly morbid and black and yet very nice and sometimes very slapstic. Nick Hurran's only film I have seen so far, and while I do not intend to watch his other films at the moment (I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies), this one is very nice and very funny. The film takes place in a small town in Wales where Betty Rhys-Jones (Brenda Blethyn) is married to a drunk and adulterous town owner (Robert Pugh). Local mortal Boris (Alfred Molina) has desperately fallen in love with Betty since childhood, but he has always been too shy to confess to her. In addition to being desperately in love, Boris has other problems, as the eccentric American deceased Frank Featherbed (Christopher Walken) has opened a burial flourishing venture in the same city ... The story sometimes becomes quite bizarre. Also, "Plots with Glance" profits from the gorgeous cast. Brenda Bethlyn, who has already proven to be a funny lady in "Saving Grace" in 2000, plays the lead and is again very funny and very kind in her role. Alfred Molina, who plays his shy admirer, delivers great performance as ever, and Robert Pugh fits perfectly into the slimy husband of Betty. Beautiful Naomi Watts is also great as the husband's "secretary", becoming a bigger fan of every movie I see. The biggest role is played by incomparable Christopher Walken (one of my favorite actors). Walken is brilliant because he is always in the role of an eccentric Mortician who arranges funerals that are quite unorthodox. Overall, "Land With View" is a very fun little British comedy that I highly recommend!
