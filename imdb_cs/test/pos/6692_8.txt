K-PAX is exactly what a warm film should be. The story is about a mysterious psychiatric patient, Prot, who played Kevin Spacey, and his incredible psychiatrist Dr. Powel, who plays Jeff Bridges. Both have a very friendly bond, and as their relationship grows, Dr. Powel can't help but wonder if there is more for his mysterious patient who insists he is from another planet called K-PAX. This movie is very funny and Kevin Spacey pulls a well-placed single pad as if it were his other nature. K-PAX is a smart movie and I didn't expect it to go where it did. Finally, I found myself thinking about little things in life and the miracle and charm of everyday life that we take so often for granted. I left the theater with a warm fuzzy feeling inside, and for families and couples in the day, K-PAX is a great movie that won't disappoint. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in something more than a monotonous release of shiny, action, gore fests.
