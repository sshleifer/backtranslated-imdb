"A Fare to Remember" is an entirely derived, almost ridiculous film, but it has the warmth that makes it a very effective and positive holiday film. This is quite a newcomer, Challen Kates, as a high-performance advertising manager who, just before her wedding, must rush from L.A. to Seattle to give a client who refused all other presentations. He has traffic problems from the start and apparently no money. This is the first stupid thing - there were no ATMs? They must do well. In any case, he meets a cab driver (Warner) who looks like a homeless man and drives it to her presentation and when he appears with a huge box of beef jerky (client product), he is there to take her to the airport. All flights are canceled, so to get to the wedding of L.A. she hired him to take her there. On the way they connect and learn from each other. It's a very sweet movie, though there's nothing new - it combines "Six Days and Seven Nights" and several other movies. But the chemistry between the stars is good, they are nice and the acting is good. Look at Jerry Springer as the head of a beef jerky company and the portrait of Karl Malden. <br /> <br /> This is a nice movie you can take during the holidays. It's a lifetime.
