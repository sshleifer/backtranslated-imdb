I have heard some remarks, especially from prisoners of war that CHANGI is not historically accurate and that it is disappointing. Maybe it's for those who really had to live through these things, and much worse. CHANGI is a remarkable introduction for the rest of us who really have no idea how the Japanese were treated with the Japanese during World War II. But CHANGI is not a war document - if that were the case, historical accuracy would be a prime aspect. It is a miniseries drama, with fictional characters and fictional situations (though loosely based on the real events I have heard and read about) - and the ideal of connection in the middle of the story. This group of young Australian soldiers, captured by the Japanese and held in terrifying conditions for years, became friends through adversity, and the power of their friendship continued throughout their lives after the war. It is also a cultural study of the differences between the Japanese of the time and the Western world, with music, games and entertainment: in Part 5, when Japan is losing the war after Germany surrendered in Europe, the prison camp's Japanese colonel insists that his country must study the culture of its prisoners - in order to defeat people, they must defeat their culture - and that must be understood. All in all, Australia continues its rich tradition of producing exceptional television miniseries, and is the unrivaled world leader in this regard: vyeing for the AFI Award with CHANGI is MY BROTHER JACK, an adaptation of George Johnston's novel, and also a good winner. Miniseries in recent years include the ROSE DAY (the story of the Glanville train crash investigation), the KARLS IN GRASS CASTLES (an adaptation of Mary Durack's historical statement about her pioneering ancestors), KANGAROO PALACE (a group of friends from a rural city in Australia traveling to London changing and growing) and (somewhat disappointing) adaptation of Bryce Courtenay's powerful novel, POTATO FACTORY. Less Recently: Nancy Cato is an extensive life saga on Murray - ALL RIVERS RUN; Cusack & James' Brilliant Novel about Postwar Life in Sydney - COME IN SPINNER; Outstanding Pioneering Saga of Colleen McCullough - THE THORN BIRDS; THE CROSS CROSS; Ruth Park's novel HARP IN SOUTH; BODYLINE; EUREKA STOCKADE; ANZACS; etc ..., etc. (Of course, there were some not-so-good productions - such as MOBY DICK, DO or DIE, on the beach, Thorn BIRDS: wrong years, etc ...) In general, if Australian miniseries Coming on the road, make sure you see it - and it doubles for CHANGI, a superbly mastered masterpiece. Rating: 9/10.
