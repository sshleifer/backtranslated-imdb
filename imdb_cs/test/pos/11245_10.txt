The show itself essentially reflects the typical nature of average youth; partying and picking up pups is a common weekend destination in clubs. People frowned at the show because of their "perverted" idea of ​​picking up girls by technique and strategic characterization, but the truth is that virtually every young guy is out in the club. Overall, the show really appeals to the younger population because we like to see the result of a "gambling" performance at the club because the show offers a comic approach made by the jury. <br /> <br /> 10/10; A cool, fun and exciting series that allows viewers to really meet. Good job boys.
