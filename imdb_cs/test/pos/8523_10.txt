In 1983 two Bond films were made, one was the official Bond movie Octopussy starring Roger Moore who played as James Bond for the first time in Live and Let Die and the other was the unofficial Bond film Never Say Never again starring Sean Connery Bond in Dr. Well, the movie was also James Bond's first 007 movie to be made. Never Say Never Again is called anecdotal because the company that made the next James Bond movies didn't do this. Never say never again is also a remake of the 1965 007 Thunderball movie, there are a few differences in Never Say Never Again that will let you know that it wasn't done by EON. One thing is that the opening is different, there is no gun barrel sequence and no pre-credit sequence, the other difference is the music score. Some things in this movie feel like a James Bond movie like gadgets and cars, and James Bond always takes it with the ladies and the movie has a song with introductory credits. Sean Connery is still doing a great job playing Bond. Never Say Never Again is a good movie that's fun as James Bond's official movies. Look at this. 10/10
