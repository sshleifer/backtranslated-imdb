The next next American model is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but recently I was bored with it. Cycle 1: Yeah I'm Happy Adrienne won, I wanted to win from the start. Cycle 2: Too Bad, I think Mercedes deserves it. Cycle 3: I didn't like Eve, but most of the girls didn't like this cycle. Cycle 4: Kahlen was to win. I don't know what they saw in Naim, but I know what they saw in Kahlen. Cycle 5: Like Cycle 3, it wasn't a big cycle. But of all the girls, NICOLE as the winner? eww! Cycle 6: I liked Sara and Joanie, but Danielle is fine too. Cycle 7: Caridee certainly deserved it. Cycle 8: No, I didn't want him to win Jaslene. I did not like it. I saw other girls in this cycle with more potential than she did, though I haven't seen much of this cycle. <br /> <br /> a good show, I've seen it too many times to enjoy it: D
