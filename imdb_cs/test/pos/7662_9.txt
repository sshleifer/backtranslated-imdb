Eliza (Elizabeth Moorman) is a farm girl from the country coming to town looking for love. She met a man who told her about an astrologer who would show her the stars. Is it the way of souls ... Eliza is put to the test, can she realize her true love when she sees it or not? Tommy (Tommy Lee Jones) is a construction worker trying to find his native heritage. They show different ways of looking at things. While Eliza is still looking for love and Tommy is trying to protect the reservation his grandmother lives on. It is a twisted story about how to take for granted and find beauty in simple everyday things. The style is artsy and crowded with symbolism. The psychedelic camera style could discourage the average viewer, but a deeper message and interesting images make this film worthy of watching. It is a film that explores the underworld of strange, miserable and devastated individuals. This one is out of the way, but it's definitely worth watching!
