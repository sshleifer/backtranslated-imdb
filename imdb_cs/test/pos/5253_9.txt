I had my son for the weekend and my parent called me and said they wanted the two of us to meet us in movies. When I got there, Mom said she really wanted to see "The Women" and asked if my son and I thought about being called a baby. I reluctantly agreed that it would be another movie of "First Wife". I must say, I was very surprised when I really enjoyed the movie from the opening scene to the credits. It was a great production and the cast was perfect in their roles. My son and I laughed all through the movie and we're glad we saw it. He did it for a great Saturday afternoon movie and I highly recommend it to anyone, man or woman.
