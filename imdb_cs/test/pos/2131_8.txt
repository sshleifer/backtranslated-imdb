Although this film was destroyed by director and screenwriter Michael Cimino's career and bankruptcy by United Artists, he still stands as one of the best films of all time. There are plenty of reasons to release this movie prematurely. Among them: its length, technical problems, colossal ill-treatment of animals on the scene - the list goes on and on. Yet for all this remains a film that captures something. It is a classic example of a naturalistic par talk with Strindberg - his moments last as long as they could be, and they weren't so stupid for the film's timing. In his moments of anger, love and war (and hopelessness), it is real. Anyone who appreciates film and narration should see this film.
