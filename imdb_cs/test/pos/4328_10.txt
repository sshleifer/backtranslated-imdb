Jack, Sawyer and Sayid float to the ship and find Desmond completely useless. His traumatic past experience before sailing to the island is revealed through flashbacks. Sayid draws a plan with Jack to surprise "The Other" if Michael crossed the group. John Locke convinces Desmond to attack the hatch, which is protected by Mr. Eco, and does not press the computer button to see what happens. This episode is one of the best in the second season. Unfortunately, "Lost" lovers see a lack of respect from the producers of this amazing series with fans. In the US, the air date of this episode was 24 May 2006. Therefore, along this period, fans must wait for a third season in a very tense situation, with Jack and his band surrounded by "others" and finding the truth. about Michael and the death of Anna Lucie and Libba; John locked inside the hatch without intending to push the button and Mr. Eco in despair before the hatch. I hope the fate of "Lost" will be better than "Angel" and its very unsatisfactory conclusion (or lack of conclusions) after five seasons. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
