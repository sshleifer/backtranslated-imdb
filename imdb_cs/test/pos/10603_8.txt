I didn't know what to expect. I've always considered Bam Marger and the CKY crew as a team of articulated heads that do stupid things for fun. I didn't know they could act. But everyone who has acted in this film has withdrawn from good performance. The rage of the "aaaaagh!" Scene blends with Ryan Dunn's depression and his revenge against his ex-girlfriend perfectly. Sometimes it seems that the movie has some scenes, but at the same time they are funny. I recommend it to anyone who likes a good laugh, but this movie doesn't have to appeal to those who prefer detailed stories and a series of twists and turns.
