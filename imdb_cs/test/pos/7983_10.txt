Batman Returns is more gothic and darker than its predecessor, and I really like it. Also, the scenery is darker and the whole environment is sad, along with music that boasts a soul that consists of such talented Danny Elfman. However, I didn't like the fact that I liked the Penguin Monster, unlike the comic book where there is a man. Even though he looks like a monster, he shows well that he has human dignity, and I was very sorry for seeing his late parents' tombstones. But in fact he was in fact a dangerous criminal and had to be stopped. Michael Keaton made a "tour" returning as the Dark Knight and this time as powerful as the original Batman. It is not difficult to understand why he is sometimes called Batman in public ... <br /> <br /> Also Michelle Pfeiffer is so sexy and well equipped in her role and has faithfully performed as a female villain / criminal dressed as a cat. Indeed, the actors did all the masterpieces with Batman Returns, which made it a successful film. <br /> <br /> If you liked Batman, watch his amazing sequel because it's very worthy for all Dark Knight's hard-core lovers.
