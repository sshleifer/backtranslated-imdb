This film was discussed in Fangoria, where I heard about it, it was especially interesting to me because it was a direct video and I recognized the two stars on the cover, James Marsden of Behavior Disruption and Christine Taylor of The Craft. And to my Valentine's Day surprise when I was looking for a horror alley to find him on the shelf! I had to catch him immediately. Me and my brother and my friends watched it and to my surprise it was pretty good, the stories were interesting and once they were SCARY, unlike many other horror movies that were recently made. Some land I don't understand, but once I see it again, I bet I'll get it. And even more surprisingly, the other stars I met, including one of the girls from My So-Called Life and Jacinda of The Real World, aren't sure why this movie was just video, with little advertising this film could at least figure out how much money was spent on making it. The only problem I have is that because it wasn't released in theaters, I don't think I can ever see it in widescreen view. You should definitely take a chance and rent this. <br /> <br />
