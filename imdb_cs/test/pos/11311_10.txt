Julie Brown happily destroys Madonna's attempt at rockstering with intestinal ripping of humor and truly original and catchy songs that compete with Madonna. The camera and the sets are a top shot. Kathy Griffin and Chris Elliott offer their own comedy injections that enhance and complement this film. The performance of Bobcat Goldthwait and Wink Martindale as such is an added bonus. It's hard to tell whether Brown's performance is intended to insult or playfully irritate Madonna, though I don't think Material Girl has found humor in it. My favorite line: "Why don't you come here (to the Philippines), everything they eat is a dog and I'm a vegetarian."
