Clifton Webb as "Mr. Scoutmaster" is one of all the time greats of comedy and recalls the innocence that has now diminished in the world. I cannot understand why networks like American Movie Classics and such films do not show this film, although I have asked for it again and again. This film should be shown to children to show loyalty, respect, determination and determination to achieve the best on an individual basis. There is so little self-esteem in today's daily life, but this film, among many others, would be a wonderful tool for teaching the younger generation today to see what can be achieved with common sense and decency. proud of yourself and your achievements to improve. Sadly, this type of film doesn't affect a modern audience. Certainly appealed to us 'baby boomer' generation yesterday. OLD KNOWLEDGE ARE UNIVERSAL AND TIME.
