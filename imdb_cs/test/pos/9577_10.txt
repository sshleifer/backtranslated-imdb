In the era of Farrelly Brothers and Jackass series, make a film made and performed by Americans to come out that is well walked and full of charm as well as cheerfulness is well miraculous. This set was behind some other effort, most recently "Mighty Wind" which was so subtle it seemed to be the current documentary without entertainment overlay, but "Best in Show" hits on all the cylinders. It is a great cast with some of the best contemporary actors in the US, Parker Posey, who radiates energy, even when standing, Eugene Levy as tolerant to anyone who is no mat, even though he is (or maybe an "untamed mat") ). Fred Willard's brilliant styling, an unobtrusive introduction of so many others, a feature that is not commonly associated with Americans or American actors. One of the few funny movies I can watch over and over again.
