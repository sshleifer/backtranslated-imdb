I see a lot of movies in the cinema (103 this year) and I have to say that this is by far the best movie I saw this year, even though it was released in 1954! I sat in awe and watched this genius work and felt quite ashamed that I had never heard of it before my local art cinema decided to keep it for a week on what looked like a new one printing. The best part of the whole film must be a 28-minute break where there is no speech and no music, only the sound of the robbery men. Clean quality. Although it is a dark place, it is lightened by dry humor. There are not many movies that have 10 out of 10, but it does and also gets a gold star for the effort !! <br /> <br /> If you ever get a chance to see this movie, don't hesitate, it's a classic. <br /> <br />
