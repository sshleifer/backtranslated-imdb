I admit that I may have missed a few moments when I didn't pay proper attention, but I agreed enough that it was a great family movie by Lionel Jefferies who played Grandfather Potty in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Basically, it starts with a happy middle-class family living in Victorian London. One night, Father (Iain Cuthbertson) is visited by two strangers and leaves with them and does not return. They move to the country cottage, and here the children; Bobbie (Jenny Agutter, whom I first saw in children's play 2), Phyllis (Sally Thomsett) and Peter (Gary Warren) keep their spirits in the spirit of the nearby railroad. Every day, they faithfully return to passengers in passing trains, also avoiding accidents and becoming heroes with courage and vigilance. Their kindness makes them friends, including important people who can help find the secrets of their missing father. Also starring Dinah Sheridan as mother / mistress. Waterbury, Bernard Cribbins as Albert Perks, William Mervyn as Old Man, Peter Bromilow as Doctor Forrest, Ann Lancaster as Ruth and Gordon Whiting as Russian. It was number 29 on the 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 24 on the 50 Greatest British Films. Very good!
