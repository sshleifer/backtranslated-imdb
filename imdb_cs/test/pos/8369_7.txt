This is not the best movie you could ever see, but it's still very refreshing. Of course, it has its drawbacks, it has humble moments and it is also different from all the ones you are used to and it is funny in a way that only French can give you. You may notice a little from Amelia's work when you see the opening. I will give it 7 out of 10, but I still recommend that you if you are tired of the usual boring you can rent it on the videostore.
