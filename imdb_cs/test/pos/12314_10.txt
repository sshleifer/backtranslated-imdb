It often does not happen that a great director's latest film becomes such a moving, brilliantly executed and filmed masterpiece. The cast is excellent, just like a cameraman. What starts as a cheerful meeting of a group of educated early 20th century citizens - Dublin, turns into a dark, philosophical account of all our fears of death and sometimes dark shadows of the past. Thank you, Mr. Huston, for the last piece of great cinema!
