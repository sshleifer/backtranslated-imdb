An extremely gentle story about Shakespeare's play (and much more about it than about the Forbidden Planet). Cassavetes is always a pleasure to watch, and even more, with Gena Rowlands sharing the spotlight. His role in the role of Prospera is very well suited to some refined omniscient expression he brings to the story. This situation comes to the forefront of the scene when, when viewed by his estranged wife and her motorboat lover, she raises a storm (accompanied by a soundtrack with a selection of Stuga Yamashty's "Go"). This is just one of the moments of the film, where the line between reality and fantasy becomes pretty blurry and the viewer is left with the feeling that magic is perhaps more than one might believe. Add to this the excellent performance of Raul Julia, plus the good work of Susan Sarandon, Vittorio Gassman and Molly Ringwald, and the film becomes a nice little gift to occupy the space behind your eyes.
