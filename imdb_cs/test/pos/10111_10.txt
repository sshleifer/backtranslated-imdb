The recent history of East Hollywood ghost / horror remakes was unsatisfactory. This film will inevitably suffer the same fate, so get a copy on e-bay or similar. It is well photographed and the sound is excellent. Good screen viewing and a good 5.1 or DTS sound system is recommended. Obviously, it's a subtitle, so if it discourages you, then I wouldn't bother. Dubbing rarely works and just wouldn't do it. It's also really scary, with great performances from casts that will be unknown to Western viewers. Especially I would choose a stepmother who was absolutely brilliant. The end will want to follow you again if you can. The storyline is relentless and offers no calming moments of relaxation along the way. <br /> <br /> If I have little criticism, some of the scenes from the Japanese version of The Ring may have an impact. However, for several years we have received direct copies of other nations' ideas for Western films, and so my opinion is limited, which has not prevented me from doing it 10/10. I believe that most fans of this genre will have a huge "pleasure" from this film, which is falling as one of my hopes.
