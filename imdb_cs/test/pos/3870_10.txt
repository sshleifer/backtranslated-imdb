The animation is still a slightly rougher style of the first episode, The Simpsons Roasting On The Open Fire, but already, with this first regular episode, Bart Genius, humor is becoming more "layered", faster and greater depth of characterization. more delicately, Lisa's intellectual superiority to the whole family. Although it is a major theme of the entire episode (there is also a nice secondary theme of Bart and Homer's father / son relationship), it's given us first in a nutshell as the episode opens with The Simpsons starring Scrabble. Lisa comes up with an "id" for her word - short, but something you need to be well educated to know. He must read the definition of the rest of the family from a dictionary that served as a way to support the couch. Marge can only come up with "he". Homer has "oxidized" already sitting on his tray right, but does not recognize that it is a word, so instead presents "do". Bart comes up with "kwyjibo", which he insists is the word. Similarly, in the main line of the episode plot, Bart cheats his IQ test, which leads to his being embedded in a special school full of gifted children. We know it won't be long. "The Simpsons" has always played a lot of fun playing with varying degrees of intellectual ability among people through their characters, and more importantly, people with different degrees of intellectual ability fit (or not) are accepted (or not) and are perceived in society. In addition to the introduction of Bart, Lisa, Homer and Marge in this context, this episode is already beginning to sneak up the fun of fools and geeks outside the Simpsons family. Despite some of the dialogue from students in a special school, as well as some of the other links, including purely visual, this episode also shows that "The Simpsons" won't pull any punches by typing or speaking to the audience. This can only be a cartoon, but it's a cartoon that intellectuals, enthusiasts and morons will understand more than anyone else. And this fact, besides being a very entertaining show, is the key to the show's longevity.
