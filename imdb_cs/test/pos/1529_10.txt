Rarely, the film captures such intense drama and emotions. What makes this film so disturbing is that the drama feels so real that it's almost hard to remember it's just a movie. This is by far Madeline Stowe and the performance of their career by Alan Rickman. The film almost feels like theater production as it is staged and illuminated. The only bad thing about this movie is that it's hard to get a copy of it. I haven't seen it before, but at Laserdisc. This truly powerful film deserves digitally remastered transfers and special DVD editing. It's really so good.
