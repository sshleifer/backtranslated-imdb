When one looks at animated superman shorts in the 1940s, the similarity of land can be a bit bored - the adversary is most often a mad scientist in a hidden headquarters, threatening the metropolis with some evil invention - deadly rays, mechanical monsters, electric earthquake, magnetic telescope you have. This one is refreshing. Bad driving in the car, shooting and bombing, but the center of the action is the golden train (on which Lois Lane travels, as the only press reporter seems). Train movies have their own typical ingredients, since 1903 Great Train Robberies on, and quite some are featured here: decoupling cars on the move, running on the roofs, taking a steam locomotive from the back of the tender, fighting with the engineer, switch turned to train he set out on a side lane, a fall (people or the whole train) from a high bridge ... it's all in a few minutes of this beautiful piece. It won't be a Superman movie unless it performs some incredible performances (including balancing and high-precision placement) to eventually win the day. If you're a fan of train movies, don't miss this. It is in the public domain and can be legally downloaded from archive.org.
