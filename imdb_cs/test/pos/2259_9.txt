I saw it last night and voted for "8". Since then she has grown up to me and I would have given him a "9". <br /> <br /> The film has a (initially) seemingly slightly detached facade between the first and second half. The first half is a comedy and there are few hints of ragged truths of the era, life, wars, religious intolerance that will be revealed in the second half. While initially it may be a little disturbing because it is a somewhat unknown narrative sequence, it works on reflection. Acting was good (Hultz in the role of Alex, an interpreter, was particularly big). <br /> <br /> I scanned most other user comments and found that some who read the book are happy with the movie, even though there are few. Of course, both feelings are valid. <br /> <br /> For me, a family therapist and one world believer, the film was relevant at two different levels. The first, as history, was a powerful reminder of how commonly polarization is happening - with demonization and an endeavor to wipe out one of those who have a different system of moral value than ours. The second was that in demonstrating the first, she also revealed something to EVERYONE, ALL of our families - that each of us must return to our roots to get a better understanding. br /> <br /> TS Eliot made a great statement in the fourth of his "four quartets" when he said, "We must not stop exploring // And the end of our entire survey // Will come where we started // for the first time." Jonathan embarks on a full-fledged journey that each of us would find fantastic - to explore and discover our roots; what those people went through, who they were - really! - before, when and during the first years before and after birth? So the film gives us the impression of a comedy first, then moves to give us lessons from history and human shortcomings, but through all that it gives us - subliminally - and a message about each of us. We would all be greatly rewarded to come back and understand the place from which we started.
