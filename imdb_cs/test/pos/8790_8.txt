Hitchcock produced at least 11 films about an ordinary person, wrongly accused, on the run (sometimes really running, sometimes not) to prove his innocence in a situation beyond his control, the first of which was "The 39 Steps", which really made him popular in the Great Britain. It's really his signature theme. Others include "Young and Innocent", "Saboteur", "Spellbound", "Stage Fright", "Aliens on the Train", "I Admit", "To Catch a Thief", "Bad Man" , "North of the Northwest", and finally "Frenzy". "Saboteur" begins with Robert Cummings as Barry Kane, a war plane racer accused of murdering his co-worker and best friend during sabotage at the race during the war. She meets Patricia Martin, played by actress Priscilla Lane, during her run by law, and later, of course, various Nazi / Fascist sympathizers on the road. "Saboteur" is mainly like "The 39 Steps", even including similar devices like handcuffs, a blonde who doesn't trust the main character in the beginning, a race across the country (in one case London to Scotland and in New California to New York) and meeting with "colorful" locals. So, just like "The Man Who knew Too Much", I believe it is an American remake of one of Hitchcock's earlier works. I think Robert Cummings was chosen because he comes as a very ordinary man. An American, everybody, with whom viewers can identify. I like Priscilla Lane because her character is more involved in action than Madeline Carroll in "The 39 Steps" and Ruth Roman in "Strangers on the Train". As mentioned elsewhere, Otto Kruger steals the show as a villain. I also liked the performance of Vaughan Glaser as a blind uncle; his lines are great. There are some humorous touches all along the way for some comic relief, such as road signs featuring Priscilla Lane's character on them, and circus sideshow artists, and truck driver, Murray Alper. Unlike other opinions, there aren't too many characters who believe Barry Kan's innocence immediately. <br /> <br /> There are some slow parts, especially when the action first moves to New York, but it quickly rises when the last planned act of the fifth feuillet runs. It's one of my favorite Hitchcock movies (I put it in the top 5), especially these days of the new war on terror. I think it hits home. Do you think that, "Could my co-worker get involved in something bad?" In fact, one of the movie posters for "Saboteur" said "Watch out for the men behind your back!" Imagine how it played in the mind of adults during World War II.
