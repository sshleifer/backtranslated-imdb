'O brother, where art Thou' is a gloomy story about Homer's 'Odyssey', which takes place in the 1930s in Mississippi and unfolds with magnificent unpredictability, a trademark of Coen's brothers. Three unfortunate convictions are fleeing to find treasure - and more than their share of adventure - in this wonderful movie. George Clooney is in a subtle, inventive form as a laudable, friendly trio leader; but the actual acting kudos go to John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as his goofy but dear cohorts, dubbed 'Soggy Bottom Boys' by Clooney's character after they receive baptism by full immersion in the river. These three cuts recorded a record for this domestic nom-de-plume for cash and unwittingly became a sensational state of the night with the true "rock star" status. The film is accompanied by plenty of music and songs that almost qualify it as a musical. And there are some incredible performances of filmmaking: the scene at the KKK rally is a real doozy and is so similar to the scene where Dorothy's friends saved her from the witch's castle in "The Wizard of Oz", which is almost to film plagiarism. And what a great job plagiarism is! Without giving up the end, I must say that the culmination of the film is one of the most breathtaking sequences that have been shot in recent memory (on the same level as the magnificent final of Magnolia, another of my favorites). 'Oh brother' is what you have to see, perfect 10!
