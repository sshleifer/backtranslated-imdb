This movie, also known as "don't look into the basement", isn't really bad. It's a bit of a well-known movie, even if the hard horror fans die, but I found this movie quite funny. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely not without his problems, but I think it would have more people. The story of a hot sister who will work in a sanatorium is definitely appealing to me. I thought acting, which seemed to be initially forced, had somehow improved when the film went on. Looks like the actors got into the role. There are some good, colorful characters, including a guy who thinks he's still a soldier, one who thinks he's a judge, an adult with a child's brain, and an attractive girl who longs for attention so badly that she undresses her clothes, when someone approaches her. The title "don't look into the cellar" is of such great importance for the story as "the last house on the left" has the movie. If you like movies with scary characters in the mental department like me, check it out.
