There have been very few great comedy films in the history of Hindu cinema. Andaz Apna Apna is one of them. The film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men (Aamir and Salman) who dream of getting rich by marrying a millionaire's daughter (Raveen). Aamir and Salman Khan try to overcome themselves and woo Raven as much as possible. The story thickens when Paresh Rawal & Co. plans to take over all wealth. The movie is well paced and very funny. Rarely does one encounter a Hindu comedy that is both funny and intelligent. This is one of the few movies with Aamir and Salman (probably the only movie!). Unfortunately, it failed in the box office, so we would never see a movie of this caliber. Aamir Khan is brilliant in the film and has shown his versatility as an actor in this film. Salman Khan gives very good performance as dim-wit. Raveena plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl, and Karishma, who is Raveen's assistant / friend, is also entertaining. Paresh Rawal, Junior Ajith, Shakti Kapoor, Deven Verma, Jagdeep and Tiku Talsania just add the taste of the film! All in all, the best Hindu comedy she ever did, and I wish they did more quality movies like this. You will want to watch this movie again and again. PS - For those of you who have watched this movie, I also recommend Gol Maal, Chupke Chupke, Chhoti Si Baat, Naram Garam, Hera Pheri (old and new), etc.
