Hi what do you expect from a movie with a very low budget!?!? Even though I haven't seen "Dahmer" (2002), I can say that after the media released about Jeff, it's pretty accurate. I studied the case of Jeffrey Dahmer and learned everything I can about this man. This is a low budget movie but shows the serial killer mentality. If you can get through the gore and find out what the basic story of the sick mind. I loved this movie! Just keep yourself on a low budget and no blood. It's a story seen through the eyes of a murderer and his actions and thoughts from childhood to his arrest. My favorite line is: "If they bothered to look at the back seat, it could save a lot of lives."
