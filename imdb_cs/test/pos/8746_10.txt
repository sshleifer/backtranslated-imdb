It is a wonderfully rough drama detailing the different sides of the international heroin drug trade - from the hills of northern Pakistan, where the opium poppy cultivation is tacitly permitted; for "yachting" "Euro-Trash" in Germany and England, which ensure the import of processed heroin into multi-kilometer smuggled shipments; end-users who are trapped on the Internet for dependencies and crimes needed to support their growing habit; And finally all levels of international government corruption and hypocrisy surrounding police efforts to control the "drug problem" - this drama is outlined with a wide array of in-depth well rounded figures, a fully developed plot, and an excellent character playing and filming on the spot. <br /> <br /> This makes Hollywood epics a "French connection" on the spot! Traffik is a deeply thought-out and exciting story about modern drug-related espionage and the international effort of many people to try to remove it. Unlike many drug-related "crime dramas", Traffik strongly focuses on uncovering the social reasons that people slip into drug addiction. When one of the characters builds it "... as long as we as a society build a world in which people want to participate instead of wanting to escape, we will not be able to prevent people from using drugs ..." "<br /> <br /> This is a fascinating and absolutely fascinating drama.
