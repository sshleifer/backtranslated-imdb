Are you looking for proof that real life is more fun than fiction? You just found him. This excellent feature-length documentary (Mark Bortchart), which refuses to admit defeat, is the funest movie I've ever seen - probably because it's also one of the most tragic movies. Oddly enough, the more I watch the movie, the more I inspired myself.
