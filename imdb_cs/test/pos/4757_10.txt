"The Seven-Ups" looks like a replay of "The French Connection" that was released two years ago. Both later Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco perform as well as stuntman Bill Hickman. But we're not with the French drug baddies; instead, we are dealing with war against all sorts of hoods and criminals after the cop is brutally killed by hoodlum. We'll see the inconvenience and New York City before the 1990s. <br /> <br /> I love watching this movie because it's exciting to see action and it's a reminder of cooler time. This means that when you compare car chases, Mr. Hickman has joined the three most compared: This Movie, Bullitt and The French Connection. Every scene of the chase has its own quality, and it is simply superb. And I'm glad this title saw the light of day on DVD.
