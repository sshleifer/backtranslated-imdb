Although this film is ranked among the sophisticated English class, it is a simple story of a few torn. It has a slightly old air, being an adaptation of "The Way Through Wood", a 1950 novel by Nigel Balchin (once very popular and now forgotten). Julian Fellowes, who despite the academic award for the screenplay "Gosford Park", has a somewhat anachronistic personality, wrote the script and directed (the second time for the first time). With the DVD version I saw that Julian's brightest audio commentary is. His main focus was on making his characters okay. He was assisted by two outstanding performances by Tom Wilkinson as James, a quilted city lawyer and Emily Watson as his attractive wife Anne. He also kept it short; the operating time is only 80 minutes. James and Anne have a townhouse in Chelsea and a comfortable former vicarage in Buckinghamshire. Anne is a few years younger, but childless. Outwardly, they seem happy, but James, one of the nature moralists (unusual for a city lawyer), is a control enthusiast. Right after the road is a noble hunt. William Buel, who is not morale for the middle class, and he is more than happy to use it. But there is a complication, a traffic accident in which an older cyclist is dressed in a landscape lane ruthlessly driven by the Range Rover as well as the Hon. Bill is. Soon James, Anne, Bill and the victim's widow (who becomes James and Anne's cleaner) are drawn into a conspiracy to hide what really happened. The main focus is on the corrosive effect of all this on James and Anne's relationship. The third person in the trio, Bill, plays Rupert Everett. From the casting point of view, his tiny, superior way is right for the part, but somehow he won't get there. This is partly because it is to be sick for some time and looks good when it is to be sick, and vice versa. Part seems to be underdeveloped. Interestingly, John Neville, like Bill's father, who has only one major scene, was able to create his character beautifully when he had his character. As Julian Fellowes says in the audio commentary, these people are able to make sure that Edwardian age still exists. At the bottom, the film is about what draws a couple together and what tears them apart. Nigel Balchin went through the dissolution of the marriage when he wrote the book, and Fellowes made a good fist to pass the atmosphere. As he says, his adaptation is fairly loose, but the central theme is the same.
