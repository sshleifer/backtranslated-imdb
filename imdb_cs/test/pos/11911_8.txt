Being raised at the time this movie was released probably influenced my shallow mind, but it still is not a bad movie in any way. It is a hostage movie, a school of pre-school age, populated to some extent by cute teenage boys who can't get out of trouble. What's wrong with that? It has no big special effects, but what? Who needs special effects? The decline in cinema began at about the same time as special effects were popularized. Chance? I think not. It turned the films with potentially good conspiracy and feelings and turned them into a large, substantially less light show for innocent children and self-medication. Well, you know, not all movies need special effects. About three quarters of the IMDb top 250 movies are without special effects, but almost all Top Grossing movies of all time have some special effects. Think about it: Star Wars, E.T., Ghostbusters, etc. All the good movies, but the rest of the top movies are usually class clich√©s with nonsense charts and lots of eye candy. But some movies don't need any of that junk. Excuse me for going to the tangent I normally do, but I'm just so tired of special effects. Back to the point: Toy soldiers are just a great movie. I admit that some of the content is somewhat scaly and ripped off, but whatever, each movie tears off another. Think about Resovoir Dogs. Countless "awards" to the site dictate that the beloved Quentin Tarentino, who I admit I like, copied many, many, many films in the production of his first major film, Reservoir Dogs. Many say the whole plot is ripped off by almost a scene for a scene from Japanese and Chinese gangster films, which Mr. Tarentino loved so much, and probably still does. Sorry once more for the tangent. <br /> <br /> Toy Soldiers is fun. It has all the insubordination from teens to unwanted members of authority, ie Hostage Hostage. It's fun to see children take over when they're held back for something they don't want to do. Hellish, an uprising inspired by adolescent angst, was a key issue for the vast majority of the 1980s. Moreover, there is the tension and excitement of the characters using fire arms and knocking out the bad guys. When one of the characters dies, the others have to cope and adapt. It's not perfect playing, but it beats most of the other tripe there. In short, Toy Soldiers is exciting, interesting and fun. How dare you rate this movie wrong! Shame on you all! <br /> <br /> 8/10
