Sick Man Carleton Hendricks (Dee Snider) sails on the line of Teen Chat as Captain Howdy. He poses as a teen boy and invites another teen over his house to party. Instead, they knock them down, cut them off, pinch their mouths and torture them (mostly with needles). Captures the cop's daughter Mike Gage (Kevin Gage). He finds him, arrests and is institutionalized. Four years later he is released ... completely healed. But lynch mop (led, amused, Robert Englund) attacks him and hangs him. He's not gonna die, but he fits and Captain Howdy's back ... Very ill, disturbing, twisted horror. Captain Howdy enjoys pain and torture and tries to show children who can carry as well as enjoy it. Torture scenes are not so explicit (you hear more than you see), but what you see is very ill. There is no humor and the (muted) screams of his victims sound too real. During most of the scenes I broke away from the television. <br /> <br /> The effect is different. Kevin Gage is not as good as a cop - he's not terrible, but he could have been better. Dee Snider is very scary as Captain Howdy - his offensive scenes are not pleasant. All in all, not your typical horror movie. I will probably never see it again (this film really gets under the skin), but I recommend it to all horror fans - at least to those who have strong stomachs. I give it 7.
