This clever little film shows rock-solid virtues of time, place and kind of masculine power that we no longer have, or even do not want to have. The saint is a paladin with only the best motives, unless they say polished vocabulary and diction. No need to increase the volume or read the dialogue. George Sanders is so charming and, yes, low-key that all that talent, cleverness, physical presence and above all, masculinity, seem well, almost normal. Some normal! George Clooney can't start to handle the scene as Mr. Sanders does (and does it without Mr. Clooney). Indeed, man for all reasons and periods.
