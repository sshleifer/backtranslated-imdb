A quick summary of the book: The boy, Billy Tepper, has been a major school problem for about 12 years and will be sent to boarding school if he is fired from another school. His noble boy's school in Switzerland (or somewhere similar) is taken over by Arab terrorists, why I'm not really sure. Billy has no friends and likes to use his laptop to enter his school database. With the help of two teachers he thwarted the plans of the terrorists and saved the whole school. The book wasn't bad, but it was sooooooo clich√©. <br /> <br /> Now about the movie; they switched Arab terrorists to Cuban terrorists and made Billy 17 and the leader of his group of friends. They like to get in trouble, but normal teen things. This movie was believable. Maybe not realistic, but the characters are real. You can watch Billy, Joey and the other guys and see the real kids who behave as they did (or at least want). <br /> <br /> Great action scenes. Not everything goes as planned for both sides. The overthrow of the terrorists was chaotic and the good guys got hurt. I won't say who, but it's heartbreaking (I know, I use that word a lot). Sean Astin is excellent. As a teenager, he usually played the best friend. This film once again proved that he could play a leading man, a child. The only performance that could be upstaged by his was Wil Wheaton, who played the only son of the New Jersey Mafia man. He hated his father and everything he stood for. (Far from Wesley Crusher) Usually, this genre of film is one I care about as the soul tries to make fun; but not Toy Soldiers. The story line flows, dialogue is usually believable. I can't think of a single moment when I find myself screaming on TV "Oh, that wouldn't happen" A great movie that should be in every collection.
