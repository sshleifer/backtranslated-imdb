Being a Belgian, I'm interested in the history of Congo. It is our only colony for many years (Rwanda was a Belgian protectorate but not a colony) and is part of our country's history. Nowadays it seems very popular to say that everything the Belgians did to Congo was bad, especially in the 19th century. I'm not saying it didn't work. Of course, but it wasn't abnormal. Do you really think the French or the British were much nicer in their colonies? No, they were not. At that time it was "normal" when our King Leopold II used Congo as a way to gain personal wealth. It was his private property (he didn't belong to the state at that time) and tried to make the most of it. Of course, frightening things like hands, chopped up, and yes to today's standards are inadmissible, but in those days it was common practice. It has to be said that it has not happened in recent decades ... I know several people who lived in Congo many years before the declaration of Congolese independence. It is true that they had several black servants, but they are very nice people and I really can't imagine being treated badly. As far as I know, they always treated them with great respect (but I'm not saying that all the Belgians did it). In fact, if they weren't so old (almost all 80 years), they would like to return to Congo. The good thing about this movie is that it provides a historically accurate vision of what happened during the last years of the Belgian administration and the first years of Congolese independence. The story is not so black and white (maybe not the best words in this context, but how else to explain what I mean), as I feared it would be. It doesn't say that all the Belgians were wrong and all the Congolese did it well. Perfectly shows how the Congolese in a hurry to become independent of the Belgians did not mind accepting the help of Russians and Americans who had more attention to raw materials such as copper, diamonds, bauxite, rubber, ... and getting the Congolese in their political " camp "and not all who were interested in their independence. It's not just a good idea of ​​how Lumumba has become stronger, but also how Mobutu has played a dual role. This shows that the Belgian reaction to some of our compatriots was broken, threatened and even murdered (My father was one of the paratroopers who were sent to Congo to save the Belgians). He gives a good idea of ​​the political problems that Lumumba has encountered because the Katanga Province did not want to be part of the Republic of Congo, the role the Belgians had in the Lumumba murder ... all this is part of this film. The story seems to be very accurate, and characters really look and function like the real ones. This film was able to give a very good idea of ​​what life is like in Congo in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and anyone who is interested in the history of the country should see it. However, this should also be shown in history classes, especially in Belgium, because it is part of our history that we should never forget. I give him 7.5 / 10, maybe even 8/10.
