Canthony is right that this little short is just an excuse to hear a very young Judy Garland (fourteen years old!) Singing a little older (one year old) Deanna Durbin. But I have to disagree with everything else he said, including the running time - which is only about ten minutes, not twenty (single-reeler). The song is not her best, of course; But it's nice and definitely worth ten minutes to watch Turner. Duret's duet is quite interesting: two opposing styles, but they are really merging. The short is just a crowd, but nowhere is it as bad as the other reviewer did. I sincerely enjoyed it. Dafydd ab Hugh
