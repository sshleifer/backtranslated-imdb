I'll do it. That was a pleasure to watch. It may or may not be more effective if the characters resemble their real life counterparts, but in addition to this tiny observation, I found that fantasy animals are the most enjoyable. The visuals were the most stunning except for the second-degree CG scenes that could have been omitted. I do not like the fact that computer-generated animation is such that it defeats the purpose of bio-like, like this. Watch it, you'll appreciate it too!
