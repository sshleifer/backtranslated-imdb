Cactus Flower is what I call "pizza film" - a personal favorite that can never be satisfied. Ideal for an evening at home with pizza. Knowing all the lines (and what lines!) Only enhances enjoyment with the heart. Since so many other people have rephrased the story here, I simply add the fix that Bergman's character, Miss Dickinson, Nurse-Receptionist, which means she was a qualified nurse - and therefore an educated person - no just "receptionist." Bergman's performance in this film - and the film itself - was largely rejected at that time. , but today's viewers will admire its scope; Not only the perfect comic timing, but also the ability to get us to believe that her character is unaware of her own feelings and reveals them so clearly Toni and us. While the general plot becomes credible, Bergman's performance is convincing: honest and absolutely believable. Also a standout is Jack Weston's performance as an old friend and co-founder of Matthau Harvey. No one could bring zinger like Weston and I.A.L. Diamond's scenario gives him a lot. For example, "That's such a big, dirty, rotten lie that a class has." Weston excelled in slightly decrepit characters as he radiated warmth that allowed you to forgive the mistakes of his characters. The film is a fairly direct adaptation of Abe Burrows (adapted to the French play Barillet and Gredy). On Broadway Matthau role played Barry Nelson. Bergman is Lauren Bacall, and Hawn is Brenda Vaccaro. It ran for 1,234 shows (three years) and was nominated for two Tony Awards (Vaccaro and Burt Brinckerhoff, who played Igor). For me, the film's score, written and adapted to the legendary Quincy Jones, is another highlight. The main theme (Time for Love is Anytime) is done by Sarah Vaughn on introductory and final credits. It is also implied in various arrangements throughout the film, most notably as romantic piano music underlining Berman's speech to Hawn in the record store. Jones also created covers for popular songs from the season (To Sir With Love, I'm Believer) for nightclub scenes. As with all elements of the film, there is a huge amount of talent, taste and professionalism. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, a few modern romantic comedies can hold the candle of this classic. It's great to be finally available on DVD. Time to call pizza ...
