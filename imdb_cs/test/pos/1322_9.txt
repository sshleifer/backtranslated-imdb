It took several insights to fully appreciate this film. At first I was hit by stylized sets, but the rest was slow and boring. I thought such a sensational subject needed Ken Russell to do it over the top. Nowadays, I consider forced constraint (placed on Mishima widow's production) to be a benefit. Some of the boldest aspects of Mishima's life are repeated and dramatized by corresponding themes from his novels. I think it helps to get to know the novels - that's the difference for me. The feeling that the film can be a bit tighter and warmer, but is truly unique and deserves serious attention. Love the fact that Japanese characters speak Japanese - not English. Philip Glass scores are fascinating.
