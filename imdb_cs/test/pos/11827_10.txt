This one of the best and most fun comedy series I've ever seen! All characters are brilliant. Mr. Slatt (David Bamber) is a very irritated man, irritated by everything and by anyone. <br /> <br /> He wants to do things and manage the situation as best as he can, but he can never do it and get deeper and deeper problems. He is not supported by his wife Janet, who is just trying to get him deeper and deeper into the problems he gets (and doesn't really need help at all!). <br /> <br /> All characters are played / displayed brilliantly. Just imagine sending your child (s) to school like this. It's incredible that people don't like it (maybe some don don't get many word games that are played many times for the episode). It is also incredible that there is still no DVD release. There are only 2 series! So please release it, let it go! So fans can and will enjoy it! <br /> <br /> Try it, you can just wish it !!! Just a few names and words from the series: Pumpman, Man Helmet, Hot Bitch, Mount Suzy, Travis Fellatio, Cockfoster, Arshead (and many others).
