I saw this movie at Tribeca Film Festival and I must say that I thought it was amazing. The combination of humor and honesty really made the film useful. The film was about a 17-year-old boy whose mother and father are very religious. Seventeen-year-old Ben decides to work for a retired actress who teaches him about girls and driving and life. It's very comic and touching. I honestly have to say that this is one of my favorite movies now. I recommend this movie to everyone and everyone. If you haven't seen one of the performances at the film festival, it should come out in theaters throughout the year. Please look! It's a great movie.
