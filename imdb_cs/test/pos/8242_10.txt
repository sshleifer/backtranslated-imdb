As a child growing up in Sydney in the 1950s, I can easily identify with the content of this fine film. Every week I visited Wynyard Newsreel cinema on George Street where I watched Cinesound shorts (and usually 3 Stooges). There has never been a better blending of B / W and film color. Flawless production values ​​round off an unforgettable cinematic experience.
