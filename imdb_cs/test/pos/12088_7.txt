First of all, I would like to emphasize that I really enjoyed this documentary. Not only was it great music, but the shots and adjustments were also amazing. However, all these positive things about the film do not change the fact that it plays the Orientalist "The East meets the West" clichés that plague many Turks like me. This film tells the story of traditional and contemporary Turkish music in a very stylish way, which is a good thing to show ignorant Europeans and Americans that this country is not just about murdering Armenians and Kurds. The problem with the film, however, is that it looks at what it defines as "east" from the eyes of "the West." Just as one jazz musician in the film says that there may be no East and West, maybe it's just a myth, a lie created by the ruling leaders of the "Western" countries to keep the fear and hostility alive by continuing to rule the world and "keep the money flow" “? Why don't you think about it?
