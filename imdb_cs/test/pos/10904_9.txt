Kevin Kline offers a great comic turn in the IN & OUT comedy. Kline plays Howard Brackett, a small town history teacher who enthusiastically sits down to watch Academy Awards this year because one of his former students (Matt Dillon) is nominated. He is nominated for his performance in the film where he plays a gay soldier and when he wins, he thanks Howard in his speech for inspiring him because Howard is gay. Now this floor Howard, because he's no idea why you would say it on international television. Howard is even busy getting married (with Joan Cusack, in an Oscar-nominated performance), so he has no idea where Dillon's Cameron Drake got the idea of ​​being gay and finding out he has to defend himself at school, but is shocked that no one looked terribly shocked at what Cameron said at the Oscars. Howard has a birthday party where YENTL has a birthday gift like a soundtrack, and explains to his guests why Barbra Streisand had to do FUNNY LADY. His parents (Wilford Brimley, Debbie Reynolds) are shocked, but they promise to support their son, even if he is gay. He also gets a visit from outside the city reporter (Tom Selleck) who wants to make an article about him because he's gay too. The moment Selleck puts a big kiss on Kline's lips is a classic. But all these little things actually have Howard actually questioning his sexuality and wondering if he's really gay ... much to the deterioration and frustration of his fiance, Cusack, who is excited. The scene in which he leaves the bar in a wedding dress and stands in the middle of the street, screaming about the lack of individuals in the world is a classic. But what I like about this movie is how Kline fully invests in the role and is not afraid to look foolish or look gay. There is a wonderful scene, probably the most famous of the movie, where he buys a record of how to be a macho, and the guy on the record talks about how real men don't dance and the disco tune comes (I WILL BE RETURNING WHEN Memory Serves) and the narrator says on the record that no matter what you do, they don't dance, but Howard can't help and he ends up shaking things all over the room. It's hysterically funny and Kline plays it with sincerity and taste. The film is not for or against homosexuals ... it's just an agile and fun character study of a man trying to figure out exactly who he is. Nádherný film.
