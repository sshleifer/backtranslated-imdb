This film is about two horses who agree to escort a small group of Mormons across the desert. On the way, they meet the murderous family of criminals who threaten peaceful people and threaten their pilgrimage. WAGON MASTER is what I would call John Ford's "little" movie, as it obviously did not have the budget or scope of some of its western countries. In particular, this film lacks star stars like John Wayne, but allows some of the usual support characters to be brought into focus. Long Term Ford Action Character Actor Ben Johnson, Harry Carey, Jr. and Ward Bond was promoted to lead roles and possibly the one who came as "lead" was probably Johnson - although the other two got almost as many screens of time and focus. This is not a bad thing because the movie worked fine without a big star - and it's worth seeing. Now that doesn't mean I loved the movie. It was very good, but certainly not perfect. Especially when it comes to music, you'll probably love or hate it. Sometimes I found the Sons of the Pioneers a little schmaltzy. It caused a nice mood, but it seemed to dominate the scenes at times. I think it would work a little better. In addition, with their constant singing in the background, I still expected Roy Rogers to jump at any moment. Another minor problem is that the plot was incredibly simple and the end was largely a premature conclusion. However, and I am glad that there is a "nonetheless", though it is rather formative and sentimental, the film still worked well. This was primarily due to John Ford's handsome, as usual, the direction as well as Ben Johnson's exceptional performance. He was able to provide an excellent anchor for the film. Another plus for me is that I saw it in the same week as BRIGHAM YOUNG, another movie about Mormon migration. While BRIGHAM YOUNG was a bit stupid and too "holy" in his paintings, here Mormons were less "perfect" and more like real people - with ghosts and personalities. Oh, and when we talk about BRIGHAM YOUNG, Jane Darwell seems to have been "going to a girl" for Mormon-themed movies in this era because she was a significant supportive character in both movies. Since she died in BRIGHAM YOUNG and it was about 20 years before the WAGON MASTER, it's a sensation! Also, if you want to look into the famous Jim Thorpe, he is in a tiny role where he plays a heartless Indian dance next to Jane Darwell around the camp fire.
