Unlike http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098238/, this movie has no background information. We have shown a picture of the fall of Danton, its false process and execution, but if one has studied the revolution quite extensively, it is hard to understand where the characters come from (Fouquier-Tinville, Philippeau, Desmoulins, Robespierre ...) and appreciate them for what they are: Danton and Joe Blobb might be the same viewer. For example, Robespierre & Desmoulins have been close friends since they were young, which explains how Robespierre is acting. But those who know the facts can easily orient themselves and appreciate this good film with actors who provide solid acting, useless subplots and a good time reconstruction. Desmoulins and Danton are the best characters, but they all do a good job, even "demented" Saint-Just, who is depicted as a psychopath. "Terreur" was a period of massacres whose significance was not fully documented and which - for most parts - was driven by ambition, greed, and the settlement of personal disputes fed by unconscious sans-culottes as another epochal step against tyranny.
