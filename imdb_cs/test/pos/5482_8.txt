Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is harassed by Mitch Leary (John Malkovich), a bomber terrorist who literally believes he won't be caught. The introduction is every popular modern serial killer, "John Kramer" (Tobin Bell) of the Saw series. Thanks to clever planning and influence, Frank is able to arrest Mendoza (Bell). Since then it's a series of chase cats and mice. Malkovich is a great actor and incredibly versatile. Again, showing another role in this movie, he will amaze me with his ability to change his characters with another film. I looked at Malkovich playing Con Air as a horribly crazy crazy Cyrus, in Mouse and Men as a tragically challenged Lenny, to name a few. He plays a very clever bomber terrorist who is very sensible, but is deceived when he thinks he can escape his captives. Clint Eastwood is no one special to me. He's too old to do a lot in movies, so the only thing he can really impress with is his ability to create dramatic scenes. The characters he plays are simplified and one-dimensional. Rene Russo plays Eastwood's love of film in the movie and keeps me interested in the fact that in fact it's more important to me than Eastwood. Although it may seem like an action blockbuster, it's a fairly slow pace and is playing on expectations. You have to wait for the build up and the end and it pays off. On the way you will be fascinated by the chemistry of Malkovich and Eastwood and their scenes from cats and mice.
