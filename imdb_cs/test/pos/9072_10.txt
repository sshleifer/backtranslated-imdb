The Star Treasury Bull is phenomenal in this movie !! William Baldwin, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon and Julia Roberts !! This movie was also made in one of my favorite years, 1990! I am Chicagoan and the setting in Chicago was very well identifiable and also artistically accelerated. I liked this movie and the agitation that motivated the climax in this picture was a powerful element for the storyline that was absolutely sensational !! "Flatliners" are centered around a group of dissatisfied students who want to be flat to get some social justification !! When life doesn't make sense, it seems very illogical to be curious about apocalyptic nightmares !! At the same time, once their desperate curiosity gets out of them, there's no return! The King of the Hill (so to speak) is the one who vehemently shouts: GOOD TWO MINUTES !! WHO ARE TO DO THAT! Everyone wants to try TWO AND HALF !! Ultimately, all these newly accepted and very unwelcome accusations now have an extremely ubiquitous disposition in these lives! Consuming to their justified or unjustified pathos required a full 360-degree perspective on the issues they were tired of! Whatever the aim of all these unscrupulous and academic bullying, it's definitely an original approach to promoting your personality !! I liked this movie, the year 1990 was also a good year for me, so it seemed that this year it was coming! When I saw this movie on the night of November 1990, I was very glad I did it !!
