Years ago when I first read John Irving's World According to Garp, I was impressed that most of the young adults I had contact with didn't like it when I loved her. I began to understand that it was age and experience. I experienced some déjà vu when I read some of the comments on this site, which were clearly written by younger viewers. Enjoying Separate Lies is sure to be an age and an experience. In this film, the viewer sees a seemingly happy middle-class couple - a successful lawyer - the perfect wife of a successful lawyer. They have a townhouse in London and a home in the country. Everything is fine until he enters the "villain" in the mask of the son of the richest man in the village. This guy seems to be cad of "Go." He is disdainful of all and everyone, including his own children. In the traditional form of nice guys who ended up last, the lawyer's wife joins the border issue. You see, a lawyer is a really nice guy, but with a marital feature killing an organized perfectionist. Even if he really loves her, he bores his wife to death. Bad boy is much more exciting. All this is involved with the death of a man in the village, where all the facts point out that the vehicle driver is the driver of the vehicle. . It is easy to determine that this film does not create a happy ending, but leads to a very satisfactory ending when a person and his wife learn and grow from their experiences and are likely to be able to lead their personal lives in a more successful way. Three excellent actors play the main characters in this movie, and there are performances that make the whole thing a pleasure to watch. Tom Wilkinson is perfect as a husband. His depiction shows us a kind man who has so much control over his emotions that he has lost contact with the world. Emily Watson shows us a woman who has become so trapped in the role of a perfect woman that she almost lost her passion knowledge. This passion is reborn by the character skillfully played by Rupert Everett. If you have reached this point in your life, in which you understand that everyone has the feet of clay and that everyone - even with gifts of intelligence and opportunity - makes many bad decisions, then you will probably look forward to following these excellent actors who create the lives of three such people. This is a beautifully acted and directed adult movie about realistic adults.
