In New Year's Eve, the tuberculous sister of Salvation Army Edit (Astrid Holm) asks her mother and her colleague Maria (Lisa Lundholm) to call David Holm (Victor Sjöström) to visit her in her deathbed. Meanwhile, alcoholic David tells two other drunks at the cemetery the legend of the Phantom and his coachman: in accordance with the legend, the last sinner who died at the turn of the New Year becomes a soul collector. his coach. When David refuses to visit Edit, his friends have an argument with him, they fight and David dies. When the carriage arrives, he recognizes his friend Georges (Tore Svennberg), who died at the end of last year. George returns to parts of David's unpleasant life and in flashbacks, showing how mediocre and selfish David was. "Körkarlen" is an impressive and stylish silent film with beautiful special effects (for the 1921 movie). The characters are very well developed; however, the story is old and there is a peculiar and inexplicable situation when Nurse Edit says she loves David Holm. Why should an enlightened woman love such a despicable man who loses life unnecessarily to spoil other people? Despite being religiously dated today, he gives a beautiful message of faith and redemption at the end. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "A Carroça Fantasma" ("The Phantom Coach")
