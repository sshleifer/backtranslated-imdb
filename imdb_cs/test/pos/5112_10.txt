This is an excellent movie. There were several parts to the movie I liked. This movie is very fun! Visit the Ernest fun club website at www.ernestfunclub.com There are several movies, for example: Ernest goes to camp, Ernest saves Christmas, Ernest goes to jail, Ernest in the army, Ernest goes to school, Ernest goes Slam Dunk Ernest again I highly recommend these for family movies. All Stars Jim Varney Try Again to Visit www.ernestfunclub.com Which is Ernest's Best Movie? In my opinion, there are actually 2 Ernest Goes to Camp and Ernest goes to jail. So if you've never seen Ernest P. Worrell, it's time to go and see him. Can you find him quite satisfactory "no what I mean"?
