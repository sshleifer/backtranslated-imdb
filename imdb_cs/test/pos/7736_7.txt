William Shakespeare probably didn't imagine Stephanos being a gay doctor, Antonio as an unfaithful wife, or Caliban as a goatherd with Trinitron, but Bard's worse work on his good work, and even enjoy a sumptuous procession of life. it is his "Tempest" as re-configured by Paul Mazursky and co-writer Leon Capetanos. This time, Prospero is Philip Dimitrius (John Cassevetes), a Manhattan-based architect tired of designing the Atlantic City Casino for the amiable Mafioso Alonso (Vittorio Gassman), especially after the discovery of Alonso's sequel affair with Philip Antonio's wife (Gena Rowlands). Along with her daughter Miranda (Molly Ringwald), Philip escapes to a remote Greek island with Miranda and his new mistress Aretha (Susan Sarandon), a pretty Catholic girl who struggles with Philip's celibate lifestyle. Will the sudden storm bring all well at the end? Here's the idea of ​​Cassevetes' career: How many other actors could make a film so confused in something so stunning? The film critics' darling for his earlier work, often with his real wife, Rowlands, is a central character who truly suffers from his art here, but seems to enjoy it and also enjoy it. It's not Prospero, but something rich and weird that makes a great sea change all its own. "It's all here," says one of his loyal companions, Aretha Dog Nino. "Beauty, magic, inspiration and peace." That it is. "Tempest" will carry 1611 London to 1982 in Manhattan and find some nice resonances in Philip's displaced life. "Show me the magic" calls the stormy skyscape of the city and the Mazursky version, enriched with the jewelry of Donald McAlpin, set in purple seascapes and naturally Greek landscapes that are sunburned, he is doing. It's not a perfect movie. In fact, the grand finale, which is the only part of the film that follows Shakespeare's story to the true extent, is a mess. Rowland's character in this film is difficult to care for, and after meeting Sarandon in all her fame, it is hard to understand that Philip is still concerned about his wife, let alone his desire for the left field to make an unfortunate "victim" to restore the natural order of things. But the "Tempest" is a lot to be loved. In addition to Cassavetes, there is Ringwald's film debut as his loyal but troubled daughter, here as in a play of desire for the primitive rustic "Kalibanos" (Raul Julia). Ringwald here is much the same teenaged muse of privileged adolescence that would inspire John Hughes, but with the emotional depth those later Hughes movies did not go into. Ringwald and Julia have never received any Oscar attention, but both would have won the Golden Globes for their playful work. She tries to drag her into the island's isolation with her "Gunsmoke" TV reruns in Greek, tempted by her 15-year-old body. <br /> <br /> "I want you to have a balloon with my bonny johnny," Kalibanos claims to have surrendered aside, but equally won our sympathy, especially after "New York, New York" with the Goat Choir. (When "Tempest" hits the screen, Julia was a toast to Broadway as a lead in "Nine".) It's a Mazursky show, although it sometimes feels that Cassavetes is running things with an improvisation line of reading and emotional disorders galore. (Philip introduces Areth by telling her "I'm right in the middle of a nervous breakdown.") He plays his character as friendly possessed, trying to gel his happiness by building a theater in his otherwise uninhabited island. Adding to the pleasure of Gassman is a rich performance as a second man who is as friendly as Julia, while saying a young man-obsessed Philip: "Boys don't have as much resources as we have." Nervous ... and love in the back of an old sports car. "Despite being too long and challenging in places like so many artistic films," Tempest "is fun in its excesses and a trip very similar to Shakespeare intended, though his dreams do not involve smoking pot backstage for a Go-Gos concert.
