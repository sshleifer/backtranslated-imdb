At first, I didn't think Lauren Ambrose was anything but scaly, but as her character unfolded, the idea made more sense. Amy Madigan seemed too rigid for her role, and her characters did not close together, although it was obvious that her character was removed from the character played by Lauren Ambrose. Christopher Lloyd is a hit as usual and has played his part in encouraging the story. His character development left the audience wondering why he was punished by younger characters and could be completed more directly with <br /> <br /> The stunning glue for this somewhat vague story was played by Taylor Roberts. Her comprehensive delivery of simplistic characters kept the film together. In this key role, Taylor was able to encourage a realistic family relationship between the characters while acting as an antagonist for all other relationships in the film.
