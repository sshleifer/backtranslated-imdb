"Saratoga Trunk" is a 1945 film starring Ingrid Bergman and Gary Cooper. It is based on a 1941 book by the great Edna Ferber. She could unconsciously have a brain with the wind; parts of the story reminded me of GWTW. Clio Dulaine is an illegitimate child who has returned from New Orleans from France with a mulatto servant (Flora Robson) and a dwarf servant Cupidon. Jerry Austin). She gave the countess title and declares he's a widow. Her mother accidentally killed her father and his family avoided her. Clio takes over the old homestead with the idea of ​​shame of her father's half-sister and wife, which she does by drawing attention to herself. Her plan is to marry someone very rich who gives her confidence and respect. Then he notices Clint Maroon (Cooper), a Texas gambler and falls on him. They both have an unstable relationship - and they have no money, so they can't take it - so they leave for Saratoga Springs. Finally, the Dulaine family has enough, and her lawyer gives her $ 10,000 to get out of town. She does. She goes to Saratoga Springs and goes to the railroad owner, Bart von Steed. But Clint is always around. Bergman is beautiful in dark hair and wearing period costumes, and Cooper is a drop-dead gorgeous with an incredible 300 watt smile. He's behind me as she defended himself. And love scenes - who, what chemistry! The support cast is excellent, Robson and Cupidon create interesting characters, and Florence Bates gives excellent performance as a socially prominent woman who realizes the Clio is a big fake movie. The movie runs a long time, and some of the acting may seem old-fashioned today, but it's an immersive story full of atmosphere and live performances. The end will not come as a surprise. But it's a fun way.
