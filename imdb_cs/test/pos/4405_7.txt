For someone who is not familiar with the process of becoming a London cab, the film will have to be very average with a few laughs from several old faces. But knowledge comes into its own hands for the knowledge boys like me or their wife who know what these poor individuals are going through. And you'll find that you're comparing your own incidents with character events.
