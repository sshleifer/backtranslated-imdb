Kevin Tenney's "Demon Night" is a fun horror movie that reminds me of "The Evil Dead". At night Hallowen a group of teenagers throw a party at Hull House, a deserted funeral home on the outskirts of town. They lead Angel, they perform seance-like ceremonies and accidentally awaken the evil spirits who inhabit the place. One by one, an uninvited evil force has a teenager, turning them into bloodthirsty demons. "Night of Demons" is the perfect horror It's scary, bloody and pretty atmospheric. The characters are well developed and Steve Johnson's bitch is pretty good. There is a terrible impaling, tongue that is bitten, fingers poked in the eyes, etc. The scene where Suzanne (Linnea Quigley) thrusts a lipstick trumpet over her nipple is hoot.Give this look. Two sequels follow.
