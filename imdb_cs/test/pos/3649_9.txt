This is one of those Tweety and Sylvester cartoons that have made this legendary couple second only to Bugs Bunny in terms of Looney Tunes' popularity. Except that all the stock situations for this duo (Sylvester garbage feed) cans, "I tawt I'm taw putty tat" line, etc.), Tweety's SOS also Granny stars who's one of those types of support characters that these Warner Bros. classic was to abound in color and flavor. This time the cat and the bird aboard the ocean liner and the gags that are extracted from this situation are creative and lively. What day was in the cartoon when Friz Freleng decided to pair his Sylvester with Robert Clampett's little yellow bird.
