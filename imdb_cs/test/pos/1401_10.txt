Certainly, most people will call the "fishermen's island" stupid and cruel hokum, but can you honestly name one more film that gives a lot of exciting themes? The Italian gem is worth the fun and presents things like voodoo, volcanic eruptions, mutant fish creatures, the mysterious continent of Atlantis, treasure hunting, a remote island full of death traps and totally mad scientists! All this and much more in one simple movie? Yes please! Close-minded opponents of Italian cinema horror can easily mark this movie as a cheap exploitation version of "Dr. Moreau Island", but the truth is, it's much more! "Fisherman's Island" adds excitement and adventure from start to finish with surprisingly convincing special effects and a stunningly stylish camera. The story opens promisingly with a small group of inmates who survived the shipwreck on the shore of a tropical island. They meet the sadistic Edmond Rackham, who rules over an indigenous tribe and a legion of genetically engineered amphibious monsters who live in the island's swamps. There are so many twists and more parcels in the story that it's almost impossible to write a summary, but believe me, this gem is worth checking out. Once again, Sergio Martino proves that he is a brilliant filmmaker who has the talent to be both commercial and creative. It uses the beautiful location of the island and also the interior sets look very impressive. The overwhelming underwater shots and imaginative scenes really raise this film well above the normal standards of the late 1970s. I don't understand why Roger Corman has redesigned the original enough to release it on the US market under a different name ("Screamers") because there are very few elements to improve. Members of the cast are all regular Sergio Martino (with the exception of the great Joseph Cotton is an elegant support rule) and hand out great performances. If you manage to get your hands from a recently renewed German version, you'll be treated with up to fifteen outstanding minutes. You see it!
