This British film version of stage play I AM A CAMERA is based on "Israeli's" Berlin stories. This is the source material for the famous CABARET musical. Julie Harris, chief stage actress of her day, returns to her role as Tony Award in 1951 as Sally Bowles. She's far from Liza Minnelli, but the basic "Sally" is here despite the various movie codes that would block this story in Hollywood. Harris is maybe stagy, but he's also pretty good as a madman and mad Sally. Her singing number is of course dubbed (Marlene Dietrich not less), though Harris seems to sing for himself at other times. Laurence Harvey (with very ugly hair) plays Isherwood with zero magic and can't even make the character interesting. Shelley Winters and Natalie do little (Marian Winters won supporting Tony for the game) and Anton Diffring is fine as Fritz. Ron Randell plays caddish Clive, but it looks loud. Lee Seidl is funny as the owner. Yet, despite the total rigidity and cheap looks, Harris takes the spotlight and is amazing. This film was released in the same year as EAST OF EDEN, in which Harris publishes a glowing performance like Abra. Comparing both shows gives a good look at the talent that Miss Harris has. These two characters couldn't be more unalike. Harris' Sally booty and prances about and growls out a very lascivious laugh. She also acts circles around boring Harvey. Without music and with a well-known story, many viewers can find little to recommend this movie, but it's a great chance to see a big Julie Harris repeating what was probably very shocking in 1951.
