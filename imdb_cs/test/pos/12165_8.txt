After 10 tours in 20 years, I also thought it was Crazy Gang's best effort on film, with greater conspiracy than their best, "Alf's Button Afloat". They were really crazy trio of double-action acts that were thrown mainly on stage, sometimes before royalty, until Chesney Allen went through bad health in '40. He survived them all years. They seemed to be just as crazy out of "work", they were playing jokes regularly. The Six Wonders of the Six Wonders are the main lies in Alaska. digging the gold that was found there. It seemed like a better idea than going to Mansfield ... because they were there. When they get to Red Gulch, they find that their information is only 40 years older - they thought the chips in the wine newspaper had read that they were funny. But it doesn't matter how everyone fell in love with Snow White and wanted to help her grandson find his long lost gold hiding place. Baddie Bill "M" McGrew wants it alone. The number of verbal and visual words is overwhelming, but most of them will probably make sense (?) for British and ex-pats who are interested in seeing British b & w comedy. Imho almost all gags and work routines, including gold if Patter between Bud & Chesney and "Whistle When You Work" pastiche - even "Always Be Our Man" Mountie Inserts. Beautiful little movie, in a somewhat tired state, but fully recommended.
