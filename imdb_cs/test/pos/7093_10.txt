Not surprisingly, the majority of the higher ranking votes were submitted by women 45+. This is the timeframe in women's lives when they become administrators of old and sick parents. In June I lost my mother from the complications of cancer and went through most of the same emotions Zellweger portrayed in this film. Yes, it made me cry, but the tears were real, the characters were real, and the plot was very precise. Kudos to the entire cast and crew for a wonderful view of life and death and promises of tomorrow.
