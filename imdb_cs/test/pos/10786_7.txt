Barry Champlain is a radio-talk-show radio host in Dallas whose unmanaged ideas for a plethora of social problems are abolishing and insulting many of his callers and listeners. Is Barry a media messiah in search of truth or social misfit to attack his audience? It is an intense, provocative figure about a man with almost no redemptive traits, which at the same time seems to be on some really profound philosophy. While it's co-written and directed by Stone, it's really a Bogosian piece all the way and he's giving an amazingly hard and piercing performance that doesn't escape. Sometimes Barry is one of the stupidest characters to imagine, and everyone around him spews crazy misanthropy, especially those who care for him. But at the same time, he is strangely empathetic, hypnotic, sage, even nice. Bogosian's hawk features burn into the frame, green eyes constantly spreading around, as if constantly looking for an answer to a riddle. The film is basically an angry, self-righteous ranting against all the fanatics, injustice and banality in the world that culminated in the wild three and a half-minute rotation of Barry's single film, which brings I-hate-everything to the utmost. but the boy will wrap it up. Cast support is great, especially Greene as a former wife and Baldwin as boss. Robert Richardson's keen photograph will keep the single radio studio interesting and there's Stewart Copeland's tense score with a crawling cod that features The Penguin Cafe Orchestra's cute phone, phone and rubber band. If you're unknown to Bogosian, look at his amazing talent in this movie - like his contemporaries, Bill Hicks and Denis Leary, it's someone who rarely appears in mainstream media, purely because his writing is out there. I find the variable Stone's Movies; I don't care much about his great achievements, but when he is more structured and objective, like Salvador and Nixon, he is much more penetrating and imprisoned. Big primal scream based on Bogosiana, inspired by the real story of Alan Berg, a host of a radio talk show in Denver that was murdered by neo-Nazis in 1984.
