It was sad that the COMMITTED only lasted two weeks in the Dallas theaters. I thought this movie has a lot to do with it. The script was fun, full of subtle emotional shifts and had good news. Acting was great. Everyone did a great job, especially with the subtlety of the script. Not only does Heather Graham have beautiful eyes, she has strong eyes. For this purpose, all the actors were attractive! Why didn't it do well in his theatrical release, I don't know - other than the studio seemed to be pushing him hard. But it deserved to do it better and I hope it will do well on video. It's definitely one of my favorites in the first half of 2000.
