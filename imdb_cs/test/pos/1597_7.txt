Movie split viewers. Only criticism points to his burial pace, exaggeration and constant, persistent views among the protagonists. Advocates point to the powerful performance of Dirk Bogarde and the benchmarking photo of Pasqual De Santis Venice. Overall, this could suggest a leniency, a romanticized elegy for the nobility of homosexual love (at that time, 1971, when it became consensually legal). In fact, Visconti managed to produce a richer, more complex film than a single-purpose vehicle. He confuses his thoughts - weaknesses and all - in a carefully circumvented arc. Inside it is indeed the central headquarters of Aschenbach Bogarde. Rather than being a recent homosexual gay man, Johnny, he succeeds in giving a pathetic composer defeated by tragedy and misunderstood integrity that sees salvation in Tadzi. His enchanting stunning past ever more infernal Venice after the boy is a direct metaphor for the artist's tenacity for truth in the teeth of a dilettant crowd (and this is explicitly limited by such a flashback). Mahler's music may be somewhat exaggerated, though well appropriated. The Italian overdub is wearing anachronism, but fortunately it does not suffer too much. 7/10
