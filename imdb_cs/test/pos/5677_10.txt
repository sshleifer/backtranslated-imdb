BLACK WATER must be one of the best Australian films I've seen in many years. My girlfriend and I were sitting and clasping our hands, jumping in all the right places. This is just as crocodile as OPEN WATER was a shark movie. In other words, creatures are only part of a dilemma, a trap in which people find themselves in circumstances. As director Andrew Traucki and David Nerlich wonder how much tension and fear of such a humble situation is amazing to watch it unfold. And when I say horror, her overwhelming, artificially created moment, she touches more on the fact that if you ask yourself "how would I feel in this situation" will lead you to the conclusion "without fear". The performances were great, the pace and beautiful cuts to another life in the mangroves were great and the final moments of the film felt very good. This is a suitable feature-length debut for two directors who are right to be proud of. Go and watch this beautifully shot picture and thrilling movie.
