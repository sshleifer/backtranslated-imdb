I have reasons to love big camera users; the flow of action suits fast adventure and comedy narration; but such skill in the hands of King Vidor or Anthony Mann can also be used to work at the level of ideas. This is Paul Wendkos' masterpiece. His plot can be sold in one pair of sentences. General Hector Cordoba is preparing as an emperor in northern Mexico and has stolen a huge cannon from General Blackjack Pershing. he sends his missionary unit, divided, feared, but determined, led by George Peppard to return the cannon back and return Cordoba alive to end the rebellion. Charismatic Raf Vallone plays Cordoba; the ladies in the work are Giovanna Ralli and Francine York; the team was made up of Nico Minardos, Peter Deuel and Don Gordon. Other devotees in the class include John Larch and John Russell. Also, horning in an already fantastically dangerous operation is Miss Ralli and the stubborn Mexican Teniente (Gabriela Tinti), whose regiment was betrayed when Cordoba set up itself. The danger is multiplied when Gordon's brother is picked up by a spy, captured and tortured when he has to watch ... and he decides to kill Peppard. The attack that captures the cannon when Peppard's orders are not obeyed by the regular type of army is one of the most electrified visual and staging achievements in film history; the penetration of Cordoba Fortress, the revelations revealed there, and the actions that the mission team will win the victory - or almost victory - are flawlessly presented. It is a beautiful color adventure film with unusually strong costumes, acting, lighting, artistic direction sets and music by Elmer Bernstein. Stephen Kandel's script is probably his best ever for a feature film. This is probably the most precious main Western at the moment, but I have always appreciated his heroes as a result - getting hard workers. But as Peppard reminds his group on the way home, "The problem of being a" hero "- is morning after". To find out why it says, you'll need to see "Cannon For Cordoba".
