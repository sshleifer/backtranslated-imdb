Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is a teacher who is about to marry. Then one of his former students wins an Oscar for a film in which he plays a homosexual soldier and, thanks to Howard, his acceptance, which he interpreted as a gaya! The film follows the consequences when reporters descend on Howard's village and try to convince everyone that he is equal. <br /> <br /> I love this movie! Kevin Kline is amazing, has some really funny moments and always amazes me with a huge smile on his face. That is why it is one film that I enjoy watching as often as possible. If you haven't seen it, you're missing!
