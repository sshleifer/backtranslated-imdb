Giorgino is a strange, dark, obsessive object; casting is impressive, plot is powerful, reminded me of the stories of Edgar Poe. It's probably not a masterpiece, but it leaves us remembering strong images, soft music, fear, sadness, confusion, and a sentence that says everything: wolves come. GIORGINO is now quite forgotten, and when it was released, nobody felt it. It is a pity. If you ever had a chance to see it, then ... try it.
