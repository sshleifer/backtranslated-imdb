I wonder if I heard from director Barbet Schroeder why he decided to make his first film More, specifically his interest in hippies - or rather this form of euro-hippie paradise - and their demise. The film is at least so true that someone is interested in it, but it is strange, biased in its own truth. It's a given heroin (aka, "Horse") is a terrible thing, rotten, conclusions for many stupid drug users who see it's all-end-all because it basically is: after everything else stops, it becomes a life, either continuous operation for the same or death. More begins as something about a romance between a New York girl and a German man, but becomes something else for better or worse (sometimes both in the same scene). It is basically two "young people, Estelle and Stefan, who meet in the city where Stefan came as a kind of rogue from his homeland. He is also wandering and maybe too friendly with a large-scale pusher named They end up on a remote island somewhere nearby and, after a somewhat bold grip for any "horse" Estelle, they also find a mat in the form of a seemingly remoter house along the coast. Lucid and intelligent so many years later, it is both direct and subtle, more about characters, and then that what he displayed could be in other hands just a propaganda image exploiting a hippie. Schroeder uses a long sequence from Bergman's Summer with Monika to inspire two children in a relentless connection, something good to determine Not so good against (too?). <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I should mention that there are problems, some large. The performances are not very convincing; a few scenes strike some strength or have an actor in good ties, but Klaus Grumberg overlaps himself, even though he is naturally in nature in German (in which case I would prefer Klaus Kinsky in that part to make it crazier) ), as well as Farmer's own study. And there are gaps in the script that prevent her from being as deep as she really thinks. On the other hand, there are two big things to do: Nestor Almendros, a great cameraman (ie Heaven Days) is a DP and it's a big support for a director like Schroeder. Almost every picture is seen with an amazing purpose or art, whether it be the cliffs of the sea or the sun, or something as simple as the seemingly natural light of the room. The second thing is Pink Floyd, probably the main reason I and many others heard about the film first (years before I knew who Schroeder was, I saw the "More" soundtrack when I was looking for Pink Floyd albums). It is a very good music all the time, sometimes a stunning variety that gives them the reputation they deserve. Some of them are also a little boring, even though it is a movie that relates to free love and lots of drugs and sometimes both at the same time. I wouldn't place it anywhere near as high as Meddle or Animals, certainly not Dark Side, but it also helps to raise the subject by another notch, especially when it least expects it, or in low tones or floating in buildings and outside buildings like Stefan or other walks around streets. It is almost a better atmosphere than the film deserves, but overall it is worth seeing it as a period that is a piece but strong, a less ambitious but more significant point of Zabriskie.
