I felt that Rupert Grint had a promise from his role that everyone knew him. So even though I never heard of this movie when it appeared in my cable TV listings, I immediately switched to that channel. I'm so happy I did it! I have read from other reviewers that they generally do not like the advent of age stories; On the other hand, I do it pretty well. I am one of those who always come of age; I have been since I was 12 years old, I am 52 and I will probably continue until I am 92 years old. The advent of age is nothing more than to suddenly realize the opportunities it brings the next day. The sudden execution, its size, sometimes throws us into disarray. If we try to protect our delicate self, then yes, I can see how the end of the age can end. But if we just dedust ourselves and settle in the new direction we've discovered, then we're on a new path and we're as alive as we were yesterday, just stronger, brighter and more interesting. So this is the movie. That was the coming of an age story all the time; young Ben, his father, father Robert, and certainly Dame Evie ... all went through a wonderful transformation. In fact, just like Mr Fincham, right? I suspect that it has done it all, except that the mother, despite her enormous opportunity, provides the end of the film. One is left with the feeling that it will continue on the very same path to which it is, with just another supportive cast. An excellent film that could not be made in America, which is totally depressing to think about, but thanks to God we still have the supplies of films made elsewhere that we will occasionally see. I really heartily recommend this movie if you don't mind that you mingle with the parts that are all too familiar to us, and we smile all through it.
