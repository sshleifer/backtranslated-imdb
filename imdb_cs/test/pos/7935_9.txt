Eisenstein describes his collaboration with Prokeviev as an equal partnership, where they worked together to match the image and music, scene by scene. Unfortunately, audio recording was a disaster, so for once devotion to the authenticity in the Criterion DVD's backfires. Fortunately, there is at least one renewed version of the film at VHS (BMG Classics) with excellent re-recording of the music (St. Petersburg Philharmonic and Choir). It's interesting to compare this film with contemporary propaganda films in England, Germany and the United States. Eisenstein's film was made in 1938, in response to the fear of the German invasion; and Olivier's in 1943, when the German invasion of England was still expected. Both films are theatrical, but in different ways. Olivier begins with the performance of a staged performance at the Globe Theater in Shakespeare's own company, then takes us from the theater to a film (though stylized) environment. Eisenstein's film is cinematic from the beginning, but dialogue and speeches are still influenced by the melodramatic gaming conventions of the old Russian theater. This works very well for Cerkassov's speeches like Alexander, because part of his work as a prince and military leader was to play a role in the public. In Nazi Germany, the first major propaganda film was Leni Riefenstahl's boring Triumph of Will, which saw a huge political spectacle - mass crowds cheering on Hitler's gaudy speeches. The propaganda in her masterpiece, the 1936 Berlin Olympics, is more subtle, with the worship of the athletic male body carrying the disturbing undertones of the Aryan superiority myth. Also, German war propaganda films can be subtle. Typical is Urlaub auf Ehrenwort from Karl Ritter (Furlough on Word of Honor). This shows that a young lieutenant let a man in his company go on a 24-hour vacation before returning to the trenches of World War I (and almost certain of death). Against the advice of veterans, he accepts their word of honor to return, even if he is judicial and shot, if not. Naturally, everyone is returning (though some of them are throwing it), probably an inspiring audience to similar manifestations of duty in their country. In the United States, one of the best propaganda films of World War II was the Air Force Howard Hawks'. In it we watch the bomber crew disagree with each other's battle experience, and overcome obstacles to continue their part of the war. Typically, for Hawks' films, their true loyalty is more than just in their country. Eisenstein has to achieve history to find some Russian military triumphs. Ironically, Alexander (as well as other Russian princes) comes from the Vikings who sailed on Russian rivers to conquer and rule their own fiefdoms. So he's a conqueror who repels other potential conquerors. Physically, they are not so different (although actors depicting German princes were obviously chosen for their ugliness and sneering foolishness). But the real contrast is among ordinary soldiers. Russian peasants are as high and strong as nobles; whereas the German peasants who leave the shield wall to kill the wounded Russians are a bit shorter than their masters. There is some historical truth in this contrast. Russian serfs in the Middle Ages were much better than their European counterparts because they could always escape into the wild and clean their own land. Eisenstein's film also cleverly gives us a first look at Alexander the fisherman. In battle with the Germans, he uses his fishing knowledge of ice as well as his knowledge of their military tactics to defeat them. When Gavrilo breaks the shield wall, they are forced to rearrange and flesh on the west side of the lake, where the ice is thinner. One of the other pleasures of Eisenstein's film (which most of the audience lacks) is the historically accurate way of portraying the politics of medieval Russia. Cities like Pskov and Novgorod owed their growing wealth and prominence largely to business, which gave traders to power, and sidelined princes until their military knowledge and feudal benefits were needed to repel the invaders. In the film, Alexander is shown not only as a military leader, but also as a politician, who knows how to wait for his time, and how to make the most of his popularity after victory.
