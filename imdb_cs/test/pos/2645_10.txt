That was such a great movie. It was with such a beautiful design, such symmetry. I love the way classical music ties to the classical art of the country, space and beyond. It was so smooth and he thought he was provoking a masterpiece. I loved the way monoliths never changed, even though it was primate, earth and universe. I loved how it was the question "Do you need me / us now"? The film expressed desire, peace, love, curiosity, subtlety, gentleness, courage and innocence. What more can you want from a mere movie? Perhaps a movie addition. Any 2001 award winner: Space Odyssey Film Finds 2010 is a 2001 film supplement. 2010 is more story-oriented than in 2001.
