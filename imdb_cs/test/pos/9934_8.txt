After the main opera actress was murdered in a car accident, her youngster, Betty, came to the fore. This is good luck for her, with one problem: she has an admirer who has decided to kill all her friends and watch. What is his connection with opera and what is his fascination with Betty? <br /> <br /> I love Dario Argento with every part of my body. I don't think I'm an orthodox fan. Many people, particularly critics, praise his earlier work ("Suspiria" and "Deep Red") but really frowned on later movies, such as "Sleepless", which I liked. My favorite, "phenomena" is usually extremely underestimated. "Opera" tends to fall somewhere between. Some consider it one of their last great movies, others consider it part of their so-called decline. I loved it. The picture is sharp, music is great (unlike other critics, I love the metal soundtrack), female leadership is someone I can feel on (unlike Jennifer Connelly of "Phenomena"). And the pictures ... beautiful. Great cinematography and some amazing killing scenes. The concept of uploading needles to a person's eyes so they can't blink ... brilliant. My assistant, Tina, thinks it looked fake, but even if she does, the idea is more than enough to pay off. And some great effects like a knife blade coming into the mouth of a man? Amazing. Jim Harper calls the film "overwhelming" and highlights "innovative cinema, well-designed shots and extremely violent murders". I totally agree with this - one shot follows the camera through the winding tunnels and the visual use of the crow is very interesting throughout the story. Mike Mayo also calls it "visually fascinating eye candy" and praises "sharp editing and smooth camera work". It's really surprising that it's not one of Argento's more high-praised works. Argento returned to the opera with "Phantom of the Opera", which was a bit of a failure despite the cast of his daughter Asia and Julian Sands. Even more interesting, the same year offered the release of Michele Soavi's "Stagefright", which (like "Opera") has a killer free inside the theater killing people involved in the presentation. Both are great movies, with Soav more on the slasher side. (Soavi actually served as the second director of "Opera" ... you can make your own conclusions.) <br /> <br /> My only complaint about this movie is the length and pace. Although it is very beautifully shot and scene killing is wonderful, they are not as common as they should be. The first takes more than half an hour and then we get between them. The leading actress should be in constant terror, but she is given the time between killing to calm down, as if everything is normal. Not cool, Daria. We need to keep the tension low and high intensity.
