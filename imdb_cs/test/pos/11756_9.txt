They will start the matter, despite the huge chances of adultery and racial issues. In 1950s Hollywood, an interracial romance was allowed but only with severe consequences at the end. Beautiful scenery of Hong Kong (although some beach scenes look like studio-bound), famous title melodies, poetic script, beautiful background music (Alfred Newman), great costumes, excellent performances, especially Jones (directed by Henry King, who also did "The Song of Bernadette - 1943, Oscar for Jones", still makes her a world-famous romance.
