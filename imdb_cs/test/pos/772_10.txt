Beautiful movie. The one who made me think of God, but I didn't feel guilty or overwhelmed. I was thinking about death, but I'm not afraid, think about life, but don't hide from it. The film, which gave both love to everything I stand for and at the same time condemned it to the deepest pit of hell. A movie that made me think about love and everything I lost, but no sadness bothered me for some strange reason, relief. Child of two worlds, god and theater. And a little wine and irony! Most recommend ***** <br /> <br /> "When S *** hits a fan, get a tent" Oh and we should all go camping. Daily.
