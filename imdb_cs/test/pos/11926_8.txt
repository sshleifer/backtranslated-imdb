I rarely have films about smart teenagers who have authority issues, but "Toy Soldiers" grew with me with repeated glances. That's so much a movie about Billy Tepper grew up and became an adult like anything else, and I give credit to Sean Astin and writer / director Daniel Petrie Jr. for not making a big deal, but letting it just unfold and sneak at you. The friendship of Tepper's friends, their grief over Joey's death, and their joy of survival, all are moving. And I have to admit that I will take some patriotic (and maybe even a little reptile) pleasure when the US Army guys finally move and just kick some narcotic ass. Ooh-rah, General Kramer! A heroic Robert Folk score is a cherry on top. I'm sure I could find a hundred reasons why I don't like "Toy Soldiers," but if we don't take it seriously, I don't see a need. This is one of the funniest "bad" movies in my pantheon.
