I can differ from many people on this album, but I enjoy watching the Mind Of Mencia. The reason I love Mind Of Mencia is the host, not afraid to speak his mind or use stereotypes. Carlos Mencia does what we all do with our friends, but we don't want to confess and then some. Mencia has no problem making jokes about any race, religion, gender or orientation. While it has a lot of flack for it, there is a breath of fresh air in these politically correct times. Mencia doesn't care if he offends anyone, but he's not a racist and even jokes about his own race. Fun persons or recent events. Mencia then comes out and does 5 or 6 minutes to get up where he talks about various issues. The show then has 2 separate parodies divided by ads. In these parodies Mencia does various things like joking people, giving their personal opinions with a funny twist, or just making a parody of people, events or movies. At the end of the show, Mencia will come out for a minute with either one final parody or something else he says. Carlos does just what everyone else thinks about certain races but is afraid to say. As for Menci, who is offensive, he speaks only with his mind. I can't find anything wrong with that. The show is not perfect. The loops don't get together and sometimes Mencia does her jokes. Mostly, however, it is a show where a comedian says what's in his mind, no matter what the consequences and what they are in the humorous thing. So if you are not afraid to laugh at stereotypes and see someone who speaks his mind and often say what you wanted to say then watch Mind Of Mencia. However, if you are easily offended, you should not watch this show because you will be offended, or worse, you may even laugh.
