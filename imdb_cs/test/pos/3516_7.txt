A quick look at the premise of this movie would only suggest another stupid and backwood slash-fest. the type where sex equals death and the actors are all the unpleasant stereotypes you actually want to die. However, "JBD" brings much more. Rather than focusing on the bare body and gore (though there is a bit of every-no sex however), the swing focuses on providing impending fear / fitting tension amidst a beautiful scenic background. These feelings are further enhanced by the cast of realistically sympathetic characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil. Oh yeah - George Kennedy is here too, and when isn't that a good thing? <br /> <br /> If you like "Wrong Turn" then watch this to see where the whole methodology comes from.
