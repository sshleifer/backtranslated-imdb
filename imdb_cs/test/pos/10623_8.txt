Reading in the commentaries seems absurd about La Pianiste's emotional banality. It's hard to understand due to the excellent performance of Isabelle Huppert. Huppert is graspable - he manages to hand over to a woman on the edge, full of hatred and delusion. The film is wonderfully stimulated and judged. It would be so easy to portray lead as a ridiculous character - such as a scene in a porn store. Huppert is able to carry him away, partly because of his brilliant performance, but also because the director makes her unreal life real and identifiable. Don't ignore this movie. It's one of the most surprising and engaging movies (and performances) I've seen. <br /> <br /> Trust Boris!
