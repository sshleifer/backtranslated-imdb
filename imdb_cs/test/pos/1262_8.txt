That was a great movie in just 67 minutes. The film-noir aspect has appeared in this film, and I'm glad Nolan was shooting him in black and white. The storyline is simple but fun that keeps you active. Even dialogue was good along with acting. It reminded me of what Mement had to do by not being in chronological order. I liked the way the main character tried to use what Cobb had taught him, for example, by "everyone having a box" into which he put his personal belongings. Also on the writer's door was a batman logo that looked ironic because Christopher Nolan would later direct Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, two more great movies. In the end, there is a great procedure I don't want to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it, even though I thought what would happen if Cobb gave the young man D a Lloyds credit card. I also liked how the writer had a copy of the Republic of Plato, one of my favorite philosophical books. This is definitely the movie you need to watch more than once to get it all over, plus it's just an hour long. There is also a circular aspect to it by ending where it started which I thought is quite brilliant.
