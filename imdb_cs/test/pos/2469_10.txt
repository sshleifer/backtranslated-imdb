The most intense and powerful movie I've seen in years. There were other movies before he plunged into Vietnam Vet, but nothing compared to this emotionally heartbreaking movie, such as the typical American suburban family, around 1972, is falling apart in seams, revealing the scars that Vietnam has left our all our collective souls . The cast is fantastic and ++++ with all four actors (with Kathy Bates stand-out), which gives impressive performances. It's amazing on this film that you don't take any parties, but you understand and feel the four characters, even though all four have different opinions and needs. There are scenes that are as powerful as family secrets and feelings are revealed (such as confrontation between a son and a mother) that will exhaust you emotionally and have tears of anxiety. I actually cried in this movie, something I rarely do. The shocking ending is overwhelming! A much overlooked movie that should be seen. I rate this 1996 movie a great piece. I highly recommend this day and age, our country is embroiled in an ugly war, our headlines were screaming atrocities and again, our young men and women returning with profound psychic scars, with deep pains of deeds done in honor. He must see the movie.
