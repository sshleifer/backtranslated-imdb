It doesn't matter what this socially retarded person says, this show is cheerful. It shows how many free men are in a bar atmosphere and also shows that women are not as trusting as men think. <br /> <br /> The competitive aspect of being really cool and original. It's not a standard reality show that we're all used to for days. Give her a chance to everyone, we're just one episode, we finally have some Canadian programming that's not absolute stupid. As Canadians we usually get, Bon Cop, Bad Cop or Corner Gas. Let's show people that we're not all as careful as the previous reviewer. A way to go Comedy Network, giving a new show a chance. The panel is fun and the contestants are still pretty good.
