I gave these films 7 out of 10. I think the general resistance to this film is due to the fact that people really don't understand the plot. If you think about the story this movie actually makes perfect sense, it just never gives you a dumbed-down explanation. It is true that special effects are subpara and it seems to be a low budget, but I think that the originality of the plot will take you inside. People say the vampire genre is exaggerated and clich√©, but with Bled what you get is not your conventional vampire movie. It's a story about a dream / alternative reality with a vampire / eternal life. I loved it. The only thing that kept me from giving him a higher rating was a lack of special effects, and I personally don't like movies where most people have accents. But as I said before, if you really do, it's not a bad movie.
