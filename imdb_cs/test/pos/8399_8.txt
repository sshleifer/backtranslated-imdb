When I read and watched Gone With The Wind, he found it very difficult to compare this film to the original. Though I thought Scarlett, the novel, was excellent, the film did not add up. It was a completely different story. Of course, except for Leigh and Gable, there will never be another Scarlett and Rhett, but the new actors did a great job. I loved the way the book and film wrapped up the story of Gon and the wind, because after reading it, I felt an increase in disappointment because he stopped and let the reader wonder what had happened. Scarlett completes the story very well and Alexandra Ripley made a great book. I just want the film to watch the story more, even if it is great in itself.
