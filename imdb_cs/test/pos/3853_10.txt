The Duchess is a beautiful white cat who lives with her three kittens in the mansion of her wealthy owner in Paris. When an evil servant hears that a rich old lady leaves everything in her will, the cat first is a servant angry because she wants to get everything first. So he can put them to sleep and leave them off the road. When the cats wake up, they start on a long journey home. A street wise cat named Thomas O'Malley meets them and offers them help. When Edgar sees them coming home, he is enraged and starts sending them to Timbuckt. But Thomas' friends come to help save the day. A rich lady decides to leave her home for every cat in Paris. It's a charming movie. Songs, including "Everyone wants to be a cat", are alive and positive. The voice cast is excellent, with Eva Gabor (who would later play Miss Bianca in Disney's RESCUERS movies) as Duchess, Phil Harris (Baloo in JUNGLE BOOK, Little John in ROBIN HOOD) as Thomas, giving interesting personalities to their characters. Probably Walt Disney, before he died in 1966, put this film into motion. Recommended for Disney fans or cat lovers everywhere! 10/10.
