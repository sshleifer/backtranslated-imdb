Skenbart takes place in the 1940s, just after World War II. The main character Gunnar (Gustav Hammarsten) ends his job to get a chance to "change" in the bombed post-war Europe. He packs the book of his favorite filisopter Ludwig Witgenstein and sets out on a journey that eventually proves that Witgenstein's famous statement is true: Nothing is what it seems. There are two main parcels and a few parcels, to this film, which takes place on a train heading for Berlin. Writer / director Peter Dalle (who also plays the role of conductor of the train) compiled an impressive cast including Swedish legends Lena Nyman, Gösta Ekman and Robert Gustafsson. Overall, acting is excellent. Skenbart offers a somewhat twisted grotesque comedy combined with finer black humor (such as a nun who loses faith and begins to curse). It's like Killinggänget meets Peter Jackson (Braindead, Bad Taste) in Schindler's List. I laughed during most of the movie and when I woke up in the morning I laughed even more. An intelligent movie for fans of Swedish comedy.
