Colonel Chabert is one of the best adaptations of the novel to the screen I have seen in movies. It combines the realism of French cinema with excellent characterization, from lost Chabert Depardieu to the proud lawyer Fabrice Luchini to the complex widow Fanny Ardant. The film has an amazing dimension as you might expect from a top-notch cameraman like Yves Angelo. The characters keep this movie in the device and although a bit slower at the beginning, it picks up the pace and is a fine film at the time it reaches the goal.
