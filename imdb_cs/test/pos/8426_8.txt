Here's one of Jane Austen's movies, which I found very pleasant. I read a book that I first listened to on a CD, and wondered how a young Victorian girl might be convinced to marry a man she loved because of her lack of happiness or education. The joy of Anne being apparently reconciled to lost love. The fact that her godfather is trying to marry her for good for nothing for a cousin who is just for money. Looking at the snobbies that come from the higher classes and how class differences can divide couples from following their hearts. Captain Wentworth realized that Anne still loved after 7 years. His final understanding that Anne's love was constant all the time and that she would not allow her family to interfere with her true happiness and possible marriage to the one she truly loved.
