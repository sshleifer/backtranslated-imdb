You can't really say Roy Andersson fertile, (6 movies in 37 years). You can't even blame him for being conventional; he does not do "straightforward", at least as far as narration is concerned. His first film in seven years, "You, Living", is like a surrealistic documentary in which a large number of characters are observed that do nothing, and if it sounds out of the game, let me assure you that it isn't. It is a witty, accessible and surprisingly warm movie that is very far from the movie we commonly see on screen. Of course, the "slice of life" is hardly the right moniker to apply to this movie because the lives of most people are not as it would be. On-screen events trigger a range of almost frighteningly ordinary to utterly shocking, and while characters may fade, sometimes never see, others reappear as if interested in approval, Andersson gives them all kind affection. This, and some flashing music, ensure that the time spent with them is a good time.
