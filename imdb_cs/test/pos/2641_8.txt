While I keep his predecessor, "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," as the standard to which other teen comedies should be compared, "Wildlife" is one of the better lesser known films from that time-and worthy following, if you can call it . I believe his slogan is: "From FTARH creators, something even faster." That's definitely true. Although it may lack the depth of the former which deals with issues like first dates, teen sex and abortion, "Wildlife" is, however, a great movie. It's pure chaotic fun, especially because Chris Penn is at the top, Thomas Drake. If Spicolli were high on coke instead of weed, he would be Drake. Eric Stoltz, in his first lead role, is great as a straightforward Bill Conrad. Two characters work fine. Think younger, crazier Odd Couple, complete with a shine of 80 years. Beyond that, there are so many other great things worth mentioning on this movie. Lea Thompsom never looked harder, especially in the scenes of her store business. Jenny Wright is simply delicate and fun to watch. Rick Moranis plays a great nerd who dies to get into his pants. Thomas Drake's wrestler mates are hysterical, especially Benny, a little Puerto Rican guy who says some pretty memorable lines. One of them shouting at the club during the night had me on the floor for the first time. It says something! Finally, the film ends with one of the best 80th party scenes on the film, at all. Take a look at a special show by Ron Wood from the Rolling Stones, Leo Penn (Sean Dad and Chris Penn) and Michael Jackson's random appearance at the party. Throw a score to anyone other than the man, Eddie Van Halen, and you can't go wrong. For fans of Van Hagar, keep your ears open for riffs that would be found on such albums as 5150, OU812 and For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. If something breaks the flow of the movie, it's a small subplot involving Randy Quaid as a burnt out vet in Vietnam. It seems to be useless and unnecessary. Otherwise, it's almost perfect. If your fan of mindless but entertaining movies of the 80s and haven't seen this yet, you're something special. RENT THEM !!! <br /> <br /> p.s.-credits say Cameron Crowe has a portrait as one of the cops in the movie. He has a back during his scene because I can't find him yet. Somebody please help me.
