The film is not for everyone. Some may think that acting is bad when it is actually underestimated and natural. There are clearly no evil actions, and there are no amazingly beautiful moments. There is a lot of indecision, lots of conflicting feelings. Actually, this film has a very honest look at a very complex subject, Sex with Minors. It's complicated because the characters try to cope with love and sex when their body and hormones are constantly evolving and both their minds and personalities are constantly evolving. It is also complex because society has a very simplistic view of sex with minors and complexity because the characters don't know whether the company is right or whether their instincts are right. Some do not like the movie because it leaves unanswered questions. Questions like the one who was in charge of the relationship that had been damaged came out well, it was an art that was more damaged, some problems with their relationship stemmed from the fact that society was forbidden, made any problems stem from their own immaturity and probably the most important was this crime? The film is definitely neutral in this respect and it's neutrality. It is a reason for underestimating games, simple sets, lack of background music, soft lighting and a generic "flat" presentation. The message is empty. We really don't understand this kind of relationship today, and quick decisions must be shallow.
