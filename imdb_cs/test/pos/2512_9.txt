This movie often appears on premium cable channels and I find that I keep watching it. The performances are amazing and the material happens so much that there is always something new that takes away from the film. Perhaps I am too often distracted while watching movies at home when watching movies, dog bark, phone rings, popcorn ends up on credit. But this film is about people and what motivates us, what animates us, what causes us a contradiction between us and what inspires us. <br /> <br /> For me, these are films like The Love Letter that keep me up to date with new movies. Frankly, I am surprised that the film is not known. I'd like to see Blythe Danner and Geraldine McEwan in many other roles. It's a pleasure to watch. Kate Capshaw is amazing and I had no previous idea that she was. Ellen DeGeneres plays a role that is much more complicated than just being a comic relief. <br /> <br /> This film provides interesting visuals as a suitable background for characters and their interactions. It seems to me that it's refreshing every time I look at it.
