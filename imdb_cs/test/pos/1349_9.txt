It is a film that has all the essential elements of its genre. It wants you to cry, makes you laugh, it's disgust, makes it angry, etc. <br /> <br /> The topic of the story is fortunately not about some diseases or drugs, which is a common trend in gay themed movies these days, but focuses the social interactions between the characters that could be considered not in the high school elite. The game and direction could be a little more sophisticated, but on the other hand it is a little better because it really shows the anxiety of the characters they are experiencing. If it was intended, then it is a remarkable job and certainly a success, especially for such a young director. It's actually a good story that gives you a little inside, how it feels to be a fat girl and recognize it for yourself.
