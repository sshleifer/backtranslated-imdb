As a local performer, I thought "Grease" was showing what Broadway producers were looking for, and emphasized a small piece of the acting population. Although my favorites didn't win (but came in second), I enjoyed comparing them and saw what I liked and where I could perform as a performer. They brought Olivia Newton-John because she is the obvious link between Broadway production and the television audience. They sang songs from the film ("Hopelessly Devoted", et al) because these songs will be included in the new production. <br /> I agree with an earlier comment that B'Way's cast looks much older, but you have to remember that these are the people who were on Broadway and worked their tails to be there. If the whole cast was green and fresh, then I believe it would jeopardize the casting process by which producers choose their talents.
