This movie blew me away - I only saw two episodes of the show, I never saw the first movie, but went to the pre-screen where Johnny Knoxville himself introduced the movie, telling us to "turn off our sense of moral judgment in an hour and a half." As a film, this would probably be a measure of 2, given it has a zero plot, no structure except randomness, and a very small production value.That is not the reason.All in our theater laughed and gasped all the way - not just that some of the stunt creatives (see trailer if you need to know but hiding some of the best (or worst depending on how you want to look at it)), but some of the things they took us totally surprised us. things that won't do it to your newspaper reviews (and probably can't even be published here), which includes a lot of stuff under the belt, however, almost 3/4 stunts are fantastically hysterical (even though they are morally condemned, but don't forget the Knoxville statement) , and if you're in the right spirit, this movie is hysterical to look at. on TV, so be aware that you are warned of what you got - some things are disgusting, but instead of repelling them, you finally laughed at total stupidity. . As a person who thought the Jackass TV show was an exaggerated fad with just a few funny sketches and a lot of unnecessary pain, the amount of fun I had in this movie I realized without borders is the best environment for these It's a lot of fun and it should Be a great comedy fix when Borat comes out. With this movie, you may think you know what you get, but these guys are a few steps ahead - guarantee that you will be surprised by the third sketch. So enjoy and don't worry: you won't want to play almost any of their stuff at home.
