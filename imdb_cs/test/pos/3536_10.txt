The Messiah was a forced look from beginning to end. The story focused on the seemingly random murders of men in London in various horrible ways. DCI Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) must find the truth that to his surprise is a little closer to home than he may think. Gripping the drama and Ken Stott was brilliant. Hopefully we haven't seen the last of the DCI Red Metcalfe.
