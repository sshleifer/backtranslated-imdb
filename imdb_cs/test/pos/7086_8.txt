I will not say easily through movies, but I must admit that it has brought me to tears. Even though I'm not Mrs. Streep, her performance was excellent. The title in the sentence defines what the mother's love is. I didn't like any character for the first hour, but it changed when the movie continued. The film also explained why some marriages last, even if there are barriers. He must see the movie.
