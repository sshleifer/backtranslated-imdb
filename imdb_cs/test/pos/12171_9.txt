I gave 9 out of 10 points. I was sitting in tears almost the whole movie because I had to laugh! Of course, the story wasn't great, but it wasn't boring either. Erkan & Stefan are assigned to become bodyguards for beautiful Nina. In this work, BNDs and CIAs come to the front-line. Of course, the two are neither native guardians nor gentlemen, so they are fleeing from one disaster to another; and they do it in such a fun way that when you watch some scenes, you won't be able to stop tears! As actors, these two "dumbly grinning" characters do pretty well, better than some so-called professional. Do you think the speech of two heroes is curious or "pseudo-alien"? Well, when you hear a lot of Turkish-German people in Munich speaking exactly like them, you'll remember Erkan and Stefan. And maybe in 10 years it could become a common manifestation of youth. (God don't!) <br /> <br /> So if you want to laugh, check out this movie!
