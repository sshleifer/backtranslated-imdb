The film opens with a director who talks to the camera and says he is about to show the story of Brazilian street children whose families live in poverty and have to steal and kill to survive. In fact, the main character (Pixote) was played by a real street boy only 11 years old. What followed was one of the most brutal, depressing, and scary movies I even saw. I saw it about 17 years ago (on a double account with "Black Orpheus") and I never forgot it. I don't think I ever want to see it again - it was too much. <br /> SPOILER AHEAD !!!! The scene that won't leave me is when a Pixote meets a prostitute who has to interrupt her own fetus. You don't see her do ... but you get a quick look at what she got out. It's almost twenty years later, and I just remember the scene is disturbing me. SPOILER END !!!!! The film becomes more brutal as it goes and ends in the only way it can. What is all the more menacing stories like this has really happened in Brazil in 1981 ... and is still happening today. Rough brutal movie ... but it should be seen if you can do it. I am surprised that I got an R rating - I saw X rated movie, which is less graphic. A 10.
