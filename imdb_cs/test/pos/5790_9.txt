This document was my first introduction to Peak Oil. A fascinating concept that has many scary consequences if it turns out to be correct. I had no idea at all that the consequences of oil depletion would come so soon, literally to my breath. This movie will probably open your eyes to how strongly the American way of life is dependent on the "abundance of cheap oil" - a term used throughout the film. Lots of themes are simple common sense and do not go to any of them in great depth. But you probably never put together all the pieces like this movie. Interviews with authors and energy experts are very interesting. I don't think this movie is supposed to scare people. It's just to inform people about what to expect in the coming years, and perhaps encourage you to think twice about commuting to work and leave your lights all day long. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie I could no longer look at the approach of cars and buses. Big document, everyone should see it.
