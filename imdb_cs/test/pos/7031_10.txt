This is an excellent movie I watched because I was 6yrs old with my big sister. this is the type of movie you can watch over and over again and always laugh, smile and cry every time it gets bored like other movies. it is a film that will live forever through generations of the family. I love it :) when rating 1-10 in my case I would rate it easily 9.9 every time. It's a film about a change of girl (child) and her first friend (Johnny) in their family, changes in the child's view and Johnny's world during their relationship. br /> <br /> DIRTY DANCING WILL BE LIVE ON TIMLESS CLASSIC. thank you for being just a short note.
