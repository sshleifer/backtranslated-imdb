This is one of the peripheral stories told by Animatrix and not directly relevant to stopping the war. One celebrating the plot of the movies, but Trinity, expressed by Carrie, appears in it. is equipped with a private detective who is hired for big money to look for a hacker named Trinity. we see his search, which contains another PI, just the one he encounters, who seemingly crazy from his own experience trying to follow Trinity down. eventually joining the Trinity, who assumes that he is a man - of course in a narrative and something that puts us firmly in his own mind, despite what we already know - in a hacker chat and solves a puzzle that forces him to catch a train in a hurry . he forgets his hat, but his loyal cat throws him at the moment of ridiculous, so absurd it is cheerful. he meets her on the train, but reveals it when agents attack; the agents used it to get to Trinity and Trinity tried to free the PI sent after it, which of course does not know, and which is not explicitly mentioned in the animation itself, something to do with film noir titles that often come up with lots of interesting stories, subplots, developments etc., but they do not show you more than a basic story and a limited view of creating a mysterious and intriguing environment. Almost everything in this short is black and white, the music reminds of film noir and the perishable, old fashioned, but the devoted detective is the perfect protagonist of the noir title movie. The Trivia section of this title on IMDb also readily introduces a few links this title makes to hardboiled literature, something that also borrows heavily from, the secret genre for detectives, gangsters etc. who deal with difficult conflicts often and often. Studio 4 Â° C and directed by Shinichir Watanab, this is a nice variation on the usual matrix story.
