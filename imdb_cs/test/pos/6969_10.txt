Ghoulies IV may not be the best of the series, but it's not so bad if you don't take it seriously, you can enjoy it. It's nice to see that Peter Liapis is returning Johnathan Graves, who has given up magic and became a detective, but is still thinking about what happened in the Ghoulies. The story is about a woman named Alexandra, who is John's ex-girlfriend, returning to the museum and taking a red gem, using a jewel to wake her friend Faust, who is Johnathan's dark side, He needs a gem to enter the real world and John is sent to hell. Something went wrong and Alex loses the gem so he needs to find a new one when he leaves the gate, is still open, and two little ghouls named Lite and Dragon appear. They're not real Ghoulies because they look like guys in a Troll costume wearing a mask, but it doesn't matter because they are funny in parts. Lite and Dark need to find Johnathan because he can return them home to go around and cause chaos when they try to find Johnathan. Another difference is that two ghouls are good guys, unlike those from previous movies. <br /> <br /> I found Ghoulies IV to be good, but this movie doesn't have to go for everyone, check it out if you like low budget movies like Troll 2.
