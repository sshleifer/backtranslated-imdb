I would have to say that I was impressed in Barbie Movies. I have a five-year-old Barbie niece and is constantly watching them, so I don't have to say I've seen enough Barbie but I'm not sick of them. This film, visually, has something to offer, especially background, and character animation has improved with every new movie. One thing I noticed was especially the huge improvement in Barbie's hair animation in this movie. It has a beautiful range of excerpts from classical music and I think it's great because it exposes the next generation of classics. This movie is well worth it, especially if you have young relievers. They will have fun for hours!
