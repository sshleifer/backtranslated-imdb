Check Out will be released on Friday, September 15, 2006 through AMC's New York Theater Chain. Times Square, 66th and 3rd Ave, West 84th Street. This film was one of the hearts for the heart. Mark Karen, Richard Marcus, Jeff Hare, Dana Harrloe, Matt Jensen, Ed Abrams, Nick Pike, Peter Falk, Laura San Giacomo, David Paymer, Reinhold Referee, all the actors and members knew this movie was something special. The need for comfort for the elderly is determined, the proximity of the family is now more apparent. I would recommend this movie to all ages and races. This story conceals the truth to anyone with or without family.
