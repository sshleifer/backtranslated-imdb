I can't see it very badly with this movie. It is true that the main singers do not have to be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they can definitely have a melody. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented composers and I am glad that their songs, especially "The World is a Circle", "Things I Will Not Miss", and "Question Me Answer". Some argue that Hermes Pan's choreography is horrible and that snowy mountain orchards look as if they are made of plastic; I disagree on both counts. I had seen powder snow before, and the snow in those mountain scenes seemed realistic to me. And above all, in the defense of this film, it's suitable for a family audience (at least I remember that when I saw it on Christmas Eve a few years ago). That movie deserves its G rating. And they don't call it a naughty "F" word every ten minutes like some movies I've seen. Thank God. Although this film may not be a cup of tea, it has some redeeming value and I give it ten points out of ten. That's my story and I stick to it.
