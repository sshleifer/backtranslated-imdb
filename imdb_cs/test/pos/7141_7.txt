True, it is not John Sayles's best film (Brother from Another Planet), but it is not even forgotten, if not for any reason other than his message. Like Batman, the parents of Thing's viewers were murdered before him and left him to take care of himself in the "zone" of the corrupt part of an unnamed city where greed and violence reign. Instead of plunging with Chopper (Robert Davi) Wild Thing, he fights for justice, uses his power of Tai Chi and scary cat impressions, occasionally lights up on fire. Something like urban legend, Robin Hood's modern day and hero for ever. 1987 at the best, WILD THING LIVES
