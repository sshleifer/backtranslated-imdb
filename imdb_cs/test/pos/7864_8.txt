The combination of both Western and Gothic horror and often managed conventions as an art film is one of Siegel's and Eastwood's best collaborations. Eastwood plays a Yankee soldier who resorts to an isolated southern young women's seminar after being wounded during a civil war. Women who are away from the world project their romantic fantasies on him, and he reacts with ruthless male manipulation. But jealousy and outrage raise their heads and find themselves in a world of brutal revenge. And the boy's revenge is brutal. Beautifully shot by Bruce Surtees and carefully running, "The Beguiled" is a creepy, elegant work that seems to have affected Eastwood's troubled sexuality "Play Misty for Me" and "Tightrope". The film is a stunning portrayal of the wild sex battle and radiates a dreamy mix of horror and sexuality. All characters are ambiguous, displaying the features of good and evil, leaving it up to us to choose who we should take root. Don Siegel left something good behind him. Everything from "Inviting Body Hijackers" to "Dirty Harry". But even though his early black-and-white pictures were well-aged, most of his colorful films seem grainy, dated and poorly shot. His brave "realism" seemed fresh and kinetic 40 years ago, but when I look at today, I don't think they have passed the test of time. <br /> <br /> "The Beguiled" is in another league. Mature, ambiguous and sharply shot, it is a pity that it is not generally known. While evolving technologies and technology have made most of Siegel's hard, male action thrillers obsolete, "The Beguiled" is still entering the audience today because of its unreal atmosphere and unique theme. 8.5 / 10 - Better than a similarly themed "Black Narcissus" is Siegel's best film in my opinion. Partial horror, partial drama, part of the sexual odyssey, "The Beguiled" is a surprisingly artistic film (especially when we realize that Siegel is looking at his films that are quoted, "nonsensical"). Much of the work of the film is given by Clint Eastwood, who from now on would seek to select mature material.
