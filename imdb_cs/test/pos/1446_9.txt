Frank Sinatra has one of the best roles as a reformed heroin addict, returning to his Chicago neighborhood after an extensive clinic stay. He plans to stay out of the drug and find work as a drummer, but he can't avoid running into his old friends. He was originally arrested for any drug-related charges, but because he was caught in an illegal poker game. His skill in poker earned him the nickname "The Man with the Golden Arm," and the men who run the game, one of them is his former heroin connection, want him to look back. Meanwhile, Frank has to take care of the woman he injured in a traffic accident, Zosch (Eleanor Parker), and to deal with his old girlfriend, Molly (Kim Novak). The film is great when it puts us in the mental state of Sinatra. When he felt sure at the beginning of the movie, I felt good for him. But when one day the promised phone call does not come, he descends into depression and returns to strike. Later, when he finally gets auditioned, he arrives completely pulled out. His embarrassment, when he can't play the right blow, is devastating. He had such great dreams, and the other musicians did not pay him a little attention when they left the room. The film moves fast and shows Frank's drug problem in realistic light without turning into a social message. The actors are united in order. Elmer Bernstein's score is one of the best in his day. The only thing I don't like about the film is the end. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Although I really like the character of Zosch and Parker in the film very well, he could do more to fill her backstage. The end is a bit too pat. Although it is certainly the pathos that will remain with the characters after the film is closed, Zosch's death connects all the loose ends a little neatly. Frank can love Molly and he doesn't go to jail. Also, his dealer is dead, so at least the immediate threat is gone. Well, I think there's always a desire in Hollywood to tie everything in a neat cover. It's a little damaging to the film, but as it stands, it's still one of the best and most adult drug addiction movies I think. 9/10.
