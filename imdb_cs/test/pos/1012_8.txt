Despite some truly scenic places in the Orient and some sporadically energetic music by Franco Micalizzi, this film does not reach the level of similar effort by Joe D'Amato, while remaining so exhausted. The author of the original book "Emmanuelle: Joys of the Woman", Emmanuelle Arsan, directed and had a minor role in this film, which mostly pornography showcases a very young Annie Belle when she gets into various strange sexual situations. In fact, her friend, ZOMBIE Al Cliver, approves of her sleep and even convinces her to continue her practices after the two spouses are! Orso Maria Guerrini drops like a professor who is oh so usually married simultaneously to two women, one of whom is played by Arsan herself. Despite starting promisingly and having a few funny lines of dialogue like "can you see me with the naked eye?" ... "I see you better naked!", The film shakes along the barren down to less than the grand finale. Like D'Amato's EMANUELLE AND LAST CANNIBALS, the main characters are in search of a lost tribe, but I don't understand your hopes, there is no violence in this movie and not much sex for that. Just a lot of nudity and stupid dialogue. I couldn't help but find some appreciation for this little film as far as the very logic that the film is all about.
