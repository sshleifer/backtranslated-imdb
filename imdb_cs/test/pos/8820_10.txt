Michael Sheen shines as the afternoon sun in this brilliant depiction of a comic genius. If you are familiar with the manners and diaries of Kenneth Williams, then this drama perfectly captures their essence. When I read about Kenneth's hoovering in his swimsuit, I laughed and then it was brought to life on the screen, but this time I wasn't allowed as it was put into perspective as an action of a repressed and tortured man. It must have been a lonely existence in Kenneth's skin, looking for attention, but avoiding it when TRULY cared! The last 20 minutes are heartbreaking, as you can see, as Kenneth gradually sinks into the depths of despair and considers suicide as the only alternative. I saw it a dozen times and still cry uncontrollably at the place where LOUIE gives good night. I can't recommend this drama enough. Sexually explicit, it drives home the fact that Kenneth couldn't let anyone attack his world, and that's where this man's sadness lies. For a genius who has brought so much happiness, it is a pity that his private life was filled with such despair and sadness. Pauly.
