I saw Riverdance - The New Show and I loved it from the first moment! It's an energetic tribute to Irish dance filled with brilliant dance, music and choreography! Leadership, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne impressed me with their wonderful dance! They can always shine and dance. Their chemistry on stage was amazing, and the unity between them on stage was obvious. They look like they're dancing together! This show is my favorite and probably will always be. Long Live Riverdance!
