The famous and mysterious grief of Raymar, who is some deadly telekinetic psychic vampire, suddenly dies in bizarre circumstances. Pretty high school student Julie Wells (warm and sympathetic performance of beautiful Mega Tilly) desperately wants to accept the snobbish clich√©s Sisters (played at the sublimely scathing perfection of Leslie Speights, Robin Evans and the still angry Elizabeth Daily), so she agrees to spend the night in a haunted mausoleum where Raymar's body was buried as part of the initiation ceremony. Of course, Raymar has his extraordinary abilities, so it will be a very long and tormenting night of pure nerve racking terror for poor Julie. Director / screenwriter Tom McLoughlin (who later gave us the Pleasant Language in the Face "Friday 13th Part VI: Jason Lives") avoids graphic gore in favor of creating a tense and frightening atmosphere, but cannot pull this particular performance because the first hour is too slow, talky and remotely frightening or strained. Nevertheless, I have found that this faulty haunted movie is strangely appealing and fun. Big hairdos poopy, goofy music splicing sequence, badly timed fake scary (including ubiquitous hand on the shoulder gag!), Scene on glittering arcade video game, kids joyfully smoking sweat, and cheerfully silly teen slang ("nerdle brain"!?) Give this picture Some cute charm 80's period. Hal Trussell is a handsome, polished cinematography (mainly I dug smoothly sliding Steadicam tracking images), spooky Bob Summers' but funky hum'n'shiver synthesizer score and Tom Burman's great ghoulish makeup f / x are up for snuff. Still tough Adam West of the television "Batman" fame only occupies space in nothing of the secondary part. The mausoleum is an impressively large and disturbing main site. The spectacular finale with lots of horrible rotting corpses emerging from their coffins and floating, qualifies as an amazingly frightening shock. Sure, this kid is definitely not an unjustly indecent gem, but it still brings a lot of pleasantly stupid and diverted jokes.
