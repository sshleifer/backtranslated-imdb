This movie is on my list of the top 20 comedies. It's a truly unique movie. To the reviewer who said, "I must really miss something." - you're right. You're missing something. If you don't have such a sense of humor, this film requires one thing. But don't give it a bad review because you think it's "looney" but it's not meant to be. Loony is a concise description of what he wants to be and what he can do. I was much more and more intensely laughing at this movie than at most other fun movies. nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature Film. As usual, Crispin Glover is absolutely brilliant in some utterly inexplicable way, and some of his funniest lines were not at all in this film. Glover is clearly the best comic actor working right now. Harry Dean Stanton gives excellent comic performances. William Burroughs is incredible in a small role. Dylan McDermott was ideally cast and Lois Chiles was absolutely outstanding. All of the above things are perfectly funny in their own perfect way, but this is one of Crispin's best performances - there with his performances of River's Edge and Willard. If you are a Crispin Glover fan, but you have somehow overlooked this movie, you must stop what you are doing and see it immediately. But be sure to relax first and maybe have a beer or something. It's a great movie, but it's very unusual, and I recommend that you choose a suitably stupid state of mind before viewing.
