I saw it on the release of Accent Underground with short films. I found the film on the first boring and old-fashioned one and turned it off after the first hour - I was a little drunk and tired. I went to bed and without a kid I had a nightmare about half an hour to sleep. I couldn't stop thinking about why, so I got up, turned on the TV, loaded the DVD and saw the rest of the movie. Well done by Alex Frayne Sir, you have managed to implant your movie into this old, cynical movie head, and it does. So 10 out of 10 you. I can't say I "loved" your movie, but in spite of its shortcomings and low budget, etc. Permanent impact.
