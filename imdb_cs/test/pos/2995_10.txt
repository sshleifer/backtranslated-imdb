First, I'm not the one who's over the movies. I saw friends in the 1970s when it was first released. I was 17 years old. Even now, at the age of 50, I still remember some scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and can actually be too tame for teenagers today, but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love, and the commitment of two young people to make a better life for themselves than at home. At that time, it was quite risky to have a film about a few young refugees who had successfully set up a house and had a child on their own. I'm not surprised that Elton John's film and soundtrack are almost unknown today. The music is beautiful. It was unforgettable.
