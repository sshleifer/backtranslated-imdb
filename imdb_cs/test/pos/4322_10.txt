This episode is the best of the series so far. The story was perfectly told. I especially liked the way the writers did it with the Desmond episode; it was his best performance so far and he definitely deserved Emmy for his performance. In this episode we had some of our answers to the questions, but because the show is called Lost, we know that more questions will be raised too. At first he replied: Walt finally met his father Michael, secondly, Michael's betrayal is exposed to Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurly, and because of this betrayal, Kate, Jack and Sawyer are captured by others. This was a great way to end the show. On the other side of the island we see Locke going through mental failure with a button. This leads to another answered question about how the plane actually went down. But there are some unanswered questions: firstly, what happened to Locke, Eco and Desmond when Desmond turned the security key and what happened to the Arctic scientists looking for electromagnetic annamolias. Guess we'll find out next season, but a great end to the best TV show.
