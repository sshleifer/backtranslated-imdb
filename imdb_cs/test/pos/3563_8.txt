The bandit gang, led by a clever, rugged, merciless Moneter (Gilbert Roland's impressive performance), steals $ 300,000 gold coins during a bold train robbery. But an untrustworthy member of Bahunda (Jose Torres' entertainment turn) embarks on coins and hides them. Unfortunately, Bahunda is killed before he can tell Moneter where he hid prey. So Moneter must join forces with the cunning, puffy, mysterious bounty hunter Stranger (smoothly playing handsome George Hilton) and the cagey, corrupt banker Clayton (a delightfully portrayed 50-year-old Eddie idol "Kookie" Burns) to find coins. Skillfully director Enzo G. Castellari, with the clever, complex and twisted script of Castellari, Tito Carpi and Giovanni Simonelli, playfully amoral and nihilistic (each twofold and threefold happily greedy abandonment), twangs, flavorsome, lively scores by Alessandro Alessandroni and Francesca De Masi, lots of excitement shots and contemplation of harsh "impregnable" fistuffs, a sinister sense of self-confident humor, a steady pace, and a real ugly surprise. Popping up in clever secondary parts is seductive Stefanie Careddu as a fiery gal palace of Monetero, Marisol, Ivano Staccioli as a stubborn captain of the army and Gerard Herter as a sneaky lawyer of Lawrence Blackman. Extremely fun and enjoyable seating.
