I am not a Faulkner fan (who is considered sacred, especially since I grew up near the author's hometown); But I think it's a great movie. At par with the quality of "Kill Mocking Bird". If you haven't seen it, buy it as well. It's worth having in your permanent collection. TCM has recently played a movie as part of the Race on Film series. I wish they played it more often. Very mobile. On a side note, the people of Oxford, Mississippi, will also see the square footage as it was in the 1940s. Court, City Hall, etc.: They're all on the screen. I never knew the movie was filmed there until I noticed the familiarity with the buildings. When I saw the arch in front of the town hall, I began to suspect. Look carefully at the flags on Chick's Wall: You'll see two for Ole Miss!
