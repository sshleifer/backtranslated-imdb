I have to rate this movie at 10. I'm sorry, but I think it's a classic comedy. then, when you evaluate it to other Madonna movies ... well, what? do you want to tell me it wasn't her best movie ever? Mira Sorvino won an Oscar for almost the same performance than ten years later? Please, this movie deserves much more credit than it gets. plus, I'd like to imagine it as a sociological study of A + on the 80's lifestyle. Remember when you could break away from Sam Goody and Cartier on the same day? Remember when women wore proudly eyebrows? so it wasn't the "last emperor", it was still good. There are some movies I would like to watch every day. three, actually, that my day and make me smile. If you like "Who is the girl?" then I would also recommend "Party Girl" and "Roma and Michelle High School Reunion".
