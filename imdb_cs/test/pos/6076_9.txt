It was curious to know the name of the Tuscan village where filming was made in Italy. I know the name of the villa: Villa San Girolamo, however, would like to know the exact location in Tuscany. The camera is excellent and it would be great to visit this area. I would also like to know what a place of desert shooting is. Travel extensively in Europe and Africa and you are interested in visiting the areas about which the book and film were about. Please send me an e-mail with information about the site anyone could have. We would be very grateful. And if someone knows if a villa in Tuscany is still living, it would be amazing. I am waiting for any information and thank you in advance for your time.
