I was as sure in this series as the sea swept me into his grasp. Though it started slowly, I realized that the realism in the depiction of the ship, the diversity of the characters and the lively dialogue follow me. The protagonist was destined to be challenged, grew, and changed on this path, and wanted to be there. I wasn't disappointed. The series has brought you from humor to tragedy and everything in between, often in the same scene, the same breath. There was a great deal of emotional overlap, interaction, and expression - observing and persuasive to observe. The movement of the ship added an almost fantasy component to many scenes, so the characters fell ill for a moment and added more humor. Edmund Talbot is a complicated character whose forms we do not have. see often. We can know where the Captain or Mr. Prettiman is, but they are older men, set in the way. Talbot was young and arrogant, still learning, testing and testing. He tried to get along with the others and made mistakes like a real man, but he had a heart that could touch which grew with every experienced experience. I appreciate the excellent characterization; It's too rare in movies and television.
