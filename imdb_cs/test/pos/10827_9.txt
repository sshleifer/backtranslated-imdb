On its surface, it is one of the most classically entertaining action / comedy / Romanesque films that I have seen for a long time, reminiscent of a pleasant old "Saturday afternoon" movies that had the right balance of unexpected twists, timed humor and integrated action. In addition, we have knowledge of the context of this film. It has the same elements of "Casablanca," but is set just before many of the characters would really realize the gravity of what happens to their country (and the world) and the consequences of some of their own behavior. This adds significant irony to humor (we feel that one of the female characters has a radical change of hairstyle in her future). This is a movie that you won't regret watching.
