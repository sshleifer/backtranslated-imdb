Beautiful .... that one word largely sums up this whole film. Everything from cinematography, directing, acting ... brilliant. At any point in the movie, you can pause it, and no doubt you will watch something mosaic or "artsy fartsy" as some people would say. I assure you that after one review, "Bobbycrush" will be stuck in his head. I know it first hand. Even the soundtrack is great. It goes very well with the tone and pace of the movie. Be grateful that Cam Archer exists in this world. We need more people like him to make movies that show love and shame in absolutely real (and surrealist) images.
