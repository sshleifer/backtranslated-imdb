May contain spoilers <br /> <br /> This historic film was so refreshing. Although it may be an exagerating real event, it indicates the heartless nature of Emperor Qui, which he was later infamous for. And there was no single computer man in it. I think it's great that China made such an epic film. The costumes and settings were beautiful, the performances were also excellent. Dignity vs. Death is the main theme of this film and I think it reflects Chinese history and culture. I also enjoyed a bit of a hint of terracotta warriors, a 3D map carved from China's conquest with individual soldiers. Of course, Emperor Qui later, as he was buried with his life-size terracotta warriors. I also enjoyed the dwarf scene, it was a very interesting character, even though it had a small scene. > <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
