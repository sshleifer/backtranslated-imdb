This movie was much better than I expected. After several movies of Will Smith that were not as great as me, Robot, he is back in being nice and fun. Smith plays, Hitch, Data Doctor. Most film centers teach him how to be himself and get a date with Allegra Cole, a rich celebrity he works with. Albert is a trick and goof and always stumbles over his feet or something. All Hitch makes him learn how to behave more cool and not be so nervous around Allegro. During all this, Hitch meets Sara, the gossip holder who has sworn on men. Hitch enchants her, so of course they go out. But Hitch can teach other boys how to get a girl to fall for them, not believe in love alone. He had never had a girl since he was fired at college. But she likes Sara, so she's still holding her. Sarain's friend is injured by the guy he thinks he went to the doctor. So Sara watches the doctor just to learn Hitch. Of course he thinks he's a pig. Then it's up to you to tell Sara and Allegro what he's doing, so they both end up being forgiven. FINAL VERDICT: Good, has some laughter and is fun. I recommend it.
