ONE GOOD WORD: This hidden treasure of dramatic drama is incredibly fun from start to finish. An example of making low-budget films at the best point is that writer / director Skip Woods uses everything he could find (eg Lamborghini, super model, phone with cow) and ear for dialogue that adds satire to storyline and all its settings the camera. OTHER GOOD THINGS: This movie seems to be created for the DVD era, with several segments that include a larger story (similar to the work of Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez Desperado). Each "chapter" of the film presents the main character of Thomas Jane, who spent one day at home and meets the fast and unforgettable performances of Aaron Eckhart, Glen Plummer, Mickey Rourke, Michael Jet, James LeGros and the unforgettable role of Paulina Porizka. <br /> <br /> WHAT OTHER GOOD THINGS: Not a "good" thing, but incredibly shocking and unforgettable ... Anyone who sees this film remembers one important scene. Just as Deliverance will always remember that it is a terrible rape by Ned Beatty, Thursday will go down as a movie where a woman violently rapes an unwilling man. Unforgettable. ONE BAD THING: The title makes people think that it is somehow related to (or derived from) a series of "Friday" movies featuring Ice Cube. <br /> <br /> GRADE: A +
