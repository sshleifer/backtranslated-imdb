It is difficult to distinguish one factor in a film that is so successful. All departments work in perfect union to create the most moving human drama ever made on film. Production is a tribute to writers, producers, casts and crews. To name a few, Hugo Friedhofer's wonderful score is a sublime miracle, a subtle but imaginative photo of Greg Toland, and the incredibly effective direction of William Wyler, combined with the ideal of casting American classics. <br /> <br /> The DVD version is a special viewing tool. It is a pleasure to see the "best years of our lives" so beautifully preserved for generations to enjoy.
