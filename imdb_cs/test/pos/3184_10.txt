There is only so much that I can take Filipino films, especially nowadays when the trend is sex, action and comedy comedy (which I hate). The fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me into a movie was a big plus. It's a good movie scene and editing was great, especially cinematography. I think Claudine deserves the best actress to get into the movie Milan. the fact that there are so few Filipino films I really like. I think Cholo Laurel did a great job in this movie. I really really loved this movie, technically and the character of wise development; the land was complicated and it frightened him.
