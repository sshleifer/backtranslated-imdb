it would be a shame if you were still watching a speed racer, be it dubbed or subbed (I prefer the dubbed version (which is rare) because it was funny ... in a good way). What is great at Speed ​​Racer is that you are never too old to watch. go red and yellow !! I first saw it when I was around seven and enjoyed a catchy opening. he disappeared for a while, then I saw it again a few months ago (I'm 19). Imagine the feeling of nostalgia that emerges, sings "Here comes the speed racer! It's still a demon on wheels ~~~". In any case, the concept of Moss 5 spawned so many "ultra-multifunctional specialty cars", but none of them could overcome their genius in the construction industry. the other cars seemed too much. And it wasn't just for me to race or fight with different bosses. it was the mysterious personality of the racer-x and how the world of speed racers was largely "turned". they did some tuning to some story lines from manga, but it all turned out pretty well. Even if I can't remember if the show really revealed how racer-x looked, in manga, they did.
