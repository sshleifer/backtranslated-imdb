I watched this movie on TCM last night, all the enthusiastic expectations I last saw (twice) in its 1957 memorable edition in Toronto. I told my wife, who hadn't seen it yet, to watch the exciting long tracking shot, no cuts where Veronika could be seen on a bus on the way to find her Boris. Then, in a hand-held frame that precedes the modern Steadicam, the shot is stretched back up and the cranes (unintentional pun) above the street as they leave the bus, shooting between tanks across the road. Then I remember no cuts, we watch her near the fence as she looks through, looking anxiously for him, but she doesn't find him. However, we follow Veronica as he searches the faces of the persecuted recruits and their emotionally-educated women, all of them, and each of them is the jewel of the captivating Stanislavsky behavior. As they wondered, Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky created this extraordinary succession. But what did I see in this version? After crossing the streets that avoided the tanks, the scene suddenly ended and returned to the apartment scenes before continuing to the soldiers and their families by the fence. It seems to me that this film was not only restored but also modified. What is it!
