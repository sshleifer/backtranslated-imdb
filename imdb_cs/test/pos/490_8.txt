Okay, this movie is a bit on the hockey side. It's hard to take characters from comics and put them in movies with any credibility (Dolph Lundgren like The Punisher, anyone?), But that's very difficult. I've never read a real comic, but it really doesn't matter, I think. I consider the film mainly on the basis of its merit, not on whether it is a true story about something else. (Unless his film is based on a true story that requires at least some truth and precision.) So why do I give this movie a fairly high rating? Because it's trying. It's trying very hard. In my book, which makes her a fairly entertaining movie. Many movies have been made with a vampire theme that is the ultimate goal. Everyone seems to have their vampire traditions, be it the cross, the silver, the garlic, the resistance to sunlight, anything. Some of these ideas are included here. The plot is known ... a group of vampires conspire to take over the world, with one person (mainly) standing in the way. Blade (Wesley Snipes) lives only for the purpose of destroying the vampire masses, which have slowly but surely moved into the world and shared with mankind. For the most part, the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them. The vampires even took the consciousness, the people who strive to be vampires, and make them vampire dirty work to show them how worthy they eventually are "turned". Now that I think, there are many elements of this movie similar to the story of Roddy Piper, they live. A hidden enemy, a hidden group of people plotting against them, a struggle to save the human species ... all that is present in Blade. The acting skills are not the best here. Snipes is at best only slightly better than some of his other roles; N'Bushe Wright, a relative newcomer, is not too bad; Kris Kristofferson is forgotten as Blade's sidekick (he has Blade what Chip's to the Punisher). Stephen Dorff does the best work of the entire cast because of the "head" vampire you love to hate. I don't know, but I loved the special effects of this movie. From the blood drenched by the vampire rave, to the inevitable fight in the film finale, the special effects are not half bad. Surely there's enough blood and gore to go around, but after all, this is a vampire movie, right? The different shapes and types of use of Blade weapons are quite unique and are generally not used in contemporary action movies. Snipes has more taste with a decked-out sword than with a machine gun. Plus, there's a lot more thoughts that get into a fight with a blade than just blowing someone. (If you aren't Indiana Jones, of course.) <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not the best action movie ever made, but it's not bad either. As a bonus, music scores and soundtrack are also pretty cool. Tell me, in what other movies can you hear super drum'n'bass like Source Direct or Photek?! <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
