After watching Skmarmen Ingmar Bergman I had many feelings, but above all I felt dissatisfied. I've heard so much hype about this movie, but I've come to find it. Don't get me wrong, I can fully appreciate the artistic value of such a film, but I wasn't so impressed with depth and emotion. I found that the characters are unpleasant and unrealistic, which is reflected in the dramatic effect. In addition, the fact that the war was false has led me to feel that emotion is not real. Dramatic war movies are, in my opinion, much more effective if events (not necessarily the story itself) have actually happened. I found out of all the films that try to show the brutality that falls in the middle in terms of efficiency.
