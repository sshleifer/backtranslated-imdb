I lay in bed, waving channels ... and the boy got channels ... 500 of them. With more than 70 movie channels, I'm probably watching a movie on cable, once or twice a month ... DVD swallowed me. Anyway, I'm flickering and I'm into this movie and because I see Natilie Portman, I'm interested. 110 minutes later I'm still interested. How could it be? When I first saw the previews of this movie in the theater, I remember making fun of it. I never thought I'd watch it ... no matter what. The story is based on a book and you can say it. The movie is very episodic, and it's not like a movie has a big plot, it just sucks you in. May-be its performances that do it. I'm sure it must have been. <br /> <br /> This film was unreasonable ... <br /> <br /> Peter's Movie Rating (out of 10): 7
