It's funny as time went by and never saw this movie ... 'until last week when I was under magic. I saw it twice a week and it still wasn't enough. It's a great movie and I'd love to see it again. The story is great and really pushed me. I'd like to live such a story. Actors are great, music too and you can dream of your own love story. I just hope I'll find an opportunity to learn to dance like Johnny and Baby once. I feel that dance connects people and connects them. I think people should learn to dance ... it helps a lot, especially in relationship. It's great to feel the dance in the blood and in your body.
