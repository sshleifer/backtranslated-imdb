I liked this movie very much. My only problem is that I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside. Corse Ironside is just a small rent to Jack Nicholson. I think Mike was busy "Highlander 2: The Quickening" that year. Unfortunately, "Beastmaster 2" would be a much better career step. It is definitely the best of the Beastmaster series and in many ways reminiscent of the great classic "Masters of the Universe" screen. Not only is it the unmatched Mark Singer, but also the amazing support line, specifically the second girl from "Sliders", Uncle Phil from "Fresh Prince of Belair" and the evil chicks from "Superman 2". It shook my world and it must definitely be seen by anyone who has no social or physical background. BEASTMASTER FOREVER !!! ROCK'N ROLL !!!
