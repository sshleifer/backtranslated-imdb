As a SCUBA diver, I can appreciate the incredible physical effort that cameramen had to endure to get shots underwater. But this series is much more than that. The story is perfect, scenes bordering on unlikely and fascinating. The daily struggle for life, which takes place from the perspective of our earthly inhabitants, is overwhelming. This DVD set opened its eyes to another planet right here on Earth. I urge everyone to watch this series.
