If you're going to spoof James Bond, it's a great idea to find a leading man who resembles BOTH Sean Connery and Leonard Rossiter, so the step forward Jean Dujardin, who perfectly captures Connery's grin that masks like the smile and delusion of Rossiter's thinking is great. Dujardin plays like Clouseau, who can keep his own in karate. The plot is looking for him for our man in Schtook, who has mysteriously disappeared and contains such improbability as a Nazi cell hidden inside the pyramid. If it is an unnerving comment, it is Berenice's leading lady Bejo, who has all the sensuality of pudding pudding and eclipse - but only - Aure Attica. It's good for one viewing, but that's about it.
