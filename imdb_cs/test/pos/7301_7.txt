A novel by Jane Smiley, loosely based on Shakespeare's King LEAR about Cook's family and her dark secrets. Director Moorhouse seems to be tamed in her approach, allowing the characters to step forward and take the bow. And how could you go wrong with the talents of Pfeiffer, Lange, Leigh, Firth, Carradine and Robards?
