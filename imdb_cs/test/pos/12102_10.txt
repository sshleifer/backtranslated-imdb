If you're a fan of Turkish and Middle Eastern music, you're very lucky. This film is a documentary of contemporary music in Istanbul, covering traditional to modern. It is very good. You couldn't do better if you went to Istanbul alone. We get interviews with Orhan Gencebay, music clips of modern music icons, a road show with a Roma (gypsy) audience, Turkish hip hop (surprisingly good) and much more. Some of the best singers I've ever heard. Kurdish woman sings in hamam (steam bath), which will tear your heart. Lots of social and political background. If it's your thing, you'll have a great time. I could barely sit in the theater. <br /> <br /> A CD soundtrack is now available on Amazon. Pricey.
