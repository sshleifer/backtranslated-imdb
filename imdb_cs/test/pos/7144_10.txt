This was a very faithful presentation of Lewis' life in the mid-1950s. The dialogue on theology and joking with his successive colleagues was extremely good. The book by Michael White, "C.S. Lewis: Creator of Narnia" deals with this time frame very parallel. Joss Ackland was doing great when he caught Lewis unemployed. The film required great pain in a precise English environment. The development of a strong bond between "Jack" (his preferred name) Lewis and Douglas Gresham, the son of Joyo from her previous marriage, was pleasing to watch. The film avoided the disgusting element of "Warnie" Lewis (Jack's older brother) who was drinking the problem, but the story wouldn't move, so it's the best.
