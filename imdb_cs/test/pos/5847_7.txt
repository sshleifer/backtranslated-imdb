I liked this movie. Unlike other thrillers, you'll learn to know the killers very well. You also know two detectives who are hunting them. Killers are two high school kids. They are very intelligent and want to prove they are smarter than the police, so they are planning a "perfect crime". We all know that this crime will not be perfect. What we do not know is whether they will be caught, or it may be just one of them, or even none. In a way, I was hoping they'd both get away, even if I didn't know if it was a movie. The story is told in a nice way. You are getting to know the people involved. The character of Sandra Bullock is sympathetic, but she has her own secret that works against her. Ben Chaplin is pretty good because Sam and both kids are great. The scenes between them are better scenes in the movie. I think you can say the movie is pretty good and not as predictable as you would think. For a nice evening with a movie, 'Murder by Numbers' is good.
