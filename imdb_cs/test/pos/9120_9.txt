He just saw it as the final film of the Austin Film Festival. At Alamo Drafthouse, a few snippets of their action appeared, and he thought the trailer was fun, but I didn't expect such a theme-themed music, and using Tarot cards is brilliant in the title order. Beware of portraits by Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins and the Dark Lord himself (who has a fetish for KG). So many over-the-top entertainment and songs are so catchy. Car chasing was by far my favorite scene. I know it will earn cult status now and win some new Tenacious D fans just like me. I hope the theaters are doing well. "Follow me, we are shadows"
