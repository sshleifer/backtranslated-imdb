Land Cabinet is an amazing, scary piece of cinema. It features just two actors in one set, but never loses your attention. Set design is imaginative and disturbing, staging scenes keeps your attention while adding your own sense of confusion and horror. Acting is excellent, with Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe, who have a duty to carry every scene. This film was first seen in 1991, soon after it came out on video. He did not play in theaters where I lived; given its political content, it is not surprising. It should be seen. It represents a brilliant staging of torture and interrogation techniques that use repressive societies to instill fear and obedience to their citizens. The earth is never named, which makes it more remarkable. It could be anywhere; East, West, 3rd World, 1st World. This illustrates what happens when a small group of people decide what is best for everyone; When the government becomes the ruler of the citizens, rather than a servant. Madeleine Stowe is a child writer who was pulled out of bed at night and subjected to terror and torture. He finds himself in a room with Alan Rickman, a seemingly pleasing official. At first it seems like a terrible mistake and she can go; but fear causes it to remain and the horror escalates. It is increasingly exposed to physical and mental torture. The investigator uses sensory deprivation, time manipulation, confusion, auditory manipulation, role playing, and twisted logic to split the author. She is humiliated and defeated, forced to endure strenuous body positions, deprived of food and water. Despite all this, he refuses to give up; what the investigator asks. It is said that it will only end when he signs a confession. A simple little act. He refuses. Through all this, she uses the defense mechanisms that have evolved since childhood. Slowly, she became a victim of childhood sexual abuse. To survive, she developed fantasy worlds and characters that would turn her away from cruelty. These mechanisms allow her to overcome torture and turn tables into investigators. He begins to attack his own beliefs and vocations, forcing him to explore his own life and motives. Finally, she is free because she retains the freedom of thought. The researcher is the one who is imprisoned by the state. This film was taken during the Cold War, apartheid, and times when the crimes of many governments around the world were making daily news. In a world where "hostile fighters" are detained and interrogated in secret prisons, they deny legal rights or counsel; where "ethnic cleansing" falls into society and humanitarian aid is denied. It shows that an individual can confront the state or another oppressor by refusing to give up fear and terror.
