Let's not beat the bush here, Taylor Hackford's undoubtedly slippery movie has little to make it stand out from the biopic genre than Jamie Foxx's exceptional, career-making performance. Remember the year they gave special Oscar effects to Terminator 2 boffins, undisputed? They should do the same with this year's best actor gong. Ray Charles's story is worthy of filming, not in dispute. Many of the memories of his traumatic childhood are well worked out and judiciously used. But for such a unique life, the film seems incredibly formal and familiar. This follows the 'history of the erroneous genius template almost on the letter: difficulties and exploitation, women and drugs, recording quarrels, band quarrels, rehabilitation, yeah yeah. And surely there was more humor in his life than we did to us here? - Accurate renditions of too many songs - in gin joints, in the recording studio, in concert halls, infinity. Narratively and for nondevotees, they begin to behave as a film brake. This may seem like a tough judgment on biopic music, but with a catalog as extensive as Ray, we need the taste not the whole meal. Otherwise we would buy the albums. I wondered how I was and looked at my watch more than once. So for all of Foxx's brilliance, could Ray be better served as an HBO-double?
