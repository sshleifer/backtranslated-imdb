This film is a masterpiece. It was exciting from start to finish. The story of writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson about a porn star is told with style, grace, humor, even honesty. The actors and characters they play are first-rate, including Mark Wahlberg in the lead, who will prove to be a solid actor and can carry a film. Burt Reynolds gives his best performance sometimes as a porn director who discovers Wahlberg. The film resumes at the end of the 1970s and early 1980s with a deadlock, from the disco scene that begins with Wahlberg Don Johnson's "Miami Vice", the clothes he wears in the final scene. Most of the regular movie viewers who see this film are unmistakably likened to PULP FICTION, but in fact they have much more to do with the films of Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese. The film is a triumph in style. The opening track that begins with the film is as impressive as the one that is in PLAYER and ABSOLUTE BEGINNINGS. Dylan Tichenor's cut is simply phenomenal. I couldn't believe the cut didn't get an Oscar nomination (GOOD WILL HUNTING was a better movie?!). The best scene in the movie must be the one with the flip flops. I had butterflies in my stomach because the scene is incredibly intense. When I saw the movie for the second time, I had the same response to the scene. Unfortunately, this may not have the same impact on TV as in a theater with good stereo sound. It is a pity that many people have not seen this film during its theatrical run because it is the best way to watch it. Anderson's use of a widescreen screen will suffer on TV (so take a DVD or mailbox). It's amazing how easy Anderson does it because it's just his second movie. Music, sets, costumes, photographs, unusual characters, sex, violence, happiness and evil are captured by a guy who is clearly in love with film making.
