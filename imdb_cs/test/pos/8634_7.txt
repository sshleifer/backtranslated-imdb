Bud Abbott and Lou Costello have always had good consequences among children, but in their careers I think you could say they made only one movie that could be for children. Jack and Beanstalk was one movie. These were two independent films from Warner Brothers, the second film, Abbott and Costello, met with Captain Kidd. These were the only two films the boys made in color. Two of them, as usual, take a job for a very precocious and unpleasant young David Stollery as a babysitter. Although it starts with Costello wanting to read the baby, Jack and Beanstalk as a bedtime story, the young boy looks at him with Costello. Lou falls asleep and fantasizes in her dreams that she's really Jack Giant Killer. Buddy Baer, ​​who threatened the boy in Africa Screaming giant and has a huge size Dorothy Ford as his housekeeper. Dorothy was a big girl, 6'2 ", and you can imagine she had some casting difficulties, except her height was used as a joke. One of the only players looking at her was John Wayne in Three Fathers. "4." Henry Fonda and James Stewart in On Our Merry Way also stood barely above her, but again her height was part of the gag. Shaye Cogan and James Alexander were princess and prince of fantasy and It was William Farnum's last film, whose career comes from the early silent projection days and even at the turn of the last century on stage. He played Princess Shaye's father of the king. <br /> <br /> Some not terribly unforgettable music numbers came from Jack and Beanstalk, save the title song.I remember well that the child has 78 records about Bud and Lou, sings the song and recites the story. but I became a lifelong fan of their TV series. Jack and Beanstalk are still a good picture for kids, although I would warn my parents to warn their little urchins not to imitate young Master Stollery.
