"Other People's Vision" is a courageous romantic comedy about a couple named Ed and Alice (Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson) who are engaged and plan to soon become married. They live together, but they both have doubts about their relationship. Alice realizes she had so few sexual relationships in the past that she could marry Ed because she never felt anything else. They agree to start fooling around with other people for a while to test their own relationship. The film balances a foresight question - by over-focusing on the question of "What if?" Aspects of Life Can It Really Do the opposite and just make it feel more limited? When Ed starts having sex with a college girl, he becomes addicted and almost forgets about Alice - when he realizes it, he scares him. I haven't heard anything about this movie yet, but I enjoyed it. It's not very well-made and definitely has that deliberately low budget indie feeling like that - but it's much better than most romantic comedies out there in the mainstream today. <br /> <br /> Check it out if you get a chance.
