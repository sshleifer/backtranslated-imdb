it is not Larry McMurty's masterpiece, but it stands on its own as a good Western, any of the lonely doves. who ever takes the role of a Woodrow call, makes a great depiction in their own style. It's also easy to see that they wanted to use it as a springboard to the TV series (both versions) and that the writers knew how to keep the lively William Peterson's taste in this amazing work. the character he plays in this - this guy can do everything he seems <br /> <br /> deserves to be enjoyed by those who like western. <br /> <br /> 4 stars
