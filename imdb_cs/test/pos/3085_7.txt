This is definitely one of Mel Brooks' better films, along with Spaceballs (though I openly admit I haven't seen many more). It is very silly and thoroughly funny, it is hardly more than a few minutes during a two-hour run-time where you will not have fun. Almost all gags have a great comic effect, few of them fall. I saw this movie right after I saw and viewed Spy Hard and compared these two spoof movies, realizing exactly how good this movie really is. It's fun from start to finish, none of the comedies is exaggerated or boring. Music is amazing as well as dance and fight choreography. Acting is pretty much what you would normally expect from this type of movie ... Elwes is a great comedian and makes a good Robin. The storyline is a typical Robin Hood, more or less all of the legend fits into this movie (and spoofed majorly). If you like Mel Brooks, or you're just a fan of stupid humor, or you're just dying to watch a good parody of the legend of Robin Hood, that's definitely a movie for you. Special attention to HBO First Look on the movie is also worth watching, and in this case you want to watch credits. I would recommend it to any Mel Brooks fan and to people who enjoy silly humor. 7/10
