This film succeeded for what was set. It's a short tragic movie. While my selection of movies are the ones that really develop characters and their relationships, this movie is meant to just give you a taste, giving you a "what happens next" factor. After watching him, I wanted more, more character stories, what influences they had to do for the people they were. I think that's what the creators intended to think of the audience. Acting is amazing. There are not many lines in the film, so their body language, facial expressions, and overall presence must be strong enough to hold back the scene. Franco and Miner have this element and it shows. For them (especially Franco) to take the time to do this, she probably says they believed in this movie and wanted to be out of it and for that I appreciated the film for what it was. I am also happy to have it, so I can share it with other people who would never know it.
