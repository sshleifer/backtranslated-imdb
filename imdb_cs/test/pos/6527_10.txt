This is the first American movie I've seen at this year's edition, and I think it's going to be the biggest one because of that feeling. As a teenage singer in America, Aaron is not as popular as before, most of the Americans I met said his song was fake and he didn't even know how to rap. But the attention, everyone, this is the baby, how many people can understand it. Being a pop fan is difficult, and being a pop star is more difficult. I think this time Aaron (JD) shows something real to us. And I think people should learn to understand each other. On the other hand, I like the music in the movie very much. that if you like this movie you may also be a pop fan. Finally, I hope you have a great time.
