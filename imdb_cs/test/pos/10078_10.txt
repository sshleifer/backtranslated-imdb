It's strange how the least known movies ever end up being the best you have ever seen. This movie has all the elements of standard modern thriller, weapons, techno, baddies, money, etc., And yet it stands out from your average Hollywood also-ran. I would admit it to two very charismatic people. Christopher Walken has great confidence and Lorraine Bracco is one of the hottest and sexiest women I've ever seen on screen. Another important reason why this movie excels is setting it up in Jamaica after the start. The Jamaican resort is so beautiful that you want to be there by the pool at night with Run'n'Coke. . . I know I did it. I'm very happy to see this movie - it was too nice to miss it!
