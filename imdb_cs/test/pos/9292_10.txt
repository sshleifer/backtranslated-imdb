That's exactly what Australian TV and Australian politics need, people with a sense of humor !!! Good at ABC to support these guys. The show is based on a couple of Aussie guys who know how to take mickey from politicians or other people in the spotlight. Boys use Sydney as their main base to get the public to the scene. Beware of Crazy Wharehouse Guy or Mr. Ten Questions. The guys doing these things are the same guys who presented CNNN. If you enjoyed CNNNN and Glasshouse, you will love this show. I am still interested in knowing which stunts are real and which are purely acting, because there are some controversial actions by the guys ...
