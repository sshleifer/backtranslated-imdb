I just saw the movie over Netflix. I was wondering how the film was described, but in the end it was better. I have moved to many different directions while watching this movie. I was filled with injuries, hate, anger, bitterness, pain, and finally relief. Looking at the accused young man would break your heart and convince you that they had a bad person. Police smuggling forces you to cringe because, as Rodney King Beating, the police brutality, pointed out, this film brings a complete lack of moral fibers on these shelves. And the fact that they beat the boy and took it with him only makes you more angry. But I have to tell you that I fell in love with Mc Guinness. One of my favorite lines when he told us what a 'police hole' was ... The cop told him to continue sucking on the cancer stick. Mc Guinness told the police ... "I always have a cigarette before sex ..." I let him know I was going to screw him. <br /> <br /> I have a new respect for some laws in this country.
