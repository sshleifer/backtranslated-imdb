This film accurately portrays the fighting life of a typical East German language. Watched by the secret police, friends and co-workers, most Eastern Europeans simply existed. Strelzyk and Wetzel's family were two families who decided not to take it anymore. Despite the extreme danger of escaping to the West, they feel that rewards far outweigh the risks. John Hurt and Beau Bridges, depicting the respective family heads, hit the idea of ​​flying over the heavily fortified border of East Germany. There are tense moments as they gather and jimmy-rig the necessary materials for years. They work in their jobs and build a balloon at night, right under the noses of the authorities, one of whom is Strelzyk's neighbor (Klaus Loewitsch). <br /> <br /> The first attempt, which concerns only Strelzyk, ends in failure when the balloon falls just a few meters from the border. A crashed balloon is discovered by border guards and a tireless search begins with conspirators who are determined to try again. Peter and Guenter, with the sales of material that is carefully watched, can still get pieces and pieces of fabric that can be used to build a second balloon for nail biting. The film also presents the pleasing and effective soundtrack of late Jerry Goldsmith.
