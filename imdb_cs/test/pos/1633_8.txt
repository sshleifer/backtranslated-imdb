Da Vinci's code introduced us to Dr. Robert Langdon and his talent for solving puzzles, angels, and demons resurrected ante by providing a huge 8-hour puzzle. , Ron Howard does a good job that is easy to follow and easier to receive. Da Vinci's code threw so many angles at you in such a short time that a quick break in the bathroom would confuse you a bit. I didn't feel it was with angels and demons, the action was straightforward, and the action kept the top level. Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) was in my favorite movie characters. His portrayal of the elitist but misunderstood position of the Catholic Church was very good, and in combination with the victim of his treatment, Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), you'll find that you choose the parties right after the performance. There is not a great deal of time Tom Hanks because the film focuses more on the story than the character development, and with me good that I had more than enough introduction from the first movie. Unfortunately I found Ayelet Zurer character Vittoria Vetra to be a useless femme assistant in the search because her lines were a bit limited and seemed like something like an idea. He plays a key role in the beginning of things, but soon disappears in the background that Langdon's "known" is more than an essential partner. The action is as such, one of the organizations that the Catholic Church in the past bothered (there were quite a few), tried to avenge itself in the most beautiful way. Some men of the Church are abducted and should be executed at certain times until the end of the Church itself. Dr. Robert Landon is brought to help decipher the tracks and teams with the beautiful Vittoria Vetra, a scientist who has witnessed a colleague died in the hands of the enemy of the Church. Music remained relevant and cinematography beautiful, I could pursue this inferior thing, but what makes angels and demons totally functional is the conclusion. It was by far one of the most remarkable surprises I saw in the movie and I was amazed at how I was when it hit me. Like anyone else, I appreciate the great wrap and this film wraps it and drops a nice bow on it. Needless to say, I left the theater with pleasure in the film in its entirety. <br /> <br /> If you are religious and unsure whether this film will offend your Catholic principles. I can say that where the DaVinci code painted Catholicism as a shadow cover group of sadists, they were painted with a much lighter brush by angels and demons. The Church is shown as a collective of good people who are forced to suffer for the sins of the evil and misleading men who wore their colors and even those who have penetrated their modern ranks.
