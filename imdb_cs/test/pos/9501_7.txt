No more beef and cabbage for her! This little romantic comedy clips from the scene to the scene with several exotic twists (some imaginary scenes and costume parties). All this is centered around the wife of her husband (wife) who wants to break out of the doldrums played by Gloria Swanson (she is twenty!). Both front men have natural air that is convincing, and of course Swanson is perfect in all types of moods, from frivolous to hopeful. Behind all the games and obvious ease is the old serious problem of staying in love and not wandering in love. There's a bit of grim, but director DeMille is at the top of it to keep him calm and believable in everyone. Like many movies from this period, subtitles do not just say what they say (or think), but they often give a kind of philosophical insight as if they justify tragedy (or racism). And here's the higher purpose, probably better without instructional text, but it's part of the narrative style and it's kind of quaint. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a visual or formal stunning, you won't find it here. But as a story, well done and filmed with precision and economy, it's a really great example. Events may not come as a complete surprise, but it's a modern love story that takes place almost a hundred years ago, it's gas. Did I see that Swanson is perfect?
