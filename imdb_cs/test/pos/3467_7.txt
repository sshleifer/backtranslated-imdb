I went to pre-screening "Rory O'Shea was here." I like this movie better than I expected because of the excellent cast and powerful performance. It's a film about the friendship of two disabled young people. Rory is a free spirit young man who wants to be independent of his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move two fingers, but he can speak eloquently and help his new friend Michael, who has cerebral palsy, and is severely disrupted. I think it's enough to start with a weeping drama. Well that is. But with inspiring news and deeply moving performances. It made me look at my life for things that I take for granted. What would I do if I could only do two fingers? I should feel grateful for what I have and what I am capable of. That's a good movie, though it could have been better.
