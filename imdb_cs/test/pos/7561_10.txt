Will some PLEASE company do (good +) DVDs of this movie! ??? Besides being a great movie about relationships and friendships, "Four Friends" is the ONLY movie I've ever seen - and I've literally spent * years * of my life watching movies! - It captures the essence of the 60s of experience (and I was there!): idealism, hope, freedom, confusion, betrayal, and finally their positive but bitterly denounced denouement. And all this is accomplished without the story of the many upheavals of that time, though many of them touch ... as part of the tapestry. But the story is about characters and their friendship for about 10-15 years ... and they survived and deepened despite the tragedy of this turbulent decade. Absolutely joy and the need to see a movie ... even if he's not an old hippie !!!
