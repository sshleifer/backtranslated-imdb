Like most other reviewers, I really enjoyed this TV miniseries. I didn't see it when it came out for the first time, but my grandfather - a big fan of secrets and war films - recorded it in 1989. I remember watching him one night in the cabin of my grandparents and being totally drawn into the story! It has a very interesting plot and a good combination of drama, romance and espionage. I've seen a lot of movies taking place during World War II. Fortunately, I was able to make a VHS copy of the movie a few years ago. I've been watching it a couple of times and still enjoying it. I'd like this movie to be released on DVD. It would be much easier to see chapters.
