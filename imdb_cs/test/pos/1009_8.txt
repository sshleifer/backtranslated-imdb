I hate football! I hate football fans! I hate cars! but this movie was the funniest thing I've seen for some time. At the weekend I got a great opportunity to see this movie and all I have to say is that I laughed until I cried and when it would be available in the UK and Denmark. Girls, this is one football movie you'll have to see, it's fun! The fact that this movie started out as a crazy ad for a phone company is just amazing, guys don't have to be well known actors, but that's good on earth real humor, with real people, and I applaud Give them that for the screen. <br /> <br /> WELL DONE!
