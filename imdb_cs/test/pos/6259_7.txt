Malcolm McDowell diagnoses Megan Gallagher's daughter and she has a form of illness when they believe they see "Huldre", troll-like animals that live with "rocks and roots" (citing a movie). Basically, the family moves to an older house that has a smaller doll house in the yard. Daughter (played well by Sofia Vassilius) will befriend her creatures until they become vengeful. The family cat will also disappear. There are some good scenes with Megan Gallagher ("Millennium") and Malcolm McDowell as a psychiatrist. There is also something special that has occurred in one of McDowell's patients. <br /> <br /> If you like this type of story, you can also like "Bad Ronald" who had a similar special theme, and the house is creepy bad Ronald (Scott Jacoby) just that movie is from the 70s. 7/10.
