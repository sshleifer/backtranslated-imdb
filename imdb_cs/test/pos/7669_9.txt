I was very pleased with the recent viewing of this beautifully shot widescreen adaptation revival in 1943 (as opposed to the original 1935 production), which included extensive spoken reciters. That was fashion at the time, so the film was blamed for a 16-year tradition. The film should only be seen when Sammy Davis Jrs acts like Sportin 'Life, sneaking in and out of the shadows. His seduction of BESS "Dorothy Dadridge" "It's for New York Company Soon" is one of many highlights. Almost all the main music is untouched and beautifully sung. Certainly never get bored by the recent versions of PBS and MET. It was a pleasure to see that the time had not diminished, and hopefully it would be available in the near future for generations that had no chance to experience it.
