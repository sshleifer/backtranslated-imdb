This is the ultimate, and I think ULTIMATE, ADVENTURE CLASSIC! The plot is good against evil. There have always been a number of films that depict gray areas, and not enough for the basic good against evil that would match the real cases of good against evil in the real world. Only recently did filmmakers try to equalize their chances. In real life, more than half of the situations are black and white, but only a fraction of the movies look like that. This film is the best example of reverse and white look. This is best seen in black and white. The hero is in the worst situation. It is in the territory of a man who wants to murder him and between different enemies. The film feels that it is hopelessly renumbered and cannot help. His enemy (count) has many resources. The Count's wife was forced to marry him and knows from her past history that she will kill her sooner or later when she does all her wives. She and the hero become allies and fall in love with each other, which could win over anyone who would watch it (unless the man wanted to be just the opposite frat). Anyone who helps them is killed. They have no escape. The situation is hopeless. So eventually they will survive? You won't guess if you don't read spoilers. The film also has a lot of great atmosphere, adventure and intrigue, along with Lon Chaney as a bad guy, and Boris Karloff in his best role, as a decent man. Karloff was usually cast as a bad man when he was presented with more complex roles like this. Chaney rarely received a complicated role, though he took things in several movies, such as "Mice and Men". This is a little more than portraits for him. But tension never stops. There is tension and danger all over the world. Perfectly written, perfectly cast and perfectly directed. This is what the film should be a clean escape, pure adventure.
