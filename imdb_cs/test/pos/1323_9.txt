Mishima is one of the biggest films ever made. Now I think Paul Schrader is the greatest screenwriter of all time, but I don't like the movies he directed to what I saw (except this and Affliction), but it's amazing, disturbing, and highly Studying three-dimensional. It follows the life of Yukio Mishima, Japan's most famous writer, combining the last day of his life with flashbacks and his stories. I don't know how, but Paul Schrader can combine all these things in a very artistic way. Acting is great as well as photos, and the perfect Philip Glass score. Although the first view is confusing, it is one of the few films that get richer every time you look. Really underestimated film gem.
