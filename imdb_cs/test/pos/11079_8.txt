Take the young liberal idealist Christopher Boyce (Timothy Hutton) into a secret classification in the government frontline because of his father's position, who will connect him with the drug dealer D'Anton Lee (Sean Penn) whom the police want, a new source of income and you have espionage recipe. Sean Penn played the role of a punk drug dealer with a certain sung froid apparently from some verisimility with such rattle types. Penn Gelatin carries a unique situation in every situation; he even suggests that the Soviets run drugs for him. <br /> <br /> I've seen the film over and over and every time I see something new. It seems to me that the main problem of US spy organizations is their inbreeding, which leads to hiring an apparently inappropriate candidate because of the temperament and propensity for a government front company. I remember when Falconeer escaped from prison and led the authorities on a wild chase. I see that despite the leak he is now released. Too bad the Soviets are no longer willing to accept the poor! Vesel√© Cherio!
