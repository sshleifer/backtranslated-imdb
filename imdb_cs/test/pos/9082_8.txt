Although Flatliners is 15 years old, I saw him this evening. I heard about the movie Flatliners, but I never talked about him to go out and rent it, or to notice it. Well, I grabbed him on one of the premium channels and I must say it was very good. This film was about some great young medical students who decided to explore death. They have come up with a way to get a person to die briefly and bring him back to life. In addition to the star cast, this film had some serious bite to it. The very same idea of ​​exploring death is quite intriguing, but I really thought the writer and the director did a great job of giving a different but still looking look. It was no general attempt at excitement, frightening and the creation of the mind's mind ... that was the real solution. Instead of becoming an empty, superficial, stellar thriller, this film was essence. Deep, white joints, a tough nasal thriller. I give it 8/10.
