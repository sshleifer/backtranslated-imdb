Today, Hollwood seems to be exceptionally exceptional. Many consider the nominated nominees for the film industry to be the best two nominations. And in "Everything is lit", the mark is hit directly. <br /> <br /> The movie launches its brilliance with beautiful scene entry. From the beginning you get a feeling of warmth and real family relationships and relationships between them. The casting is also perfectly installed. For the character of Elijah Wood, Jonathon, his sensitivity is expressed by holding the hand of a dying grandmother. And for a character named Alex, it's easy to see his life in his perspective - a true Ukrainian rock star. With the first lighting, the story slowly relaxes into our minds when Jonathon decides to go to Ukraine to meet a woman who believes she will save his grandfather, the whole family. And from there the story moves slowly, but it keeps pace from the contrast of the harsh tear drip and laughter and loud humor contained in the scene, every scene. The film itself is rather a grant, there are several complaints from other sources commenting on Liev Schrieber's inaccurate adaptation of the novel Jonathon Safron Foer. I have never personally read a novel. But no film, especially this film in particular should not be graded on whether the film's story matches the story of the book, but rather how the main concepts from the novel were rendered and utilized through film. Just because it can be far-pulled from the novel does not mean that this film is no longer necessary to see - it is still. During the film, new information floods the viewer's mind very slowly. Some of these thoughts are never answered; and in fact the other half of the film reorientes the whole subject and the reason for traveling around Ukraine to something else, but somewhat similar to the original intent of this film. However, the film leaves you on a satisfied note - but the tears can be dropped on the weak souls. And the whole movie. for stingy people with a common sense of humor, they just have to laugh at the fun and ongoing conversation of Alex and John. I would recommend this film to several different types of people: those who like movies that share the genre of drama-comedy, for those who are interested in family relationships, and those who are interested in the Holocaust items. And to those freaks who find a slapstick like a jolly comedy, this movie isn't for you. And for you who think it is a really funny and totally funny movie, you are wrong; this film shares comedy moments and dramatic sequences. And to those who judge the film based on their similarity to the novel, you may or may not use this movie, but this film should be considered much more than whether or not it is near the book. Overall, "All Illuminated" is a brilliant work that enlightens one's heart.
