This movie from what I remember was such a great movie! I was watching it on TV when I was 11, and I couldn't remember its name. If I remember correctly, I believe it was a strange Christmas TV movie. One of my friends at work and I have been discussing it for years, but neither of us remembered the title. But we remembered almost the entire movie. No one else at work remembered seeing it! Thank goodness that someone on the TV movie site answered my post! Now I have a fun job looking for a copy of it! It's amazing what you remember as a child, but this movie definitely stays alive in my head ... even after 28 years. And I believe I only saw it once. Maybe it was because I was the oldest sister in my family, or maybe because I was a child and worked in day care centers that I was so stuck out for so long. No matter the real reason, it has remained one of the movies that I really wanted to watch lately !!! If anyone knows where to watch it online or has a copy, please let me know. I'd love to see it again !!!! Thanks a lot! Seriously, I tried to send it and it says my comment is not long enough. So, I must write more, did you know that Melissa Michaelsen is Peter Billingsley's sister who played in the Christmas story? I know I'm not the only fan of this movie, so if anyone has any idea where to find it, I'd appreciate it.
