This is an excellent tub-thumper of war years. John Mills leads the subtle cast of regular British B-movie stalwarts in a solo submarine attack on a fictitious enemy battleship. Recorded in black and white, it's well stimulated and also well placed, considering that the war is happening at the time. If anything, it shows how much the authorities have taken positive propaganda. The mission-side of the film takes place in the right submarine. Things are cramped and claustrophobic. The actors look suitably filthy and sweaty without being too offensive to the hero's palate. Other commentators have already pointed out authentic details such as keeping the cushion of the vessel and oblivious to reading instruments as well as activities in the engine room. Probably it's the first movie in which there are debris (and the dead German) being thrown out of the torpedo tube to deceive the enemy. And it is ONLY the time when I saw a part of the vessel subjected to the sinking - a high risk of gambling, if any. I'm a little skeptical about whether or not a submarine could be pushed through a wire net. The submerged velocity was barely twice the rate of human walking, and the net would have a lot of "doses." The engineer was also on the same workstation and operated the same levers on the surface and submerged. It also seems unlikely because either diesel or electric engines were used and were in different parts of the ship - or so I was told. There was a little too big a coastal drama for my cravings. But then it was a propaganda effort and clearly contained a subtle message to civilians to think of how it behaves as it might adversely affect service morale and thus war effort. little adventure. Nowadays, films of this year tend to be shown in the afternoon, while much more modern and inferior films enjoy first-class time. But then; it is no longer politically correct to mention the war in the presence of our European friends (too many of them guilty of conscience), or our own leftist fascists (of whom we have never fought for freedom that they now take for granted). <br /> <br /> As a submarine film, it is extremely collectible. Better than "Enemy Under", I think, though less demonstrative. It is not as authentic as 'Das Boot' in any way, but not as rude.
