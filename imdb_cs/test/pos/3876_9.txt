The A-team keeps repeating every day on Dutch TV (RTL7, around 1800 hours) and I'm still watching it! I don't like A-Team ... I love them! It's great to see Justin chasing former A-Team members. It brings back memories from the old days when I was young sweet. I would give you 10 for excellent, but Justin seems to chase former A-team members alone. Of course this is the only bad thing about this document. Too bad Justin doesn't look for Melinda Culea ("Amy A. Allen"). It's great to see Mr. T. in action. Too bad for him. But the party is too short to laugh again and see everyone in action again.
