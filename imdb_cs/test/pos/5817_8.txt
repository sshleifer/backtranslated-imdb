Minnie and Moskowitz are the prettiest and most painful love story I've ever seen. Between Minnie, the disenchanted curator of the museum whose disgraceful spouse fires her and leaves her even more agitated and confused than she was, and Seymour Moskowitz, a parking assistant who so desperate for the attention that she spends the night in bars and restaurants aggravating People, From the Beginning is a chaotic and disillusioned match. Like many couples we see every day. In almost every love story there is a man and a woman, a man is self-confident, witty, classically hot or attractive in his own way, whose flaws are glamorous, and a woman hurt a soul who might have a man he wants who chooses the guy because there's just something on it. These films force everyone to feel so good, because characters embody what every man and woman want to be, not what they are. Instead of enjoying any fantasy in romance, Minnie and Moskowitz portray people who may be more ordinary than attractive, self-confident people with so much experience in the field. What is the story of love affairs of an ugly, disturbingly uncomfortable, lifeless man, and no work we've all come across, or a woman so paralyzed by the uncertainty that it's hard to talk to her? The film is not as fascinating as Cassavetes' faces or the opening night, but it has such a riveting quality that Cassavetes has always fought so hard that it is an unwavering portrayal of ego people hiding behind each other in all other films . Gena Rowlands and Seymour Cassel, bringing surprisingly pitiful people, are barely sympathetic. Moskowitz is almost crazy, let alone Minnie. Forcing himself so strongly in his life, the data is an explosion of our inner voices that respond to the blatantly dissatisfied day at a time when we were all, rejections we all swallowed, and the arguments we all had. that we knew our own mistakes. I admire a film like Minnie and Moskowitz, because with the trademark with Cassavetes helmed, she identifies us with 100% honesty. Our egos play no part in society with its characters, which is a huge success for the performance of the actor.
