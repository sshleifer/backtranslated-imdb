A little chicken egg, this. I started to hate him, it's a predictable setting of an "old dark house", a constant mention of recent American horrors and regular journeys up and down lit corridors. But it goes on and has a moment of originality. I started wondering as soon as the killing started as they headed for the sixth, but then we went back to the previous visit to the building and saw the whole kill a bloody killing that is pretty effective. Naschy is fine and at the end it was a nice movie. It just doesn't jump up and catch one, pretty hard.
