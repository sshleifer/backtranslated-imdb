I first saw this great movie and Alyssa, my star *, playing Frances Ella Fitz, was so great in this movie! It was so real and her little dog so cute! I saw it for the first time when I was 11 years old and was the best movie I've ever seen and you know what? I still think so! 10/10 ********** = Biggest!
