John Carpenter's brilliantly exciting film is a great fusion of Sci-Fi and horror that takes on the classic theme of body exchange and takes it to its limit. The Remake of Howard Hawks produced the original 1951, Carpenter holds the themes of the Cold War paranoia and confidence as the background of the alien takeover and impending fate amid the insanity and isolation of the Antarctic setting. Tesar's direction is always excellent because his camera slides through a lonely world of characters whose inhabited environment is to be destroyed by the primordial fear of taking over the body. But here, and like the work of David Cronenberg, Carpenter does not hold on to the incident, because with some fantastic special effects we are witnessing some mad moments of surreal gore. However, he never loses contact with the human side of the story, because in the face of all the shocking things that are happening before us, we have a perceived notion of trust and suspicion. 9/10
