It happened by accident. I was at my friends' house and just started watching him, so I sat down thinking that we would shoot the wind while it was playing in the background. However, within seconds, I plunged into this dock-drama and we both spent the rest of the time totally focused on the subject and didn't say a word. I've never known the story of the first solo race in the yachting world, let alone the tragic events of one man's attempt against a course that became his redemption for all his misfortunes. it eventually becomes their example. When I did not know about the story, I watched it with the same zeal as I imagine those who read about the race when it was actually happening, devouring what is happening and longing for more information, hoping that the lone amateur was ripping out against him against the course and beat the professional, causing the shocking twists of the story to be more tragic, I felt like I lived a story. The story is told with great caution, and the interviewees apparently had time to think of a tragedy that gives a great deal of attention, but is also nicely contrasted with archive footage of tragedy interviews, recordings and photographs of lone sailors are also greatly used, and looking into the minds of the sailors and how loneliness influenced them was excellent. I'm shocked that this story is not generally known or turned into a film, but also grateful. Grateful that we have this drama-documentary film that tells the story of those who knew the man instead of some wise-crafted film adaptation, and grateful that I captured this movie gem by pure chance. <br /> <br /> It's necessary to see if you like documents or not.
