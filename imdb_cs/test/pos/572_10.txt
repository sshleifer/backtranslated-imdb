You know, before I saw this movie, I had little sympathy for those who were caught up in criminal matters. I mean, if they were arrested and accused, "they had to be guilty", I justified it? I've created this opinion for years. You see, my good friend once worked as a detective in some of the more delicate areas of Sydney. He often complained that his police efforts were wasted due to 'bleeding hearts' lawyers and magistrates. "It would bang in the morning and they would be at noon" back on the street. "It took its toll ... wore it down and he ended up. <br /> <br /> Since then, he was arguing, not disproportionately thought that the creative evidence of gathering to make the baddies" where they belong "was ... well ... "acceptable". <br /> <br /> My arguments about the rights of innocent people weren "What are the chances you will ever be arrested and charged with a serious crime?" that he is a law-abiding citizen, the weight of his argument has convinced me that he is right, of me, or of my family or friends who have been charged with murder or a serious offense, was zero than I thought. > <br /> Hmmmmm, as I mentioned earlier when I saw this amazingly informative document, everything changed. <br /> <br /> I'm sending him a copy.
