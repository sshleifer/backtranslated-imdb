I went to see it because I have some friends in Ukraine. but the film has moved me beyond what I expected by showing myself the perfect combination of abdominal laughter (Alex's special use of English) sitcom and difficulty bordering on depression. I loved the range. I wanted to jump into the old car and go on a trip to Ukraine. Alex (hutz) perfectly plays his part of the guide and provides a great counterpoint to the poker elijah woods who has faced seriousness. the film shows the positive side of humanity when ppl of different cultures can join and do the right thing when they feel the sincerity of the situation, even when they enter into it with biased ideas and prejudices, and how it can open the door to the deep buried memory. there is a lot in this movie.
