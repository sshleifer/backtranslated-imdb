I gave this show a chance because of Jaleel White, not for his Urkel character, but mainly for Sonic the Hedgehog voice XD So just as I said, I gave him a chance, and I was very happy. I never cared about Urkel's character, so I was delighted to see Mr. White in a different role than a sometimes so unpleasant nerd. And his Calvin J. Fraiser (first Calvin, but comes the second episode, all started calling him "J") was very entertaining and interesting. I think my favorite episode was when J was dating an ex-Cowboys cheerleader with a snobbish boy. ("You're not saying that 'bout my mum!" "It's an adult to talk, you stay down there!") The only beef I have is that the show was supposed to assume 3 main characters, but Mr White's character seemed to always have the biggest Attention, and the other two (who are married) have always had back stories ... It's not good if the story of the two that might be pregnant will return to J. Watching his girlfriend's dog ..... > <br /> In addition, I really wish that this exhibition lasted a little longer. Unfortunately, it seems that people are not interested in Jaleel White as anything but divine horrible annoying ass nerd known as Urkel .... <br /> <br /> I hope they have at least interpreted it as a DVD box file.
