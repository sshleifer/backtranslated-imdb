The quality of the animation is definitely under par IMO, regardless of the age of the OAV. The story itself makes sense, but the characters don't. That might sound picky, but since Olympus is almost entirely inhabited by living machines, do you feel comfortable as a human being? Would a machine imitate human arrogance, myopia and greed so effectively? I doubt it. There are some pointers to this in the film, but only when the team can be bothered to give them, and the great 'bioroids' (or what they are) are interchangeable with human characters. It seems to me to be careless. The main characters seem to have some kind of emotional involvement, though no light is cast on it. There is a small light behind the scenes, a big pity. The short film length associated with focus on moss and crime means we don't see any depth of character. Earthwork is all down, but we left no finished product. The cropped version of this OAV would make a great television episode once some character sub-conspiracies were founded. The highlight of this short film are mecha designs and action / espionage. Defects begin to show up after you have had the opportunity to spend all the action, so I couldn't recommend it to the owners, but it's definitely worth a watch or two! Although this is mostly negative, I think it is worth it to look at it, but it is not something that should be rushed and bought. In short: Observed missed opportunity.
