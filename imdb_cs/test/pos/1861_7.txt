Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star in Creation, which depicts the period of Charles Darwin's life prior to publication of "On the Origin of Species" in 1859, his infamous, world changing tome on evolution and natural selection. Darwin's research created a huge rift, a split between believers of his day and scientists. At that time he was told that he would go to war against God, and even "kill God". The film revolves around Darwin's life with his wife and four children. Jennifer Connelly is outstanding as his extremely pious and loving wife. The revealing scene in the beginning, when it leads the prayer table for dinner and Charles does not say "Amen", is a harbinger of what will follow, and what will be between them. She is convinced that she will be eternally damned and will bring bad luck to her family by rejecting God. Darwin is torn between his strong love for his wife, his faith and his stronger reason. There are beautiful moments out of his animal watching, dissecting their behavior and sequences that make up their lives, explaining the phenomenon of choosing their children, the first born, Annie, with a very morbid curiosity. We see him interacting with England's first orangutan, Jenny, playing with him as if it were a child, and deciphering her every look and action. Annie, the eldest child, later dies, and Charles becomes the dreadful death closest to her. In my opinion, this part was too long, bizarre and exhausted. I didn't like trippy scenes where she seems to be losing her mind and being chased by her daughter's spirit, screaming and screaming. Though Charles thinks his wife is accusing him of his deadly illness, he says very poetically: "The truth is, if I knew what I now know, I would marry you tomorrow." Their bond is solid and unbreakable despite the huge differences in beliefs. When Charles finishes his handwriting, he gives his wife a last copy and tells her he can burn it if he doesn't. He stays at the end of the reading and finally introduces him to a package, a book ready to be sent to her publisher. Ultimately, the reason and perhaps love, the triumph, because he makes an accomplice of his most nasty adversary. It is fascinating that Darwin received a full Christian funeral at Westminster Abbey, proof that his land-surprising thoughts were obviously considered controversial, but were recognized as important knowledge for the development of the human race. The film definitely draws on Darwin's family life, his joys and problems. I liked such an aspect, but Fabio said it was like watching a documentary about the quote "Hitler's Passion for Ping-Pong". This is in some ways true and I cannot disagree with his desire to learn more about Charles Darwin's theories from this film than we do. But it remains a well-executed and flawless period drama. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 Fabio: 7 Total score: 14
