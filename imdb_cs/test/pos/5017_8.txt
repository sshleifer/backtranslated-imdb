What is it about some films that generate such polar opposing reactions? Some people have called High Roller "disgusting" here. Some have called it "extraordinary" (as I am). Why? I think it's because films like this don't create cracks or degeneration spells, and some people can't deal with it emotionally. They need a hero. I would also add that if they are gamblers or poker players, they may feel personally betrayed when their existence is not justified. High Roller in NIE is not poker. It's a PEOPLE movie. It is not perfect, but it looks good, it is well written and behaved beautifully. And best of all, it creates an emotional response and inspires reflection. And maybe it's what makes people so damn crazy.
