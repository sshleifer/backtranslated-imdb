In the last days of 1999, most people in Taiwan died. There was a strange plague on the island. This disease, allegedly spread by cockroaches, sends its victims to psychosis where it acts as an insect. They will eventually die. The hole is set in a crumbling tenement house (which is especially well designed; which way for the stage designer!). His two protagonists live directly above and below them. The woman is on the lower floor, and the ducts above her flat escape, threatening to destroy her food supply, not to mention her health. He calls the plumber to inspect it and, by mistake, throws a hole in the floor of a male apartment. They've never met each other and come into contact through a hole. The script is quite brilliant. At the same time, several films are humorous and at the same time completely human, deeply exploring the human state, especially the feelings of loneliness and despair. The direction of Tsai is simply beautiful. Like many other Taiwanese directors, he uses many long issues. But unlike, say, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Tsai doesn't overload them. Actually, I don't know if I saw them use better. They are always effective and never boring. It would be wrong to review this movie without putting music numbers. Yes, The Hole is also a musical, and the big one. In the best scenes of the film - something she says, considering how good all the other scenes are - one imagines that a woman is a singer, almost a cabaret singer. These numbers are fully choreographic, often with backup dancers and singers. In the genius move, Tsai has these elaborately made figures taking place in a crumbling building, a sign of apocalypse and decay hidden. This provides both pathos and absurdity. A hole is a film that demands to be seen. It should be a cult classic if nothing else. Before I went to see it, I was told it was a decent movie, but it's probably the least good Tsai Ming-liang. If that's true, I can't wait to see more! 10/10.
