A great movie about the triumph over all the nay-sayers who are trying to kill their spirit, achieving the impossible. I will not go further than saying that I like this movie when I am struggling with something particularly daunting, and I realize that if Lindberg could do what he did, I would surely have the task ahead of me. Definitely a "good feeling" movie. <br /> <br /> Look. You won't be disappointed.
