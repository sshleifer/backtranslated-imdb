"The Journey" is a romantic version of the Cold War. It's about an English woman (Deborah Kerr) trying to smuggle her earlier love, a Hungarian scientist (Jason Robard, Jr.), from Hungary during a 1956 Hungarian uprising. to get out of Hungary across the Austrian border. Of course, the Russians will stop by bus for security checks. The Russian-in-charge officer (Yul Brynner) is attracted to an English woman (Deborah Kerr) and lagged the way. Of course, a Russian officer knows the truth about a Hungarian scientist acting as a British citizen, but has decided not to arrest a scientist because he is waiting for an English woman to come to him. Of course, that sounds ridiculous, but it's a fun movie you're looking at. Despite the romantic flow of dialogue between Mr Brynner and Mrs Kerr, which seems inappropriate in the situation in which they are situated, the film becomes exciting and interesting. Good behavior prevails over some stupid dialogues. Perhaps some people involved in the Hungarian uprising would not appreciate this film; they would consider it a piece of fluff. This is my favorite role of Yul Brynner. He speaks his own male voice and is very attractive, especially when he becomes vulnerable. This is Deborah Kerr's second time working with Yul Brynner because they did "The King and I" in 1956. They make a very attractive couple. Too bad they never worked again. It was the second sexy role Mrs. Kerr took from "From Here to Eternity". Despite the fact that Mrs. Kerr had heavy winter clothes throughout the film, she was very beautiful and sensual. The subtle supportive cast was led by Jason Robards, Jr., in his first film role. Some international casts were recognizable, such as Robert Morley of England. Other actors I've never seen before, or have been in the movie, were just great. In the background, it was fun to see Senta Berger, as one of the maids, to speak several lines of Hungarian. A few years later in 1966, she was in the film, "Casting a Giant Shadow", with Yul Brynner as his leading lady. He still works today.
