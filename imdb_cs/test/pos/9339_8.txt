I don't particularly care from Michael Jackson. Besides being a pedophile, I don't like his music much, except for a few songs from his landmark album THRILLER. That's one of them. I like this video because it's one of the first and most important music videos ever made. Director John Landis, who is known to horror fans as director AN American WEREWOLF IN London. This music video is not so much a music video, but more or less a short horror movie. M.J. and his date is in the werewolf movie. When they leave the film, they are attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty zombies when Michael Jackson makes his famous "Thriller" dance. You know, this is actually a pretty good song with good synthesized rhythms. This and Beat It are probably the only two Michael Jackson songs I can constantly tolerate. Especially I love Vincent Price as a narrator. Its distinctive voice is ideal for a horrific thematic music video. Even if you don't like the music of M.J., you have to see this video at least once. By the way, he was good before he became a haunted white woman with a false nose.
