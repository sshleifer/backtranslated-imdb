What I can say about this band, I was addicted to 68, I was a ten-year-old boy, I grew up on Blues, even though I'm a dad, then these Midlands guys came, a country rock fusion, Heavy Rock and Blues, I wish I was seeing live in the early years, I was fortunate enough to be there at 79 (Knebworth), which was the best gig I saw today, I hope the full version of this hot August night will be the shortest. This CD gave me the chance to see these guys over and over again, the song remains the same, but this CD gets to the roughness. Zepp lives long.
