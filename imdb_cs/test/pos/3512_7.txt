I was fortunate enough to see the DVD version of this movie "Horror Classics" before it was mysteriously removed from 4 movie DVDs and replaced by another. The picture and quality of the film on this edition was a nightmare in itself. However, this version is STILL superior to the one that has luxury DVD processing. The reason was given in Brad Fiedel's interviews on a special DVD. He noticed what I first discovered on this film. This is the use of music in idle times in the movie, but leaving moments of activity in silence, thus giving horror scenes a stronger feel. The problem with this reissue is that it carries another movie score used to fill these deliberate gaps in the score. Fiedel complained about it and made it clear that the music of the fill wasn't his. The music actually sounded a lot like Howard Shore's work for Videodrome. Sad to me, I'm also the main fan of this movie and I have to contact them. <br /> <br /> The film itself has been able to add interesting, realistic elements to the genre horror film. A group of friends going up the mountain, one of them inherited. On the mountain they are confronted with a family with a terrifying secret. The film is moving at a great pace. In fact, every time I saw it, I still found myself shocked to see 45 minutes passed before things started really bad for campers. While the Horror Classics version is full of many gaps, the fact that there is no score for horror scenes is what makes this movie smart and even superior to most movies I've ever seen. Director Jeff Lieberman has made some unique horror movies that preceded what is happening, because it is one of the main streams, but very different from the mainstream. It's a good fun movie with surprising acting performances. The new spiffed up DVD version is worth hiring, now collectors of the Horror Classics item, now the PPE is worth the hunt.
