To get started, it's my favorite ST OS. In addition to the StuOz critical remarks I will throw in some others: Getting technical when Enterprise fires it's photon torpedo on a blind target, they would have to be very close to direct hits (I believe) to cause any disruption to much less damage the Romulan vessel with the vacuum of the universe to fight. I had a somewhat Romulan Commander problem questioning his belief in the Romulan "protocol" or their leadership if it wasn't to do with attacking vulnerable targets (bases in the neutral zone) that were not at war. Also, I don't think the commander would fall to the basic or simple tactic Kirk played, such as "playing dead" or falling on the trick the subordinate gives him to attack the Enterprise when they play Dead. The Enterprise: I'm surprised that after Sulu sees the Romulan ship attack method earlier, she said, "Are they a surrender?" when the Enterprise attacks for the first time. <br /> <br /> Funny how Spock can do a gun repair only when the emergency is over. Also in the Last Attack I thought the Romulan ship was not closed for too long (so long that Spock could escape a few aisles and return to the gun room and activate and burn photon torpedoes. he used phasers, but I'm sure he had to do with technicians and budget. <br /> <br /> Positive page: It's a good drama playing on a Romulan vessel to introduce us to Romulans. There is also his conflict with Spock, and I wished Stiles' character stayed on the show for a while, if for nothing more than the energy he added. just fun to point to negatives and stupid, more). But for me it's as good as it gets !! "Balance of Terror" is always the first one in the ST ranking.
