This movie catches you from the opening scenes and never lets go. You are watching forgiveness in watching the excitement of JÃ¡nos Szaby over coming to America. He's a nice guy. You cannot help him, even if his eagerness is replaced by bitterness as his fate. You know, under his circumstances, you would be forced to make the same decision to survive. This film comments on society's worship of beauty and all things superficial and is only truer in the culture of the 21st century. Janos himself is the victim of this philosophy by telling his blind girlfriend: "You are young and beautiful if you saw the world." And like many modern gangsters, when its security is threatened, it gains vengeance. But his innocence is not completely lost because he demands the same high price of himself, knowing that he deserves his destiny. Peter Lorre is in good shape in this starring role. Few actors have been able to convincingly achieve the transformation of this character from innocent to outraged criminal in sixty-nine minutes. Lorre is supported by all the actors, making him a true picture and not just a single star vehicle. With a little less disciplinary dialogue, this movie would be 10. Highly recommended.
