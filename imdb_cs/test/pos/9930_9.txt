Horror-genius Dario Argento is one of my favorite directors and his films "Suspiria", "Phenomena" and "Profondo Rosso" are on my personal favorite list. 1987's "Opera" is another exciting and brilliant movie that no horror lover can afford to miss and who will keep you on the edge of the chair from start to finish. This stunning and ultra-violent Giallo could be described as the master's most beautiful film, which is quite something that is due to the fact that the Argento films are not exactly known for how their violence is embodied. Violence is extreme and very stylized in a brilliant way that makes opera a censor nightmare. <br /> <br /> - Warning! SPOILERS ahead! Just as Betty (Christina Marsillach), a young opera singer, becomes successful, her murderous and incredibly sadistic psychopath starts chasing her. The murders are indeed brutal and particularly sadistic in nature. The killer attaches the needles to Betty's bound eyelids, so they must keep them open and watch them brutally murder people close to her. When he does it with the cut, the killer issues Betty and leaves just to come back for other friends ... As usual with Argento films, violence is extremely graphic and very stylized. "Opera" is a really brutal movie and what a stylish and atmospheric film is. This film is absolutely irritating and pure from start to finish. The performances are very good, especially Christina Marsillach is in the lead. Breathtaking beauty and a great actress alike, Marsillach fits perfectly into her role as a talented singer whose fear and terrible experiences slowly make her crazy. Other great performances include Ian Charleston's director Horror, who directs the opera, and director director Argento in Darie Nicolodi's real life, who has a role in many of his films. Working with the camera is excellent, as in all Argento and The Opera House films, it is a great environment that greatly contributes to the beauty of the film and its permanently scary atmosphere. The score, which is partly classical and partly heavy metal, is also great, even though I missed Goblin's brilliant Progressive Rock Soundtracks, which is a distinctive feature of most other Argento movies. "Opera" is a really frightening and absolutely breathtaking Giallo experience. This is an absolute must see for all Horror lovers, and I recommend it to any other fan who is not very sensitive about extreme violence. Excellent and absolutely irritating!
