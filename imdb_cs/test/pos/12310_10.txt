I waited for the DEAD to come out on a video that had a largely worn copy of VHS. It is one of the most beautiful films ever made for the holidays. It takes place on the Feast of Epiphany (Twelfth Night), and is a simple, charming vignette of characters taking part in a dinner prepared by three Dublin women. The focal point of the story is a relatively helpless couple, a wife who once passionately loved the young man who died for her, and a man who wants to feel the same kind of passion for his wife, but feels incapable. All the performances are stunning and the scenery between the beautiful figures for dinner blends beautifully. Of course, his source material is James Joyce's short story about the same name, and most of his narrative structure is fully preserved. John Huston's long career as one of Hollywood's greatest filmmakers had with this film, written by his son, Tony Huston; stars his daughter, Anjelica Huston; and is dedicated to his wife Maricella. Thank you Lions Gate for picking up the rights to this movie and releasing it on DVD. For lovers of all things Irish or for people looking for a literate, gentle but incredibly moving holiday movie, it's a real jewel.
