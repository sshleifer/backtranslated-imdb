If you are going to watch this movie because Michael Caine or Michael Gambon are in it then don't bother, it's not their typical role, although I found Gambon fantastic. Instead, watch Dylan Moran I am a fan of everything I have seen, and this is no exception, nor did I realize that he could act, but also the characters he has to go through when I find him completely credible is impressive they know to the audience that they are false. The storyline is a genius and although it is not a constant laugh all the way through it has a lot of other spells. Great movie for people with a sense of humor.
