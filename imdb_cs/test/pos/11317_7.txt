The film is partly a thriller and partly a public service announcement when we see events from the perspective of politicians, terrorists and, of course, victims. In this clever dramatic lesson, information about the contamination and survival of chaos is given, while in the meantime the behind-the-scenes look at how the crisis is being driven encourages viewers to distrust the guards and to make the attackers frightened. The film, originally aired on the BBC, gets aroused effectively by doubts about the official prepareparedness. The performances are correct, underestimated, though never amazing. Flick is just the beginning, a provocative start to a greater discussion, but in my opinion it works, giving the right excitement and making the audience think and ask questions.
