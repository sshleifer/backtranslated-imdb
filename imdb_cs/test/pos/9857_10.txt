One has to be careful to tell us about watching 12-hour movies. It might be easy for people to think that this is a regular occurrence - in fact, even in the world of arthouse cinema, such mammoth run times are, for obvious reasons, very rare. That's one thing Hollywood and art cinema are involved in: a generally accepted 90-120-minute run, with a minority of movies that dare come closer but rarely cross a three-hour mark. For this reason, the movie Out 1 (runtime: 729 minutes) is a challenge for even the toughest kinophilia, somehow explaining why it has sometimes been screened on several occasions and remains extremely difficult. find. Originally designed as a television series by Maverick Nouvelle Vague by Jacques Rivet, it has attracted little interest from the French network and instead went to a short theatrical run (Peter Watkins was forced to do the same with his brilliant pseudo-documentary a documentary about The War Game, although it had more to do with state censorship than running time problems. In 1971, Out 1 appeared several times over the past two decades in several Rivette retrospectives, and many of them, including the acclaimed American critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, have recognized him as one of the greatest films <br /> <br /> Is it? Well, yes, if you like Rivette. This in itself is great if Jacques Rivette has never been a commercially successful director. Only two of his films were hits (Celine and Julie Go Boating (1974) and La Belle Noiseuse (1991), both excellent), and many of them are difficult to find on DVD today (Out 1 just recently became available via the internet after the rare was videotape). However, he is highly respected in the film community and distinguishes him with one good reason - his playfully surrealistic stories, the sense of stimulation and the use of improvisation - from one of the most academic and capable filmmakers. Out 1 deals with a theme that reappears during Rivette's work: the nature of acting, especially in the context of theater and improvisation. His fascination with acting makes Rivett's films a much more cooperative process than many of his contemporaries, as improvisation aspects allow actors to play a more active role in determining how the film combines. Out 1 is roughly divided into four major stories, gradually blending and blurring as the film evolves: two consisting of triad acting, each attempting to devise a post-modern theatrical adaptation of Aeschylus' plays; the other two individual pet thieves (played by Nouvelle Vague icons by Jean-Pierre Léaud and Juliet Berto) pursue eccentric methods of making money; and an umbrella plot involving a mysterious plot inspired by Balzac, centered around an organization known as "thirteen." As with any Rivette movie that includes a plot story, the secrets and secret organizations are a little bit more than red herring. As the characters slowly explore and reveal, and their plans and interpersonal relationships break down, the film becomes more symbolic after 1968 and the decline of the ideals of that time. For the film made in 1971, this was notably the prescient themes; another French director at Jean Eustache would address this topic equally satisfactorily in his masterpiece The Mother and the Whore. However, this is not the Out 1 limit. <br /> <br /> It consists of eight episodes, each lasting about 90 minutes (the beginning of each episode has a short, abstract black-and-white, and still assembles events from the previous chapter). than any quality TV series, and can even be better experienced on one episode - on time. This does not mean that it does not remain difficult even when viewed in segments. Like most Rivette films, it uses the first few hours to simply establish characters before embarking on a plot, of sorts, and some of those early scenes (especially sequences depicting actors strongly abstracted 'exercises') seem interminably long. However, these scenes are important not only as an exploration of improvisation methods that play both literal and metaphorical roles in the film, but as a method of adapting the viewer to a somewhat moderate pace of film. Long-term acquisition of long films is much more tolerant for viewers, and this understanding of stimulation has led Rivette, along with more modern directors like Michael Haneke and Béla Tarr, to create films with shorter commercial times that still retain their capacity. Let the audience be fascinated. <br /> <br /> In a film that is in many ways about acting, acting is fantastic. There are many famous faces of Nouvelle Vague, including the above-mentioned Léaud and Berto, excellent Michel Lonsdale and Rivette regularly Bulle Ogier. Even another legendary director in Eric Rohmer has a great professor as Professor Balzac, who appears in the key scene. Paris' People and Architecture c. 1971, however, appears to have as important a role as the urban landscape, crowd scenes and those interested in the theater scene freeze from time to time, a documentary about the place in history. After a little over 720 minutes, the film ends with an incredibly short, mysterious note; however, the exhausting journey that the viewer has taken is so full of possibilities, complexity and spontaneity that it would be forgiven for wanting to start again from the beginning, or seeing another twelve hours in the life of these characters. For those who have watched many kinds of cinemas and think they have seen everything that the art form offers, Out 1 is a reminder that cinema has the potential to be a lot more and diverge in much more than the current conventions allow. For filmmakers, film critics and artists of all disciplines, this is something to be appreciated.
