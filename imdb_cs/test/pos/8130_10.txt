The biggest tragedy surrounding this thorough film is the lack of distribution in the US. I was fortunate enough to see this film at the Boston Women's Cinema International Festival and I highly recommend it to anyone who sees it. Amazing performance and sophisticated screenplay and great direction from talented and funny Rose Troche team up to win this movie!
