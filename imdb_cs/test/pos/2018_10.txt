After reading the previews for this movie, I thought it would be a pause, but after I got my region 1 DVD (DVD was available before the movie hit the UK cinemas), I was pleasantly surprised by the strong performances of all members of the series make it a very enjoyable movie. The fact that the script is pretty weak means that you will not fit into the story and therefore the review factor is greater. I recommend this movie to one and all <br /> <br />
