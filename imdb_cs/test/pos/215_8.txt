The short show, which continued in three film spin-offs (Naked Guns 1, 2 & 3), is a fast pace on the face, a fast comedy fire that has more hits than is missing. Leslie Nielsen plays Lieutenant Detective Sergeant Frank Drebin, an incompetent detective who weaves and weaves his way through cases, with his boss's capable assistant, Captain Ed Hocken. Rows of stories are false, at best at best, but it is deliberate, because good here is not about telling stories, but weaving the jealousy of envy together with some really strange and wonderful characters. The jokes themselves come in many forms, be it a word, slapstick, pun or gag background, most of them hit the spot, even if some fall on a small apartment. It's inevitable with this 'gag every few seconds' approach that some fail, but the ratio is good. <br /> <br /> Characters are a pleasure. From the guest star of the week dying in the opening seconds of each episode, a laboratory scientist who apparently carries out harsh and unusual experiments on children on a shoe that is some form of seer, writing is funny and sharp as a Cutlass. Although it was not particularly successful at that time, a cult follow-up rapidly developed, many blaming the relative lack of success from programs that outperformed its time and too sophisticated for the target audience. none other than Matt 'The Simpsons' Groening: and he should know. Dated today's standards, if you can see through this aspect, you're in for treatment.
