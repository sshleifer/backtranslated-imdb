In 2000 (bear in mind, that's two years ago, not four), two men were motivated to create the most serious work of art on this side of Mississippi. Thanks to Jere Cunningham and Tom Flynn, the world can now look forward to Second String, a superb television film depicting the story of ragged gangs of second strings (that is, the title) thrown into the starters' position due to the order of bad oysters. Due to the motivational direction of director Robert Lieberman and the last moment of QB Buffalo Bills, Dan "Give 'emu to Heller (portrayed by Canadian actor, Gil Bellows), the Super Bowl snake-billed accounts find themselves in the final position. Thanks to an interesting mix of internal and external conflicts, a love story, a friendship that can only bring a gentle sport of football, and the overall theory that a loser can compete, the other chain is an excellent film worthy of viewing all the possible moments that appears on TNT. The only thing that could be potentially bad in this production is the spelling of the name of the first designer, Jenifur Jarvis. <br /> <br />
