My wife and kids are a good and entertaining series that really shows the worries and problems that happen most in the best families. Michael Kyle (dad) is a man who always tries to stop girls from girls like party, drinking, loving or making love. When they do something wrong, he's there to fix them (by the way he loves bad punishments) Janet 'Jay' Kyle (mother) has a strong personality and rarely agrees with her husband. He understands that their children are teenagers and likes to do "bad" things, unlike Michael's, Michael Kyle 'Jr' is a fool who believes in everything other people say. He's a great guy at the beginning of the series, and he's trying to be like his father, but lately, I don't know why, he's a very stupid guy, and he's becoming a problematic guy. At the end of the series, he falls in love with Vanessa and becomes a father, or I should say that a silent father who doesn't do anything is not right. She has a lot of problems with her parents because she gets too much into her privacy. He has a friend named Tony, who is Catholic and afraid of everything, so we can't understand what he's doing. I remember one episode that they are ready to have sex, but Michael Kyle scares Tony that sex is very dangerous and deadly, so he decides to protect himself until he marries. I'm continuing to do the Best of My Life series and I'm still looking at it every day for 3 years, so I recommend to all of you - mostly for teenagers.
