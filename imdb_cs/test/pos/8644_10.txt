Hitchcock would be proud of this film. Though nothing happens, it's tense. Director David Lynch takes a few cheap tricks back and forth, but he distracts them with other cinematographic techniques to make it dull. This movie is totally unreal, as if it woke up and remembered most of the dream, but not enough to make it reasonable. I'm still trying to figure it out, and I'll probably see it again to capture the things I missed and which can better understand me. It is a very detailed graph that is very slow to meet, so you need to be patient and attentive. Get your bathroom out of the way before it starts. And yet, the plot is overshadowed by the theme, mood, character development, and shooting techniques. The double role of lead actress Naomi Watts shows off her huge talent. That's when I could take my eyes off my star. What is an acting couple. Lynch's surprise throughout the movie with unusual camera angles, editing length / timing, jumping back and forth between scenes. Combined with the clever use of music and sounds, all this helps to build tension in our minds, undoubtedly the director's main goal. Well, he kept me on the edge of my seat, he even let me talk to the actors to be careful there, and don't be so naive there. You know, the things you want to crush your kids for doing in movies.
