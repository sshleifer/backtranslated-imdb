Many accounts, Stu Ungar was not a very nice guy. He spit on the merchants, froze the people he owed money, and was verbally offensive. Many filmmakers could choose to want to give a man a confectioner, which would make him a sports hero who would win despite his fate. But High Roller doesn't do that. And that's a hard line to catch him. Instead, we have to watch very carefully how a man who never died has gone through a frightened little boy from the streets of New York, despite all his successes. The only real consent he has ever received is from death himself. Very brave (because people don't get it) and very moving (when you do it). <br /> <br /> What's so brave is using Scorsese. "Oh! How derivative," people say. Really? But there is virtually no violence. And Stuey loved gangster movies. Maybe the feeling reflects Stu's man, not Marty's director? And if it's a really low budget movie and it looks good, bravo! Finally, linear flashback structures. Wow, it will beat. And not only does it work, it works exceptionally well for those who don't see a connection with the Seventh Seal. (PROOF: In SS, Knight plays chess with death: In HR, Stuey says, "We can play cards for cards, ya know" ... Death says "Never too good in cards ...".) <br /> < br /> No complex effects or camera movements. No shaking camera. Nothing fashionable at all. Just a tight, tight narrative. Maybe the movie is too basic and somehow wrong. But then again, just like the guy. And that makes it right. 9/10
