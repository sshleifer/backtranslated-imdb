The idea of ​​provoking, humble depiction of the human tragedy of war. A small but altruistic view of the interaction of one family with the enemy during the Kentucky Civil War. This film reduces the "magic" of war; shows that it affects not only the soldier but the whole family unit. Many of today's movies show war as an opportunity to emphasize the "hero" and other glamorous features of war, but very few attempts to show the true effect of war actually take the community. This film attempts to do so by reformulating human memories of those days. This film is referred to as a free translation of real events, when in reality this film is probably a civil war in the real reality of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of "real events." I highly recommend those interested in our civil war to watch this film.
