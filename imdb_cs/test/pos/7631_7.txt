I've read a few reviews of this movie, recently released on Eclectic DVD. The opening titles seem to be letterboxed, but the rest (most) is full screen. The first edition, in 1982 Planet Video, is completely letterboxed. Although it was a primitive release, it was right. Later releases had sharper and better picture quality, but they were all screen like DVD's. Any release of this movie should be a letterbox because it makes a significant contribution to the visual experience of the old planetary tape.
