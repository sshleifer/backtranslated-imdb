I love this movie. and the Disney Channel is ridiculous for not playing anymore. I think they should put Susie Q back in the air at least once in the night so we can record it !!! but if not, does anyone know where to find him? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please email me if you know where i can find this movie. Online or anywhere. I told my kids about this movie and I think they deserve it too. All these Disney movies that come now are fake and boring. I need Susie Q back !! It was a great movie and had great actors and I don't know why it was taken from the air. If everyone loves this movie so much why it was out of the air. Please take into account my comments and all other comments on this movie. Thanks, have a nice day.
