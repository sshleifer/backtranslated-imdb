This film appeared on Channel 13 in the 1990s when they made a series of comedies from Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s. In fact, to the tune of "Jolly Fat Policeman", they had montage scenes from the movies to introduce a series of people laughing, including one of Gary Cooper's chortling while watching a movie in a movie house - a sequence of this all starts innocently enough when Cooper, a millionaire goes to a luxury department store in France to buy pajamas. But he likes to sleep only on tops. An official (Tyler Brooke) insists he can't sell half of his pajamas as Cooper wants. Claudette Colbert hears the argument and offers help - she likes to sleep in her pajama bottom. What if Brooke sells them every half? Brooke has never had such an offer, so a walker walks (Rolfe Sedan) and asks if it's possible. It is also disturbed - the request is quite unconventional. Eventually they contact the store owner (Charles Halton). Halton is in bed and gets out - his thin frame supporting only the pajama roof (if it is long enough for censorship). Can they sell two customers one set of pajamas (half for each)? Halton says, "No, of course not! That's communism!" So the sale is not allowed. No one seems to think Cooper could buy a total pair and sell half to Colbert. Lubitsch's BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE had a reputation as a falling flat, most viewers disliked because of a poor understanding of Colbert's character. She is seen as quite a mercenary to Cooper - selling herself to him on her terms. Actually, Cooper's character is nastier, as he's rich and numbers all have value. Most of the time is correct. See how Colbert's aristocratic pauper father Edward Everett Horton sees his new son-in-law as a golden goose he can use. Cooper's willingness to marry Colbert in some way involves an agreement that if he hesitates or decides not to marry her, he must pay damages. Horton, when he realizes it, pulls out his watch and (in a totally soothing voice) tells Cooper - "Take the time of my boy!" To take the decision. Later we see that Horton's wardrobe is more modern and delicate. The film, screenplay by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, compares well with their script for MIDNIGHT by Mitchell Leisin (also with Colbert, but with Don Amech and John Barrymore). Colbert is willing to sell for marriage to money (Francis Lederer), but it complicates the fictional marriage to Amech. He really loves Ameche (a taxi driver), but at an unexpectedly realistic moment he explains to him that her parents married "love", but poverty made them grow to hate. This is not in BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE, where Colbert does not have such a background (after all, she is the daughter of the marquis). Her mercenary drawing is to teach Cooper a lesson on his standards. The film has a nice job of support staff, including Herman Bing as a private eye that turns out to be hiding things that Colbert learns about. , and a young David Niven who has a set of choices as a rack in a punching bag and as a willing ear to Cooper. Coop tells Niven about his problems with Colbert and how angry he is. Niven listens respectfully. Finally, Cooper is touched by his willingness to hear what he has to say. "Albert, how much will I pay you?" Cooper asks. Niven thinks and says, "Thirty-five francs a week, sir." Cooper looks deep into his soul and says (shaking his head) "That's fair!"
