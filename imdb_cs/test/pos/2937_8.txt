Yes, I'm watching this show. Of course, my girlfriend is watching. At least I tell my friends. But as nobody knows me, I can say it; I love it! That's great television. <br /> <br /> There's a panel first; Tyra herself, who can't escape even the only way to talk about herself, but she's gonna be taken seriously because she's pretty businesswoman. Then there is Jay Manuel, a sober homosexual, very serious and amazingly professional, and Miss Jay, an extrovert, "queen" stage and a damn funny guy, and Nigel, self-styled as the only man on the panel. Secondly, the show is an in-depth look at the shallow industry, and we need to give it to manufacturers to show us an inner perspective that can be informative and entertaining. Finally, the release is great; there is only the right mixture of everything; Girls living together in the ego-house, their set impressions, the competition itself and judging. All of these images smoothly move to the right rhythm. There are no lengths. Of course, there must be other factors that have led to exclusion we don't see at shows; The panel is composed of capricious divas, extroverted and fast to bite; woe to those who insult them! But what has been said until one contestant is stepping on his fingers, their decision is usually fair - I think. So give your brain a break; If you can't beat them, join them and watch this reality TV with your loved ones. It will be an eagerness for another, somehow.
