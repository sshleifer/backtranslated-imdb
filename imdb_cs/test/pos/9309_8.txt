It's rare that the film includes both a problem-solving process and a fantastically far-reaching moral buzz, and it's a pretty accurate historical movie, but Fat Man and Little Boy will download this trick. The Story of the Manhattan Project - The Second World War's effort to build an atomic bomb, he said as a conflict between the two men who did it, the gene. Leslie Groves and Robert Oppenheimer. Historical Personalities are a Great Study of Contradictions: Military vs. civil, practical vs. idealistic, emotional vs. scientific, brute force vs. consensus-based problem solving; long-term vision. The fictional character, played by John Cusack, is added as a sort of synthesis of two historical characters, showing humanity that oddly escapes real people (and of course the compulsory interest of love, played by Laura Dern). One who is looking for a direct document could criticize the gaps in melodrama (and the occasional release with facts, but it's Hollywood for ya), but the purpose of fiction is to synthesize and incite events into more universal truths, so I think it can be forgiven. One of the biggest visuals in the film is that Oppenheimer witnesses the first atomic explosion: it's all his reaction, and given the amazing visual elements of the atomic explosion, it's a brave and totally effective way in a single moment to describe an ambivalent effect on a person who lacks such power (something that in a typical Hollywood shooter is lost in the history version.) The use of music is particularly outstanding in the last third of the film. <br /> <br /> Fairly accessible and highly recommended as a historical film and drama of the highest order.
