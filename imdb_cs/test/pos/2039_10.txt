This is one of the best action movies I've seen. Geena's portrayals are hard as nails, 'Charly' / the subtle mother 'Sam', and Samuel L Jackson keeps you just laughing all the way, with his classic inserts. Sure, there were a few holes in the real story, but this quick swing will keep you on the edge of your seat to the end. I felt that Geena was the perfect choice for Sam's role. Charly and her versatility as an actress is evident for her role as a mother in the recent movie 'Stuart Little'. Both Samuel and Geena were well supported by David Morse, Brian Cox, sweet little Yvonne Winter and newcomers, sexy Craig Bierek and Melina Kanakaredes. This film emphasizes the growing trend of a strong female character and a move away from traditional male and female stereotypes when we see Sam / Charly (Davis) and Mitch (Jackson) moving from one disaster to the next. While I and many others loved this film, it is fair to say that there will always be people who do not have, and that is fine - everyone, to their own. I highly recommend this movie to action fans, for its merry scenes and quick action.
