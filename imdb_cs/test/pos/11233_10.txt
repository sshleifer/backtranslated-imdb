The Polish brothers are unique film artists and the cover has really been moved here. A fantasy that has points in common with "Wings of Desire", "Northfork" tells the story of a small 50s town in the middle of nowhere that is two days shy of being flooded and immersed by the US government's desire to make a reservoir in the city . It is a wise parable of losses and memories, representing angels, dreams, premonitions, and most successful government reclamation officials from "Repo Man." The performances are excellent, especially Nolte and Woods. When I read some of the notes, I noticed that there were people who were offended simply by the Polish twins using elliptical storytelling tactics, and I want to say that this is one of the things that makes this film so great: its willingness to accept the mysterious as an aspect of everyday life. David Mullen's camera is amazing. Highly recommended; If you have suffered a significant personal loss, such as the death of your parent, I would even need this film to see it. - Ray
