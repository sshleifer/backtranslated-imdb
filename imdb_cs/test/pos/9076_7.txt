This is definitely a good movie as opposed to what other people say. Peline and I both saw the movie three times and the end is cheesy, but that's part of the package ... experimenting with death is the same as trying to resist it so the movie is fine. For those who want to see the classic movie Kevin Bacon, please see this. take care of the greeting from Istanbul. we write 10 lines if you really want us 2, but we think it's a waste of time bye. The rest of this review should not be taken seriously because we wrote it down to fill the 10-line requirement (which is crazy), but we are kind people, and therefore we will adapt to the rules that are set for us. So people watch this movie not because we wrote 10 lines, but because it's good. and by the way we wrote 12 lines !!
