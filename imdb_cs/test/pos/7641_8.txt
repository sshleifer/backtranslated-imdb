I captured this film on the Horror Channel and was impressed by the Gothic atmosphere and the tone of the film. As a big fan of everything that is related to vampires, I am always glad to see a new variant of vampire mythos, in this case a ghoul-like creature living in another Lovecraft dimension. The director did a great job of showing a dark mood on the theme, using a decadent art scene as the background to what is basically a story of love that spans time and space - a pure love of friendship that runs counter to the desire for blood and life . vampires in the story. The characters in the story are transferred to another dimension by means of a mind-changing medium, where it appears that the changing vampire creature gives them their desires and at the same time deprives them of their essence. There are some analogies to drug addiction and loss of control, and how this affects a group of friends in the art circle. I liked watching the 2 main male characters in the story, Chris Ivan Cevic and Alex Petrovich, who were very attractive hunks, always a point vampire story for female viewers! The special effects make up and the effects of creation have been well done, and the vampire dimension design has been very effective. All in all, a pleasant admission to vampire myths, and recommends for anyone who likes their vampires with some intelligence and not just action. All he misses to make it even better would be a little more erotic and nudity, as it would be for the storyline and the topics.
