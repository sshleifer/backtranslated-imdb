I was fortunate enough to capture this film at the Phoenix Film Festival and I must say that I enjoyed it very much. When I asked the director if he attended the Film School, I was very impressed not. Such films do not come from people without talent. To start in advertising and then produce a heart felt family comedy like this shows the actual range. I'm sure I'll keep an eye on what she's doing next. As a good indie movie, the film should be very built. It corresponds to your average Hollywood movie, which is mostly conspired. The film focuses on the Jewish family in New York, Applebaum's, who were all invited back for their "suicide" party. The film is full of witty, quick, breaking dialogue. The fact that a small Jewish family is obsessed with being Jewish and anyone who is a Jewish cause is the unreal situation of a "suicide" party in fact. Director Jeff Hare does a great job of pulling out characters from the actors and putting them on the screen. The manufacturing design brings the sets to life with a lot of attention to detail, making the setting feel at home for 40 years. The cut keeps the dialogue in such a way that it allows you to sit in the seat and wonder who will stab, who will be with another funny phrase or punch. And, when appropriate, the film slows down so that the audience plunges deeper into the meanings and motivations hidden within these loving characters. If you're a Woody Allen fan or movies like "As Good As It Gets", check out this movie.
