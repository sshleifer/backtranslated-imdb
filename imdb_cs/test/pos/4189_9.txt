I can't believe it's not a huge cult hit. Perhaps the people of 1968 who thought of the Monkees as stupid factory-produced Beatles pop bands refused to see it. That cynicism has apparently covered it since. Don't make that mistake. _Head_ is an amazing movie that will be appreciated by most open people. It's very funny and very intelligent (and very trippy).
