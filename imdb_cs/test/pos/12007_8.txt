Funny movie! The script is terrible, but the quality of the actors saves the day. John Hurt is perfect, just like Jane Alexander. Beau Bridges is fair and the actress who plays her wife is very weak. The story is a true star. Based on the real story, the pace moves well and the whole concept of escaping from East Germany sucks and holds you. The joyful ending provides enough emotion to compensate for the script. Don't expect the Academy Academy but it's a great ride for the whole family.
