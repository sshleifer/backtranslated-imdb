Wayne Wang's direction can be a component that has made me more impressive than "Slums of Beverly Hills", which has a remarkably similar ground. The interplay between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman is riveting. Real chemistry. This film managed to bring me into the dysfunctional life of these two women without dragging me into depressing frustration. The character Susan Sarandon hits all the nerves that a narcissistic parent is capable of touching an uncertain teenager. She can do it amazingly without encountering such insanely or deliberately sadistic. And Natalie Portman reflects every attack on the ego of her character with the resigned grace of an intelligent co-dependent child who does not capture Natasha Lyonne's smug cynicism in "Slums Beverly Hills". Portman's character is a teenager with dignity in stress, an unusual creature in modern movies. The film achieves a very satisfactory resolution without much effort. I highly recommend this movie to a viewer who wants to be challenged and amused.
