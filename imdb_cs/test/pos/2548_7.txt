I can't say it wasn't good. At a recent film festival, the director admitted that some scenes took 30 shots. And there is not even the slightest hint that he would not get exactly what he wanted. But this is a strange non-Hispanic movie in the same way as West Side Story many years ago. Both the leader, brother-sister team, are excellent and memorable in their parts. The setting, a kind of underground car repair center in Queens, is for most people totally alien and worth the cost of acceptance itself. But there is something unsatisfactory about the key issue in the film, and what the nurse feels must do. I understand my brother's reaction, but it seems to me that it's too easy. The movie seems to suggest that people like these don't need our help to find a way to survive without the usual support systems. I wouldn't let anyone believe it. There would be much greater resistance to the options here than shown. Other than it works well. As an accurate depiction of culture, I think not so well.
