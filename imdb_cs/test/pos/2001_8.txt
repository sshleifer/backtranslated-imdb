Here is one of the more enjoyable scuzzy 70's blaxploitation grindhouse items; it is the ubiquitous pimp opus that comes as a sleazier version of "The Mack". John Daniels, proudly feminine hairdresser hero Mr. Jonathan in the immortal "Black Shampoo", gives a brilliant Baron steel image, a ruthless, commercial wit, forever making a versatile mass salesman who has horrified his bitter, brutal Italian rivals over Sunset Sunset. When not locking the corners with his fellow no-count criminal buddies or doing his best to avoid arresting local vice cops, Daniels leads a sweetly average existence like your standard garden-suburbanite variety dude (complete with caring wife and loving kids!) In some typically humdrum California town. The blazing absurd assumption itself promises a top-class kitsch-size variety of the B-class Schlock (George Theakos deserves credit for his cheerfully ridiculous scenario). Matt Cimber is commendable tactless and tasteless direction delivers slimy bucketful junkies, making this film an extremely enjoyable portion of celluloid dirt. Among the most diverse pleasures you can enjoy, there is a rich gratuitous female nudity, coarse dialogue, beautifully blatant Me Decade threads (halter tops, felt hats, sparkling Day-Glo jewelry, loud seersucker suits), intense funky R&B Smoke scores, some hopelessly miserable behavior (a little old lady who lives next to Daniel is unbearably penetrating), a remarkably ugly turn from Patrick Wright as a sadistic goon, a couple of great action sets (top slow-motion massacre in the bar seriously cooks), more lurid travel footage of the Sunset Strip before you can shake your feather boa (say shots allegedly include "real hookers and blades of the sunset strip in hollywood"), effectively dark'n'dingy cinematography Ken Gibb, a pair of sicko sex fetish tableaux, some raw explicit violence (a prostitute has one of her breasts cut off!), and a fun supportive gig The well-known schlock features perennials Richard Kennedy and George "Buck" Flower as a pair of racist, corrupt, browbeating police detectives. Sure, this film is not an art, but it is certainly helpless to qualify as a deliciously eccentric piece of fun-filled movie swing.
