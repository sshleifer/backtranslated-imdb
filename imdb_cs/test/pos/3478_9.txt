When I was 10 (currently 14), I promised never to see a movie I knew wouldn't have a happy ending. And only a few weeks ago, I did quite well, except for Shakespere for the English class ... and so on. I was just watching things that ended happily. But then I saw Ramol Garai in Havanah Nights, which was cute, not very good, but amusing enough to watch. After seeing it several times in two or more years since I first saw it, I like it, especially music. So I was looking for her and found an IMDb ... I saw "Inside I Dance" and assumed he made another dance movie, and overlooked it. It was later on the image search (Rory, looking for Gilmore Girls poster for the locker) I picked up a picture of this movie ... Then I was looking for a trailer, I found a trailer and when I saw the hospital and heard Rory say "You have a future" your promise and I realized that it wouldn't be a good movie for me. But it stayed in the back of my mind until we were in the video store and there it was for $ 5 so I went forward. After I saw it, I wanted it to be from my head because it was so sad. I still wouldn't get to her until I had cerebral palsy as a word. Then I had to see it again, and this time I laughed, even in the saddest parts that I no longer felt depressed because I realized that the whole movie was happy and uplifting ... I love it and now it's one My favorites, I'm sure it's the worst comment you've ever read. But watch a movie that's worth it.
