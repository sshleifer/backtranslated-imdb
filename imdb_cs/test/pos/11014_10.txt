One of the best movies I've ever seen - the classic movie "Matrix". For many years I have tried to get on VHS or DVD - without success. The German film and television industry still prefers to make valuable cultural contributions (and that's Fassbinder!) To rot and collect dust in an archive instead of distributing it commercially (and earning a lot of money with it if that's what stimulates) instead of creative thinking). Although WDR once told me whether I paid DM 200.00 to check the copyright (non-refundable) and then 8 DM per minute copy plus the cost of material, then consider preparing (single!) A copy for me. Some way to sell something! We have the same problem with many other TV films or series like "So we die die Füße tragen", "Sonntagseltern", "Kellerkinder" and others. Great TV series - never hear of it. Germany, wake up! UPDATE since March 2007: Last year I could finally get a DVD copy of "Mittschnittservice" WDR for about 50+ Euro. Great!
