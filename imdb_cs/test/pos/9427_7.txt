Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) engage in the battle of wits to control the latest bomb creation from the perspective of the inventor of Switze. Holmes wants to protect him for the British, while Moriarty is not for sale to the Nazis. Although many fans will undoubtedly be disappointed to see that Holmes has been updated in the 1940s warfare, this film proves the ease of entertainment that does not revolve in war propaganda as it might be. . Dennis Hoey Lestrade and Dr. Watson Nigel Bruce tends to steal the show because their characters, who are in the metaphors, constantly add breathtaking comic relief. Sparring between Holmes and Morirata is varied and well thought out. Atwill does well as Moriarty, though not as memorable as some of the others who played the role. Although it doesn't mean anything particularly new or exciting to the show's fans, it's an amazing escape from reality, somewhat suitable for 1942 in my opinion, reflecting many movie series adventures of the 1930s and 1940s, but it boasts a more compact, less repetitive chart. And all of this is happening while remaining true to Sherlock Holmes's fundamental spirit.
