One of the better TV bios I wanted was to tell us more. I read many biographies and saw other things about carpenters, and this film did what it could, based on the limitations that the family put on it. Cynthis Gibb did a great job of trying to revive Karen. One of my disappointments is that there was no more insight about Karen's anorexia. In reading I did about this disease (especially Cherry Boone O'Neill's wonderful book, Starving for Attention) anorexia seems to be a disease control. Karen saw her weight as one thing in her life she could control. She felt controlled in every other aspect of her life. Don't get me wrong, I believed she really loved the music, but she felt she had little control over her career. She really loved her family, but she did not express her well and did not know how her family understood her. The film could touch a lot more about it. I appreciate the music I have from the Carpenters, and I wish it was still alive to contribute more to music today.
