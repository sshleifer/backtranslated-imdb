I recently rented this movie as part of the nostalgic phase I'm going through. I was born in 1980, and so from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s the film has a very important place in my teens. This particular movie was one of my favorites, so I was excited when it was available in the UK. It's not getting worse with time, it's still a great fun movie with great enthusiasm. Sure, it fades in the shade of larger, bigger budget movies, but don't let it stop you to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It is worth renting or even buying at discount prices you will find for.
