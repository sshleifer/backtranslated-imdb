After seeing NAKED CITY and NIGHT AND CITY (which is still my favorite Dassin), I was more than excited to watch his "O-Word Criterion" RIFIFI. Now I'm a little bit disappointed with the story. So I have at least five questions in my mind: <br /> <br /> 1. In the Countdown Louis Grutter final shot the main character Tony le St√©phanois from inside the house. He couldn't know if he was still alive or not, but he didn't care about it and ran right behind him outside the house (with money) to reach his car. Of course, Tony wasn't dead and shot him. BIG QUESTIONMARK. 2. In another important scene, the safes specialist Cesar gave a diamond ring (which was part of the robbery) as a gift to the woman who worked for Louis Grutter at the nightclub. Stupid, because before this character was so stupid. And of course, Louis understood that Tony had planned the theft of jewels. SMALL QUESTIONNAIRE. 3. After Gangsters attacked Louis Grutter, Mario Ferrati and his wife, Tony and his best friend Joe, planned revenge against Louis's gang. At the same time, they don't care about the safety of Joe's wife and his five-year-old child. Of course, Louis Gang kidnapped his son. CHEAP AND SIMPLE. 4. Perfect Robbery: Of course it's the best 30min. a long scene across the fence, without any words spoken all the time, but was it a perfect robbery? Comparing with other movies that can handle this subject I could only smile when, for example, Tony was taken by a fire engine to disable the alarm. Also too simple. 5. Gutter gang went to Mario's house because they knew (but ....) that the jewels will be there. Then Maria and his wife murder. And then? Don't look for it! NO. They ran straight out of the apartment. And more. They can't watch the apartment after him, so Tony can go after a while (which was the same day) to make jewelry. BIG QUESTIONMARK. Especially: it's a good movie. Because of the brilliant 30min silent robbery scene. Because of a very good cut (the end of the car scene across Paris is overwhelming). Because of a very good actor named Jean Servais. Because of this black / white fever, you get to watch. For some other reasons, too much a user has written about, but please don't tell me this is a stunning story.
