I'm not sure how I can make ten lines out of this question, but I'll try. When Julie went to dance and danced to slow music. What was the name of the song that played and who played it? <br /> <br /> I love the song! And I watch the movie over and over, just to hear that one song. I've searched several times online and even looked at the soundtrack, but I can't find a song. It may be because the song they danced was not a complete song and only a partial song. <br /> <br /> I'd appreciate it if someone knows what the song's name is and the band that sang <br /> <br /> Thank you. <br /> <br /> Frank
