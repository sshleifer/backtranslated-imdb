There is a lot of film now on DVD, but producers have forgotten some of the titles of importance for many viewers. Egyptians, along with El Cid and other favorites of the widescreen era, deserve credit. Many people from my generation will learn a lot about the history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas (for the first time I heard from them a very cheap adventure film with Charlton Heston called the Inca Treasure), the same happened to Egypt, or Rome saw many "Epic era. many production values, great use of color (De Luxe color was more Brigit and sharp that ordinary Technicolor), maybe it was wrong, but in any case the film got into the idea to give us an idea of ​​life in ancient Egyptin and was so To make the engine go out and buy a novel, My Mika Waltari, one of the best if not the best historical novel ever published. Also ousting aing was an excellent score by Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann. I saw this movie many times when I was a kid, it wasn't a big box hit that Fox Studios wanted afther a huge hit, in CinemaScope and Stereo there was a wonderful eye popping sp4ectacle.
