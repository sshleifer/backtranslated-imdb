I think this film must be one of the most moving and brilliant films of recent times. Basically, the film begins with suicide in the schoolroom. You won't see who it is, then goes to the beginning of the day from there, and we know 6 characters and go through some heavy things, eventually one of them commits suicide. I have been teaching physical education in schools for 8 years, and I've never seen such an accurate picture of what works in school life. The movie is shot beautifully, and it sounds incredible. The end is so shocking, so what one wouldn't expect is something that will haunt me for days. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one you can watch. I think the fact that the director / writer was at school only a few years ago is a major factor contributing to the raw honesty expressed in the film. <br /> <br /> The movie will be taken in two separate modes. First, it is a smooth observation style where we recognize characters in their school environment as they go through their drama, but the overwhelming portion of the film is in interviews where we recognize characters back and their stories. deepest, darkest thoughts. You are still wondering who it is (who commits suicide) and as the drama unfolds, you are constantly changing your mind until it happens, the last five minutes. I'm everywhere in my writing, but I just saw it in a media screening in Australia and I'm still in a bit of a shock. It's one of the best Australian movies I've seen in recent years.
