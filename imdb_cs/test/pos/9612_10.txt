This movie is the best kung fu movie of all time. Although there is no wire-work and special effects such as those used in Crouching Tiger, this film uses ingenuity and creative camera-work to create unforgettable combat moments, and combat scenes are well choreographed and tight. There's a lot of action in this movie with lots of great scenes, but the story is also very good, with lots of twists and turns. The characters are well rounded and have a real depth for them because the motivations for their actions and personality are revealed in much greater detail than most kung fu movies. There is really great work with the camera in the film, with my favorite close-up image on the face of our hero, showing his reaction, then coming back quickly to reveal the scene before him, which is the cause of his view. Originally I bought the movie and I was hoping to see some great scenes, but on several points I learned how amazing the acting stories and stories are. Great movie in general.
