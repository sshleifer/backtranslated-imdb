If it is true that sadomasochism is a two-sided coin that contains the whole in a diverse expression of its contradictions, then the film portrait of Erika Kohut has its reality. Professor Kohut treats his piano students with some fascist sadism and longs for himself. Her outer expression projects her desire. That's why he can hurt without guilt or remorse. Along with the talented, charming, handsome young Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel), who is attracted to her because of his passion and intensity. She wants to become her student to be close to her. He rejects it from his hand, but because of his talent, the Vienna Conservatory votes him. She falls in love with her. He pulls him back, but doesn't answer, so he begins his own descent into corruption and loss of self-esteem. The question a viewer could ask at this point is: who's in control? Sadist or masochist? Who really is a sadist and who is a masochist? It's hard to say. It is a person who has been very psychologically and physically abused, who is actually lying on the floor in a grotesque triumphant and filled wound, or is a person who comes out of the door, saturated and instructing no one to know what happened. But Erik's not just a sadomasochistic freak. It's sex extreme lunatic. He wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while preserving the decency facade. Actually, that's not true. He says he doesn't care what others think. She doesn't care if they come in and find her bleeding on the floor because she's in love. Love, she calls it. They are one and the same for her sex and love. At one point Walter tells her that love is not everything. How ironic is such an exaggeration for her. How unreasonable commentary. The film is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by Michael Haneke, who spins a story with a professional camera of work and carefully built sets in which the essence of the action is not only clear but exemplary (as in the bathroom when Walter moves high above the top of the booth to find Eric inside). He also employs the subtle placement of players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another. This is particularly important in the scene in which Erika lies, as well as the dead dead blood that was captured in sharp white and black light, beneath her lover, like a stone. For the most part, we can only see her face and the sharp outline of her neck with a pulsing artery. We no longer need to see. Part of Erika Kohut is ideal for Isabelle Huppert, who is not afraid of extremes; they really stand out in them. I have seen her in many films and what she does better than almost everyone becomes a body and soul figure. Like the woman she plays in this film, she is not afraid of what others can think of and look after in a decorative sense. What matters is performance and challenge. No part is too demanding. No character is too bad. It is as if Huppert wanted to experience all mankind, and he wants us to look at her as much as she does. It is always fascinating and almost flawless. It is not a mere light of French cinema; is one of the greatest actresses of our time who has put together an incredibly diverse work. I think it's very instructive and gives us a wonderful and remarkable contrast to comparing her performance with her performance in Lacemaker (La Dentellière) since 1977 when she was 22 years old. There were sweet apples in red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute character playing Pomme, a hairdresser in Paris. Her character was shy about sex and modest - just an ordinary French girl who hoped one day would be a beautician. Here is a self-destructive witch, bitter with hateful self-consciousness, shameless and utterly corrupt. Huppert is lucky to be an actress in France where there are parts for women after old age. starfish. (Hollywood could never do such a movie.) In American cinema, only a few of the best and most difficult actresses can work after thirty years. Huppert significantly increases her exposure due to her ability and reach, but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles, here and also at La Cérémonie (1995), in which she plays a nasty, malicious murder. You see it for Isabelle Huppert. You will not forget her or the character she will bring to life.
