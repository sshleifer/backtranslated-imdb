Such a dark night is a tough challenge: It is very difficult to write about it in any detail without destroying those who haven't seen it before. Because it remains quite obscure, it includes almost everyone. The film strikes those who know the better known titles of director Josef H. Lewis in the noir cycle? Gun Crazy, The Big Combo, Even My Name Is Julia Ross, Who Briefly Recalls? as an odd choice. For beginners, the French rural environment serves. Steven Geray, a middle-aged detective with Surété in Paris, embarks on a vacation to the village of Ste. Margot (or maybe Margaux). Quite unexpectedly, he found himself in love with his daughter inkeepers (Micheline Cheirel), even though she was engaged to a rude local farmer. But the siren song of life in Paris is hard to resist, and so he agrees to marry him, despite the age differences that inevitably become a talk about the city. But on the night of his engagement party he won't return to the inn. She will soon find her body by the river. Her jealous, angry lover is a logical suspect, but he's dead too. Anonymous notes then threaten the more deaths that come. For the first time in his career, the bereaved Geray found himself in a pause .... Especially a weak scenario, but the movie is in it; it plays like bad Cornell Woolrich crossed with Roger Ackroyd's murder. But Lewis is proud of that stupid vehicle. Takes time at the beginning but then the story ??? and narration? to gain momentum (unfortunately, only when the script breaks the remedy). Burnett Guffey lit and photographed a film with an interesting leitmotif peeking out of his eyes and peeping through the windows; there is also an effective score by Hugo Friedhofer, who has added a hearing threat to many noirs. Lots of talents have been invented on So Dark The Night, but will ultimately be reduced to no more than a trick? and it's not a very good trick. It's one pony movie trick. <br /> <br />
