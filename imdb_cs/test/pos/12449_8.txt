This is one of the most enjoyable teen movies I've ever seen (and that I wished was released on video). It was released the same year as another big comedy in which Tim Matheson played the role of "Animal House" (which is probably why it was disregarded). One of the most memorable parts of this movie would certainly be a soundtrack he could have had and should be a formal release of the label. The soundtrack features a lesser-known 70's act named High Inergy whose song "We Are Future", played a marquee role in the movie scene Prom. I remember buying a "Steppin 'Out" album as a boy mainly for girls and not necessarily for their musical talent. The final song is one of the best ballads I've ever heard, and I still hear it in my head. I wish I knew the group's name so I could look for it somewhere in cyberspace. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed movies like "Over the Edge" and "Rich Kids", I think that's the one you will have.
