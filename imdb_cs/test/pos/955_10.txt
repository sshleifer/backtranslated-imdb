I'm an enthusiastic fan of Vijay. I've never seen another movie of his that is as good as this. <br /> <br /> He has all the common clich√©s to expect from a commercial entertainer. A hero who is bad in studies, but a star in his power, ie Kabbadi. His friends fill in a comedy quota. A heroine in a situation of life and death. The thief I say is the best ever portrayed by the protagonist. High octane chase and action sequences. Music that can do one dance. And above all, that perfect story to keep all the above factors in a pleasant circle. Perfect. <br /> <br /> The director doesn't give viewers the chance to relax. It just goes from one nail to the next. And in this movie you can see the lighter side of Vijay, which he rarely performs. Everyone said ..... This movie was and will be perfect for many years to come.
