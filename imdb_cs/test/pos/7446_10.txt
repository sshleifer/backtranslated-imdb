The square really landed. They did not try to please everyone and instead focused exclusively on Final Fantasy 7 fans. And boy, they will be happy fans when they see this movie! The story doesn't have to be so interesting or credible, but it neatly ties to the story of the game and has some sincere funny moments! Full surprise and welcome too <br /> <br /> There are plenty of portraits and funny links to the game too. And most important of all: Fighting scenes rock so hard that they could go through a diamond! They are truly amazing, and they would make a film, even if everything else was saturated. I think they are one of the best PERIOD created so far. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. Hi. PS: I know my review sounds like a lot of teenage girls. It was the same as I intended.
