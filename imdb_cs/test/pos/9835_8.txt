As a fan of history, mythology and fantasy "Mystic Knights" the show pulled me out of get-go. She has semi-decent scripting, costumes are fantastic (there are exceptions), she has pretty good performance and heroes and villains play well from each other. SCRIPTS - Half the scenario is pretty big, the other half falls flat, but its all mixed together, meaning many episodes turn out so-so. Some key players also repeatedly receive dead lines (such as King Conchobar and Angus), must give them something ... more. I'm not sure what but writers should be able to come up with. ACTING - Except some actors from the villagers. Everyone, good and bad, works well together! COSTUMES / WEAPONS - Everyday clothes worn by everyone is spectacular! The Mystic Knight's armor, which is short, is Deirdre's and Garrett's. Chain bikinis would probably have better protection in their case ... and wouldn't look like plastic; it looks like a bunch of brown plastic pieces when it should look bronze. Ivar's trident seems to have been purchased at a discount store, and while the Garretts weapons look cool, they also look like plastic. Recently, "Mystic Knights" has adopted too many features of "Power Rangers" when you watch a show, you know what I mean. However, as the series progresses, it should find its niche and refine its style. Overall, it's an amazing show that all ages should look forward (most of my friends and I watch it and we're all 20+). The plot gets stronger and more distorted, although a little juvenile gets in place and everything is more interesting. It might be of some interest to fans of the movie "Willow" or T.V. series "Adventure of Sinbad". Lots of adventures, secrets of secrets, a bit of romance, sprinkling forces in nature ... Look at it! (My score: 7/10)
