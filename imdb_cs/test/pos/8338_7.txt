The sale of "Chic" Charles is absolutely amazing because the only member of the Leeds family willing to testify against a gangster whom they saw murdering a policeman and informant. He fought at Bull Run in the Civil War, and his patriotism runs high, even after his son-in-law is defeated and one of his grandson is kidnapped by the gang, intimidating all other members. The fear of the death of his grandson is not an excuse, he says. He would not want his grandson living in a country led by gangsters as well. The conflict between civil duty and personal security is sharply driven in this Oscar-nominated story. Walter Huston is also a standout as a tough district attorney driver threatening a perjury family if they don't back up their killer identification in court. The rest of the cast, including sleazy killer, Ralph Ince, are all excellent, and the movie is snappily directed by William A. Wellman. There is also a good tension as Sales disappears as well as the process is about to begin.
