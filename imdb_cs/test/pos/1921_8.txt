Even if you are not enjoying documentary films, you will enjoy the courses. Not only does it have a well-charted chart that is easy to follow, but also contains interesting detours; it also has a very strong emotional resonance and not one that relies on a simple specific tone. Instead, there are emotions as deep and stormy as the sea. As has been said, if you know nothing about Donald Crowhurst and the 1968 1968 World Cup ... case for me ... stop reading and renting / viewing this film. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS FOLLOW <br /> <br /> My friend Brian recommended it at the same time my aunt sent me a clipping that connects this film to Antonioni's work. Antonioni's movies, I'm still! To join this film with Antonioni, I think it's a bit of a stretch, the character most likely to be seen in one of Michaelangelo's movies is Francoise Moitessier de Cazalet. It's funny on the main page of IMDb, it's not even listed as playing "Alone", which is probably the function of its long name, as opposed to its self-realization / renunciation. Since Moitessier sails directly from the race, it could be considered something like Anna in L'Avventura. Relatively smaller side character. Although there are many things to love about this movie: real shots of the time, the stoic best friend, the sheer power of the Roaring Forties, I was leaving with a simple connection. Man, really at sea. There were times in my life where I wondered how I got to that point, caught between dreams and reality, I felt like a passenger in my own skin. I may have read too much in this documentary, and the directors have read too much into Crowhurst, but I found that feeling as a spell binding like the other secrets that are kept in this film. For a Special Chance, Crowhurst's wife (who seemed to be a remarkable limited-scale studio) and his children (so young in the shots and still young at this late date in terms of their pain and pride in their Father), I'm sure the comments here and the movie alone can't catch the man who was your father. In his death, however, he gave the world a look at something like a lost myth, he is a pre-GPS Odysseus. We will never find his body that contributes to the air of fragile immortality, if not the figure of the cosmic being he wrote. <br /> <br /> This movie is with you after the show as if you were expecting another twist. from deep waters. Or at least hope for the continuation of the Moitessier. Thurston Hunger 8/10
