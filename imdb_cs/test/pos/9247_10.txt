All the trials and tribulations of making a movie without a budget directly from the participants. You feel all the sweats, courage, determination and devotion Stuie has put into this work of love and frustration that he has remained hanging for all his work. Interview interviews with all involved provide a great flowing story and express balls, hardcore punk, an almost anarchist stance on "Waldo," and then a documentary. Stuie and the company deserve all the props in the world for not giving up when they get right and get the "Texas Tale of Treason", so we can see what it's like for a novice filmmaker on the street!
