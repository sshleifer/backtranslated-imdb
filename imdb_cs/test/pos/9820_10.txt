In this unlikely love triangle, which takes place in Italy in the 19th century, "Beauty and the Beast" turns upside down and upside down, and some: Giorgio, a military officer and the very image of male beauty, is transmitted away from his (married) lover Clara and sent to a small crew somewhere in Piedmont. There - initially much to his horror? Fosca, the grotesquely ugly cousin of his commander, develops obsessive love for him. Does he have a passionate and demanding expression of affection for regret and interest in his health (he is seriously ill), but is he becoming more and more fascinated by it? up to the dramatic final? Don't miss this unusual love story, as twisted as it sounds. Valeria d'Obici, who deservedly earned a prize for her portrayal of Fosca, is as disturbing as touching her.
