It must be so hard to tell a story where not much is happening, but still attract the attention of viewers. I think that this short film does it effortlessly. Rutger has an amazing voice that is very reassuring, wise and paternal, (I'm not gay), reminiscent of the features Robert Redford has in narration. The end is very sad but beautiful. I wonder how long Harry left, he'll be lonely and be able to say goodbye? He is also angry with Mr. Hauer for not taking part in this caliber work. Hopefully he will continue to do a good job in Holland and stay away from Hollywood. It is worth watching
