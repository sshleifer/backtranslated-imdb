From today's point of view, it is rather ridiculous to rate 18 (or X in the US). The film has a sexual but noble erotic story, but the pictures are rather innocent. Throughout the film you feel and see the spirit of the late 60s and early 70s in fashion, dialogue and typical experimental cinematography and lighting. And that's exactly the part that's worth seeing.
