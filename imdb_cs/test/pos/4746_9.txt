Roy Scheider is not Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood, but who is he? Seven-Ups is one of the better films, even today, and is second only to McQueen's Bullitt and Dirty Harry, which is not a bad company. There are three things that seem to make a good cop movie: A plausible scenario with great acting, great car chasing scenes, and some tough action. This movie has all three and scene car chase is better than in Dirty Harry. Scheider plays the head of a group of cops to get NY's bad guys for seven or more years; hence the name Seven-Ups. Overall, not quite up to Dirty Harry or Bullitt, but much better than all the cops from Dirty Harry series. 9/10.
