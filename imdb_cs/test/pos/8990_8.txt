Like most sports films, it is no wonder that people who know something about this sport can find it in shortcomings. As a football referee, I haven't seen a movie or a TV show to make it right when I displayed the match. "Forever" has good actors, but I found that Sean Astin is a little young to become a juvenile prison manager. I was very grateful that the conspiracy did not include a leading character who transformed her inmates into rugby players and took over Flagstaff and Highland. That gets credible: the police police car is just pulling back at the time when Flagstaff's flagships weigh Rick Penning. Although rugby is not a sanctioned high school sport nationally, the team is a school-based club sport - much like a rodeo. This means it is hard to believe that high school officials would allow students to play with open wounds: This is not what happens on AIDS and hepatitis this day. I don't care what a tradition and a macho picture are. In spite of this, it was a great movie where teenagers were expected to act as adults (and sometimes they did). Unfortunately, there are too many coaches like Flagstaff - or worse.
