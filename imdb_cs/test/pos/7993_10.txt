I have enjoyed this film since I was a kid and still doing it. At that time I also liked Batman, but the real difference is that this movie wasn't dated when I grew up. In this movie, I noticed several scenes that made no sense: "Hmm ... the crowd is angry." Hi! Where did the tomatoes come from? Then I thought, 'Who cares? This movie is not 100% serious anyway! The original Tim Burton Batman was also great, but on some games it was a bit ugly and I didn't like all the actors. This film has improved on almost every aspect with a beautiful cast, more Gothic style and no prince participation. Nowadays, many fans of Christopher Nolan Burton's films don't like to claim that Nolan's movies are more serious, so they are more loyal to the comics. I don't think it's entirely true: - There has never been an adaptation of Batman's original concept, which was a vengeful criminal with a gun. -Batman took many forms over the years peeking his stupidity in the 60s (and a bit with Batman & Robin). The director can choose what type of Batman he will display as long as it is good. <br /> <br /> My opinion: Batman is not necessarily serious. It's about a man in a rubber suit with pointed ears. Burton managed to create the perfect balance between the stupidity and the darkness of the idea. I recently watched Nolan's movies and I love them (especially The Dark Knight). There's just something about this movie that interests me more. Nolan's goal was to give the character a much greater depth while looking for an explanation of almost every aspect of Batman. This is a little too much for me, I'm a bigger fan of the more Batman version. Burton movies are more theatrical and centered around the atmosphere. My conclusion is that you shouldn't compare Nolan with Burton movies. They are simply different and it is up to you which decision you like. My respect is for both directors.
