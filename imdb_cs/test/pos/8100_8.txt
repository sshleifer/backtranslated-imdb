Well, it's been too long and it's in itself too happy. "The Great Dictator" is a fascinating film. Chaplin does an amazing job of satirizing Hitler and attempting to portray the oppression of the Jews in Nazi Germany (it was before concentration camps were common knowledge). Not Chaplin's masterpiece, but it's still worth seeing. <br /> <br />
