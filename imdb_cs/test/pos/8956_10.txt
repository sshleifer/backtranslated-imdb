I watched this film for the first time at the Istanbul Film Festival in 1994. It was so good that I married a few friends with me and I met him again that week. The characters are very well played and humor here and there is amazing. It's definitely a very powerful gay movie. Some scenes cause you to watch Friends with more sophisticated lines. I think I'll put it in my video recorder and I'll watch it tonight ...
