Definitely worth renting! Good pure family fun. My 4 and 5 year old (and I) loved. He caught them on the edge of his seats. I encourage parents to sit with younger children to watch it because it can be quite exciting for them. It's not very often you can find movies that you can watch with your kids and so it is a rare find. Some acting / realism isn't occasionally there, or maybe it's a little scaly, but the kids don't seem to notice or care about it, they love it. Parts are predictable, but others are not - like trying to figure out who the good guys are and who they are. The film has no scary / scary stuff, so I doubt it will give children nightmares. This inspires children to dream, which is something we need to support and support more in our children. Rental and blessing!
