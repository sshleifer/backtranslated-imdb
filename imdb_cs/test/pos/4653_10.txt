I would like the cast and crew members to sit down and make a commentary on this movie! All the different places they shot the movie! There should be some very good anecdotes! Fans of this movie would like to know: <br /> <br /> What kind of permission did they have to get to film in certain places? Were there any unforgettable experiences? <br /> <br /> Were there any scenes that were deleted? What were the tasks and face of the crew? Did some actors have stunts? <br /> <Br /> What was it like working with other cast members? <br /> <br /> Were there any ad libbed scenes? <br /> <br /> What are the cast and crew members up to now? <br /> <br /> Which places are still there and what places aren't there anymore, or are they another company now? <br /> <br /> It's one thing you can read about this movie on the web and other websites. But there is no comparison with how to get it straight from the horse's mouth! Come on, guys! Get in touch and make a comment! Never leave the challenge! Go to the gusto!
