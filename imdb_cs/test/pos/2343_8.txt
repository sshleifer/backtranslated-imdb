I have to agree that this film and his talented director don't get the plaudits they deserve. I hope the DVD will perform very well and bring attention to a wider audience. The actors gave excellent performances and the action is excellent. Overall, the film may be a bit long, but Miles Thomas seems to have his actors when they are doing strong performances, and sometimes he keeps them in longer narrow shots than necessary. Good for the actors I'm sure, but sometimes as an audience you're ready to go on so talk to the conspiracy. May Miles Thomas deserves more recognition from the film industry as one of our leading digital film directors
