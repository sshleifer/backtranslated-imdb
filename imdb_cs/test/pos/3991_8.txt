Warning - this movie has some amazingly graphic images and kids should never see it. The artist this story was all about was a great Korean painter who rose from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter. Unfortunately, in so many ways, this guy was also a jerk in many ways. Some of them were artistic temperament, and what might seem annoying was just his demanding nature in terms of art. But at other times he was simply a drunk - especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist. Late in the film, his being uncomfortable, abrasive and unnecessarily cruel seemed to have diminished. Though all this did not mean that a person was really nice, it is important to capture the film, so we understand a lot about the nature of the artist. I really fascinated the film and loved how the artists' real works were shown through the film (as in LUST FOR LIFE). I really wish I could show it to my students (I teach at school for art), but I can't because there are just too many adult materials. Yes, it is nudity, but it is even more problematic for all viewers (especially the younger ones) when he,â€¦ hmmm, ... I don't think IMDb even allowed me to describe what happened, but it was very graphic and includes body fluids . Not just an ugly and disgusting scene that didn't need to be seen, but a reason why junior to watch this amazing movie. It's a real shame.
