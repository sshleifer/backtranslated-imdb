Incredible Performance! This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I know a lot is said, but I bet you won't regret watching this movie. <br /> <br /> It's great from the very beginning to the last second. Acting (especially mothers - played by Judith Light) is so convincing that there are not many other films I have seen that can be compared with her, and it seems impossible for people in this drama to feel nothing. Br /> <br /> There are a lot of movies every year, but if you have to decide to see a few in your life, do one of them.
