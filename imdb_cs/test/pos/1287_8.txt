I was just watching Watch and I thought it was great. I rated it 8 out of 10. I plan to watch it again with the director's commentary and then again in chronological order. I rented this movie for my fascination with Christopher Nolan Mement's newer movie. The following has some similarities; This movie was probably a plan for Memento. Even music in some parts is very similar. <br /> <br /> Capturing a movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel. The story and dialogue are really good. The performance of the actors is believable. Christopher Nolan made this movie on a really low budget. I look forward to his next release, Insomnia, a big movie budget with my favorite actor Al Pacino.
