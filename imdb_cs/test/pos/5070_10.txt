Extraordinary rendition is a terrifying practice that is surprisingly allowed under Clinton and which allows the US government to seize and detain anyone who is suspected, for some reason, of terrorism against the United States. This is a sensitive issue, especially after 9/11, as supporters of this practice will always criticize the opposition as a denial of US vital power they need to effectively fight terror. Fans of Fanatics will call the opposition terrorists. But just like a recent film that has lent a similar level of humanity to the death penalty, the Life of David Gale, the Rendition shows us the story of abuse of extraordinary rendition, or at least the ease with which it can be used and falsely applied. The story includes Anwar El-Abrahimi, an American chemical engineer born in Egypt, who took a journey back to America from a lecture in Egypt. The reason is that he phoned a known terrorist. No evidence is ever given (or needs) that it was Anwar that called that his phone was never lost from theft. Meanwhile, Anwar's extremely pregnant wife Isabella is back in states that are desperately trying to find her husband who got on a plane to Chicago, but apparently never stepped out. A delicate explanation that he never evaporates when he finds out he made a purchase in flight through his credit card. Recently, I have been exploring modern Chinese history, especially the amazing selfish and brutal dictatorship created by Mao Tse-tung, and it is more than frightening to see similarities between extraordinary rendition and some of his brutal frightened tactics, including his public executions (which people were forced to follow), and the widespread use of torture that was specifically used to obtain "confessions". It is quite disturbing to notice that Mao has done these things to create an environment of fear to obey the Chinese people. To say that the Bush administration did not create an environment of fear and keep it milk for anything worthwhile would be naive at the extreme, and although extraordinary rendition was not created under Bush, it is clear that it causes more harm than good. Adding to the film's thickness is Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal), who works at the CIA desk and has little field experience until his boss is murdered and suddenly finds out that he oversees torture. a man who quickly challenges himself has something to reveal. Fatima's daughter (Freeman's boss) also plays a key role, as does the senator's assistant, Peter Sarsgaard, who might have the most satisfying role in the film. Meryl Streep is also appropriately cold and clinical as a cold senator with dogmatic support for the necessity and practice of publishing. As a political thriller, the film is remarkably well worked out and paced. But the scariest thing about it is that it's all real. The aim of the film is to get people to really think about things that are done in the name of America, especially when they say they should be done to prevent these things. Leading terror in the name of preventing terrorism will not gain any sympathy for us, nor will it make a confession through brutal torture, which is the most basic form of criminal investigation. Unfortunately, we are gradually moving in this direction, doing these things more than less. The horrible question is, what is the event that will take place at some point in the future, to persuade us to stop and go to the other side, towards civilization and peace, or we will continue towards a military dictatorship until we finally reach . push?
