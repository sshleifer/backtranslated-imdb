For every fan of age stories, this 3-hour adaptation of the novel <br /> <br /> Sarah Waters is pure fun. The kinematic nods to Baz Luhman's kinetic style <br /> <br />, as well as all the early and right period pieces that have ever been on the BBC (where you probably saw almost <br /> <br /> every significant member of this cast). It's rather bawdy and more than <br /> <br /> at the top of the points, but that's what the novel demanded. The cast <br /> <br /> is appealing and, in the cases of Anna Chancellor and Hugh, <br /> <br /> Bonneville, perfect. In the case of Rachel Sterling, as our heroine, Nan, you just have to overlook the fact that she is too nice to sometimes be mistaken for a boy and run with him. After all, it's a fantasy. Some fans of the novel may be exposed to various changes in character <br /> <br /> (especially Jodhi May, Florence), but the changes that are all heading for the greater good of this teleplay and <br /> <br /> provide the overall quality of entertainment.
