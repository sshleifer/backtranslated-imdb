It takes a precious film to improve every time you see it. Brother does it and then some. When I first saw it, I must admit that I've never seen anything like it before. I wanted to see it again and now I'm on a two-digit number with this great movie, the Coen brothers' best film they've ever made, and Fargo and Hudsucker Proxy come in the second and third for me. Br /> <br /> George Clooney gives his Ulysses Everett McGee career, a fast-paced creditor who knew it, and who doesn't know much. Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro are the perfect sidekicks for Clooney, especially Nelson and his portrayal of Delmar, a loyal though uneducated fellow escapee. John Goodman is my favorite bit character as Big Dan, perfect. It reminds me of his role in Raising Arizona, he's just a perfect actor for this role. Favorite coen brothers Holly Hunter and Charles Durning are also the most popular performances. Joel and Ethan Coen are the masters of their business. It's not like trying to win the Academy Awards every time they make a movie, they just try to tell the story they want to say and it's fun. It's a free adaptation of the Odyssey and I think I'm free for all of you Homer's fanatics. It's just great. But the most amazing part of this movie is coloring. I watched the film feel dusty and I am still astonished to think about it. Coloring becomes an important part of the film. Great great movie.
