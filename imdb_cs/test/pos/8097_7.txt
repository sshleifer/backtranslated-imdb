That must have been one of Chaplin's most ambitious projects; it throws practically everything, from visual veils and black comedic sketches to social meaning, romance, even some violence. The mixture is challenging and interesting, and the film has many fun and clever sequences (such as where Chaplin and four other guys try to avoid finding a coin to order their self-sacrifice), but the ingredients do not always click together, and the mixture (and tone ) seem a little disharmonious. As far as the famous closing speech is concerned, although it is undeniably honest, it also seems a little naive today, with allusions to "a better world where one overcomes his hatred and brutality and his soul will fly". Great works by Jack Oakie and beautiful Paulette Goddard. (***)
