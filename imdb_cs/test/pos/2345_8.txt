One Life Stand is the perfect work of making a movie that has not been granted the credit it deserves. Its 1.7-inch IMDB rating does not mean fairness and it is only possible because of the very small number of screenings than the quality of the film itself. The film, shot in digital color in black and white, is well directed by production values ​​that run counter to its shocking budget. The performances are excellent, especially with Gary Lewis, who will improve with each role. My only criticism is that it is a bit of a long side and it could do a bit more humor with a touch of darker moments. Overall, it's a good job.
