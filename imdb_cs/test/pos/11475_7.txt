Do you know from Frame 1 that a good man in a suit and tie is doomed? He's not lucky ("Sorte Zero") or so he believes with music on the car stereo, and a dubious conversation his best friend and company associate who is with him into unknown parts across the desert road. Alberto wished he would stay alone to fly abroad the next day, with? Well, someone we guessed. The film goes a long way? will it be short? on the final scene with a man who heard the same music on a taxi at the airport. Meanwhile, many happy people have found different ways out of the story, some die, some are born, others fall into appalling anxiety. Is he really convicted this time? Or is it? The film is a showcase by director Fernando Fragata who has left sound recording and its special effects to other, competent people. Those who typically reject Portuguese films due to problems with sound and unclear speech must go looking for other topics to criticize this time. The car accident (it's not spoilers, the movie is too smart for THAT) makes a great scene, and apparently it was with cheap equipment. (US Studios note: you can save a dollar or two by hiding competent Portuguese directors!) <br /> <br /> The rest was done by Fragata, from script to dialogue, from camera work to editing. If part of the dialogue was ad-libbed, then again it must be congratulated on acting direction, and casting with most inexperienced actors. A large number of non-speaking parts are credited, but most of those people have been used for music video and production, used extensively in the movie's promotional trailer. The cast has a dozen actors and actresses, ten of whom are relevant and a huge number of relationships? which are revealed step by step, in a thrilling, exciting way, reminiscent of the best genres. 'Alfred Hitchcock' (qv) and 'Claude Chabrol' (qv) think the game between cat and mouse between the director and his public, and the nature of his characters. I recommend this thriller and comedy to Portuguese speakers, and if the film has a decent translation of its colloquial dialogue, anyone who likes these genres.
