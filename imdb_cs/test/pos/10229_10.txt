As an avid reader of Clive Barker, I really anticipated this movie before its release ... I wasn't let go. "Nightbreed" is a horse of a different color. Rich in the basic disintegration of Western civilization and dripping with alternative existence in a way we have never seen before. Barker is at his best when he lets us look into his world of unprecedented horror, but shows us the other side of the coin. Here, "Monsters" are abominably beautiful beings, while humans are deceptively ugly creatures of self-confidence. We will soon find out that we were wrong all the time. By far my favorite performance of frequently used Craig Sheffer and David Cronenberg's bonus as "Decker" is the best performance. "Monsters" are portrayed flawlessly by the bevy of English Creation Masters, whom many have also brought "Cenobites" to life in "Hellraiser", including "Pinhead" itself by Doug Bradley. "Nightbreed" is absolutely necessary to see all the horror fans of the genre, and anyone who needs just a bit (Something) more of their horror story. That's Clive Barker at his best.
