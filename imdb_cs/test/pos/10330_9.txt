I absolutely loved this show. I never understood why it is called Bug Juice. I had to be about 13 when it came out. I remember running over the summer holidays on Channel 4, between the re-runs of Summer Pugwalls and Saved by the bell or something like that. I remember sitting there wishing I was also in the summer camp - ha ha. All the kids in it seemed to have so much fun, it was all about "discovering who you are" and "growing up". First kisses and all that stuff. I remember it was a really nice guy, I think it was the main reason I got up in the morning. They should have more teen dock-soaps like this, I thought it was great!
