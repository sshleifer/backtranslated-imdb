Sometimes Denis Leary can be funny and clever and always nice, but this is the cake! This show showed Leary's genii. Job is set in New York City. Leary plays Mike McNeil, a tough detective who is married, has an occasional drug problem and has a girlfriend. McNeil has a serious attitude. So much dripping into her. In addition to McNeil, the circuit is filled with fun, interesting and likeable characters. Also excellent cast. All the episodes in this show are really funny and addictive. One insert in this show is everywhere. You'll be in a stitch after you hear them, and you're still a few minutes after that laughter, and then you laugh at some. Cases dealing with precincts are something else nun strippers, bathroom hostage situations, and others are on top. This show was too good. He could grow his legs to last many seasons. <br /> <br /> Last word: Great, fantastic show. I miss this show dearly. All the episodes of this show are great. You get your belly-laughing ... a lot. ABC made a huge mistake by giving her an ax. It is a pity that Leary failed to revive the cable TV show. Yet I give this show one of my highest recommendations. Really one of the kind show.
