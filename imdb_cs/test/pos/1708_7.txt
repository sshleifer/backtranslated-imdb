As for the talk-show, Larry King Live is not bad, and because he occasionally gets good guests, it's a show that turns on once in a while, but not compulsively. When Bill Maher, Carl Bernstein, former president or other eminent guests sit across from him, it's not bad. At other times, he tends to host guests who participate in the latest celebrity scandal, who has no intelligent information in the country and feeds a largely uneducated public who wants to hear the latest gossip about film and television stars. During the Simpsons trial, every other guest on his show seemed to be in touch with the case. But is it really journalism? Or National Enquirer on the tube? Sometimes, it comes a bit like a television garbage - Jerry Springer in a conversation with the phone instead of a live audience. On the other hand, King's show is definitely much better than Bill O'Reilly, whose show is nothing but the most likely political platform of Rush Limbaugh. That means Larry King is not a bad interviewer, but unfortunately he is not big. The King does not always leave, as if he fully understood when the intellectual material is being presented, especially if he is a scholar or historian with a new book on the subtle aspects of politics. It always seems that the minute a king cannot solve a problem is when he turns to phone calls, hoping someone in the country will have a better question than he has. He could talk to someone like David Gergen, but maybe he didn't read any of his books. A bit like a film producer who never bothered to read the script. <br /> <br /> It's no problem when it's a fun personality. He can come as he is thoroughly informed because the material is not as essential as well. Talking to Elizabeth Taylor about her relationship with Richard Burton is not exactly rocket science. And I noticed that he usually saw the last movie of the star. Watching a movie takes much less time and contemplation than reading a book. However, if it's like John Dean or Bob Woodward, King comes out a little like he didn't finish his homework. So off to the phones. If you're looking for real in-depth interviews, Terry Gross of NPR is probably the best interviewer in the United States. She reads and / or examines everything written or about her guests in advance and has a working knowledge of these areas. I don't see the king so well. It is true that the audience is about 1000 times larger than Terry Gross, who can say more about the American audience than the King. In short, Larry is better than Bill, but not as good as Terry.
