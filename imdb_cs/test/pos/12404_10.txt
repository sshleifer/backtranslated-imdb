I recently rented this video after seeing "Final Ascent" from the same writer. I wasn't ready for how intense the movie would be. I found it fits from start to finish, and it was rooting for teenagers to get rid of their crime attempt. The end was certainly worrying about some of his implied violence, but well done. I highly recommend this picture.
