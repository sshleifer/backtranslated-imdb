This little film brings a lot of memories, both kind and foul, what can happen and what happens when a person is a musician. It's not so nice accommodation for a band, leading a place jumping up and down that tells you what to play, total ecstasy applause .............. in fact, very accurate in the way it depicts musicians , professional and otherwise, who have traveled a great distance to perform a concert season at the venue. There are times when everything goes perfectly, there are other times when you immediately start to miss your partner and wonder what the hell you're doing away from home. Finally, you must make the most of it because there is no other way out.
