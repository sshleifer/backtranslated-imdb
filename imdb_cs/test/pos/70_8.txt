This film is certainly well designed, begins and ends in the dark, with a focus on Lili Smith / Schmidt, Julie Andrews, initially singing "angel", later a famous spy. <br /> <br /> It's beautiful! I saw a movie about 15 years ago and I recently watched it. While in the 1970s critics rejected it as a burn, "cinema vulgaris" and lack of structure (among other things), time turned out to be bad. Blake Edwards certainly made a film that is almost lyrical in quality. The film rises and swirls (aerial photos, Julie Andrews on the move) and captivates. One only has to buy into the assumption that Julie Andrews is a spy whose mission has gone wrong. With a view to the lukewarm chemistry between Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson, one has to believe that they are lovers - who fall into one another in all innocence. Finally, love is more important than winning the war. And so innocence is maintained. There is a lot of underrated games, and the movie will certainly reach the emotional depth often not seen in comedies. There are wonderful comic elements (harbinger of French goons in Victor / Victoria), an interesting diplomatic asides (reminiscent of Tamarind Seed, seen about 18 years ago) and a general sense of goodwill. Suspend all distrust and this movie will take you away. Julie Andrews' belting from the war songs and the creepy 'Whistling Away the Dark' are enough reason to turn on the TV, just for the soundtrack. And a striptease number, like "Jenny" in Star! works. This film has, like good champagne, good old age. Paramount should bring it to DVD as soon as possible. The same is true for transferring a Star laser! to DVD. These are interesting pieces of careful and then underestimated work by Julie Andrews.
