Three pairs of zany, all SIX OF A KIND, are involved in madcap searching for stolen bank loot. This is a live, cheerful comedy with six stars - Charlie Ruggles & Mary Boland, WC Fields & Alison Skipworth, George Burns & Gracie Allen - all that is involved in what they did best: laugh . Ruggles & Boland make another of their movie appearances as husband and wife - this time somewhat more cheerful than usual. They were the perfect team - she was a rigid lioness, a nervous rabbit - and dominated the screen most of the time. From beginning to end, they are a pleasure. Burns & Allen continues their cloak, which was created in Vaudeville, improved on the radio and eventually taken to television. . Occasionally in a movie it tends to go a little over the top, but it's hard to dislike it. Her heart was obviously made of solid gold. While Skipworth has enough short shift - only fragments of her formidable personality gleam - Fields is in his element as the undisputed sheriff of Nuggetville in Nevada. Whether he explains how he got the nickname of Honest John or when he was looking at the missing pier at night, he is never less than amazing. Best of all, he can do his entire pool routine and keep it for grateful forever. Finally, he will do almost miraculous - he gets Gracie to shut up. Paramount was so pleased with the success of SIX OF A KIND that they wanted to rush major players into another comedy. Only Fields got lost. He felt he had now reached the point where he no longer had to share the film with other celebrity comics. The studio finally agreed and started preparing the first solo game Fields, YOU'RE TELLING ME (1934).
