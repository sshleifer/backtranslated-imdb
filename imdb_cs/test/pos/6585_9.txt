This is another of those rare movies that one feels grateful for being introduced instead of the usual Hollywood trio. It's really a rollercoaster ride because we're watching the effects of a forged 500 euro banknote on a lot of people. One asks "what if" all the time, but it's definitely a butterfly effect captured on the film. You will laugh, cry and bite your lips. I loved every minute! And thanks to SBS Australia for displaying movies that are really fun, even worth reading the headlines. The only downside in my mind is that I wont book a vacation at Frozen Land - they all seem too depressed - they must be all that cold weather. Either way, watch it - it's worth every second.
