This film is an excellent example of what can be an independent film. The director does an excellent job of moving between emotional and physical violence. Eventually, however, he remembers what so many indie films he forgets - tells a good story. When I watched this movie, I remembered how shy and mundane the most majestic Hollywood movies became. Especially noteworthy is the extraordinarily powerful performance of the film's management - Jorge Cordova. Cordova, as a thief thief (on the way to the top of a pile of crimes), plays Cordova, a brutal, arrogant, malevolent and slim S.O.B. Somewhere I read that these guys are part of a new wave of Latin American filmmakers in Los Angeles - called La Nueva Obra, or something like that. Either way, this movie looks forward to more work. <br /> <br />
