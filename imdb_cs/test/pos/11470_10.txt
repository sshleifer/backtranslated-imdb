I thought this movie was good, I loved the storyline, I loved the scenes from the filming, except for a few, didn't need them, and I also enjoyed Mao's character, she was a rider I liked. I have to say that in this movie of the gangsters the actors were well picked up, because sometimes some actors just don't fit this role. However, even though I hate to say it, but I hated the end, I felt like it should go in a different direction. It would also be better with a little detail based on a true story, but there were so many omitted facts that it was good. If you like past gangster movies, you'll enjoy this movie.
