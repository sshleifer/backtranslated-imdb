I'm not a big music fan, but this is one of the few I really love. Unlike many other musicals, such as "The Sound of Music", there is no song about gratuitous things. Each song is a social commentary, watch out for war, sexuality, rebellion, spirituality and freedom. Especially amazing songs are "Easy To Be Hard", "Age of Aquarius", "Hair", "Flesh Failures / 3-5-0-0", "Walking In Space" and "Hare Krishna". Totally revolutionary and wonderful. I can't wait to see it once live!
