I expected this movie to be stinky, but I wanted to make sure it was a good movie. I know that longer films often don't do well at the box office, but why it was pulled out and couldn't be seen by the public is beyond me. Keeping my interest throughout and scenery and photography is breathtaking at times. The story was good and the game of morality was good. I liked the realism that was in line with "Unforgiven". I had to rent this movie to see it, but it was definitely worth it.
