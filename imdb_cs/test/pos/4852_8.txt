This is a movie about a person who everyone thinks is Jewish.This is a movie about Lawrence Newman who lives in Brooklyn in the 1940s, at the time of WWII. Jew. And just because he looks like one. And she lives in a very anti-Semitic neighborhood. So some people start treating him like dirt. They make the judgment that they are a Jew, also Larry's fresh wife, Gertrude Hart. Life Unbearable.Neal Slavin Focus (2001) is a pretty good view of anti-Semitism. This is a problem that won't go away. The film is based on the novel Athur Miller, which, I admit, I haven't read. But the movie is really good, so I'm sure the book would also. actors are doing a good job. William H. Macy is always good, and his work as Larry Newman is brilliant.Laura Dern is Gert Hart and she's gorgeous. Finkelstein is the most likeable in the movie. Paymer is the perfect choice for the role. Christian and Jew.
