This is a great example of very no Hollywood movie making that is very thought provoking, moving and not without a sense of humor, Kevin McKidd and Paula Sage are excellent. Actually, I watched him on late night television and I see why I missed him in the cinema, it's not the kind of movie that shows a multi-screen "mega" movie, a shame today. <br /> <br /> I'll be looking for a DVD. Not for those who prefer, the current trend for special effects and no story. If you like the best-selling book "The Curious Incident of the Dog in Night-Time", you'll enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the best Scottish movies, such as "Little Faces" and "Trainspotting". All the movies in which Kevin McKidd also plays. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
