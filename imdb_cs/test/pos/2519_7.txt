Just as the "beginning" showed that we still get "classic" x files, Drive showed that X files will explore the new territory. They start by giving us a unique demonstration on Drive, with camera shots. It was an interesting transition from television to real events. I would have liked it even better if they left the news camcorder for the whole puzzle and didn't cut inside. After the show of this episode to live in 1998, I was wondering, "Am I on the right channel?" The first autopsy of Scully flooded me with great words I couldn't understand. Before she did an autopsy, I think she always learned to wear a mask. Stupid Scully! What is the illumination in an autopsy lab? It's dark as a tomb! How do they see what they're doing there? Assistant Director Kersh gets his first line in this episode. I didn't lose any love for the man. He is the third recurring character in the series that is presented to you that you love to hate, the first two being Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender. I think the manufacturers felt that Mulder, Scully, and Skinner loved each other very much. So they needed to add some characters to grieve our favorite agents and encourage our anger as fans. I like quarantine suits worn by Scully and her team with cool bulbs. Boy. It's really smoky or hazy in DRY Northern Nevada at night. Can we say the word "effect"? Driving is a great episode, but when looking at Route 36 on my American atlas, Mulder can't keep the speed of 70-100 MPH on this road. If he was on I-80, maybe on the highway. But no way on the state road with many curves. The whole shooting in the car looked very authentic. Rob Bowman's great work. It looks like nothing like old times of apparently blue screen or clip of passing scenes in front of a car window on stage. It was a fun episode, but some of these inaccuracies make it impossible to be a big episode. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, so keep on driving fast!
