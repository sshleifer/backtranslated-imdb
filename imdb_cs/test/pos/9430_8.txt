Dr. A Swiss scientist, Franz Tobel is smuggled from his home country by Sherlock Holmes, so that Nazi agents spying on him will not get their invention of a new bomb. Arriving in London, he resides with Holmes and Watson, but goes out to visit with his girlfriend, Charlotte Eberli, where he leaves the leash for Holmes as to his bombs point of view, which he divided into four pieces, but Holmes' eternal nemesis, Professor Mority , also looking for a bomb to be sold to the Nazis, and kidnapping Dr. Tobel and the key he left in Charlotte, a code series of dancing men that both Holmes and Mority can't completely decipher. . Holmes eventually discovers the key to the code and get the location of the fourth piece of the bomb look, but Morarity has the other three and the showdown is inevitable. Very good entry into the Holmes series with lots of secrets and guesswork to go around. Atwill's depiction of Morarality is more sadistic than the scholar described in Doyle's stories (or George Zucc's performance in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes), but Atwill's ability as an actor makes his morale completely benevolent. The screenplay and direction make this record more of the cat and mouse game between the two characters and that's one of the reasons this record is so successful. Great work on cinematography. Rating, 8.
