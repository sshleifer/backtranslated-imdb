"Termination" can be just as much about ending a predetermined identity as a drug withdrawal. As a rural man coming to Beijing, class and success must strike this young artist face to face as a challenge to separation from his roots and far beyond his peasant acting achievements. However, problems arise when a new person is too new when it requires too much departure from family, history, nature and personal identity. Subsequent division and confusion between imaginary and real and dissonance between ordinary and heroic is a matter of controlling the intestines on the one hand or completely escaping from one another on the other. Hongshen slips into the other and his long and lonely way back to himself can be grim. But what an extraordinarily convincing peculiarity, honesty and sensual director Zhang Yang and his actors bring to this journey. No clich√©s, no stereotypes, no rigorous gender roles, no essential sex, romance or violent scenes, no essential street language, and to shoe, no supposed money to swim character acts and whims. Hongshen Jia is in the mid-twenties. He is a talented actor, impressive, futile, idealistic and perhaps emotionally hungry. The perfect recipe for his abilities. Soon it is a "cool" actor, idolized by the youth. "He was hot in the early nineties." "He always had to be the most fashionable." He needs extremes and goes into heavy metal, accepting earrings and scarf. His actions mean art, friends - and roles, but not the kind that offers a personal challenge or input. And his self-criticism, blunted by the immediacy of success, opens the door to irrational self-doubt, hatred - "I didn't know how to act" "I felt like a fake" - and readily available drugs against them. He says, "I had to get high to do what the director wanted." His shallow identity as an actor is due to drugs becoming an escape from identity. Hongshen's drug elimination and his false life is very slow, intermittent - and tremendously inherent. Solitude, space, meditative thinking, rejection of speech, replacement of therapy. The abstract is gone. And much of his changes take place outside - not in idealized locations, but mainly in green areas under the highways, bridges and high-rise buildings in Beijing. Physicality is almost romantic, but it is not. The bike goes to Ritan Park, long spontaneous walks, sunbathing sun and rain, grassy picnics, sky patterns and dragons that absorb its thinking are very specific. He is drifting away to come, all while encouraging a more realistic and realistic identity. "I started to open up," she says retroactively. And the contact seems to begin with his wide-eyed body, which radiates a kind of dancer's location in the present situation (clumsy, graceful, witty, narrative). If there is no mind or spirit, his legs may force him to walk all night. The centerpiece of his comeback is the rejection of set roles. To break his end of acting and his commitment to a new identity, he breaks his videos and television and heads his way into a bloody poster against his "John Lennon Forever" poster. He left his iconic anti-artist founding --- but he is the only viable guide he knows. He even imagines himself as John's son (Yoko Ono) and accepts his "Mother Mary" as an intercessor in his "hour of darkness" and "time of trouble." (Twitching, trembling in the park - hallucinatory and skitzoid suffering) "Music is more real than playing," he says. And he talks about Lennon's influence as "showing me a new way." In a psychiatric institute, life-saving apples (resistance, nutrition) reflect Lennon's presence, as well as Hongshen's need to hang his hero's poster into his painted room. If Lennon's influence is lively, Hongshen's influence of father's influence is grounding. Although father and son are both actors and users (drugs and drinking), his change differs from Fegsen's differences from his son. The father is safer in himself: he accepts that he is a Chinese, a peasant in a row of peasants, a rural theater director. And he exercises control over his habit and his emotions. It is this recognizable identity that drives Hongshen to treat him like a soundboard, sometimes with anger and anger, sometimes with humor (blue jeans, Beatles) and passivity. In her craziest and violent exchange with her father, accusing him of liar, and of false speech, she reveals more of herself than her father: "All the actions I have done before were crap ... life is bullshit." "And to Hongshen's emphatic" you are not my father, "he gently replies," why can't a peasant be your father? "Under these two teachers and with great help from mother, sister, friends, prisoners in rehabilitation institutions, some tangible connection to the real (not all) self, as the long-term effects of the medications subsist, and its old identity, indebtedness replaces pride, mistrust of trust, integrity excludes its black cloud, all its edges soften. after being released from the strap he had given because of his refusal of medicine, now the fat of his lard is at home with him, and his once "rare and true friendship" begins again as seen in his back to the enchanting scene of a leaning fence Hongshen says about this movie: "It's a good chance to think about my life." And I can add to becoming a new actor tied to He changes and lives, just as Lennon has gained success without losing his identity.
