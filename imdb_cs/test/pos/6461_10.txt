This is a powerful movie that seems to have never re-arisen after Joe McCarthy's time of censorship. It influenced me as a Jewish teenager who had friends of different colors and whose paternal family suffered during the fascist regimes in Europe in the second quarter of the twentieth century. Unlike the later rip-off, "On The Waterfront," which seemed to have some of the same themes and twist them to fit the forced Hollywood political correctness of time, it told its story directly and with respect to the characters and the fictitious reality. it bounced. It was an antidote to "Down with the Wind", "Nation of the Nation", "Triumph of the Will" and so many other glories of hatred and violence. I would like to place it next to the recent German movie (also hidden in the USA), "Rosenstrasse". I remember that the television version, also black and white in format and story, was blackened by some stations because the black hero's wife looked white. As a young civil rights worker, it has caused me a conflict because, on the one hand, I was against cigarette smoking and, on the other hand, boycotted a television program sponsor, the biggest tobacco producer in Georgia (I can't remember which one - anyone else?). I'd like to find a CD, whether a movie or a TV show, so my sons can see something that would generally inform me about the opposition to racism (as opposed to just fighting against racism against Jews) and the recognition of natural links between racism and militarism.
