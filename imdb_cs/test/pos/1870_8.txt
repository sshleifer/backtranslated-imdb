I saw this title again on Shemaroo. I also asked the nephew who had 17 to follow the same with me. I'm 35 and he is 17 years old. I liked it and I did too. It's still funny, a little childish, but still very clean fun. Satish Shah is cheerful in multiple roles. This sitcom would still be better than many recent TV shows. But apparently some people seem to have the mundane prizes that come out today. It would be nice that Shafi Inamdar would continue in all seasons. He's not alive today. I'd like someone to list all the episodes here. What can forget the lines of "Yeh Kya Ho Raha HAi" "What relief" "Chief Kaat Daalu" "Vyavhaar hai Vyavhaar" "30 Years of Ka Experience hai" <br /> <br /> and Title Song Yeh Jo hai Zindagi, teaches us to live life as it comes and enjoy it. The life of ordinary people. I still like this sitcom. It may not seem so fun at times, but some episodes are still hilarious.
