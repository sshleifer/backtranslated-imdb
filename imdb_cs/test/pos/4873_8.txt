Remember that friend at the school who always insisted on renting the strangest movie? This is a movie he would do if he had a chance. I wish I could tell you exactly what the Sea of ​​Dust was about. He pretends to be the story of a doctor who gets into a strange story in the "Black Forest". He goes there to help, but ends up being caught between two young women. But it is just scratching the surface. That's the kind of movie where things happen accidentally ... and not a nice thing. People are constantly beating and stabbing. There's a couple of ghostly girls who seemed to come out of the Shining. Tom Savini is some imaginary religious figure who decides not to be imaginary anymore. He has a plan to take over the world by sharing the suffering of Jesus. At some level it's a sex movie. It's one without nudity, which was a disappointment, but no mistake. At the next level, it's a stone paradise. Unexpected things happen so often that they stop being unexpected. At a time when a doctor passes through his girlfriend's birth channel, it is enough to draw it into the crazy nature of the film. Some of these places are roaring over and over again. If you're watching it with a bunch of stone friends, it could be a good thing.
