This film changed the art of filmmaking, telling a complex story in a strong new way. The film mixes brutal realism with fantasy, interlacing modern war with strange scenes full of colored smoke. The film uses music not as a score later, but as a practical part of a scene playing from speakers, radios, etc. Coppola uses classical literature as inspiration, takes scenes and characters, and places them in a completely different setting. This is a complex and daring thing. Then he takes a superstar, Brando, pays him a fortune and shoots him so you can hardly see his face. The clean insides that such a move requires are stunning and beautiful. This film belongs to the top ten.
