It's a funny, clever movie and it's worth your time. In my opinion, it is much better than American Pie and other films of the same genre that seem to be discarded all the time. I didn't hear about this movie, so I think it wasn't much of a press, which is a shame. It doesn't take too seriously, but it also brings people a serious message of life and life experiences and what's important ... Unlike a movie about a lot of desperate men trying to lay down for the first time and one dude holding its d ** c cakes, But in the end they all lay down and scream-de-do ... One thing that impressed me was that the soundtrack was quite amazing and not the usual cheesy American pop-punk ... In fact, they had a real punk of the day like Ramones ... The film itself did better! To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this movie and I was pleasantly surprised at how good comedy is.
