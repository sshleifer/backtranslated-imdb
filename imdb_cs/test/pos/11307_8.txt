After all these years, I am confused why Julie Brown (West Coast) is not a household name or a very famous comedy star. He's one of the funniest women on the planet. In this spoof he takes Madonna, which is one of her favorite goals. It is Medusa, an extremely successful singer, as well as Madonna, who also had the documentary "Truth or Courage". Julie Brown spoofs Madonna as Medusa who came from Wisconsin, a country dairy and beer. I remember the segment she went to Wisconsin to visit her family and the grave. I don't remember if he was a parent or her pet. I remember someone that Medusa did nothing original. She just copied the others. I have to say that I hope this spoof document is available on DVD somewhere. Julie Brown was best at mocking and spoofing others.
