Jean-Pierre Melville is a director I only recently met (I have to see Bob le Flambeur and Le Samourai to fully understand them), but to observe Le Cercle Rouge (The Red Circle, allegedly based on a proverb in Buddhism) I realized that I watched him be skillful and absorb a crime film I saw at some time. Although his film has a dialogue, it is mainly for the film scenes to alternate with them. What kept me alert, even in seemingly mundane scenes / sequences, was the emphasis on character movements or behavior patterns. Melville has his story unloaded, and he is careful to take his time to say it (it might seem boring to some, but it seems to work because he puts a little more emphasis on the weight of the characters / environment over the fence). Yet look at each of the four main players: Alain Deleon as Corey (just released from jail, bullying a new robbery), Gian Maria Volonte as a Vogel (escaping the rope from custody), with Corey Happiness), Yves Montand as Jansen (at age for with many years of arms experience, friend of Vogel), and Andre Bourvil as Mattei (an experienced investigator, who is on sight for Vogel, and on his fingers with internal affairs). Each of these actors plays their parts with precision, distance, and each has their own moments that show viewers what their personalities may be, apart from criminals and cops. The heistics sequence gives few tips, such as how Vogel cops-and-feel outside a female statue as they pass down the hall, or how Jansen pulls out a flask and has only a whiff of content (and what the dream this guy creates). Even Corey's movements involving a photograph of a woman aroused interest. Since the story is absorbing and cooling, and how great the skills were to make it happen (through cameraman Henri Decae, the editing and musical score of Eric Demarsan), they are the people on the screen who are gaining fascination with how they remain true to their nature and ideals. It is not a film that the new wave enthusiasts would miss, and lovers of modern crime films would like to spend 140 minutes to soak up the atmosphere of Melville's work. Great piece of movie that is still one of my favorite favorites.
