When it turned out at the Seattle Int'l Film Fest, I was the only one who stood and applauded and cheered. The rest of the crowd squealed or silent. It is a well-played little film that extends deep into the realities of the young homosexual mankind. It's about a real person; and does not play the hyper-buffed muscle "gay paositive" that goes through the genre of non-gay porn cinema (and that's why so many contemporary gay genre movies are so boring). This movie is Intense Passsion and Great Tragedy. Acting and directing and cinematography are fantastic; It all keeps the film clustered and tense and passionate. Don't miss if you can find one.
