Oliver Stone, always ready for politically motivated films, is next. "Talk Radio" is loosely based on Alan Berg's career, a radio talk show host in Denver that has been murdered by white supremacists. In this case, Barry Champlain (Eric Bogosian) is an open talk show in Dallas who loves nothing more than to irk people calling in. racists. And things can get hotter than anyone realizes. Bogosian's performance brings a light comic tone to an otherwise serious film. I really liked the scene in which she throws herself on a cat calling inside. I'm sorry to never tell Oliver Stone's biggest movie, but it's a good reference at a time when media is increasingly concentrated. Good performances by Ellen Greene and Alec Baldwin also help.
