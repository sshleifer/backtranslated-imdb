While I agree that this film has no real substance and should not be taken seriously, it is primarily aimed at fans of the series looking for a quick fix. Bronson (Paul Kersey) takes to the streets again (with the license to kill the main police no less) and moves to his apartment of friends (whom you guessed) was killed by a street gang who took control of the surroundings (which looks like Beruit). It's funny that people who associate with Bronson have a habit of killing. Bronson kills them one by one when people in the neighborhood are against him. There is a certain dynamism between Bronson and Fraker that leads the street gang, you can say that they both enjoy their work. At one point in the movie after they break off in city jail, Fraker says, "I'm going to kill a little old lady just for you, catch her at 6:00." "Giggler", a handbag thief who laughs when he commits his crimes, is also nice to watch. The film was made in 1985, and most people probably could identify with the stereotypical urban gangs that are cast in the film. It's nice to watch Bronson (Paul Kersey) get rid of the streets of these criminals. Watch out for the look of Wildey Magnum, a serious piece of hardware that Bronson controls. I also liked the soundtrack for this movie.
