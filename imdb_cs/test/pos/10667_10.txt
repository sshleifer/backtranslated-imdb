If you are a film student, or you are one, or are thinking of becoming one of them, the Potemkin Battle Ship name will or will have a resonance. Sergei Eistenstein, like other pioneers of silent film, such as Griffith (though Eisenstein's innovations are not as obvious as Griffiths) and Murnau, have had such an impact on the history of cinematography, this is obviously taken for granted. The reason I brought up the movie is because, at some point, whether you like it or not, your movie professor will show 9 times out of 10 the sequence of this movie "Odessa Stairs". It's hard to tell if it's the best part of several movie sequences that deal with the time of the Russian Revolution. But it leaves the biggest impact, and it can be seen in many movies introducing tension, or just plain mounting (the culmination of Untouchables' comes to mind). Montage, who was not only Eistenstein's talent, but also his life blood early in his career, is often abused in contemporary cinema, or if not abused then in the wrong context for the story. Sometimes mounting is now used as another device that gets from point A to point B. Montage was something else for Eisenstein; he tried to communicate as directly as possible so that he could urgently, passion (passion), and the final tragedies that were in Russia at the time. Even if you don't see all the thoughts of Eisenstein's narrative or traditional "story" ideas that have a lot of grounding (Kubrick said it), no one can deny the power to see the ships that come to the port, the people on the stairs, and the soldiers who come to them each. way with weapons. Some may find it difficult to believe that it was done in the 1920s; He has power such as the Passion of Jane of Arc to overcome his time and remain important only in terms of technique and emotions. Of course, one could go for books (which have been written hundreds of times, of which at least Eisenstein himself). On the film itself, Battleship Potemkin is really more like a dramatic report than a particular story in the film. The first segment is also one of the large sequences in the film, as the revolt is plotted against Captain and other head-ups of a certain ship. This is described in detail in a manipulation manner but very effective in some way; Here too, splicing is used, but in the energy fluctuations that capture the eye. At other times, Eisenstein is more content to let the images speak for themselves, because the soldiers are tired without food and water. He is not one of those directors who will try to get all sides into the story; Of course, it is a very early Russian language of the 20th century, but it is nothing but honest as it sees its motives and style, and it ends. Some may want to control it outside the film school because the 'Staircase' sequence is like one of the landmarks of a heavy tragedy on the film, depicting the ugly side of the revolution. Eisenstein may not be one of the "more accessible" directors of silent movies, but if photomontage, frame details, non-actors, and Bolshevik themes are your cup of tea, it's really one of those that has to see for life.
