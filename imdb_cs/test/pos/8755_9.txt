I remember seeing it in the UK in the early 1990s and being addicted. The international scope of production is breathtaking and observes how the characters evolve within five hours of being built. Of particular interest are scenes from Pakistan and Afghanistan, and as a viewer, in the final stages of the Cold War, you have a real sense of looking at the culture and atmosphere of these countries. The characters of Fazal and Helena are developing very well over the course of the series, competing with modern shows like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under. In the UK, VHS is about £ 6 and the DVD is £ 10 - a quality contract. I thought the Soderbergh version was great too - but it owes this masterpiece a huge debt.
