I spent many sleepless nights after watching 2001. Not only because of psychological horror (of which 2001 is a masterpiece), but also because of how she brought me (a restless soul) to some clear way of observing the universe. It changed my way of thinking in a very deep way. And after reading the novel (by Arthur C. Clarke), I was once again inspired (writer like me) by the level of imagination. The Odyssey space is not something that can be simply "going" and seeing ". One must be prepared for it, or it cannot be understood. In fact, I do not think it could be understood at all It is a philosophical journey to the infinite and beyond, a masterpiece of his genre and still technically quite impressive after 32 years until the powerful musical soundtrack called "Also Zarrachust's Spracht" by Richard Strauss and Johann Strauss's Blue Danube. Take all the time you want, but in the end you'll have to see this movie, if it can bring some order and understanding to a space-fighting artist like me, it can definitely do it for you too. Or maybe I'm just crazy ...
