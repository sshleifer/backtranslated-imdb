When the episode was made and aired by Eisenhower was President. Kennedy was President-Elect. As for the episode, it was an open-air episode, if not a bit serious. "Professor" shows that there is not too much, and the whole thing seems to be hurrying (lots of TZ episodes seemingly fall out of time, some seem tense and hurry, some with little or no to spread out hours, and some, of course fit). I think you just expect a little more tension than going back to some rooms and drugging. But overall a decent episode. "What if" the motive of time travel is actually a nugget in itself, and a table of basic interest is set. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10, given that there were a lot of TZ episodes that aren't as good and some much better.
