This movie is too good for words. It's incredibly great and funny and true to life. You know that the one who wrote DEFIANTLY felt Jip and his friends were making a movie. It was my life in one place and I would count on going home to watch Human Traffic at any time before I thought I'd go to sleep. I think you fell in love with characters and their lifestyle. Of course, this film would not be more than 16 to 22 years old for the elderly. There is nothing wrong with this film and it will take you all the way in the stitch. He has no specific story to do. The general idea is a weekend in the life of older teens in London and what they get to. The places they go to, the people they meet, the drugs they use, and the experiences they have. You have to get this movie on DVD don't mind just watching it, you must have it!
