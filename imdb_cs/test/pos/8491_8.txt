Jamie Foxx does a great job of impersonating the famous blues / soul / country singer Ray Charles. Merit of the film shows both good and bad as to the character of Charles and his choice, both personally and professionally. <br /> <br /> This is a smooth movie that will give you a rich sense of times in which the story takes place. Not only does it look good, it sounds good. I wish there were more music. It's embedded when it's inserted, but it's not enough. Assuming, at least for the purpose of reviewing that the story was true, I was overwhelmed and disappointed by Charles, which means that the story has left some unforgettable impressions because I write it 16 months after reading it. The main impressions include: <br /> <br /> GOOD - Re-Living Ray is a tremendous talent and its foresight to stand out and take chances, such as “country” for a while. The man was confident in himself, but he wasn't so arrogant. Also unforgettable was to show how he beat his heroin addiction - without help! That's just amazing. BAD - I also remember through this movie how easily curved Ray got first and disappointed that he was so unfaithful to his wife. The truly sad reminder was that his wife was more upset with him because he lacked his Little League children's games before she was for all the cheating he did on her, even the childhood of a child with a member of his singing group. The only negative with the filmmakers was the over-emphasizing of his problems, which were accused of one early childhood event, the accidental death of his brother. This tragedy was used as a hill for all Ray's misconceptions as an adult, another example of a culture in which people refuse to take responsibility for their actions. <br /> <br /> Note: There is an extended version with DVD but the word is that it's so badly edited that it's not worth watching, so stick to the "theatrical version".
