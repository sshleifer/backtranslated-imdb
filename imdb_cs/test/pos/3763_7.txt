I love this movie a lot. I gotta get it on DVD. I have 2 copies of VHS, but the quality is so bad that you can't read one written joke above the door of the department. I'm amazed forever that Blankfield has done almost nothing. He did both Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde completely believable. The film is plagued by its low budget. (One cruel edit jumps to the middle word and has been described as "Siskel & Ebert.") But there's a thousand jokes, gags of fine references that more than compensate. I often found myself quoting lines (or, singing, "I got nothing to hide") and, from time to time, completely describing a scene that matches some conversation. There are at least six scenes that are among my favorite comedy bits. Viewers without a history of cocaine use can miss many gags. <br /> <br /> "Here, take it." * Visual control while waving his back from the window. * "I said," Is this seat taken? "Visual chaps, headband, jockstrap, & swim fins." Yeah. I'm right. "" Me! "It says my wife is trying to sell." Bernie will love them. "" These are my legs, Jack, "says the black legs." Why should we tell you? "..." ARE ON SUPERMARKET! " "Ivy!" In the PA supermarket. * Loading the entire shopping cart into the ambulance. * Etc.
