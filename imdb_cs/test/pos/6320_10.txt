I own this movie. I'm actually from the same town as the director's brother. But that doesn't mean the movie is better. But if one night you want to watch something that is not serious, and you do not have high expectations, I recommend Demon Summer. Yes, the lines are raw and the plot is sloping. However, it contains key elements of horror / comedy. I just want to see children from a small town to make a film full of effects. And I say "bravo" to Campell's brothers. They are now making more films and continuing their long dreams. Demon Summer was one of the movies that will help them start a great career with a great future.
