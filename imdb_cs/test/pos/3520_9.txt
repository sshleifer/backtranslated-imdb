Just before Dawn came out during the golden days of the film slasher. Backwoods slasher quite started with films like Friday the 13th, Burning and Madman. Just Before Dawn is one step ahead of the classic back forest. The camera is beautiful. Activity is top. The film's heroine is not your typical "end girl". Constance is a "forest" girl, but when it comes to the primordial survival instinct, it is a step forward. Not when it comes to saving her and her boyfriend's life, she makes an initial idea of ​​survival. There is a gentle transition that gradually focuses on the ultimate girl hidden sexuality - which coincides with surviving next to her. Just Before Dawn isn't for everyone, but for a slasher fan, it's as close as you can get. The killer (s) are very menacing - Almost like a game that has the task of mutilating and murdering anyone who crosses their territory. The final scene is a little off. For the first time it may be a little shocking. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the forest slasher. Even non-slasher fans will find something they like. This setting is scary and makes you feel uncomfortable. Death sequences are not particularly bloody, but I'm not sure if the film needs gore. You see it!
