Based on the 1952 autobiography "Many-Gorgeous Thing," "Love is a Many-Splendored Thing" (1955) tells the story of Han Suyin, focusing on the romance that Han, a widowed Eurasian doctor in 1949 Hong Kong, had with a married American correspondent on behalf of Mark Elliott. "I don't want to feel anything again," Han tells Mark soon after they meet, but they both soon develop and who can blame them? Mark is played by William Holden at the near peak of his hunky-dude season (the following year's "picnic" would be the pinnacle) in this, the first of three films in the next seven years that would find Holden in China (1960 ") \ t Suzie Wong and 1962 are Satan Never Sleeping to Be Others) And Dr. Han is played by Jennifer Jones, who, although not Eurasian (as opposed to the wonderful Nancy Kwan and pretty France Nuyen of the other exotic Holden movies), does a credible job As one, whether they are dressed in cheongsam, european wardrobe, surgical clothing or (hubba-hubba!) swimsuit, Jones looks ridiculously beautiful here. No wonder East is so dramatically meeting the West in this movie! stars, breathtaking Hong Kong scenery, beautiful CinemaScope cinematography and color, Oscar-winning costumes and classic Oscar-winning title cast into the movie as a beautiful incense, "Love j Many-Splendored Thing "is changing quite a victorious and romantic mix. Han herself reportedly did not care about the picture, so I can imagine that her freedom was taken with her source material. Still, I enjoyed it. And if the end of the film causes a tear to come into your eyes, remember Mark's words of wisdom: "The greatest tragedy of life is not to love."
