the most "spiritual" movie I've seen for a long time. maybe sometimes. also one scene around the dinner table piece of comic perfection. I understand that the release date comes in the fall. If it comes to your city and you want to see a movie that you think it's it. Aviva is great at it and he's definitely a future star - (Superbad is now where she is) - even all the actors seem to be perfectly calibrated. There is a tone set by this film that is used to surprise out. I wouldn't know what to call it - it's a comedy, but the captivating message is so fierce and straightforward that "comedy" is not enough for her. I love this movie. It's a thinking man's comedy. but even the phrase is not good enough. The FTF has a message and this message needs to be heard
