Hercules' son is terribly at risk of lion hunting, which is happening. Hercules (solid and engaging performance in the venerable Reg Park) must embark on a frightening and dangerous alternative dimension dominated by the evil and vengeful Gia Earth Goddess (the deliciously bad image of Gia Sandri) and the fight against various monsters to save the soul of his son. Meanwhile, Gia is the same ugly son of Antaius (Giovanni Cianfriglia's totally hateful turn) represents Hercules and takes over the city as a cruel and ruthless tyrant. Director Maurizo Lucidi combines this riveting story at a steady pace and keeps a serious tone in it. This film starts a little slower, but actually starts to cook as soon as Hercules enters the hazy and dangerous underground spirit of the world: Hercules, a humanoid lizard, Hercules a giant tree, and Hercules attacked by a haunting rotting tree, are major attractions. zombies. Better yet, the bizarre spiritual world just dusts up a spooky atmosphere (I have to love the persistent thick whirling mist!). Heavy rugged, invincible mano-a-mano great physical confrontation between Hercules and Antai also totally rocks. Of course we also get a great mondo destructo climactic volcanic eruption. Worldwide Widescreen Cinema Allvaro Mancori gives the film an impressively extensive sense of range. Ugo Filippini's robust, exciting score has a handy majestic sweep on it. Okay, so this movie is an obvious task that uses lots of footage from "Hercules in Haunted World" and "Hercules and The Captive Women", but it's still a very lively and fun game.
