Mike Nichols's "Charlie Wilson War", which was created in the 1980s, tells the story of the title character (played by Tom Hanks) by oppressing a secret war with Russia using Afghan forces. Of course we know how well it has done in the long run, but fortunately the film does not interfere with the unpleasant consequences. The cast is stellar, with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts one of the most popular stars in Hollywood. As a bonus, the versatile Philip Seymour Hoffman has a characteristically unforgettable support role for which he received an unjustifiable Oscar nomination. I'm not a very fan of Roberts, but Hanks is always reliable. However, I can't get into him like a drug-taking girl, even though the real Charlie Wilson seems as sympathetic as Hanks. Except for the big three, but not very interesting, even from a recognizable name like Amy Adams. The story is interesting and supported by the subtle script by Aaron Sorkin. The verbal interplay between the main characters is excellent and full of memories. Later events initiated by the war are not overlooked, although it seems to me that the book scenes that honor Wilson are too serious to have a bittersweet feeling that was probably intended. On the whole, Nichols' direction is hardworking and follows the scenario's activity admirably. This is a film that, like Charlie Wilson himself, has some drawbacks, but is still cheerful. Certainly recommended for fans of three stars and for those looking for an engaging political drama with a light feeling.
