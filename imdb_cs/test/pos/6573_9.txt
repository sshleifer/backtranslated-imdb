When I first saw the poster of this movie, I threw it out as another low-budget film focused on youth. After a few days, when he finally got to the theaters, one of my friends told me it was good. A year later, when I first saw the commercial, Anand was about to be aired on TV and the moment finally came when I switched channels and stopped to watch for a moment and I was watching the whole film. And now, 3 years later I would watch a movie at least 7-8 times and I really watch movies again and again !! This film is great because it tries to be different when all the movies in Telugu were composed of 6 songs and 4 fights. It's a simple movie, a little slow but very tight script, there are no free ends in the movie, very well-oriented dialogues that are really really hard. find by. Music is both a classic and soothing, great rendition of Radha Krishnan, some great kirtanas also come in bgmusic, through out the movie. Cinematography deserves to be mentioned. Editing is not neat but adequate for a romantic like this. But what really throws you away in this movie are two things - the first way each scene was processed with utmost respect, now the famous Shekar Kammula. 2. Beautiful texts by Veturi. And one more thing deserves special mention, Kamalini, the part of her success attributed to Sunitha, that we lend her such a beautiful voice, really tells you that the voice does the miracles of Me. Other actors are just as good, Raja in the title character and a little girl and the way he screams when he gets a new dog. Finally, I can tell you that this film is soon on its way to becoming another classic of the old classic romantic, along with Kammula another classic-romantic work by Godavari.
