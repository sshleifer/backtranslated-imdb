The best romantic comedy I've seen in years. It's not the slickest of the best Hollywood material by Ben Stiller or Adam Sandler and much less syrup than the Hugh Grant epic. Julianne Nicholson and Jay Mohr are perfectly cast and both provide a seamlessly professional performance as a committed couple who decided to spend some time sowing their sexual oats before the wedding. Instead of playing it strictly for laughter, the authors and the director invented a nice mix of human feelings and comedy. Nicholson is just great because the awkward seducer and Mohr do a great job as a man who reluctantly enters the game, but is soon enjoying a little too much of his flutes. We only see so many supporting characters as to round off the plot nicely without distracting from the main story. Especially good is Andy Richter (serious friend) and Helena Slater (single-mom excited). There is enough sense and emotional complexity to make it much more than a standard boy-girl farce. Indeed, with just a little better stimulation and a little bit of bigger cut, this movie would be the top ten comedy.
