Paul Bettany acted as a tortured father, whose favorite girl tragically dies of disease. For this he deserves all credit. However, the film was mostly about it, keeping Darwin's adventure as he garnered data for his theories as incomplete stories told children and skip entirely the controversies over his ideas. Two things worried me horribly: the soundtrack, with its soft sound, practically casting sadness to the viewer's throat, and a movie trailer that shows some beautiful scenery, his theological reflections and his wife and the enthusiasm of his best friends who are preparing for battle. against blind faith, making the film totally distorted. To put it bluntly, if it were necessary to remove the scenes from the movie trailer from the movie, the result would be an unwritten family drama about a small film. as a result, the child and the suffering of her parents die. It is not clear what I expected from the film about Darwin, although the film was beautifully interpreted.
