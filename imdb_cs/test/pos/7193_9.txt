Great combination: - Chabat's humor - the world of Uderzo / Goscinny and characters - the limited presence of Christian Clavier <br /> <br /> The original comic was a great - one of the best overall great series - and Alain Chabat, one of the best players. the funniest member of the famous French band Les Nuls was able to shoot, replicate and complement, great work goscinny and uderzo by cleverly pushing through the story and giving Djamel Debouze his best role (finally a bit far from his usual repeatable part), gathering a lot of great actors (Gerard darmon is amazing as often, Chabat himself is a great emperor). In addition to being obliged to keep up with Christian Clavier as Asterix, Chabat cleverly tuned his role in the film to give Darmon and Debouze ... a good idea! Great environment, great screenplay, great director, great actors, great humor, beautiful Cleopatra ... This movie would deserve 10 if Clavier wasn't bee n involvement.
