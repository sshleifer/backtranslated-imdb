Elizabeth Ashley receives phone calls from her nephew Michael - crying, screaming and asking for help. The problem is that Michael died 15 years ago. This film terribly scared me in 1972 when it aired on ABC. When we see it again, a few years later, STILL works. he must give peace. Elizabeth Ashley is great, Ben Gazzara is fine and it's fun to see Michael Douglas so young. And the phone calls are still frightening the living daylight from me. Actually, I had to turn on the light during one of them! Haunted Little TV Movie. Worth seeing.
