I was impressed by the latest production from Mick Molloy. As his fan, I was used to a different kind of humor than here. He wisely chose a softer, wider style of comedy in Crackerjack than his usual low brows and cheeks. Sometimes it is inconsistent and not-balanced, but a decent script works around it and does some fun viewing. Directed by Paul Moloney (who has directed almost every Australian TV series imaginable), Crackerjack tells the story of Jack Simpson, a guy who belongs to his local bowls club for the sole reason of parking. When the club is struggling with financial difficulties, it is forced to compete in an effort to raise funds to rescue the club before it becomes a haven for the poker machine. A well-known and successful formula that is well treated. There is no doubt that the film owes its success to the great Molloy casting. He seemed to have a great relationship with Samuel Johnson and excellent chemistry with Judith Lucy, and while the character doesn't seem to be far from his own personality, you can't help but why he didn't try his hand at the movie before. They support and often steal their scenes to exterminate the experienced cast, the beautiful Frank Wilson and Bill Hunter. They are two great actors, and the pairs ride their roles with ease. If it weren't for the huge success of 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding', Crackerjack would have done it at number 1 in the Australian box office, but when you think about what the movie is about and who's involved, even if it's done at 2 excellent effort. All in all, a funny, good movie. Great cast, great crew and great soundtrack combine one of the best Australian films of 2002. 7/10.
