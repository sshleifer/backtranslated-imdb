I was very impressed by the subtle power of this film and the mood he created. I think there should be a lot more credit than it was. I agree that she should be nominated by Michelle Pfeiffer, but I think all performances were excellent, and that Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange portrayed deep affinity and nurse conflicts with great emotional depth and sensitivity. Although I did not read the book, I found the modern concept of King Lear very cool. I will never look at the game again anyway!
