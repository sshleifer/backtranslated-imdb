I saw this film as a child and I long to see it again. survived? I discounted the 1980 version as a fluff. I'm sure there are a lot of people who don't feel they need to keep these movies. It's so unfortunate to discover a lost gem after it's gone. Young people today are not aware of the hallucinatory quality and impact on the life of a film that is seen at an early age. This film, the "Blue Lagoon", influenced me. How many of us wanted us to be in a place that was removed from the fear and chaos of the modern world. It was an idyllic story of a boy and a girl who were on a tropical island. there are some problems, but they will fall in love and have a baby. Life should be so simple and beautiful.
