I think Vanessa Marcil is the best cast actor. She makes Sam one of the best characters on the show. James Cann is also pretty good. I love it when he was worried about Delinda. One of my favorite scenes when Ed and Delinda beat a guy's crap. That was funny. Nikki Cox is also good and has great chemistry with Josh Duhamel. Lara Flynn Boyle was a wonderful guest. I wish he didn't kill her. The show has a great cast without bad actors, which is not something you often see on TV. I still think Vanessa Marcil is the best. She should have had Emmy in my opinion. It's a shame that the show was canceled
