I watched many short films in my day. Often I consider them too compressed (too much information on the viewer in a short time to run), too "wind", or lack of clear vision. I can't say anything about Starcrossed. In this review, I will do my best to avoid any dramatic spoiler, but I also assume that the reader understands that the theme of this film is fraternal incest. <br /> <br /> As with any short film, The Story is quite simple, straightforward and easy to digest. It is clear that the film is trying to light up the light of one of the most endangered taboos of modern society. This film will succeed in every respect. Fifteen minutes of running, I found myself feeling like I had a sense of emotion. With little dialogue, the viewer is quickly drawn into the most personal moments and thoughts of these stellar brothers. From the early scene in early childhood you can see very close relationship brothers have. When the film progresses to the present in the next scene, the outstanding acting and honest, cordial presentation reminds the viewer that love can come unexpectedly and cruelly. As this relationship progresses, any resistance the viewer initially feels is quickly replaced by sympathy and emotional anxiety because the viewer suddenly realizes that there can be only one possible solution. And the consequences of this distinction are heartbreaking. Everyone who has an open mind would look at this film well and absorb its message. If nothing else, he boldly and frankly invites the viewer to re-examine some of our deepest beliefs about the shameful and mysterious taboo of incest. Although the film is only fifteen minutes long, it resonates in the viewer long after credits are credited. This is perhaps my favorite short movie I've ever seen. I can't recommend it.
