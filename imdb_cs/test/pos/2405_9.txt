It took them 4 attempts, but they did it right! In this 4th sequel to Karate Kid Franchise, producers really hit the home run! Above all, I applaud them for finally getting rid of Ralph Macchio. I felt he never helped the Karate Kid service. I'd rather see Danny 'Ralph Mouth' Bridge in this role. Macchio found out what turned out to be the best movie in the series, and see where his career is now! Instead they gave a girl! They got Hillary Swank, best known for playing different parts of the sheman in each movie's in. I personally don't care about her buck teeth, but that's personal preference. But still, as Karate Kid 4 started her career in orbit! She won the freakin Oscar. Christmas Jiminey! Meanwhile, where is Ralphy? He should give some amateur porn tape like Screech or something. By the way, my only disagreement with the film is that they have a girl who does karate. As a self-appointed master of Karate, I have been the proud owner of a white belt in the last 8 5/8 years. The first thing they taught me is that there's no place in any of the girls' martial arts ... but except for Jud ... but that's a little gay. So for the sake of precision, I think they should meet another man for this role. Maybe I was thinking about Dennis Franz. He would give the role the depth it requires. Maybe they will listen to my suggestions and make the right adjustments in Karate Kid 5. His too Pat Marita is no longer. I thought Justin Guarini was the perfect replacement for a nice Asian colleague, Mr. Miyagi. He puts a "wax on wax off" a whole new meaning. HAHAHAHAHAHA funny huh? By the way, if you're looking for an exciting movie full of Karate and the triumph of the human spirit, Karate Kid 4 is for you. Don't waste time with 1-3. This is the Karate Kid for you! This is the Karate Kid for Ever!
