For a short while. The opening scene with Traci Lords and techno bar <br /> <br /> is incredible. I would probably follow her to my final death! The best vampire movie ever, but with a twist. Combat scenes are amazing. Wesley Snipes shows the athletics you don't see every day. And Stephen Dorff is impressive and very believable as an ambitious new recruitment that moves through the hierarchy by any means. Great movie 9/10. Where is Blade II?
