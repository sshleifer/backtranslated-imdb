This film proves that the world is too often an unfair place, especially the world of movies. "The Assignment" has barely received any attention to its release and is not surprisingly flopped at the box office, but when history is written this film will certainly receive some long lost praise. <br /> <br /> Thank God I 'm surrounded by friends who know what' s good for me. Being a movie enthusiast like me, buddy recommended "Task", a movie I didn't even hear about. I decided to find out what Leonard Maltin gave him, and no wonder he gave it 1/2. Knowing this is the same grade he gave classics like "Alien", "Common Suspect" and "Matrix" (I You You Not You Are) I knew its meaning doesn't mean it would make a squat jack with ** *. So without hesitation, I went out and bought it on DVD. That was about 3 years ago and the movie is still one of my nicest things in my DVD collection, despite the cover design that reflects the low budget stinker with Casper Van Dien. "Task" is professionally directed, bringing some really intense moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie, in addition to boasting an admirable story that you know will be riddled with unexpected twists and turns. He plays Aidan Quinn in one of his best performances and serves him with great support from Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley, both of whom are in great shape. Something like 40 out of 42 user comments like this movie, most of them can't praise it enough. So what are you waiting for? If you call a fan of action thrillers, you should buy it, rent it, see it Yesterday!
