This was one of my favorites as a child. My family had an 8-way soundtrack! It took us years (until I was 20) to get a movie from the movie (my dad recorded it from HBO or something). Every summer, when we go to the beach (my mom, brother, sister and I), we were lying on the beach singing all the songs from this movie !!! MILOVAL TO !!!
