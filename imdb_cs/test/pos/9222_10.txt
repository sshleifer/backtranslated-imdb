when I was a kid, it was a movie I watched. I think it's a great movie for kids to watch and parents don't have to worry about any violence or obscene pictures. Rainbow Brite is a cheerful young girl and she is trying to make winter go away. they find that something or someone is trying to steal the source of life and keep it for themselves. I love this movie and I think even adults can enjoy this movie.
