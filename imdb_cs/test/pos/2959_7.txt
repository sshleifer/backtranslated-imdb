Lone Ranger and Tonto set out to court a band of robbers who killed three Indians for what seemed to be initially for no apparent reason. the man had a medallion. The five medallions Tomache handed over to his friends as gifts we later learned when they united will provide the Capuchin Master with a map with the legendary lost gold city. Can the Lone Ranger protect the remaining two individuals who hold medallions before the hooded robbers surrender to it? Is there a lost city of gold somewhere in the native country? When I watched it, I knew what was going to happen sooner, and everything seemed really familiar until I realized I saw the same movie when I was a kid. And I remembered that I enjoyed quite a fun time as a child who enjoys this with a bunch of my friends. As an adult though, the plot is somewhat predictable, but you know this, while not entirely in the same league as the 1956 film, remains a lot of fun to watch. Clayton Moore is perfect as Lone Ranger and Jay Silverwheels, as Tonto steals a lot of this movie because it's probably in more action than the Lone Ranger. There are very familiar faces at hand, including Douglas Kennedy like Ross Brady, the gang-hooded gang commander, Charles Watts as the bigoted sheriff and Ralph Moody as the kindly Padre.
