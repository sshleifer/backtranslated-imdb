many people said that this film was not a good movie, I agree in horror, it wasn't very scary, it had some terrible ways of torturing yes (hooks, where shouldn't), but not scary. but it was a good comedy movie, I thought it was merry, such a bad dee snider with his stupid theological questioning, and every second word he said came out as "what is _____, define ___" then an angry mob in his house with one of them holding a sign saying "we won't take it" (which is a song from his sister twisted band, but I think the part that made me laugh was the woman who was dead) and dee snider her he held and danced when I saw that I broke out in tears ... so I wouldn't recommend it for horror lovers, but for those who love horror for their comedy I recommend this movie 100%
