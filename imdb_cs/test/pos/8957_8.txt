I bought this movie from my local 99p blockbuster that I sat in my video library for at least a year. Tonight I decided to see it, the film was completely different from what I was expecting, and there was no humor I could see in it, it was a bleak look at people who engage in love relationships sexual orientation, I really do not see a plot of a psycho killer who really makes sense, except that he adds tension to the end of the movie. I felt that someone who played a lesbian woman did a great job. I watched her emotions and what happened around her. Some people would probably see some of the things that makes them funny, but I could really put in her place, loving someone, but they refuse you at every turn no matter how hard you are trying. I thought it was a very moving movie and was well concerned with all the different sexuality. I expected something like Bound & Gagged: A love story, but that's a very different movie. Not for bigots.
