Overall, Daddy's military film is very entertaining, though humor is not as catchy and sparkling as it is on TV and radio. So where do viewers leave us? If you've never seen Dad's army, then the movie is a good way to get closer to speed and get to the crazy world of Walmington o / S. The downside is that you don't have to "get it" because, as I said, the film's humor is a bit on the solid side. <br /> <br /> For dad's army movie enthusiasts have nothing new as the story is more or less a notch of the TV series, but it's a unique chance to see your favorite in "high def" compared to the clumsy quality of BBC videos. The film also includes a must be lamest holdup sequence in the history of the universe. But I can't decide if it's positive or negative.
