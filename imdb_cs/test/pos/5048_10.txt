This is FANTASTIC. Hana is a very old boy with a very young heart. He knows how to live his life in everyday life by joining his friend who makes fun of almost everything, even his own death. Though his wife cannot deal with her "irresponsible" behavior, she also knows that this is exactly why she loves her husband for nearly half a century. I'd like to meet this old man because he knows how to enjoy life and never be afraid of death. He is joyful, witty, malevolent and never boring. Vlastimil Brodsk√Ω played Hanu greatly at the age of 79. Every view from his eyes and every move from his aging muscles brings the viewer so much about character. This is a movie that leaves a big smile on my face, and it kind of caresses me. Tomorrow I'll go buy a house and have fun. If Han can, then I can. But I think I'll skip the smoking section.
