Ugh what yesterday's episode! It was one failed script for "ABC Afterschool Special", or the product of a serious novice writer, just out of college, making homage to that classic PC anti-homily weapon from 1974, "The Gun". In fact, they were disappointed and disappointed that the final shot was not the weapon that had been melted like in a movie! No, I'm not some NRA shill. It is only when a producer of intelligent and nuanced series gets him in the head that I should be subjected to a didactic dramatization of his personal cause, I would appreciate it if at least the 2-by-4 Geez! OK, the sociology lesson is over. The message was delivered. An important episode was broadcast. Now let's go back to some fun episodes that try to respect our intelligence.
