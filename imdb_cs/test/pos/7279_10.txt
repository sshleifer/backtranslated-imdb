Wow, I loved this movie, this movie was full of conspiracy, good acting, great story and surprising end. To be absolutely honest, this movie wasn't too cruel, but it contains some gore, but it was rather psychological. I read it on the Internet: the movie cost $ 3,000 and was shot in 8 days. Amazing!!! This is for someone who wants to think and love great filmmaking. What starts as a terrorizing thriller is slowly turning into something somewhat twisted, even a little more sinister. There is not much I can say without giving away the points that this film has exceeded my expectations
