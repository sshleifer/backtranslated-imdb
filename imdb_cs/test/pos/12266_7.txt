Necessary tracking for anyone watching TV news because it can help to become a little more skeptical, even cynical. On a personal note I remember that a few years ago I took a course on television - what to do, what to do. The course teachers were impressed by the fact that TV news is a "show-biz affiliate". This depressing view, which is probably even more valid today than when it was made, is reinforced by this film. No matter what the journalistic integrity, what counts is the ability to look good and smile nicely. And make sure you don't sweat on the camera. The interaction between the three main characters is a center piece, each with its own ambitions, abilities, and beliefs. Brooks takes these differences and sets them into an unstable TV news studio environment and adds more than a hint of love to the mix. The result is a complex, though somewhat elongated, display of how we compromise every day to fulfill our ambitions and take others with us. It's always fun, even though the final scene might have been unnecessary because of everything that was before.
