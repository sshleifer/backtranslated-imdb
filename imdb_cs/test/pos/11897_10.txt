This film was a modern day scarface.It was on my fingers. This film is one of those rare epic movies that you want to continue. out. The only thing I didn't like was the backstage because it didn't show the intensity of the movie, and I'd like to see less narrative scenes. is in my top ten movies of all time. \ tPlus acting was great there wasn't a bad scene in the movie, I loved it, Jennifer Tilly was perfect as well as all the cast. He must see it.
