A beautiful film, cleverly filmed with eyes in the details of the war era and (given that it is set during World War II), minimal violence. Small cast joins the emotional journey of occupation of Czechoslovakia, separating them from loved ones as pilots leaving for England (separation from cocker spaniels touches hearts), spitfire scene, love, friendship and betrayal. The theme of betrayal goes deep through the film, from the betrayal of love, to the betrayal of friendship and ultimately the betrayal that the communist regime has shown to former RAF pilots. <br /> <br /> Desperately sad film, all the more so because it's so accurate. I would recommend it to everyone.
