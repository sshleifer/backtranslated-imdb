I know almost nothing about rugby, so even though I found out that the rugby-aspect of this movie is interesting, it could be any kind of sport and I think I would enjoy it as well. The fact that rugby meant nothing better or worse to me. What made this film great is the story itself, based on real events that have happened over the last 30 years. Highland Rugby Club. The Gelwix coach is the kind of coach most parents would want their children to have someone who cares for him more than sports (even if they won 17 national championships and have lost only 9 games in the last 30 years!). The more I learned about the coach and the team, the more I like this movie and its message. I've seen other sports movies that seemed to be great at first, but then I looked into the details to find that most of those movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with 10% of the facts being very exaggerative. Not with Forever Strong. It may seem too good to be true, but that's amazing. If it were fiction, it would be a pleasant story and nothing more. Instead, the movie is inspiring and makes you want to be a better person. Don't miss this movie because of some negative reviews by professional critics. I read some of their reviews and most of them gave the film terrible reviews. These are generally the same critics who swear about the movies most people hate. In fact, I would be afraid if some of these critics gave the film good reviews because I almost always disagreed with their views. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and send a review (positive or negative)! Nowadays, most viewers' reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites) and I'm interested to see if this trend continues. Thanks!
