I first heard of Begotten when my girlfriend picked him up in the "cult classics" section of my local video seller. She knew I liked obscure artsy films so I rented them and brought them home. I sat on my TV for a few days and then put it in the VCR just before bedtime. I thought I might see what it was, and then I spend more time on it the next day. It followed that it actually woke me up. I sat the whole movie and loved it. After I went through the final credits, I saw it again. Only after you see the final credits will you get an idea of ​​who is who. After you know that you can follow again with renewed awards. Don't listen to the people who tear this movie. It's not for everyone. If you are someone who does not like reading subtitles before this movie is not for you (not that there are subtitles, there is no dialogue). If you are someone who actually owns Rush Hour 2, then this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> This film is truly original and inspiring. What other movies have never done. It looks like nothing else and is bolder than everything out there - from 1989 to this day. You can say that everyone who is involved in the creation of this film really loves the art of what they do and understands what can be captured in the form of a film. <br /> <br /> If you want to be "fun," then the movie isn't for you. However, it is pure escapism in some extreme way and in the form of a movie. It's as if someone has attached wires to my head and recorded one of my worst nightmares. But this nightmare makes sense, if you really sit and watch pictures, you break the action of the actors and don't sit there to passively fit your guitar but watch and flicker. People compare it with rubber but Begotten is much more. I'm not saying when it's my favorite movie. It's an important film, visually stimulating, mechanically inspiring and hypnotic. One review I read is very true, "no one gets through Begotten without being tagged."
