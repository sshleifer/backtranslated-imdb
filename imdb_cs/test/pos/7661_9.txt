Hercules Avenger is by far the best single item in the musical genre I remember. Critics' accusations - this is the cut and paste of two previous Hercules films, with some new material added to make it look fresh - the fact that this cutting and insertion approach is solved by one of the central issues of sword films and sandals. For most of these films, the middle third is sweeping - usually a kindly love story or mysterious political intrigue, or both (the queen falls in love with Hercules and her evil brother against them, etc.) to watch the exciting finale. Hercules Avenger cuts off all the crap from the source films and adds a rather sharp story of hercules, who is embarking on bullying their way into power. (It should be noted that this episode also functions as a distant but sharply critical note on the rise of fascism in Italy.) This also sets up a fine final wrasslin 'struggle between the actual Hercules and his impersonator. In a narrower focus, I could also add that other edits have improved individual scenes borrowed from other films. For my money, the scene of rebellion is much better than it first appeared in Hercules and Captive Women, because it was tightened by reducing several characters and their conspiracy complications. There are also monster floppy disks, a spooky underworld atmosphere borrowed (literally) by Mario Bava, the whole city ruined, and the usual number of beautiful babes in revealing clothes. Since no one expects any of these films to compete with The Seven Samurai - or even The Magnificent Seven - it seems a little picky to keep a movie from other movies against it.
