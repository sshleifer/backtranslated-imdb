I remember seeing this movie in the mid-1980s when he thought it was a good walking and well-played piece. Now I work quite often at Berkeley Square and I had to get a copy of the DVD to remind myself how little the area has changed, even though my office is just 30 seconds away from the "bank." Even Jack Barclays still sells Bentleys and Rolls Royces. It seems like the DVD is coming soon because of Region 2 release. The copy of Region 1 is very poor. Hopefully they cleaned it up. Only a slightly risky escape sequence from the court spoils what would otherwise be a great movie, but I think it's in line with the caper tag.
