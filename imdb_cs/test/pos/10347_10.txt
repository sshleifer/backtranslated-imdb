Recovery is an incredibly moving job, managing the devastating effects of brain injury not only on individuals but on the whole family. Without resorting to preaching or Hollywood's slanting end, the drama of Tony Marchant represents a realistic family in crisis. The highest praise is David Tennant and Sarah Parish for incredible performances. Before I watched the drama, I assumed some of their previous relationships on the screen in Blackpool would go through-- but it never would. Neither of the actors is recognizable from any previous work, and neither of them have been seen as actors playing the role for 90 minutes. In addition, the performance of Harry Treadaway as a son at the beginning of his university life was fantastic - he shows the torn nature of a teenage boy thrown into the unwavering role of a man in the house, at times, almost every character in the drama is unsympathetic. As a spectator, I wanted to give each of them a good punch to wake up to reality, stop moping and begin to adapt to rotting, but very current changes in their lives. But under the same circumstances he acts like any one of them - switching between trying to show a stiff upper lip to despair to escape into something, including behavior that is completely different from each other. It is the greatest strength of the show - true, without sugar, to make us all think about what we can do under the same circumstances. <br /> <br /> This is difficult, but you have to watch the show. I hope this will be somehow shown in the US
