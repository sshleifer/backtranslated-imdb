RAINBOW BRITE AND STAR STEALER are, in my opinion, an excellent masterpiece. I felt warmly and tingly when Rainbow Brite (the voice of Bettina) and Krys (the voice of David Mendenhall) took revenge on the princess (Rhonad Aldrich's voice). If you ask me, the princess was absolutely ugly and devilish. She deserved for me Rainbow Brite and Krys to avenge him. However, I liked her castle as well as the rest of the setting. In addition, I thought that Lurky (of the Pat Fraley) and Murky (of Peter Cullen) were devilish. Before I packed it, I'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the direction was flawless and Disney scored a big hit. Finally, I recommend this excellent masterpiece to anyone who has not seen it, especially hard fans of the TV series. I guarantee you will enjoy it.
