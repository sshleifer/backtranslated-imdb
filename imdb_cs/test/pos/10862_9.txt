This beautiful 3-piece BBC production is one of the sweetest love stories I've ever seen. Actresses show a very high level of talent, especially Rachael Stirling as Nan Astley. She is funny, seductive and cute. Loving scenes and close kisses are very erotic regardless of sexual preferences. <br /> <br /> The characters are well defined and very believable. I think this is a by-product of a good adaptation from a well-written novel. A really remarkable dramatic track that quickly gains speed after a few boring (but necessary) scenes at the beginning. . My vote: 9/10
