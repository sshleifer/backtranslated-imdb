Well, this movie came on workday at 23:00. The cute little actress who played Billy caught me in the beginning and after fifteen minutes I was held captive on my television until the very end. He has you on the edge of his seat, then throws smart pieces of comedy during the most tense sequences. The only return is that the story was not significant enough to fill an hour and a half of the film. , causing some sequences to stretch little. However, it was still very fun, and I recommended it to all my co-workers the next day.
