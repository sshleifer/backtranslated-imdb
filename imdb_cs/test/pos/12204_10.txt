This is the first sci fi series that I really became a Star Trek addict (and I haven't seen Trek in years). It takes the topic of invasion in somewhat different directions, but has done it in a very exciting way. It also borrows from a soap opera format, where it continues the arc throughout the year of the series run. Certainly, CGI will not overcome conspiracies or characters, except Nim, a nascent animal that is a pet with a certain attitude. (Anything that shows what he really thinks of a neighbor's yippy dog ​​is A-1 in my book.) It was a brilliant move. I'm at the end of the finals where I ask (intelligent, hopeful) and running my fingers and fingers that NBC or someone else (maybe Sci Fi) will continue the series and answer these questions. <br /> <br /> Really great, elegant show.
