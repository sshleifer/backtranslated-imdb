78 years ago ... premiere of "Anna Christie" advertised by the slogan "Garbo Talks!" The film runs for 16 minutes and the audience reaches the peak of curiosity: Greta enters the bar and passes the long-awaited transfer from silence to sound: she closed the silent era for a few seconds and finally Greta Garbo tells the historical line: "Give me whiskey, ginger ale and don't be stingy, baby! " "Anna Christie" (1930) is a film by Clarence Brown who introduced Greta Garbo's great silent star to interviews. Nowadays we can imagine what a serious transfer it was for actors and actresses. The career of many of them has been forced to end - something we hardly ever meet at all. And it was no coincidence that it was Clarence Brown who was the first to talk to Swedish beauty talkies. Garbo believed the director after two of his great silent productions, FLESH AND DEVIL (1926) and WOMEN OF AGEs (1928): films that reached the box office of broken success, both with Garbo in the lead. But we are in 2008 and this fact about the film, now purely historical, seems less important. The question for today's viewer is not what Garbo's voice sounds, but if the film is still observable after these 78 years. In other words, we all try to answer the question of whether the film passed the time test. It has? When I watched him recently, I came to the conclusion that in addition to a few small technical aspects, including a static camera, "Anna Christie" is still very fun. It is, on the one hand, an amazing story about the life, the fact that a young woman is standing (based on the play of Eugen O "Neill") and, on the other hand, the artistic expression of true grandeur in the area Can I analyze these two aspects in separate paragraphs. <br /> CONTENT: Chris Christopherson (George F Marion), a heavy drinker who lives in a ship on a ship, is grieved, pleased with the letter of his daughter Anna (Garbo), whom he has not seen for 15 years, says he returns and starts to change things better, forgetting that his daughter is no longer a child without experience, but a 23-year-old woman who has been through various things on a farm in Minnessota, where she has lived and worked, forgets that she has the right to accept another kind of male love in her life ... This brief presentation of the content not from the point of view of the main charity But the one introduced to us before Anna (her father Chris) realizes how universal it is. letter from the entire text, which seems to be life, not after all these years is cleared. The cases discussed here in 1930 are still valid and meaningful ... <br /> <br /> performance. There are not many characters in the film, but there are really two in roles. It is, of course, Greta Garbo herself, who has done something extraordinary in her fifteen-year-old phenomenon, a presence that strongly marked the history of early film (something I have already mentioned in many of my previous remarks on her films). But Garbo is a little different. I admit that there are times in this film when she feels uncomfortable with her role. This is probably due to her new experience of sound in English; however, its performance is always true and unique. But that's what everyone expected from Garbo. The real surprise for the film for 1930 viewers and for us is Marie Dressler as Martha. She is excellent in her facial expressions, in her accent, in the full view of a woman looking at life from the "hitting the bottle". Her best moments include an interview with Anna Christie at the bar, preceded by her cheerful conversation with Chris. The rest of the support cast is fine, but it's nothing at all (here's the German version). Especially Dressler, with the exception of Garbo, is a perfect choice. If you asked me what I like about "Anna Christie" today, that's what I would say: it's a classic movie. But at the end I have to mention one more thing. It's humor, a wonderful joke that is evident around the world. Although the content is very serious and "Anna Christie" in no way carries a comic spirit (the only Garbo comedy was NINOTCHKA), there are times when you split your parties. For example, don't miss Anna and Matt in the amusement park, especially in the restaurant, where she orders milk to think how virtuous and innocent she is, beer for herself and where Martha joins them suddenly ... <Br /> "Anna Christie" is a perfect movie for classic enthusiasts and has to take care of everyone at least a little bit more about the real beauty of performance. If you have enough of the modern stars, look for such movies and you will be satisfied. Very worth your search! <br /> <br /> Skaal Greta Garbo! Skaal Marie Dressler! Let's drink a toast to the great work you have in the movie! Skaal after all those years when wine tastes much better and your spirit is with us in a different sense ...
