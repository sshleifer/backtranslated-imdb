When I first saw this film, I was very impressed with what kind of atmosphere the director was creating. It is also very interesting to see how he imagines the near future in 1974. If you see a film, you will see a lot of sets and habits we call today freaky and modern. The topic of the film deals with the old question "What is real and what is illusion?". If you see "Matrix", you'll find lots of similarities. However, both films are not at all comparable because "Welt am Draht" is an art and "Matrix" is fun. If you prefer first. Unfortunately I lost my video copy. <br /> <br />
