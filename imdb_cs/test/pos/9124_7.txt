Meville's film is not as good as his most famous film, deliciously stylish "Le Samourai (1968)". I don't even think it's the best example of a very beloved subist. The main thing against the film is its long running time. Meville has this tendency to focus on too many tiny details. He could tell the same story in a relatively short time, but for reasons I don't understand, the film seems to go on and on. Still, the movie is never boring. Melville's impression impressed me and the cast is very good, especially Alain Delon as a very "cool" master thief. The film must see color photography is a great asset and Melville uses the sound (or lack of sound) in a very effective way. From a technical point of view, the film is virtually flawless. Sometimes one gets the feeling that Meville is just showing off, but when someone is so talented, he has little reason to complain. I still like other Jules Dassin's "Topkapi" (1964) just to name it, but there's no doubt that this movie is a good piece of fun and a good example of what people refer to as a "cool" cinema.
