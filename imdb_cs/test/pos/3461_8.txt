I was surprised and touched on this emotional film, which moved me very strangely. At the same time, I was confused, sad and happy. I think less people will pay attention to this film. But I hope at least a few of them see it and get some of it. The story of two of their friends is suffering from a physical disability, which (as a team) defeated the medical pricing system and fought for its rights. This film shows a side that some of us will never understand, not overly exaggerated, but emotionally presented. Hopefully this film will help us to better understand some of their desires and to realize how important it is to have a friend in the world, especially when you hardly can express that fact.
