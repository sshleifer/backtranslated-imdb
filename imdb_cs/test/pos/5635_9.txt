When we are young, we all choose the ideal profession for ourselves: artists, actors, writers, rocket scientists, etc. While most of us grow up from our dreams, the main character of American film Mark, he has released his (and also in thirty): to become a richly acclaimed director. Despite the fact that Murphy's law does not leave Mark alone and something seems wrong, Mark is able to persevere in every deterrent incident with even greater efforts to achieve his goals. His desire to be a director controls his character, which he sees in his life any person or something that he can use to achieve his goal. Although I have noticed that other IMDB commentators are Marmbard selfishness, I think it is almost a legitimate kind of selfishness, because for Mark, when he doesn't become a famous director, it's the equivalent of death. He constantly talks about leaving a mark in the world, and he sees filmmaking as a way to do it. Unfortunately, no viewer of this film soon takes into account the fact that Mark has a near-zero chance of achieving his dream. Is he aware of this? No, not in the least, and none of his family or friends wants to keep him secret (in fact, even some of them believe in him). Surprisingly, however, the unsatisfactory future that the viewer feels will certainly not happen to Mark, does not interfere with the ability to find humor in the film. This is a very funny documentary. Most of the laughter comes when Mark is filming scenes for "Coven". There's a scene where an actor has to break his head with a locker and just doesn't work. Another scene has Mark a very old uncle Bill saying a few lines to camera; Needless to say, after 20 seconds of lots of headcratching and line-stumbling, Bill finally decides he has enough. Unfortunately, a lot of humor comes from Mark himself. His script, which seems to be worthy of Pulitzer, is ridiculously bad: "It's okay, it's okay, there's something he could live for, Jesus told me." <br /> <br "American film" is, unlike what people think, a document that everyone can enjoy (although my sister who was watching some scenes seemed to think it was totally bizarre). The fact that Chris Smith can successfully bring a screen to the screen that inspires both the sadness of Mark's depressing lifestyle to the merriment with the scenes with Bill (who unfortunately died before the film was released) says quite a lot about him. I wonder how this documentary dreams about this dreamer. Does he realize he's throwing him in the wrong light? Or is he going to show him as a fool in many movie scenes? Or does he see it as something to appear in front of his own A&E Biography segment? It is an interesting subject of wonder, and I hope the other one will be true to him once. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie: 9/10.
