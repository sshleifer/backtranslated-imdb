Robust David Innes (solid Doug McClure) and Dr. Abner Perry (wonderfully dotty by Peter Cushing) waggling their way into the Earth's core in their machine. The duo discovers the ancient prehistoric world inhabited by dangerous gigantic animals and human beings who are used as food and slaves to evil telepathic pterodactyls. Director Kevin Conner, working from the blithely silly Milton Subotski scenario, keeps pace fast and treats the extremely foolish premise with stunning seriousness, giving this picture a clumsy, serious quality that is fun and cute. Notably hokey (not so) special effects are quite (unintentionally) humorous. Especially a raw line of created animals is positively stranplitting: crunchy guys-in-obvious-delicate-rubber-suits pterodactyl men, equally rinky-dink wild monkey-man brutes, and cheerfully ridiculous fire-belching frog thing that blows really good. One of the most noticeable cracks is when McClure mixes it with a thick and clumsy giant reptile. Another priceless scene depicts a dinosaur gripping a doll in the pressure jaws. In addition, we also get some excitement and boring slave revolts. It's an absolute tribute to seeing Cushing cheerfully punctuating it in a rare wide comedy section and becoming an unlikely but enthusiastic arrow-slinging action hero in the last third of the film. Caroline Munro, who is curious, looks positively wonderful as Princess Dia, and there are nice supportive shots of Cy Grant as brave warrior Ra and Sean Lynch as a treacherous coward Hoojah. Mike Vickers' neatly varied scores alternate between genre orchestral music and an erratic synthesizer. Alan Hume's sharp cinematography adds shine to infectious spread. Complete campy revolt.
