and there is not much in cinema history. "Rouge" seems a little hopeful. Hope in humanity and life. But just to say it can be naive. Kieslowski could find the right way to tell the story of this angry judge and a 20-year-old but wise model. Maybe the old and unsatisfactory love affair won't be repeated - it's a new couple with a young judge after the accident. But what to say about this camera master? You can't miss a second movie because you have to watch each of those faces. Kieslowski loved human beings and this is quite evident in the way the camera handles actors. Mrs Jacob and Mr Tringtignant are perfect It is not only this film, but also "Down's life" and "The story of love", which can think about contemporary film as a way of expressing the artist's point of view. Skoda American public - the average person has not seen these films. At least they're not in Maltin's dictionary. And even Baseline doesn't know what to say about this unique person. abel posadas
