What can be said about a film that originated at a time of such colorless emptiness, social indifference and authoritarian satisfaction. Cassevettes' first major independent film was not the immediate success of the box office and still did not receive the critical attention it deserves. I compare this wave of American independent projects, which consist of "Beat" filmmakers, such as Robert Frank and Harry Smith, with a growing scene emerging in Paris in the late 1950s known as the New French Wave. discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering American cultural superiority; Even at this stage, this strange, very spontaneous brand of filmmaker fought against the emergence of such political lexicons and fanatics that kept the development of art at bay in the mid-twentieth century. Cassevettes explores racial relationships and portrays a man as weak in the face of love because we, as a culture, are blinded by our own racial bias and prejudice. The great element for most of Cassevettes' work is that his films have an almost reverse minimalist effect; the mental response is triggered by subtle character relationships, not so many images. That is why his work seems to persist because he has a more intimate approach to defining characters that rely less on explicit actions and more on interpretation. Although my favorite movie Cassevettes is 'Married', this is its most important.
