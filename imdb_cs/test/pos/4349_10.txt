I think it certainly is. Writing is so good that English beginners should model their conversations after the conversation. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey (Bronson) and Mrs. Kathryn Davis (Deborah Raffin) (more about this character later) is very clear and to the point: Mrs. Davis says: "I hope you like the chicken. what I know how to do ", which Kersey deftly answers," Chicken is good. I like chicken. "If it's not an English grammar 101, I don't know what it is. Another thing about this Mrs. Davis character: Kersey sleeps with her the next day after she gets a good fit for him and tells him he wants to see him "last time" (that's just the fourth time when they met) before moving to her sister's house in Binghamton, New York to get away from the reptiles; then she really doesn't even drown her eye while her body burns down the street a few minutes later. Kersey will never even tell his first name through the film. Not even once. Never give up, Katy, or "That's a nice dress you're wearing, Kathryn" or "Be careful, Katie, or the horrors you get!" 'Love' evolves between the two, Fraker (Gavan O'Herlihy) keeps eyes on them. It's almost as if Kersey used her as bait to get to Fraker, just like he uses a camera or a car. Sure, when Fraker bites, Kersey bites hard ... in the most amazing sequence of events ever captured by film! Perhaps the last fifteen minutes have only been competing in the last thirty minutes of Delta Force in their brilliance. And that gives Delta Force a lot of credit. In what other movie do you see Ed Lauter to marry Alex Winter to win Charles Bronson's back, a troubled gang leader who is apparently calling a hotline to call neo-Nazi cyclists to come to his aid, and the quick Broadway dancers who wear halter tops . featuring as street punks, all laid on the soundtrack written by no one but Jimmy Page. If it's not the tallest of high comedy, then there's nothing funny. In truth, there are thousands of ways to introduce the unintentional Death Wish 3 comedy, but the only way to truly understand is to watch it and judge it yourself.
