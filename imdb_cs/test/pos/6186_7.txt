A few years ago, when the premarital covenants became a regular thing, Ernst Lubitsch created the comedy they are based on. Bluebeard's eighth wife includes Gary Cooper as a multi-millionaire living on the French Riviera who was married seven times and now married Claudette Colbert. But Cooper is a good sport about it, always settling with his former women for $ 50,000.00 a year under an agreement he signs before he marries him. It sounds like what we now call pre-marriage contract. Of course, Claudette wants a lot more than that, and she thinks Cooper is just like a business approach to marriage. She would like the real deal and is willing to go to a great extent to get it. Bluebeard's Eighth, eighth wife, has some really fun moments, the original meeting of Cooper and Cooper in the men's shop where Cooper is. insists he only wants pajama tops and Colbert is looking for the bottom. And of course my favorite is Colbert and blackmail of Detective Cooper to reveal her. Herman Bing has the best supporting role in the film as that of selfsame, a flustered detective. Often I was wondering how back in the day that Hollywood could get away with casting so many people who are non-French in the movie like that. Of course Cooper's American and Colbert Cast is the only actually French background. Although David Niven is charming, as always, when he is a Frenchman, he is ridiculous, he is sooooooo British. Nevertheless, the eighth wife of Bluebeard is an entertaining movie and a great example of what was called Lubitsch touch. back in the day.
