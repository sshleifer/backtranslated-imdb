"Student Nurses" is an excellent film that deals with four women linked by friendship and career. For the first time it is possible to see a realistic representation of relationships within the workplace, outside the workplace, the risks of these relationships and the consequences. The film also offers a rare chance to see the veteran scene and television actress Katherine "Scottie" MacGregor as a nurse instructor, "Miss Boswell." Mrs. MacGregor is best known for her performance as "Mrs. Oleson" in the TV series "Little House on the Prairie". The direction, music and color of the print are very good, as is the introductory theme of Clancy B. Grass, III. This film offers a rare opportunity for those who like themes in the late 1960s and early 1970s, offering a "softer side of life" and at the same time appreciating the beauty of the female.
