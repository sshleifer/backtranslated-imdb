Shtrafbat is a story that the Russians could tell about World War II. The biggest front of the conflict was, ironically, the least appearing topic on the silver screen after the war. While the Western Allies' war effort was seen in almost all possible details and ways, the exit was left out or the work was left to some old propaganda films other than the historical value of the shot. There is no chance that Shtrafbat could compete with the Band of Brothers in every detail, but neither do you want to watch the screen examining the tiny visual effects. The fact that the soldiers are Russians is a pretty big reason to forgive the less enchanting battle scenes and you can concentrate on the most interesting story. So much different was the war in the Eastern Front and the nature of the Russian army that you might want people to make more dramatizations from other fronts and armies. Shtrafbat is not perfect, but it has some rare specialties that increase overall ranking. It tends to crush the myths people have about World War II, the real heroes were the Russian people and not their leaders who sent them to missions where they could only perish. Another great mythical bust is that it represents an enemy that does not lift its weapon as an equal human being - a progress that is difficult to try in many respected films. Shtrafbat shows how the war in the Eastern Front was a survival war and how the clashes crushed people into dust.
