From the producer / writer / nominated director, Golden Globe, James L. Brooks (Talent Conditions, As Good As He Gets), is a really good satirical comedy movie that shows behind the scenes in the life of a reporter / journalist or producer. be like. Jane Craig (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated for Holly Hunter) is basically a new reporter for Tom Grunick (Oscar and William Hurt nominated Golden Globe), but Aaron Altman (Oscar Albert Brooks nominated) also has strong feelings for her. The network is preparing for big changes and sparks will fly with all the studio members. They also play Jack Nicholson as anchor Bill Rorich, Moonraker's Lois Chiles as Jennifer Mack, Robert Prosky Mrs. Doubtfire as Ernie Merriman, Joan Cusack of Rock Rock as Blair Litton, Peter Hackes as Paul Moore, Christian Clemenson as Bobby, Robert Katims as Martin Klein , Ed Wheeler as George Wein and Stephen Mendillo as Gerald Grunick. The comedy is subtle but strong, romance has moments and it's certainly a plausible situational film. He was nominated for Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Writer and Best Picture, and was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Film - Comedy / Music and Best Screenplay - Movie. It was 64 for 100 years, 100 laughs. Very good!
