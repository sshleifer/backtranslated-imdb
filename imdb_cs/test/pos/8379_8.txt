Hong Kong, 1920s. A young man from poor beginnings dreams of being a hero, and spends most of his time training and learning about kung fu and bodybuilding, much against his father's will. It helps a service girl escape from a ruthless businessman whose goons then come after them, and terrorizes a young man's uncle's noodle restaurant. Uncle turns out to be an old, reformed murderer, Triad, who is now helping a young boy to know in martial arts. It's an all-out Karate Kid style with "wash wok" instead of "wax on, wax off". Kung fu villain is the ruthless son of a son who has a scorpion-style trademark that looks cool, though it's pretty stupid and certainly completely unrealistic. But the story that evolves over time has an epic feeling, good characterization, big kung fu and is generally very fun. The young hero is very sympathetic and provides a good protagonist. However, the romance dimension remains undeveloped, which is a bit disappointing. Otherwise a great movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 of 10.
