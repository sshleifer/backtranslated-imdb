The 2005 release of the Royal Rumble came to live from the Save Mart Center in Fresno, California. The two best WWE World Championships were defended, the Undertaker fought Heidenreich in the Casket match, Shawn Michaels was at the Edge in a hateful match that had been staging since last October, and of course every man for himself. Rope The Royal Rumble match itself. Who will take the prize this year? Chris Benoit? Fringe? Eddie Guerrero? Fringe? John Cena? Batista? Fringe? Shawn Michaels? There was no lack of opponents. It was Batista who won the battle in the main event, but not without discussion, or I should say it is an unfinished result. Batista and John Cena were the last two men in the ring. Batista was supposed to fire young Smackdon! the star over the top rope, but it all went wrong and they both went to the floor. The judge acted on his feet because we had a similar competition in 1994 as Bret hart and Lex Luger. This was brought by the Chairman of the Board of Directors. Vinnie Mac went down to the ring as much as he could, but wounded injured when he got into the ring. It was unusual to see Vince McMahon sitting, legs out and telling both men to resume the game. Batista then did was he was supposed to make the first time and dumped Price to Floor sealing his own future with the championship match at WrestleMania 21. <br /> <br /> Mat for this year Royal Rumble had a very solid line up, with many of the biggest stars WWE competes in matches. Each brand had two big matches each. Raw opened the night between Shawn Michaels and Edge. That was a good technical contest. Back and fourth until Edge got pinfall. This was a smart booking decision and kept Edge as a heavyweight World Candidate. The second match of the night was the match ending with the Casket between The Undertaker and Heidenreich. The match wasn't classic, but then it was a classic Casket match again? It was funny. Especially when Snitsky got involved and then Kane jumped out of the coffin into a big pop. The Undertaker wasn't surprised when he won, slamming the lid on Heidenreich and this average dispute. The first of two championship matches at night was John Bradshaw Layfields WWE Championship defense in a triple match against Kurt Angle and Big Show. This match was very good. Not classic again, but fun. JBL won after pinning Kurt Angle. His celebration was short lived but when the backstage teddy Long informed him at No Way Out he would defend the WWE Championship in a barbed wire steel cage match against the big show. It's not a very nice way to spend Sunday night. And of course there is no show without Punch. Punch of course be reigning World Heavyweight Champion Triple H. His rematch from Unforgiven 2004 with Randy Orton was much better than the original meeting. It's a shame, because they just don't seem to click in the ring, and if they did, it would be a great deal. Orton played the concussion role very well and went down in the defeat of The Game. So the first big of 2005 was good. She has achieved her goals. The scams ended and new ones started. We were now officially on the way to WrestleMania 21.
