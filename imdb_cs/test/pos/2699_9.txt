When this show first appeared in the air, I once saw it and saw it was another "fat guy, skinny wife" that looked like a net at that time. It was just "okay" in the initial glances and I didn't see it again; however, once it went into syndication, I caught several episodes (simply because it was for twice a night), and I tell you, the more you look at this show, the funnier it is. As soon as you see all the big support characters connected, this show makes you laugh out loud. Every new episode I watch is more creative than the previous one - people who watch it only a few times will not notice it. Writing and story lines are much more sophisticated than they appear first (this is far from "by Jim"). First, Kevin James is a hysterical, incredibly charming and talented comedy actor, as well as supporting cast. Leah Remini has excellent timing and Patton Oswalt's Spence is one of the funnier characters on the show. And of course, Jerry Stiller is brilliant as Arthur. I was shocked to read the comments that this was the worst part of the show - it's a huge part of why this show is so big - its passing of these ridiculous schemes (rounding the mad father's character) is enthusiastic. And screaming - the best episode is when he shows him he's a child screaming "Lemon Icee !!". This episode, during which Carrie takes him to a therapist in the hope of receiving him medication (to get stressed out by Doug), guest star William Hurt decides that Arthur is screaming because he has never been confirmed. The second part of the episode, where Doug beats his childhood in a therapy session is off funny, is one of the most creative scenes I've seen on the sitcom. I feel the weird need to defend this show because it is seriously underestimated - while "Friends" were sometimes amusing and "Raymond" has some great episodes and characters, both lacking a creative touch that has "the king of queens". In an era where most sitcoms have canned jokes and are on average, "The King of Queens" continues to push the sitcom envelope and show a real comic genius. Critics of the show are clearly not getting it - or not watching the show enough to give it a chance, because anyone who has a real comic and creative feel must laugh out loud while watching. It's definitely on the same level as my other two favorites, "Seinfeld" and "The Office" in their ridiculous tone. It is Arthurs, Kramers and Michael Scotts from the television who are watching and laughing out loud.
