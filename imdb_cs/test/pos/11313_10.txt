I really liked this movie. I watched it last night in a public broadcasting system. The part I liked was the fact that today they were dealing with problems that are not in the future or in the past. Basically, some terrorists should have taken a van or two and rented them as car bombs. I think what the movie could show was people in different countries at once. It turned out that England or any other country was not ready to attack the size they showed. I've never heard of any of the actors or actresses in the movie, so I can't tell if they're usually part of them. After the film, they had this group of experts who talked about whether this could happen in the US.
