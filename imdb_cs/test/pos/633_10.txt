Man, this year I wasn't laughing so much, and it's hard to laugh. While I was waiting for some movie in the Hostel style, my smile came to my face and from the beginning. This film-inside-film shows a woman stabbed "victim" to spoil the entire set until she finally "die". Her over-riding of director nuts and his humorous response tells the audience that Mute Witness is not typically a horror movie. The main character, mute American make-up artist Billy Hughes, plays beautiful but talented Russian actress Marina Zudina. Its performance is superior; her character can't talk, so body language and emotions on her face have to compensate. And oh, boy, she did a great job. Her sister (Fay Ripley) is a girlfriend or fiance or wife of "film director" (Evan Richards). Most of the time they were both very amusing. I won't go wrong anymore, but the scenes following the bath, with them two, fake policemen and later angry neighbor, were free of brilliant black comedy. The land turned close to the end, maybe at some point misleading. But don't worry. You can see such an excellent movie in your family or with your friend.
