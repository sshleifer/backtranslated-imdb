I don't see what is the problem with SOME people and their need for intellectual humor. You need to get your head out of an up-tight ass if you don't find this movie merry! If it's not your "cup of tea" so to speak, then look at what it really is - damn funny movie. Maybe the DID went on another drug / T&A movie, but in this case they really got into place. It is particularly funny for Ali G fans because it delivers everything we love and expect from it. So I say BIG UPS to Ali G, and if that's not your thing, don't hesitate - BATTY BOY!
