The bullets didn't have to bounce off his chest, but the Lone Ranger was for me every symbolic symbol of my other childhood hero - Superman. He represented the truth, justice, and American way in the classic television Western environment, living on the principle that he would never use his weapon to kill, while washing the South American with his faithful Indian companion Tonto to bring each individual to justice. The arrival of the television provided the perfect opportunity for the post-war generation to find it ideal for the mysterious masked man who was behind the law and order, while providing unparalleled fun for five seasons of almost eight years. Today For the first time I had the opportunity to see the complete three sub-episodes that started to complete without the standard opening and closing sequences interrupting the story's continuity. For the Ranger fans, he is a great dad from all Western sagas, as the Texas Ranger John Reid survived the excuse of Butch Cavendish Gang, and how an Indian friend was treated back to health from childhood. Tonto (Jay Silverheels) declares that his companion is a "trusted scout" and is named Kemo-sabe. I have read various interpretations about the origin of the word Kemo-sabe, but I'm satisfied with Ton's explanation. Reading too much is just reducing it from the story as well as the English translation of 'tonto' from Spanish, which I won't reveal because it's just better to know if it can help you. I thought it was clever enough that the story's story created the mystery of a lone Ranger, like the sixth grave that created the illusion that all the Rangers had died in a canyon box. You never see the face of a man who becomes a Lonely Ranger because he is always averted or covered to cover up his true identity. Even the origin of Silver is processed brilliantly; story narrator voice that describes the quality of a wild stallion. That would be, say, a pound ..., silver? I got the biggest kick out of it. Of course with the time, observing the Lone Ranger episodes today offers insight into how unbridled the show was over the original story. Some of them are almost embarrassingly goofy, especially when it comes to clearing the Lone Ranger as they shoot in the middle of a crowd of bad guys to knock down a weapon from the owner's hand. And what about the little wave he gives to Tont when they're going to attack the bad guys - it's always the same gesture, but Tonto always knows what it means in different circumstances. Then you have episodes where Clayton Moore takes off the Ranger mask to give another disguise to impersonate another character in the service of the story. He even went under cover once as an actor depicting President Abraham Lincoln to expose a criminal, top hat and all! Few fans I've ever encountered know that actor John Hart has replaced Clayton Moore in 1952. 53 in a controversial dispute that Moore had with the show's producers. If you've ever seen the "Happy Days" episode where Fonzie loves her boyish hero, you'll find it was John Hart's credits. It's hard to say whether you're watching Hart's episode or not, the key is to listen to the voice; Moore is so distinctive that he's dead giveaway. <br /> <br /> If you ever taste some of the latest seasonal episodes, you can enjoy treatment. The portraits I've seen on VHS are absolutely amazing, even if I don't know if commercial prints are available. Most of the black and white episodes have been repackaged by any number of distributors in different configurations, so getting into the hands of those who should have problems shouldn't be a problem. Of course there is a three-part origin of course, and if you don't look at anything else, you get all the taste and excitement you need to capture the image of one of the most famous heroes of the West. Hi-Yo Silver, Awaaaay!
