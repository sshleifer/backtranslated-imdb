Charming. The best time to see this movie is sometimes when unhappy or sad. It's all just so cute, everything, even that the white bear loves the queen in secret and eventually gets it, also the success that two young actors gave Gerdy and Kai. It's also nice music. The two of us will always be in combination with sad piano tones in some places, which gives a very moving result, and if one looks at both parts at once, they will see that the Snow Queen is not so bad. He tries to surround himself with love in the wrong way. The evening of the first part of the film, I watched it just because I was bored, but I loved it much more after I was very angry when they didn't show another part for a funeral funeral. Yeah, that was terribly sad for me. But when they said it would be next week, I was so happy to see it and now I'm glad I did.
