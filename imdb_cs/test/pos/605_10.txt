In many ways, the perfect movie. Incredible Journey and Horatio Alger's story come together for a positive spin on a usually depressing subject of existentialism. Basically, the defeats of the muppet are reduced to the final song of the film: "Life is like a movie, write your own ending, believe, pretend." They create their own reality that has all the pitfalls of every epic story: a noble goal at the end of what is necessarily an obstacle path; an ever-growing group of like-minded individuals for camaraderie; a vile set of vilians who are not behind all redemptions; and a big Hollywood end budget because that's all it can. Only Jim Henson could pull it out. It goes through the line between sentiment and philosophy without it too long or too hard. Of course it seems strange to invest such weight in a movie where puppets play, but in the end they are the perfect puppets that do these points. The atmosphere of the film allows for a pure Hollywood dream experience, a "happy" ending, unnecessary portraits and bursting in a song with a drop of a hat. Usually these aspects of anathema are of quality in film, but the self-deprecating way in which the story is delivered is for guilt-free viewing. One of the few movies that can actually be called "suitable for all ages." Other muppet related movies (including "The Empire Strikes Back"), while tasty, don't touch the simple grace of this movie. Take for example the music number "I hope something better comes together", duet Kermit and Rowlf. Entertaining in his vaudevillian goofy, he makes a scathingly vital point about motivating for life choices. Brilliant.
