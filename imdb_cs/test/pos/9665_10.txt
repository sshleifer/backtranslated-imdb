we now know that a number of munteans movies, excellent PAPER WILL BE BLUE and BOOGIE, but worth seeing again (or finally) this first FURIA, which shows perfectly its initial features. his very interesting thing is to see how his beginners have developed to confirm him as one of the best contemporary Romanian directors. Of course, the film itself is excellent - a smart and professional script, a certain direction, a stylish photo. definitely one of the best - in the most serious and strict way! Also, munteans telling the sense is convincing and grasping - and he actors ... well, they just rock!
