It's a beautiful movie. The scenes are well illustrated. Anne Revere's dialogues are really well-written and inspiring, the philosophy and thoughts that this film gives, and the things they teach, make it great and amazing. Mickey Rooney is great in the movie and his role goes through many emotional riots as the film progresses. Elizabeth Taylor looks very pretty, her scenes in the movie are inherently poetic, the camera follows her and the way the music feels to make every scene of her ethereally beautiful. This movie has a great spirit and beloved classics. Angela Lansbury is fun in her role. though unknowable if you have seen her in the role of 'm' in the 'Manchurian candidate'. Donald Crisp made the role of his father full of justice and the scenario provides him with enough things to justify his role. Its a very nice movie and has to watch family and kids evergreen favorites.
