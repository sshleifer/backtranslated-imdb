NO SPOILERS !! After Hitchcock's successful first American film Rebecca, based on Daphne DuMarier's novel gothic romance and intrigue, he returned to some of the more famous themes of his early British era - misidentity and espionage. As the US settled in World War II and the vast "war effort" of civilians who built planes, weapons, and other necessary militias, the flourishing film entertainment business began to turn paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes. Often, these thrillers included networks of misleading and skilled operators in the shade between good law-abiding citizens. Producer Jack Skirball, who knew the director was at home in this espionage genre, turned to Hitchcock about how to manage the property he owned and dealt with corruption, sabotage in wartime, and a helpless hero pressed into the whirlwind of chance and mistaken identity . The darker elements of the story and the sharp joke of the literary maven Dorothy Parker (during her short stint in Hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in New York), who co-wrote the script, was a perfect match for Hitchcock's feelings. This often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25-year-old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings), who meets a new employee, Frank Frye (Norman Lloydd) while working in a Los Angeles aircraft factory, and is ready for a moment later committing sabotage. The escape from the authorities who do not believe his story that has appeared will meet several characters on their way to Soda City Utah and eventually to New York. These unforgettable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of useful "madmen" and the popular billboard model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane), which will fall madly in love during the worst crisis of its life and national security! Of course, in the Hitchcock country, Patricia, kidnapped by the supposed saboteur Barry, falls on her hijacker, adding a romantic tense to the mix. In Good Form for This Hitchcock Trip Produces a National Network Destroy old ladies, average Joes and decent entrepreneurs who double the secret agent of terrorists who harbor criminals, pull weapons and detonate bombs to make things move. It's an amazing plot that takes its time forward and once fired, culminating in one of Hitchcock's unforgettable finals. Check out the incredibly life like NYC tourist attractions (all of which were created by artistic directors in Hollywood due to the war time 'shoot ban' on public attractions). While Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcock's best-known films, it's a popular b-movie that is sure to be strong and engaging with many clever plot twists and, as usual, the stunning Hitchcock thieves. Don't forget to look at Hitchcock's appearance outside the pharmacy in the second half of the movie. Hitchcock's original idea, which was shot (he fought in sign language with his 'deaf' wife) was clipped by the Bureau of Standards and Practices, who were afraid to offend the deaf!
