Caddyshack 2 has a terrible reputation, only because it is a continuation of a highly classic classic. People have criticized the film for a lot of reasons, but they all eventually went back to not being Caddyshack. I would start by saying that we should take Caddyshack from the equation and consider this film to be our own merit, but I think it would be unfair. The film has a lot to do with its predecessor. The "snob versus slobs" themes that relate to the class, and the desire to fit into a class higher than your own, prevail as in the first film. Two things really missing are Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield, who are replaced by Dan Ackroyd and Jackie Mason. Now I'm not going to say that Ackroyd is approaching Murray's movie, but Jackie Mason is the admirable successor of Dangerfield. He comes as a cross between Dangerfield and Arnold Stang, but without biting too much on himself. I wouldn't say he's somewhere close to being so funny, like Dangerfield in Caddyshack, but his character and his film dilemma is much more. and several times in the film, which is another joint complaint. Maybe these naysayers didn't notice that he only appeared in the first movie a few times. For my money, his scenes are much more entertaining if they are somewhat exaggerated. While I'm on this topic, it's really redirecting this movie that it brings. It seems much more confident in his laughter attempts. Many of the jokes are strenuous, and Gopher is too much to seem to have accepted a much more anthropomorphic personality and voice, just in case we don't understand the idea of ​​being funny. Characters are similarly hammered at home, especially the smarmy of yuppy kids. Jackie Mason rarely misses defeat and is always sympathetic and very funny, but we didn't need any tango sequences at all! The director apparently doesn't have the same school of thought as Harold Ramis. Not suggesting that Caddyshack was savvy, but the jokes here are just a little overcrowded, and most of them are unnecessarily embellished with an unpredictable musical cue. All of the things at stake are fun, goofy movies with something to say about class and identity that very few movies called at that time. Don't be discouraged by the terribly low IMDb rating, check it out for yourself.
