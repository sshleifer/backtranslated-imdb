There have been many films about people returning home from wars and have to settle, but "war at home" is worth seeing. The depiction of Vietnamese veterinarian Jeremy Collier (Emilio Estevez), who has difficulty connecting with his Texas family, most of the film is very likely to stretch you. But nothing can prepare you for what ends up being revealed. Part of what makes this film so good is how it gives the viewer a feeling of both Texas and the generation gap. Jeremy's parents, Bob (Martin Sheen) and Maurine (Kathy Bates), have a problem with their son's attitude, both about the war and the rejection of Americanism. His sister Karen (Kimberly Williams) is not sure who to party with. However, there can be no neutrality after dinner. So we as Americans can never fully get through the Vietnam War, but this film is likely to help us look seriously at how it has affected it. many people. Emilio Estevez definitely did a good job. They also play Corin Nemec and Carla Gugino.
