I liked it better than House Party 2 & 3. The cast was cheerful and cool at the same time. Chris Stokes, who directed the film, has a very humorous portrait as a car repairer; Look at his mom who plays the main character, John John's grandmother. And you can hear her rap title song "Down to the Last Minute" at the end of the movie as a roll credits. She is a very funny and really good actress. The young actors who play it (the main trio) and who are actually part of the IMx music group have done an excellent job. I did not pay much attention to this group before this film. I'm a fan now. Music number in the House Party scene itself is worth a look at the movie. I was pleasantly surprised. I loved it.
