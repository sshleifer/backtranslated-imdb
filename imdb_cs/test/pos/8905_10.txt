Participating in this film was an excuse to escape from the work I had to do for my classes, but it turned out to be one of my best experiences in France. The film does a quick job of building multidimensional characters and has a great story. The characters really had the voices that you would expect when reading graphic novels and artistic talent surpassed my expectations Music was catchy and comedy, fiddling with ease, almost flinstoneish incorporating modern subjects in a playful way. The movie was grabbing attention, cute and action packed at the same time. He was an amazing story. I'll show it to my French students.
