This is a great show despite many negative user reviews. The aim of this show is to entertain you with laughter. Two boys compete against each other to get a girl's phone number. Simple. Fun in this show is to watch as two men try to reach their goal. Some seem to hate the show for a variety of reasons, but I don't think they understood it as an "educational" show about how to pick up chicks. Well, it's not, it's a comedy show, and its whole sense is to make you laugh, teach you nothing. If you didn't like the show because it doesn't teach you anything, don't look at it. If you don't like the whole club thing, don't look at it. If you don't like socialization, don't look at it. This show is a comic show. If you're down by watching others pick up the girls, but its not laughing at you so don't watch it. If you are so disappointed after watching this show and you realize that you do not have the option to "pick up" the girls, there is no reason to hate the show, just don't look!
