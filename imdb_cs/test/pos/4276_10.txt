I saw this movie and I recommend it. It has a very good plot, it keeps your full attention, acting is excellent, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good. Very good movie, about big and unconditional love. Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not ready for the suffering he is about to start, but takes the matter as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel anxious and suffering. Emily Watson's character is very strong and has a quick look and you understand everything. I will not say more because it is better if you have to enter the story as it develops.
