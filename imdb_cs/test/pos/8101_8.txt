From the beginning of the movie I found myself laughing trying to keep calm, so I didn't wake anyone in the house, it didn't go so far in the rest of the movie, I didn't find everything "laugh out loud" funny, but I still found some things funny. At first I had to keep laughing when he dropped a very smart grenade on his sleeve. Then there are scenes where you will just smile, like when Barber falls over the roof into someone's apartment, I can see it's pretty funny, but today's days and the time that was done pretty much didn't feel original, though at that time I was sure it was. I loved Hynkels (Hitlers) explosions of raging German with a nice soft English translation. The last scene is wildly discussed, because it is absolutely true and so very intelligently designed. Although the film is sixty-eight years old, the last scene is still important today, unless it shows how big the writer Chaplin is, then I don't know what will be. Especially the talks in this scene were pretty good, Barber went beyond the message and realized the serious nature of the film while enjoying the funny side. Another feature of this movie is the fact that it was such a brave movie that almost feels before its time. Of course, Chaplin did not know what would happen after 1940, was not aware of the Holocaust (apparently), is also on record when he said that if he knew that this film would not do. The fact that this film is so anti-Hitler is interesting is more interesting that it wasn't anti-Germany that would be very easy to do in those times, Chaplin could easily make it a propaganda film, but instead did something more, he did honorary film. I recommend to anyone who is interested in this film to see it, as well as those who have studied or studied Hitler and WWII to see this film. It's at least fun, it doesn't have an unpleasant obsolete feeling that some movies of that time. Unlike most "comedies", this movie actually has the message you are trying to bring, watch this movie, you will have a better vision.
