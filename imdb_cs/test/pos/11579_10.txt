My friend asked, "Doesn't a man have to be euthanized to like this movie? Is it a movie error when most quadriplegics want to end their lives?" Interesting questions. <br /> <br /> If I see (correct me when I'm wrong), there's only one quadriplegic that wanted to end your sea life inside. Think about it, Ram√≥n Sampedro. He's the one who wants to die. It is he who fights for his right to decide on his death. They speak for themselves and not for other quadriplegics. Although his pioneering work, depending on the person's view, may prove beneficial or damaging to the quadriplegic by road, his primary goal is a personal goal. But one thing that this film does (in my opinion) is that it forces viewers to ask themselves the questions that my friend has so briefly stated. went home in conflicting blur. I tried to reconcile this irritated concept; Why would Ramon want to die? Given the love, care, and sacrifice, so unconditionally showered by Ramon, the people who surround him, why would he hold on to his vulnerable decision? After looking at Ramon and his lawyer for the second time, I got into it. This provoked narration: "... total addiction comes at the expense of intimacy." Most human beings desire such intimacy. Of course, how much we value these "needs" depends largely on the individual. <br /> <br /> As a family-sensitive person, I have had a strong sense of caregivers in this film. Why can't Javier think about the sacrifice and love of his family and friends? Is it blind? I think not. The Miracle of the Sea Inside is therefore a mysterious depiction of a very humanist tug of war. When confronted with the custody of a sensible but incompetent loved one who has expressed a calm, conscious and rational intention to die, then what is the right thing to do? Caring and keeping this loved one alive, against his will, a pious gesture? Does it show the value of our love? Or just calms our "selfish" fears of irreplaceable loss? Would it not be with such understanding, which is given to carers, their invalid accusation by subjecting themselves to the utter dependence of others on survival, also a disregarded act of sacrifice? Rhetorical or not, how much does the "dignity" of an individual cost? Does (or dies) live with dignity privilege or right? If we really care and love a person, should we also respect their possible decisions in life (like death)? A stream of questions the film could ask for, answers that I am in a position I could not provide. The risk of ignoring the gray sea that engulfs the most vulnerable people, carers and those they care for. The Sea Inside has therefore attempted to present a subtle but complex relationship between them. Intuitively, this film understands one thing; that the nature of the "victim" is never unilateral. In this tug of war, we should try to win arguments, but to watch closely and hopefully determine who is the "stronger" party to make this sacrifice. Nautical Inside is a sober movie. She opened my eyes to things I don't want to see. And for that I am grateful.
