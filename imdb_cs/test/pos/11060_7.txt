Maybe this movie is too long, but after 45 years it has some magic. Major roles seem more appropriate to Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. I took less care of Gary Cooper, but Ingrid Bergman is fine, especially in dark hair. The film is worth seeing to support cast: Flora Robson is amazing as a mulatto servant. It is a white woman on a black surface and may have the expression of evil or voodoo mistress. Jerry Austin as a servant of the dwarf has an amazing role that will keep you from laughing despite some long scenes. Speaking of scenes, Florence Bates steals most of those who have a social lady widow. At the end of the film, I did not understand the result of the fight on the railway and the last scene was pure Hollywood dreck. It's a strange feeling when you realize that a film title refers to rail rather than luggage!
