A lot has been written about the film itself, so instead of joining the noise, I want to say a few words about two female actors. For every actress, it must be a daunting prospect to play, in a sense, against the magnificent Monica Bellucci, but Romane Bohringer pulls her to the sensational ends. Film with Monika Bellucci, where do I fall in love with another girl? This should not happen. It was said a thousand times, but Monica Bellucci hit the saddest character in a modern cinema. I've never seen such an inborn sadness. She wouldn't be in place to break Lon Chaney's heart.
