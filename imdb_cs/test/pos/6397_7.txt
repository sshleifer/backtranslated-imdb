This show was stupid when it first appeared. The first actress who played the daughter did not respond to this role, the writing was hit or missing, and Damon Wayans CLEARLY didn't feel so good that he would do such a family show with the corn family. Chemistry between themselves and Tisha Cambell (they are long-time friends, just like all Wayan clans with their Tisha and Will Smith and Dad Pinkett) DID work by reorienting the show. After returning, reworking their daughter, they made a much stupid son (la Eric of "Boy Meets World") and made the youngest daughter a genius ... (later they gave her a little genius friend to make a comedy guest appearance). The show as if often rollercoasters from over the top buffoonery to being a corny walk line enough to hold it as a show that you can see Damon Wayans are comfortable in his own skin on the scene (especially because the main writers, directors and consultants) \ t Wayan family) And in its character. As soon as everyone was at the show, they all worked in strong games and were able to show in the air a lot of fun. However, there is a TOO MUCH buffoonery, too much over the top rumors, and often too much chaos going on in Kyle's family life. They did Junior TOO STUPID, they also made the eldest daughter an attractive, clumsy idiot from time to time and the youngest daughter was not spared the writers either. I feel like they jumped out of a shark and signed a warrant when Junior got his girlfriend pregnant, moved in and married her with her parents and introduced her parents (the character of my father is for me thinking of me). The show remained humorous ... but it was UPN's show on ABC if it makes any sense to the reader. <br /> <br /> Reruns is pretty funny enough, but I'm relieved that it's over ... there was nowhere to go with it. When it's bad, it's really BAD. It tends to be an occasional cornball, but at least he was a black man who had a sitcom to make it syndication to a major network .. Who can say for himself now? (Due to the merger of CW and "brownout" in TV networks recently, that means). One.
