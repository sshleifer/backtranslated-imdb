Obviously the answers here have been written many years after the film was released and cannot be accepted in context. In 1980, after the work, this film was blood-witty in England. We were happy to laugh, and Rising Damp, with his sympathetic mockery of the complete social stratum, was one of Britain's best sitcoms, if not at all. She hit a chord in almost everybody and we laughed at Rigsby in real British fashion. America had nothing to do with this type of humor because its own grudge wasn't fun for our overseas cousins. Leonard Rossiter was one of the best players in Englands, on stage, on television and in movies. His commitment and professionalism were top-notch. Richard Beckinsale, though young, was a perfect Rossiter comedy film and should be classified as great by all rights. If he hadn't been so young, I'm sure he would now be classified as one of the greatest actors in Britain. Frances De la Tour has found her best TV moment in Rising Damp and has never quantified her undoubted ability with other roles. If you haven't seen the movie at the time of its release, you're not allowed to comment, simply because you can't understand why it was funny, the humor of the moment.
