Luis Bunuel's "Nazarin" presents an extraordinary view of religion in Mexico. As director and Julio Alejandro, his eminent collaborator, wrote, it was a film that put a Mexican cinema on an international map after receiving the Cannes Grand Prix that year. It is a distracting film because Mr. Bunuel is deeply immersed in what is wrong with the church. Nazarine seems to be holy. This young priest is seen living a life of poverty in a dirty guest house. He doesn't have enough for himself, but he doesn't mind giving him a coin when a beggar asks for help. At the same time, he takes a prostitute into his small room, who was injured in a fight with another woman. Andara, the woman repays her favor by burning the room and the whole building! Nazarin is seen in the countryside begging for food. Andara and Beatriz, two prostitutes from his old town follow him. Nazarin's life resembles the life of Jesus. In fact, this secular character makes a case for humility. Of course, sir. Bunuel didn't mean any religion when he and Mr. Alejandro took this film. Ironically, as Spain welcomed it after the film was released, because it was seen as manifesting itself in Christian qualities, when it is actually a violent satire of the Catholic Church and its ministers. Francisco Rabal, a Spanish actor, makes a wonderful Nazarin. That was one of his best roles. Mr. Rabal worked extensively in his home country, but also in Mexico and Argentina. Rita Macedo, like Andara, is also excellent. Marga Lopez is also a valuable contribution to her portrait of Beatriz. Great movie by one of the film's film masters: Luis Bunuel.
