Suppose for a moment that you have been experimenting with psychotropic fungi and you are interested in the so-called "bad experience" and how can such a thing be played? Come on and pop into the fresh copy of The Beguiled. You see, with the film you have your clean trips (Solaris and anything else director Andrei Tarkovsky), shots, ie Experience-from-which-never-heal (Sweet Movie and El Topo) and you are a bad organic excursion, a category specially dedicated to film like The Beguiled, which is the kind of content of those enthusiasts who made the right decisions with their lives and graduated from the English Harvard Department, call it "hallucinogenic in tone." The third act of Don Siegel was to direct the film; Fruit that is incalculable in age, but you will feel something. In 1970, when the film was made, most Americans were looking for an anodyne for their collective pain, a movie like The Graduate maybe, a lot of world endism was happening, and of course you had a nightmare to disintegrate the Vietnam War. What you get with The Beguiled, a trivial drug metaphor, is a scenario adapted to a guy's novel that at least for the moment wanted to be known as Grimes Grice and a director who helped with work and career. Sam Peckinpah. Donny Siegel, born at age 12 in Chicago, Ill., Less than 45 years after the Great Fire, says in Beguiled that he is trying to cope with all the current cultural insanities in the early 1970s in the form of a classic film artifact. The Beguiled is an incredible film and an excellent contribution to cinematographic art in almost every aspect: shooting, editing, directing and story are fantastic and you are unlikely to see anything like that.

Plantation South, linking beauty with evil at every point shot. Clint Eastwood, no need to say, has never been like this. Old Clint, he immediately moves from gloomy to lively, eyes like two Archimedes spirals in the medium close up. The rest of the cast is just as demanding and miraculous. This Beguiled never makes AFI 100 in my life, but it doesn't stop me from being one of America's best soundtrack ever made. While most people catalog it as a western to include people in The Western Channel, The Beguiled is a problem because you really don't know what it is: A kind of war movie? Drama? Psychological thriller? Maybe the answer to all those emotionally forged Noir movies starring Kirk Douglas? I actually say this piece of a horror movie because when my old man who likes to kick with cheap, gratuitous violence in entertainment like The Wire, saw that high angle medium-length shot of Geraldine Page wrapping a turnstile around the bloody leg of Clint, Pa was pretty quick when he suggested we watch something different than the Outback Bowl, just before he ran into another room. My advice: look at this and make sure it is on a very large screen, preferably on the DPL projector you are considering. I would like to give The Beguiled the right to order along with that important purchase for the consumer, turn overheads, throw some movie light on a big blank wall and try not to lose grip because, like Norman Bates: "We all go a little" sometimes crazy, "even enchanted.
