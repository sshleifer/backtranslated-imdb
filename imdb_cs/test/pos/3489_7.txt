Alter Egos is no wiser than creating Ali G. Sacha Baron Cohen. Completely confused by his vicious and non-existent sense of suburban surroundings of Central England, which makes up his social background. It insists on life in the style of Los Angeles Gansta. While still living with his Gran in the London suburb of Staines, he holds firm control over his Posse, West Staines "Massiv". Spend her free time between Julie, his girlfriend, Posse and teaching local eight-year-old Boy Scouts to "Keep it Real" lessons in the government funded by the John Nike Leisure Center. This is where the story starts and says that government funding has stopped. Ali G then continues to search for one man "In the struggle for justice that I wanted to ask me Life, just like Martin Luther Van Dross". Be his answer to local media crews while talking to him on hunger strike while strapped to the fence. Charles Dance plays David Carlton, a sinister and sinister deputy prime minister who is "even more than a thief. Skeletor". Using Ali G, unwittingly, lose Prime Minster by 18,000 votes three weeks before the General Election. When he saw Ali G as a fumbling idiot, his plan was moving away. Ali G suddenly becomes a nightmare and savior of people who work directly with the prime minister. The story becomes more sinister and cheerful. Ali G Indahouse is a brilliant British film that brings extremely talented writing skills along with Dan Mazer, the performance and performance of Sacha Baron Cohen. Charles Dance and Michael Gambon, as P.M. play their parts with great esteem between gags and gaiety that is Ali G. <br /> <br /> Ironically, seeing a parody plays its part in a world that is really real and who are constantly preaching "Keep it Real "From their own small world, which is West Staines" Massiv "is a real comic paradox. Directed by Mark Mylod, his first feature film from directing television production, such as Shameless, Shooting Stars, The Fast Show and Reeves Smell and Mortimer to name a few. <br /> <br /> Very real and very funny.
