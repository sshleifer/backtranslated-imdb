Uzumaki has an impressive reputation in Lovecraft's circles and now I know why. Uzumaki is based on the Manga title (which is incredibly supposedly better than the film) and follows bizarre events that precede the typhoon. isolated japanese city. I don't want to tell you what's going on in this movie because it's a absolutely necessary film. I watched him for the first time and I was blown away. It shot into my best movies of all time and jump-frogged Pans Labyrinth as the best fantastic movie (literally and photographically) that was released in the last decade. This film is very Lovecraftian in nature without a formal connection with Cthulhu Mythos. It was made in the same way that Lovecraft composed his stories; it exudes power as an aura of "something that is not entirely right here", which intensifies with a depressing phase to horror and ultimately horror through subtle progressive changes in soundtrack and cinematography. This is really a "weird story" par excellence. <br /> <br /> Just stunning.
