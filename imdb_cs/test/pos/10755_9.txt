What is often neglected on Harold Lloyd is that he was an actor. Unlike Chaplin and Keaton, Lloyd did not have the background of Vaudeville / Music Hall and was not a natural comedian. He came to Hollywood to act; and he found that he had the talent to play funny - first in shorts, then in functions. He made a name for himself as "Lonesome Luke", a Chaplin knock-off; With "character glasses" that made him an American boy rather than grotesque, Lloyd took his step and his films became some of the best that were made during the silent era. He has developed a reputation as a "daredevil" in some shorts, and has retained this in some of his best films ("Last Safety", "For Sake Heaven", "Shy Girl"). He was more popular than either Chaplin or Keaton during the twenties and he became very wealthy before the advent of sound. <br /> <br /> The first sound movies were often disasters. Too make the most of your "sound", too many dialogs have been used in many movies. Lloyd's acting skills were focused on silence after two decades. He had no bad voice; his high pitch suited his "glasses" character. And his sound movies were not unqualified disasters of legends. However, silent films were raised to high art (especially Lloyd's, who did not stand in the budget and was very well created); with the introduction of the films, they had to learn to walk again and made some wrong steps. Although he tried to move with the times and embraced the sound, Lloyd's best pieces of his early (too blunt) conversations were still visual - like the scene in "Movie Crazy", where he seems to be on a skipping rope cars, but actually "hit the ride" by bike. Trying to capture the daredevil that made him famous, as he did in "Feet First", was the wrong step. (In "Safety Last", his best film and film, which deserved or not, he pushed Lloyd into the box as a "brave comedian"), played a determined young man who climbed to the top. Apparently he was afraid, but his fear added to the humor, in "Feet First" came to an unfortunate situation, when the construction of buildings diminished by chance, his frantic cries for help were lost. His character was pathetic and crouching, aspirations to save his neck - perhaps an accurate statement of the thirties, but not fun). Harold Lloyd wasn't blocked in the past, like some crazy Norma Desmond. He embraced the sound and tried to take movies in different directions, growing and changing in the industry. When "Feet First" failed, he left the daredevil and made a satire on the film "Crazy Crazy". Just as he had to flounder through many films like "Lonesome Luke" before carving his place in the history of film with the character of glasses, he tried several directions in sound movies before hitting his step in the sound he did with "Catspaw". In "The Catspaw" he plays the son of a missionary who is bred in China and who unwittingly acquires the elected mayor for a false political interest. When he finds out the truth, he sets out to clean up the city. Just in his forties, Lloyd could still act as a cheeky young man. Yet "Catspaw" was another box-failure in the office, and Lloyd made only three other movies, including "The Milky Way". Of his main competitors, Chaplin still had silent films in it, and Keaton was hopelessly misled. "The Catspaw" and "The Milky Way" suggest that Lloyd could handle the audio comedy if he was a little younger, or if the audience would benefit from doubts after his initial sound fiasco. Although the film was unfairly ominous about how Lloyd's character tidied up the city, he suits him. From his days in "shorts," Lloyd wanted to scare his audience, and the "Catspaw" climax surprised him again; until the trick is revealed, it seems creepy, and then laughter comes. Looking at the product of its time, The Catspaw is charming and funny. A very well written Lloyd sound comedy. Director Sam Taylor, his strange mixture of drama and crafty humor, make it almost like the comedy Frank Capra or Preston Sturges.
