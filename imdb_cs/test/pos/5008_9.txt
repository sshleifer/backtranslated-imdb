This show was a pleasant surprise after watching Mad TV on Saturday night. Spike is a great host to whom you can say he gets used to it, but he adapts greatly to his new job. I can imagine it is a difficult transition from a writer (Seinfeld) to a host, unlike many new talk show hosts will not let the air ride while trying to figure out what to do next. It is fast, and each segment and part plunge into one another. Also, it doesn't hurt to be a little sexy in a silly type, so it's not hard on the eyes like Leno or Letterman. I can't remember the exact date of the episode that was my favorite, but most importantly, I loved the Idiot Paparazzi parody of the fake J-Lo and Katie Holmes. Great new show !!
