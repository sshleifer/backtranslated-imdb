I own miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much. This is one of the best pieces of contemporary civil war I have seen and tells a story of friendship divided by war. Costumes are great, story stories are great, I love how the story jumps around from character to character to guess what happens next in their lives. There is a great balance of good and evil. Some of the characters that I think are bad are too good to be observed. Every time something more contemptuous than the last happens, I curse the TV as if they heard me. I love how these miniseries feel involved in drama. However, I would rather NOT REVIEW the third DVD movie. It is compared to the first two films and most of the original characters do not return. I don't want to remember how the third movie ended, rather living with the end of the second movie. It makes me happy.
