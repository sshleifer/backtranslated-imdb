Yes, this movie was just hilarious and the performance was top of the cast. Except for Shelley Winters, the German accent wasn't that big, but it doesn't matter because it's hardly in the film. So if you are a fan of her attention! The two main stars of this film are Laurence Harvey and Julie Harris. Now, before this movie, I'd see Miss Harris in the East of Eden with James Dean and my own The Glass Menagerie soundtrack she made on stage with Monty Clift and Jessica Tandy, so I wasn't sure how she was doing it. To be in this role and BOY, I was impressed. How was it? I love ham! ;-) Mr. Harvey, he tickled my imagination! I'm a full-time fan of Laurence Harvey now! That hair !!! * Collets * OMG! It's almost like Burt Lancasters, the crazy messy look, that's no better than this. He is young and innocent in this film. ATTENTION! It's definitely in my top ten! :) I'm so glad I found a copy that's all mine! Unfortunately, this movie is out of print and it's very hard to find it on video. : (<br /> <br /> Btw, watch the hospital hotel room scene !!!!! It's one of the best parts! Or when Mr. Harvey convinced himself he was sick and trying to get a knee kick, you know how Doctors do with this little rubber hammer ;-) Well it does itself and its leg kicks and it kicks the table * screams * Look at the look in his face, so innocent !!!! I can't describe it, but to all those people who say they couldn't behave very well, and other comments on cockamamie, see this movie and see what a really great actor he was. You will be above them! If you're not, I'm afraid I can't do anything for you, you're hopeless. ;-)
