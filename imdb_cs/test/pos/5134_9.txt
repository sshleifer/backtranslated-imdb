In "Hoot", Mullet's fingers are engaged in sabotage to stop the pancake house. The problem is that builders start again and have to take more drastic measures. When confronted with dogs, he is frightened by snakes, not before he is bitten by a dog and has to go to the hospital. Roy before bedtime asks his father, who works with the Justice Department to deal with fraudsters. His father says it involves tedious steps looking through the papers because sooner or later everyone will slip. You can see it with Enron and WorldCom. Roy looks at the pancake house documents and finds a repressed document (he must break into a company trailer), so when the police see it, he has a right on his side. In contrast, when he avoided the police. Remember, as mentioned earlier, Roy is not always legislative, and when society kills owls (illegally), Mullet Fingers takes direct action. She can't wait for the law (Mullet Fingers hides). The film suggests that one should work in the system.
