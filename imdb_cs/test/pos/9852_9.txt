I've heard about this document so long that I knew I needed time to watch him. As a document, it is very well done in that it has a neutral, attentive look at their experience. There are no voice calls or conversations. It's honest. Is it true. It is also humble. Two comments remained with me after the film was finished. One of them was how the boys were told not to become American boys wearing baggy pants, and how much time there was, but no money, but there was money in America, but no time. The biggest impact was how the boys were hungry for education, and how one of the boys moved completely to go to school. I watched this high school movie that said it upset him to see how the boys were brought into a new life without a real American focus. He also said he knew so many American teenagers who just couldn't appreciate their lives in America. I agree with him on both accounts. A powerful film that lets people think about many things.
