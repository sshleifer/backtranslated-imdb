Biodoc on a mysterious singer / songwriter who, according to friends' accounts, spent the last 15 years of his relatively short life seemingly on the mission of self-destruction. He died at 52, overweight and scattered, of heart disease, after a lengthy rampage of virtually non-stop overindulgence in alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and cocaine, a grumpy party, and flagrant abuse of his vocal instrument (he confided to a friend that he was shouting his lyrics in one performance with such a force that blood spattered on the microphone. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that he was: (1) considered the most popular pop singing ability of his generation; (2) successful, years effort in terms of industrial recognition - Grammy, Oscar, decent record label with top label and at least two star albums - "Nilsson Schmilsson" (originals) and "A Little Touch Schmilsson at night" (and (3) very happy) married (the third time) with a beautiful young family he apparently loved. <br /> <br /> The strengths of the film begin with the completeness of their life of Nilsson's life, including the subtle use of arc the stunning movie footage and many of Nilsson's photos, the publishers are doing a particularly good job of bringing movement to the photos. We learned about his close ties to John Lennon and later Ringo Starr (Lennon often said that Nilsson was his favorite American musician). Here are people like Perry Botkin, Jr., Ray Cooper, Mickey Dolenz, Terry Gilliam, Mark Hudson, Eric Idle, Rick Jarrard, Randy Newman, Van Dyke Parks, Jimmy Webb and Robin Williams. many funny funny, others deeply miserable - and they all express deep affection with him. Are the interviews with Nilsson's women equally informative and mobile? Annie and Una, his son Zach, and cousin Doug Hoefer. The best set of heads I can remember in biodoc. The most blatant lack of film is that it displaces Nilsson's music. Even the performance of his biggest hit, "Without You," is shortened after about 8 bars. Arrrrgh !! There is no excuse for it, not because the movie runs for two hours as it is. We lost a few shots from the head and we could hear at least the song, and maybe one or two more, like "One", or his Oscar winning title "Everything's Talking". mystic and not attentive to his music.
