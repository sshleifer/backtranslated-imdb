Surely Arthur Miller knows. His stories give a clearer picture of what it means to live in the United States in the 20th century than any other writer I think. Focus, based on one of his novels, is no exception. William H. Macy and Laura Dern have a fantastic show here. The film is emotionally bruised, but ultimately rewarded, this film is excellent.
