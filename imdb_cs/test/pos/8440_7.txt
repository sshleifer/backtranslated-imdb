Thirty years since the production of this film, it has somewhat hindered the tension and will not keep the public as attentively as I am sure it did in 1979. Still, it is still fun - and regaining some of its power when it finds its sad today importance (see the story of the FirstEnergy Davis-Besse nuclear power plant). With the top of the actors and at a steady pace, one can learn to overlook the old 70's environment and see it for political criticism. I doubt it will survive the test of time. It cannot be completely forgotten because of his cast, but otherwise the dialogue, setting and score will make this film inevitable. Given that the oil situation is now comparable to the situation in the 1970s, and alternative energy sources are becoming a warmer issue again, we can only hope that the current generation will receive a warning about the risks of (privatized) nuclear power plants this way.
