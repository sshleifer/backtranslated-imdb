I first saw it at 5: 1, 2009, and after a day I watched it again and I want to watch it again. Love everything (well, almost, so 9 stars) about it. No color, beautiful naive stories, funny gangsters, Anna, working with the camera, music. Sometimes you just want to listen a little longer and the music stops. But it's not a musical. I like Anna, if she is the naive wannabe gangster talking, holding a gun, everything smiles. No, it's not so much fun, even though at some point I laughed a little, it's just so fine. Excellent work by Samuel Benchetrit. Although 3d nouvelle seems to be weaker, but they are also gangsters, maybe worse because they steal ideas. And the last scene is my favorite. I feel so warm and .. romantically. Yes, I would recommend this movie for romantic souls with a taste for such art films. And I disagree with those who compare it to Pulp Fiction. It's not about the actions and the twisted story, even if all the vignettes intersect. For most people, it is a calm and maybe a slow movie. It's about characters, their feelings, very subtle. Anyway, probably this review will not much help everyone (my first) just wanted to express their appreciation. SPOILER: This movie doesn't have a Goofs section. Wondering, no one noticed that the hand in the second part when the kidnappers decided to go home? Looks like part of the crew, hehe. I know it should be better after this forum, but I disagree with some policies here.
