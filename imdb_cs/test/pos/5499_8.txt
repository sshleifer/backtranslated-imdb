In a line of fire he gives us a great game of cat and mouse. Clint Eastwood is plagued by John Malkovich in this stunning movie. Malkovich says he kills the president and deliberately calls Eastwood and presses the buttons. He questions Eastwood's ability to protect someone. Malkovich brings to his nature a cool but very intelligent way of thinking. He does what he does for some reason and he is not ashamed to kill. Eastwood must overcome the suspicion of his superiors to catch Malkovich, but no one wants to listen to him. The result is a film that bursts with tension that escalate into a tense scene in the Bonneventure's ballroom. Wolfgang Peterson raises tension and feels at every turn.
