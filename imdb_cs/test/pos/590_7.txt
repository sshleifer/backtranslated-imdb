If I rate a movie maybe a little high, you can blame it for sentiment. This is one of the first movies that I remember when I see and I absolutely love it. I saw it on the entrances here in California in the late 1970s. I was already a big fan of "The Muppet Show" on TV, so I was ready for the movie and the movie didn't disappoint. Basically, it takes the entire absurd ethos of the Muppet show and transports it from vaudeville to a road movie. Kermit Frog is on his way to becoming famous; not because he wants to take champagne baths and go by private plane, but because he wants to "make millions of people happy". Of course. Along the way, he takes all his beloved muppet friends, the most loving Fonzie Bear, he meets in a bar that behaves like a perfect one. They sing "Movin 'Right Along", which has always fascinated me with its positive melody and its theme of friendship and discovery. He also meets plenty of Hollywood movie stars to fill the Stanley Kramer movie, including comedy lights like Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen, Milton Berle, and Mel Brooks. In particular, Brooks has a somewhat boring bit, and you feel that Henson could cut out some of these portraits if he is not afraid to insult the stars. Anyway, as it suits a cruise movie like this first person he meets, it's Dom DeLuise. The end is one of the more special examples of literally breaking the 4th wall you will find in every "kid" movie. It seems the Hollywood dream is falling apart when a real rainbow penetrates the Hollywood set with its authentic joy and mystery. I'm sure it was related to some of Jim Henson's own or spiritual experiences. This is the best movie with long Muppets footage. If you or someone else was wondering why the Muppets were so popular back in the 1970s, considering how poor movies have been over the last few decades, I think this film has at least an age well enough to provide guidance.
