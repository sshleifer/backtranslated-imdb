A fantastic movie with great Aussie talent. Director Mark Lamprell dealt with the issue of potentially sobbing excitement in a way that was humorous and refreshing. Definitely the highlight of the Brisbane International Film Festival in 2000. Australian film veteran Sam Neill was, as always, fabulous in the role of Frank's professor and new talent Matt Newton performed with a performance in which people say, "You know, Bert Newton, Matt's dad!" Get out and check out this movie !!!
