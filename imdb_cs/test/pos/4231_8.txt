The first children's game was an original and effective little horror movie. however, as it was expected, the two terrible sequels of this spell seemed to end. well, when I heard they were doing the fourth, called "the bride of chuck", I just turned my eyes and murmured "... when ever they learn." but when I heard that they got a great director, Ronny Yu and a solid cast including the respect inspired by Jennifer Tilly, my interest in it was nice. This movie is very well done. She has a great sense of humor, highly stylized graphic violence, great cinematography, and the tremendously sexy Jennifer Tilly, who started her most impressive stuff in the first half. (I should add that she is also a fantastic actress.) <br /> <br /> It holds the tongue firmly in the face without turning into the campsite. the effects of the doll are great and the verbal interplay between them is invaluable. it's more horror / comedy than direct horror, but humor is welcome and well integrated. I've heard they're planning a Chucky son. if they can match the quality of this movie, then this franchise may have made a legitimate comeback. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.5
