Scientist Carl Lehman (well played by David McIlwraith) gets something terrible in a deliberate chemical explosion. His brain is transplanted in the body of an almost indestructible cyborg suit by his evil colleagues, led by a sinister, obsessive fellow scientist Alex Whyte (a perfectly hateful image of Richard Cox). Lehman sets out on all sorts of killing. It's on the nasty mercenary Hunter (a terribly repulsive turn of divine Pam Grier) to stop him. Director Jean-Claude Lord, who previously underestimated the underestimated psycho thriller "Visiting Hours", visits rich action scenes with considerable vision and keeps zippy at full pace, ensuring that this movie moves like a fun sci-fi horror event trip. Paunchy character thesp Maury Chaykin easily cops top honors as the disgusting fat creep burt, who in the movie's most most tasteless sequence has a brutal fistfight with Lehman's pregnant wife Lauren (winning performance by beautiful Teri Austin). Handy Makeup Stan Winston f / x and the exciting score of Paul Zazy further contribute to the overall slim fun.
