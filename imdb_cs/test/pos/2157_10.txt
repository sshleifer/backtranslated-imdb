Hard Justice is an excellent action movie! The whole movie is really nothing but filming and fighting, but it has a very good vampire plot! For people who say they don't make shooters and fight movies they use. Well, this is a really hard core! Don 'The Dragon' Wilson is excellent and his character is really cool in the movie. Nicholas Guest was also very good and the show probably steals! He really acts like a fantastic villain! Melanie Smith was also good. I think this very nice looking actress is very underrated. Michael Cavanaugh was good. It was really great to see Vince Murdocco in this movie! When it comes to action, it's really amazing with all the weapons and super cool combat scenes. The fighting in this picture are really some of the biggest I have seen! There is so much that happens in 86 minutes of running. For action fans you will be blown away with all the firepower and great fight that this movie has to offer! A night hunter is a movie that is not easy to find and if you are in a video store and you see it for sale buy it because this movie is a great goalkeeper and plus box is cool! There is a ton of action that must be seen to be believed! Check out and see if you can find any good deals on Ebay, Half.com, Amazon.com From-Stores and Market Place Sellers! In my opinion, Night Hunter is one of the biggest fighting movies I've ever watched and the characters are so elegant. If you like Don 'Dragon' Wilson and want to see Nicholas Guest in great performance, then I highly recommend that any action movie fan who loves to shoot em ups, fight movies and vampire movies and has been disappointed with other movies he has to look at on a real non-stop action move but can't deliver it and buy Night Hunter today!
