Co-scripted by William H. Macy from, probably, Donald E. Westlake is the best and hardest to find a novel, "Travesty". * Very * true to the story, the movie star Macy as an unhappy man who gets too far over his head after trying to cover up random death. Costars Adam Arkin and James Cromwell in good support roles. The film's strength is in a complex twist-after-twist story and in acting, especially Macs who routinely and joyfully break the 4th wall here and gets away with it every time. A good story with a lot of dark humor that caught me so much that I watched it three times a week since it came out. Get ready for your critical skills and release a loud, bipartist "wheeeeee!"
