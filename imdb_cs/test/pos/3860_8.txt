The first Disney animated film without the strong involvement of Disney itself, this film suffers from the fact that the story is not particularly original or interesting (that is, I think, the only animated Disney movie from the 1940s that is not based on an earlier film). books or other work, but it is rather an original story). As others have noted, the plot is basically a cross between the romance of the Lady and the Tramp and the story of the kidnapping / traveling home in 101 Dalmatian people. However, to overcome this mistake, the creators have successfully used many of the better features of most of the animated Disney movies from the previous 10-15 years: Phil Harris (from Jungle Book) expressing one of the main characters, followed by his duet with Louis Prime in the previous movie with another here with Scatman Crothers. The quality visual appearance of this film is virtually transferred from "Dalmatians" (with some nice nods to French impressionism as it seems), and the villain here also strongly resembles the followers of this film. (This is probably one of Disney's least memorable villains.) The main story goes back and forth between the cats, and the valet's ongoing trouble with two country hound dogs (with great vocal work by Pat Buttram and George "Goober" Lindsey "). They are similarly known to those who have seen "Hiker" and "Dalmatians." The owner of a cat, while having a striking visual resemblance to a malevolent stepmother in Sleeping Beauty, carries none of this character's ugly features and comes as very warm and generous. The real strength of the film is voice work, following the first move to use the most famous actors in Jungle Book, the tactic is strongly continued here with veterans Disney Harris and Sterling Holloway from The Jungle Book and Eva Gabor The Rescuers made a very similar figure), as did the Crothers and Nancy Kulp, all of them excellent, especially Harris and Gabor in the leadership is as excellent as one would expect, showing different emotions well. Smaller children may be disturbed by a few short episodes (escape from a fast train path, almost one child drowned), but these are not presented in a particularly frightening or dark manner and are quickly overcome. Overall, there are very few types of scarier scenes in many other Disney classics. One of the minor oddities is the way some visual aspects of the 1960s are portrayed among jazz-performing cats in 1910. Paris; one cannot help but why the story has not become firm nowadays, except for the great amount of Paris that has changed when it appeared. It would be so much more meaningful. The song, which is pleasant and sometimes very entertaining, is not particularly unforgettable. However, the general energy used here, excellent voice work and subtle animation contribute to overcoming relatively few weaknesses. Far from the size of the classic "10", such as Pinocchio or Aladdin, and not entirely up to "9", which could give Sleeping Beauty or 101 Dalmatians, it's probably rather marginal 8 out of 10; maybe 7.
