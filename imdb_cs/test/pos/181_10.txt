While Boris (Aleksey Batalov) is gone to fight the war against the Germans for his mother Russia, his beloved Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) marries her cousin Mark (Aleksandra Shvorina) at the moment of weakness shortly after her parents have been killed in the air. . air raid over Moscow. With various trials and betrayals, Veronika will wait for a word or letter from Boris no matter how long it takes and hope to return to her. <br /> <br /> The incredible photography work of cinematographer Sergei Urusevsky boasts a powerful piece of film. Some of the many beautifully framed, moving shots include a scene in which the camera follows Veronica through a crowd of loved ones who said goodbye as she plunges through the crowd to say goodbye to Boris. even when we look at Boris, who is impatiently looking at the swarm without happiness. Sequence after the raid, when Veronika walks up the stairs that orbit the ruined building she once called home, and the scene where Mark makes his lusty movement on Veronica, while the next raid continues just behind the building as the wind blows through curtains and flashes. The light radiates inside are just two of many examples where Sergei Urusevsky shows his genius to framing pictures that last forever on film. But without the power and tragedy of the story of how war can forever shape the fate of a couple who dearly, deeply loved, this film could not cope with the beauty of the visual itself. But together they will stay with the amazing movie. Simply a terrible masterpiece from the Soviet Union after Stalin breathed the last breath. I feel honored to have seen such a great movie.
