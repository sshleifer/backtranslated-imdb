Greta Garbo plays in 'Anna Christie', a very early 1930 MGM 'talkie', for the first time 'Garbo Talks'. 'Anna Christie' is a powerful film, but not for everyone. The film is filmed as a scenic play, short series and cinematography, long for dialogue and dramatic characterization. Eugene O'Neil, who wrote "Anna Christie", is known for his dark work and the character Garbo Anna Christie is a bleak character with a tortured past. <br /> <br /> DVD audio quality was average. It doesn't matter that George F. Marion, who plays Anna's estranged father, Chris Christofferson, is hard to understand. Marion performs well as old drunken sailors who meet their mad devil sea on their madness. But his dialogue is written with a very heavy Swedish accent, which is true for the original O'Neils game. Mary Dressler's dialogue as Martha Owens is just as difficult to understand. Dressler credibly portrays old ruined drunk women. Her dialogue is also true to O'Neils' original play as is Charles Bickford as Irish sailors, Matt Burke who pursues Anne in a troubled relationship. Garbo is actually the easiest to understand. The strength of the film is Greta Garbo. As a victim of neglect and abuse, it delivers intestinal performance that leads to prostitution. At that time, Garbo was a big star and considered one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. Her look is not charming here, she is tortured. Her posture almost doubles in agony. She scrunches her face to become a poor creature on the screen. Garbo gives the viewer these anxious feelings to convince us of his suffering. This is a dark subject and Garbo puts it into life. It's not easy, not fun, not for everyone. "Anna Christie" is a powerful emotion extracted from depth to examination, that's one great ride.
