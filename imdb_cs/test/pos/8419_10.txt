Shwaas is awesome! Since the producers had a low budget, they did a great job. It is necessary to monitor. The little child did a great job with the many emotions that flowed through his eyes. Grandfather's the best. The photo is excellent. Technically correct and very creative. It helps to add many emotions to the mainstream content. The film will be ugrossed and don't be surprised if you are shaken after the movie and the story persists in your mind for several days. I sincerely hope to get into the final Oscar nomination <br /> <br /> Don't miss and miss it again
