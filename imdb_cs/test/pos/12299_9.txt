A rare exception to the rule that big literature makes unsatisfactory films, John Huston's wonderful farewell to life and movies is almost entirely true to the narrative and spirit of James Joyce's story, tender meditation on love, death, and the time of the twelfth night party event in central Dublin circa 1910 Waterproof as the material might appear, the film succeeds by its willingness to tell the story on its own silent, apparently meaningless terms, rather than forcing the conventional film shape plot points. and dramatic incidents on it. Just once is a bad note when old Miss Julia (a trained singer and music teacher whose voice was to be cracked by age, not broken) sings so badly that the audience laughed when I saw it in the cinema. Fortunately, the mood of silent and gentle melancholy is restored in sufficient time to reveal the couple Gabriel and Gretta Conroy in the hotel bedroom when the snow begins to fall out. I suppose it's a sad story, but the kind that gives you a better feeling, not a blue one. Especially recommended as a data movie - for people in love who are not afraid of fear of the sweetness and sadness of life.
