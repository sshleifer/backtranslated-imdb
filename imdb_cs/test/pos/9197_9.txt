This is probably one of those films that are too commented but undiscovered ... This is probably one masterpiece of Spanish film like some Bu√±uel's masterpiece. "15 days with you" could be the best "now and they" who could visit other movies from ancient times: it could be "Midnight cowboy" but it could be "Les amants du Pont-Neuf" or realistic and if not -spot-look (but most realistic) trainspotting. This hard story has a place for humor, love and obviously dramatic meaning. In the new social Spanish cinema, this little diamond could be the resurrection of Italian neo realism mixed with the best film Ken Loach. Probably the better movie I've found in the last 10 years.
