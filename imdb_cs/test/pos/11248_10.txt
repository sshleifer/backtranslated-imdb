The keys to VIP is one of the most entertaining, informative and cheerful shows on TV. The idea is original and well done, as it can preserve the aspect of reality, but it still remains fun. All referees have a razor blade. They are not the most beautiful at all times, but if you are looking for comfort, go look at the cub. Tell me what you like about the show, but it's absolutely real. I know the people who attended the show and confirmed it. <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh, watch this show. It is at the best comedy shows ever made.
