I totally loved this movie as a child. I can't find it anywhere! Sometimes I mentioned it to some friends and neither of them remember it! Can someone help me? My older sister remembers it vaguely. There was also another movie I remember being half live action and half animation, but I can't remember the name of it. The characters were animated and the background was real ... I seem to remember that it was about a kangaroo, and I believe the movie was set up in Australia. I come out of my mind and try to get copies of these films, which were an unforgettable part of my very pleasant childhood. Edit: I was looking for an IMDb for this other movie and found it called Dot and Kangaroo! All I had to do was put "kangaroo" in the search bar under the characters, and the movie's name was like a bell that broke up! MAN, I like IMDb! Thanks!
