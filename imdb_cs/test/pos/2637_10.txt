This movie was really fun. People who expected to see an Oscar-worthy comedy should get over themselves. This was a fun movie that shows you interesting and funny characters, charts, dialog quotes and phrases. I rate film 10 if I bought a DVD, or in this case, a videotape, and I watched it many times, and in this case still laugh out loud. I have about 12 movies in my 10 collection and about half have nothing to do with the Oscars. Again, it was just a fun, funny movie. I hope it works out on DVD. I highly recommend checking this movie if you're in the mood for crazy comedy.
