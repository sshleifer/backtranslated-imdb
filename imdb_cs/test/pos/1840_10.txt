Gracie (Minnie driver), a woman in her twenties, is on the waiting list for a heart transplant. Bob (David Duchovny) has just lost his wife in a car accident. One can estimate the result. Gracie accepts the heart of Bob's wife, though they have no knowledge of themselves. A year later, Gracie feels like a new man while Bob is just beginning to think about his social life. When a friend sets him up for a blind day, Bob is interested in the Gracie waitress in the restaurant where the date will come. They start to see. How long will it take for truth to become true and what will be the consequences? This beautiful, fun and moving movie is one of the best romantic comedies ever made. Two stars dazzling as the couple just heaven could bring together and supportive cast, Bonnie Hunt, Jim Belushi, and Carroll O'Connor, are just amazing as well. Housed near Chicago, the area is also charming and beautiful. Let's make dittos for costumes and script. If you know someone who goes to ga-ga through cheerful love stories, you will always be in good grace if you introduce him to this great movie.
