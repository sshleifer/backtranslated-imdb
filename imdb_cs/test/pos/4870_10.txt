OK, so in any Wile E. Coyote-Road Runner cartoon we know that WEC will prepare all kinds of traps for RR, but it will always be mutilated in different ways. This will surely happen in a beep, beep. Predictable? I think it is, but when you think about it, these cartoons show you the more you try to hurt someone else, the more you get hurt; Something like Daffy Duck is always trying to undermine the integrity of Bugs Bunny, but the mistakes he sees around her. Overall, it's another classic from the Termite Terrace crowd. Sometimes I think that if we really wanted to ease the tension of the Cold War, we could let the Soviet Union see Looney Tunes cartoons; I'm sure they would love them. Another great. PS: I learned "Jeopardy!" the middle name of Wile E. Coyot is Ethelbert.
