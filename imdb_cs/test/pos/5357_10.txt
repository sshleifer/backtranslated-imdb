When Wallace and Gromit set off on the short "Grand Day Out" academic award, they created a new new perspective on claymation. After two more shorts, Aardman's dynamic duo returned for this fun and entertaining movie. He has excellent voice cast, funny jokes and good animation, just as Aardman did! <br /> <br /> In this movie, Wallace and Gromit "Anti-Pesto", a rabbit removal company. When the word gets on "Were-Rabbit" eating all the vegetables in the city, madness follows. Victor Quartermaine, a handsome, dull hunter, longing for breath, of course wants to get a rabbit to impress the beautiful Lady Tottington ... but can our favorite duo Aardman save the day before chaos follows? <br /> <I guess the jokes were merry. One point, villain, Victor Quartermaine is, booty-crack was showing, prompting the character to shout: "Watch ... MOON !!!" Vintage Aardman! <br /> <br /> The characters are sharp and cheerful. Our favorite team of Aardman Man and the dog enjoy ourselves as they could, earning them a second Oscar (remember "A Grand Day Out?"). Helena Bonham Carter was amazing as the beautiful lady Tottington, Wallace's love interest. Ralph Fiennes was particularly witty and premonition as a cunning, blunt bearer of the Victor Quartermaine hunter. But the one who really stole the show was a priest whose opposites turned out to be a cheerful comic relief. Hats off for Aardman to create another masterpiece of Wallace and Gromit!
