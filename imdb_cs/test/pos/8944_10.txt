In this movie I accidentally came across Cinemax while I surfed the canals. I have to admit, Christopher Walken took my interest. And the setting was what I wanted, so I started watching. At first, I was expecting a serious dramatic film and it seemed that it looked so long for as long as I did not giggle here and there, and before I knew it, I laughed so hard. I really like how soft and cheerful it is, but it still has a huge impact on the audience. The storyline is very simple, and it's far from trying too hard to be funny like many Hollywood "comedies" are, but it almost made me rolling on the floor. He must see a nice evening rest, or at any time.
