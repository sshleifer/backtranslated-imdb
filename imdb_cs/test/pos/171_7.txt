Three ten-year-old children who were born at the same time during the solar eclipse will start to deceive someone who commits them. While the movies of a killer boy were not a completely new theme of children as murderers for this film at the time of this twisted 1980s. Bloody birthdays bring some good chills and suspense, while being a competent killer thriller with some special traits. Straddles the delicate line between kitschy and fearsome, but remains interesting and interesting. There are several powerful murder scenes, as well as a bit of nudity, to prove it a solid slasher guilty pleasure. The cast has a pretty good job. Young Stars Elizabeth Hoy and K.C. Martel gives some terrible performances, while rising star Julie Brown makes a striptease before an unforgettable murder scene. Veteran star Susan Strasberg does well as the teacher and Jose Ferrer have a portrait look. <br /> <br /> There's no bad entry all over this slasher entry, though it's not true, but it's worth watching for the genre fans. <br /> <br /> *** off ****
