One would think that a film based on the life of Japanese author Yukio Mishima would be a daunting, if not impossible, task. However, Paul Schrader actually made the film "About" Mishima, which is both excellent and complex. While it is not a literal resume, Schrader and his co-screenwriter Leonard Scharder (his brother) have taken several incidents from his life, including his sucide and crafted what can best be described as a random tableaus that is visually sparse and overwhelming. Mishima's homosexuality is almost non-existent, due to the legal threats of his widow, but still the film is still amazing and one of the best films I've seen in 1985. I should also mention the significant contribution of Philip Glass who made it a score that adds more texture to the film , and is better than the one he did for Scorsese's Kundun. Also notable is John Bailey's fine sharp beautifully colored cinematography and great production design and costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to make memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she won a well-deserved Oscar. Hopefully this movie will soon be available on DVD.
