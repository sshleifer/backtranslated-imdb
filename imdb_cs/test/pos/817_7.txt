I saw this movie for the first time when Quentin Tarantino showed us a bunch of us at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin. He outstripped how awesome he thought he was and how funny it was and in the context of his explanation it was HILARIOUS. I see how it would be harmful to some viewers, and this topic is not funny at all, but there are at least three lines in the movie that made me laugh so hard that I thought I'd pee. They won't come halfway, but when they do, oh god ... you die. Oh and Jim Brown is great. She's not in the movie, but when she's there, you know what movie it is. Of course, the best line in the movie (and the funniest one) is his; you'll know when you hear it.
