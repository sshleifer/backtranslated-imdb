Attention, My Lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifties and was directed by a man, Harry Horner. Robert Ryan plays a handyman hired by Ida Lupino to do some chores for her. The problem is, he's a psychopathic killer and he doesn't know. Miss Lupino is an empathic soul trying to win Ryan. It is not a kind of human compassion that could help or cure. So we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean good, but one of them can't do well because there's something wrong with it. He suffers from periodic blackouts, during which he commits violent acts, which he later forgets. Basically Ryan has on Lupino it's a hunter and his prey, or in another sense a sadist. The audience will soon discover that Ryan is a crazy killer, but Lupino takes much longer. That is why we must live with this knowledge when we look at the poor Miss Lupine, who is trying everything in her power to "win" Ryan to make things work, do work, live in life. But what's happening is not Ryan's makeup because he is incapable of any other than the most basic form of normality, and as soon as his paranoia opens, he asserts himself. As a study of mental illness, the film is not very impressive. What is superlative is to show the impact of a great mental illness, with dangerous psychopathology in the mixture, and its effect on a normal person. In this regard, the film is realistic and compassionate, though tirelessly logical in knowing that Lupino cannot 'fix' Ryan, but we want it to be. As a result, if one is willing, he can get emotionally into this film if he can postpone his melodramatic structure so to speak. Horner shows us how Lupine's house is developing, prohibiting a Gothic monster that never feels like home. Meet the staircase, kitchen and pantry; and find out which windows Lupine can use to escape and which she can't.
