This film is sweet - not cloning, just warm and kind. I found it just a bit funny, and the assumption * is * wildly unlikely, but the characters are so charming (especially Minnie Driver) that they have my full attention from the start, and I soon also had my affection. Bonnie Hunt did a great job in his directorial debut as well as a good writing job. I highly recommend this movie and I'll see it again, I'm sure.
