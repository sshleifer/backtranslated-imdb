I've seen this movie more than once. Actually, El Padrino was one of the best feature films I saw in a lot of time. There was a large cast of Jennifer Tilly, Faye Duanway, Brad Dourif and Damian Chap, who really shone like a Real Star in this part of Kilo. I heard that this film was shot for less than two million dollars. I've seen 33 million films that can't be compared to quality and production value. Damian Chap why don't you get offers and more film work !!! EXCELLENT WORK !!!!!!!!!! I can't wait to see the sequel, and I hope she has the same action. Jennifer Tilly and Sabeva became a cult classic figure. Damian Chapa moves coldly in every scene resembling movie stars of the 40s and 50s So sick of seeing these non-charismatic actors like Ben Stiller, who won all these films when is a talent that has something to show. great movie. GO GO ONE WELCOME TO YOU, BUT IN EL PADRINO'S SALE !!!
