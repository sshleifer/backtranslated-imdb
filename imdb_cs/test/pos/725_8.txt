This movie was probably the best "scary movie" I've seen in years. cooling can be a more accurate description. the end was unexpected and therefore surprised me. if it has any mistake, it would be overuse of the whole meaning of life conception. Because no one really knows the answer, definitely sail into muddy water when you incorporate this concept into a movie. put it aside and the movie is pretty nice. The Carly Pope should appear as one of the other bright young stars in the film industry. the rest of the cast was somewhat shaky, however because the focus was on sara novak (the carly pope), her performance anchored the film. The occasional poor acting skills of her carts were not a problem because it was not their performances that powered this movie. (thank God). Watch this movie you should enjoy. <br /> <br /> t
