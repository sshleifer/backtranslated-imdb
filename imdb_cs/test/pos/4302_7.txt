This is a well-managed Columbo episode, also with some good character, but the story just doesn't know that it would be interesting enough to look as well as layered and constructed as it was with Columbo. The same applies to a killer plot to kill his uncle. It's quite simple and doesn't seem to be well thought out. Maybe this movie wasn't taken seriously because the movie's atmosphere is mostly light. At least in comparison to the various Columbo films. For example, a movie contains a fairly large amount of comic relief, mostly from the very nature of Columbo. It makes the movie a pleasant one to watch, but it also gives you the feeling of being a little exaggerated times, also mostly because it doesn't match most of the other Columbo movies. <br /> <br /> The characters are good and it helps Martin Landau's double role. It is always funny to see how much he differs, even though he looked like a young man, while a man like Peter Falk, for example, has barely changed over the years, only grayer. The film also features Julie Newmar among others, who is best known for playing Catwoman in '60's "Batman" Life Action Series. It's funny as she moves like Catwoman in this movie. Intentional or is it just her way of playing? <br /> <br /> It's nice and good to watch Columbo movie, but it also gives you the feeling that it could all be much better with a better thoughtful script. <br/> 7/10
