After receiving a copy of the Bostocks Cup, I must admit that it's not as fun as I originally thought !! IT'S BETTER!!!!! Charlie Williams ... find your heart. Match fix ???? Never! Slope inclination to 45%? Ronnie and Reggie Kay? George Best? A coach driver who thinks Pontefract is in South Wales (It's all Ponty's and Ponty's that) Bertie Masson's (Tim Healey's) lucky cup hat! Sugar Plum Fairy ????? Confused???? Watch it again. Innovative use of real shots with Bostock players was brilliant and the manufacturer should be proud to have given us MASTERPIECE. Let's go to ITV to make viewers and do yourself a favor - show it again !!! Please>
