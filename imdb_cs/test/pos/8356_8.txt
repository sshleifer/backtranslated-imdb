Where should I start? Walt Disney's happiest movie "Lady and the Tramp" is one of, if not perhaps, my favorite in the Disney animation theater canon. But at least it is fun to continue. I enjoyed the whole movie. That was, (flame-shield up!) Adorable! The wide-ranging style of the song and the movie type worked, and I hummed the songs for the rest of the night. I can still sing all the songs if you asked me. But where the movie was really good for me, it was bad in many other places. The animation was sometimes a little scary. Every time someone looked at them closely, I don't know ... that seemed frightening to me. Also where the damn lady was? It gets like two lines of dialogue and at the end only the Scamp's dog hug. She gets a 0% interaction with the fence and her only son! But in everything, I like it. Does it hold in comparison with the original? No. The songs aren't as good (yet catchy), the plot was much less involved, Lady had nothing to do with it and it's not as cute as the first. But if you go with an open mind, you will have fun and maybe 'catch your breath!' Like?
