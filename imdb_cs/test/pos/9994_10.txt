I'm not a sports fan - but I like sports flics! So why ... what a great sports flic ... this. And the narrative style is very subtle. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a truly fantastic 2-hour entertainment experience, the "Greatest Game" qualifies. Here is a movie that moves. Bill Paxton went to the same school as Ron Howard - a.k.a. Richie Cunningham, "Happy Days". That's not bad. Look at the immense amount of fine work Ron has done after moving behind the camera. Bill as Ron was a great actor, but he will be a superstar director if "Greatest Game Ever" is a sign of things to follow. Beautiful Cinema - A Fantastic Direction - Gentle Gaming, Particularly Elias Koteas, Shia LeBeouf, Marnie McPhail, Josh Flitter, Stephen Marcus, Justin Ashforth. This is a must see movie not only as a "good feeling" or a "sports movie", it is a very good cinema.
