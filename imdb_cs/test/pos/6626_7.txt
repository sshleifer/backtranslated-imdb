I was not surprised that it was a very depressing and exhausting film. After all, it's all about the impact of the war on civilians And it's the "king of depression" Ingmar Bergman. In other words, so much of Bergman's works immerse deeply in human suffering and anxiety, and so this film does not look so extraordinary to this director. Although it's harder to watch, the last half of the film offers an easier insight into the lower depths of mankind. This is because initially the main characters (Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow) try to overcome adversity and are basically decent (albeit a little stupid) people. However, as deprivation after deprivation occurs, they (especially Von Sydow) become less and less humane and more animal - doing nothing to survive. <br /> <br /> Entertainment Watch, NO FREAKING WAY! But an interesting insight into human nature. PS - 1 thing I LOVED about this movie is that he avoided the silly movie chiche. When the couple sat down with the merchant to drink a glass or wine, he finished the wine completely! In most films, they barely touch their drinks or leave them intact. He drives me crazy because I would never leave a $ 4 alcoholic beverage without drinking it if it doesn't taste awful or there is no floating bug! BRAVO!
