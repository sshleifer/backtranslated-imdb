I bought it back a while, during a massive martial arts film phase. Although it is certainly not the best, I love this kind of movie making and there was a lot I enjoyed. Leung Kar Yan is one of my favorite martial arts stars, always appreciating that although he lacked formal martial arts training, he usually provided more than capable combat performance. He also has a good beard. This film has him in a good, heroic role, and although he does not dig as many asses as in some other films, he is still learning well. Early performances from Cherie Chung and Chow Yun Fat are also nice, also because Chow Yun Fat is taking those cowards without playing his trademark. It doesn't have to be a great fighter, but it does OK. Eddy Ko is as great a bad person as ever, as well as in many other movies, as usual. The guy who plays Bu is good too, I don't remember his name, but also the Magnificent Butcher. Although the struggles are not as good as other films of that time, the postman fights for being with great imagination, quality cinematography and a pretty unpredictable atmosphere. There are some very handy scenes, good characters, and a good eclectic mix of Hong Kong talents all put together in a decent effect. All in all, I would recommend it to kung fu and Hong Kong action fans. It doesn't have to be stylized classics like Shaw Brothers, or as a crowd like Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee, but it's fun.
