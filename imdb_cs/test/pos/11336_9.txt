When I saw many more Wong Kar-Wai (Ashes of Time), I knew what to expect to come to the theater; cinema would be fresh, the use of space and perspective would be diverse, acting would be excellent, and at least one of the characters would be consumed by unbearable loneliness. These are exactly the techniques that make Wong Kar-Wai art what it is. What I did not expect was to what extent I was drawn into a film that some reviewers rejected as "unfinished" and forced by characters who "seemed to be consumed ennui". <br /> <br /> I find it interesting how people can be so totally unmoved by the film that so vividly depicts the emotions and settings that many of us take for granted or work zealously to forget: the tremendous feeling of sadness stemming from betrayal ; guilt caused by the idea of ​​not being better than a traitor; secular but deeply intimate moments of relationships where you need to express yourself utterly unnecessary. This is what Wong Kar-Wai is trying to portray in film and what he is doing so well. Too many Americans are consumed by the need to have every moment of a film filled with stock exchange dialogue; funny joking, dissatisfied sarcasm and exaggerated confession seem to be the highlight of the "best" American movie he offers. Wong Kar-Wai sees things very differently. Instead of requiring viewers to learn about each of their feelings, perceptions, or beliefs, Wong's characters clearly know their feelings and understanding of face gestures, body positioning, and yes, silence. If viewers only think about this film in terms of character development and action, then they can be disappointed with what it has to offer. If they are willing to try and intuitively feel what characters feel, then they may feel completely different than what Wong offers them.
