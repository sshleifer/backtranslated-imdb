One cannot help but is overwhelmed by the intelligence and scope of this film, and at the same time disappointed with lost opportunities. I found the script that is excellent, and the loud talent of Edmund Purdom impressive. However, as his time artifact, the film suffers too many Hollywood-isms, especially poor casting, too much orchard exuberance, and too much arrogance. Edmund Purdom (who plays the title character) is so obviously awkward with physical acting, I suspect he was mainly in the theater at Shakespeare's Theater before. So if film people read it, I suggest it as an excellent remake candidate, especially if you have thrown real Egyptians like Egyptians!
