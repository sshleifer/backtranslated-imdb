I own a copy of this movie and I always loved it. However, I remind you here because I saw PBS presenting a concert version of Sweeney Todd earlier this week. This production was deployed at San Francisco Opera and played by George Hearn and Patti LuPone. In the early 1980s Hearn replaced Len Caria as Sweeney (Cariou won Tony for his performance). I saw Hearn and Angela Lansbury (who also won Tony for her performance as Mrs. Lovett) on Swwayey. They had to make a movie around the time I saw the show. To this day, the most moving moment I could ever remember in the theater happened when Hearn sang "That's my friends." ("These are my friends, see how they shine." "My hand is complete again!") Hearn's performance in San Francisco's opera convinced me that he had lost nothing in almost twenty years . since I first saw him play on Broadway and later on in film. What talent! It is compassionate, funny and scary - all at once; and can sing, the boy can sing. All this reminded me of how amazing the movie was. Highly recommended. Ten out of ten.
