People surprised me, after such crappy movies that got to the top 250 or just 7.0 years, I thought more people would get a kick from "Throw Momma from Train". That was a great comedy of two amazing comedy actors, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVit. Together they created a great duo of madness and obsession. Billy is a man who has just lost his million-dollar story to his former wife and repeatedly wishes to be dead, Danny has a mad and senile old mother who just abuses him. When Billy gives some "misunderstood" advice to Danny, Danny offers Billy a suggestion if he kills his ex-wife, Billy has to kill his mother. This is a crazy and funny story that can always laugh. Please sit down and enjoy this movie, people! It's good! <br/> 7/10
