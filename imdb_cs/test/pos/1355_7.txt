There is something that one of the characters (an aging film director who pretends to be dead) says he can sum up the whole film: "In Italy, the dead rule." Real! It is a country without a future, in the hands of old and tired men. And Bellocchio's mysterious portrait of this country, turned into a seemingly senseless story by a director who is supposed to shoot a married party to make a living, can say a lot about what's not working here. But foreigners can miss a point because it is not clearly expressed. I understand that Australian or Canadian people who look at it can get bored and wonder if it makes sense - well, it makes sense, but it's only clear to the people who live here today and keep their eyes wide open. like Bellocchio. It certainly is not one of his best films, and it is not as strong as Buongiorno, notte, but worth seeing ... for the Italians who live in Italy.
