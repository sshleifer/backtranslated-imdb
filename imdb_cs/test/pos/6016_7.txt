Based on the memories of Gypsy Rose Lee, who painted a much more kind picture of her mother than her sister, actress "Baby" June Havoc, in her autobiography, "Early Havoc" on which "They Shoot Horses, Don't The? . I saw Ethyl Merman in Gypsy's original Broadway production, and she was great as "Mama Rose" but certainly more "Merman" than Rose. I was disappointed with Rosalind Russell's 1962 film version. Otherwise, an excellent actress, Russell was a very wooden substitute for Merman. In contrast, Bette Midler was better and more credible than Merman and I recommend her performance as definitive.
