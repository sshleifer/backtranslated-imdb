Even after all these years, it remains a "perfect movie" for me. After a long stay in the theater, I still remember how it was over, overwhelmed by the experience, overcome by emotions. I own a DVD (of course!) It's seen at least once a year. It is incomparable and I cannot go to what has already been written about its perfection and beauty. So glad that others love it just like me! Note: The author of the book on which it is based - Michael Ondatje - has been captivated by the film and is quoted as saying that he wished he recalled some of the beautiful scenes written purely for the movie ... as Kip invites "Hana to his the side with a trail of small candles, and the way for Hana to look at the frescoes in the ruins of a medieval church.
