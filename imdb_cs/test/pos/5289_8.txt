For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's movies: he is still in top form and has made another useful experience. Okay, you don't have to read now. I think most readers are older than the two protagonists of this picture, so I should say that Ponyo is not so much a family movie as a way to remember the feeling that you are a small child: discovering the world you wanted to see it, make your own rules and boast with enthusiasm for doing things for the first time yourself. Ponyo turns away from many of the problems that all age films face. It's never condescending, all characters have a good heart and believable problems. Two main characters can be two of the most believable kids I've ever seen on screen. They are not simple, arrogant or naive, just curious, enthusiastic and learning in the world. They are so easy to love, but even easier to identify with. Many movies observe children from the outside, because an adult only looks at the child. Ponyo brings everyone back to this world. Ponyo first appears and chooses what matters most to you, which is highly appreciated by the film. It's worth remembering it, feeling it again.
