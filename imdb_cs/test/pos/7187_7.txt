This film is much better than the first "Astérix et Obelix contre César" but is far from perfect. Comic book customization is good, some movie images and dialogs are the same as in the book. But there are few things that made the film not as interesting as the animated film released in 1968. For example, the struggle between Numerobis and Amonbofis. This was neither necessary nor credible, not even for the little love story of Astérix. There were also some things missing, as well as songs that are in animated film, and some other things ... I am deceived by the film because they cut in things that I waited to see tho and showed things that I didn't want or need to see. I know it would be very difficult for a film to be exactly the same as a comic book or an animated film, but I expected it. Finally, although the film is good, I still prefer an animated film that is, in my opinion, much better.
