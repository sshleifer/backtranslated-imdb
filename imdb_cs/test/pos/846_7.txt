Believe me, I wanted this series to work, but Kevin Kilner's premature departure after the season solved almost a death strike. Robert Leeshock just wasn't right, and Jane Heitmeyer received admirable work as a leader, but the series became too chaotic and confused at that moment. I don't know what happened in Fifth Season, what's wrong. Sometimes it's time to drop a red cape and just keep a sword in the bull if you know what I mean. The only consistent thread that held the series was the amazing presentation of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as two Taelons in a peaceful idealogical conflict. If not for their talent and well-written dialogue, they would be two strange bald men in the B series. <br /> <br /> If this series could end in Season 4 and pick up SyFy later ...
