The thing with Ali G is that he takes mick out of himself and his character. Humor is considerably "similar or loving" to a brand of totally politically incorrect, irreverent and self-serving type. Personally, I really love this movie, so it has everyone I met who saw it. You can watch several times and select new gags every time. Humor is both phonetic and visual, and timing is perfect. Humor is probably very English, specifically London, so its non-English viewers may not get some humor. Think of yourself as a teenager and love it - especially if you like Kevin & Perry Go Large!
