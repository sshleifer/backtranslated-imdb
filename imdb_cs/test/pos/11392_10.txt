'Boogie Nights' uses his protagonist, Dirk Diggler, as a metaphor for a decade of acclaimed celebrities in an American shameful past, consisting of an unexpected increase in pornography, resulting in abundant spoiled youth. His leading character borrows features from a variety of genuine actors, engaging in a number of illegal issues that were celebrated by celebrities in Hollywood and too often abused by the press. It looks like this is the tall story that can appear on E! A true Hollywood story. Drugs, Sex and Violence - American Dream. But what goes up must come down and the bigger it is, the harder it falls. Dirk Diggler's dreams are huge, which is another valuable asset to his body. The real name of Dirk is Eddie Adams, a Californian man who dreams of becoming a star. He believes that God gives each individual one great talent on the planet, and his gift is somewhat unusual. After dropping out with his mother, Eddie leaves home and meets the slippery Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), an adult director who offers him a job. Eddie eventually becomes a major porn star, representing the leading "actor" in most of Horner's films. With new success, Eddie is told he needs to invent a new alias for himself, so Dirk Diggler was born. Eddie / Dirk himself is primarily based on the infamous porn star John Holmes, whose life story was revised in 2003 with 'Wonderland', which was played by Val Kilmer. 'Boogie Nights' is undoubtedly the best of both, proving that pornographic films can be made without disgusting the audience: regular cinema visitors. The film takes place in 1977, at the time of artistic pornography - filmmakers really believed they could compensate for the low points of X-rated features by adding deep stories and a fascinating atmosphere. Paul Thomas Anderson, a director of the film, is doing a very artistic approach to the project, resulting in a gratuitous and artistic film about American history, when smut was truly gratuitous and artistic. Anderson's style is so deep and so clear that we soon feel like we are once again experiencing first-hand era. There is no moment when we believe in the time span we are dealing with in the film. <br /> <br /> Everyone wasn't happy with the "Boogie Nights". Prior to filming, Anderson approached Reynolds repeatedly, asking him many separate times to play the role of Horner. Eventually, Reynolds agreed, but claimed that the film was a terrible and worst part of his career, publicly denying it, before being nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Academy award and abruptly shutting down. A year earlier Anderson suffered a title dispute over Sydney / Hard Eight. He preferred the latter title for his film, and New Line Cinema held that the former was more marketable. He basically lost the battle, and Anderson wisely avoided title disputes this time around by inserting the words "boogie night" into his film over the character's mouth. Film Casting is one of its best aspects. Paul Thomas Anderson's regular partners are here, as well as the top-notch cast of first-timeers. Naming some of the more famous stars: John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Luis Guzman, William H. Macy, Heather Graham and Julianne Moore. But the whole film basically borders on Mark Wahlberg, like Eddie, who is surprisingly convincing in his role. Wahlberg, formerly known for his singing career and disappointing Hollywood persecution, has all the necessary features to portray such a character. That's his best role so far. Anderson knows how to attract his audience and dominate every scene. When Jack Horner meets Eddie for the first time, Anderson is happy to use the background stars, the signs of what will come, and the hidden symbolism as gently as possible. The opening scene is three minutes, a long tracking shot that follows Jack and Amber to a nightclub where most characters are first introduced. It reminds me of a discussion about watching the footage in Robert Altman's "The Player" - it works so well at Boogie Nights and it's the first indication that Anderson knows what he is doing behind the camera. His style is fast-paced in the veins of Martin Scorsese, where he zipped around fast, but he never seems to be in a hurry. By the way, Anderson refers to two classic Scorsese shots - the final mirroring of De Niro by "Raging Bull" and watching the night scene from "GoodFellas". Anderson is a young, growing director who, despite his age, is remarkably mature in story and direction. While his first feature film "Hard Eight" was noticeably wise and engaging, "Boogie Nights" is all the more important. 'Boogie Nights' began as a love affair for Paul Thomas Anderson's account. After filming the extraordinary film Hard Eight in 1996, Anderson's film is pragmatic to such an extent that it seems to be almost true. Boogie Nights encourages us with its gratuitous content, sometimes bordering on pornography, but it is much more sophisticated than that waste. It is a flaming, gorgeous, modern masterpiece that is just as absurdly explicit as it is wild and stylish. Anderson's best film and among the biggest - and most important - projects of the past decade.
