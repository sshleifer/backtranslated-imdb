I just saw a very original movie that I would recommend to all, including "young and restless". However, I think that some of these blasphemy, violence and sexual allusions in the film are not suitable for all your children. Before the sandglass is filled, let me tell you the name of the film: "Sister Betty". Renee Zellweger plays Betty. She is a waitress in Kansas who falls into a trance and thinks it is the real life character of her favorite soap opera. For this reason, she sets out on a trip to Los Angeles to meet with her supposed lover of soap opera, Dr. Rubell. It is also being chased by some unscrupulous "one life that does not live" hitmen who think they stole drugs to add fuel to the fire. You could say that Sister Betty spends her entire life in the film. This situation, which is very "ungeneral", eventually leads it to a "hospital" set of her beloved soap opera. But the only problem is that Betty thinks it's real. It's like her mind in another world. OK! Enough! I wash my mouth with soap and don't mention the names of the soap. I have already registered my voice for Renee as the best actress oscar. Also the performance of Greg Kinnear as Dr. Rubella was as good as his acting biography. To sum up, my final diagnosis is that everyone should call Sister Betty. ***** Great
