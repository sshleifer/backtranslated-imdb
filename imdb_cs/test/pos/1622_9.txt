First I have to say that this film is much less demanding than the Da Vinci code. Certainly you have a religion vs. science problem, but don't make a big statement about it. his essentially action thriller, which moves very well from one scene to another. One scene in particular (it includes fire) I found very well done. Second, changes from book to film. Even though I was following the film's development I complained about changing some characters and completely eliminating others, I must admit that I was wrong. it was refreshing that the film did not follow the book exactly as it was in Da Vinci. if you are a book purist, some of them may upset you. However, BIG TWIST is still there, so don't worry about it. Finally, I am glad that they have removed some silly subfields and have not even tried to indicate how Langdon and Vittoria are meeting. Performance is really good, but nothing unusual. that's okay for such a movie. I'd give him 9/10, mainly because he brings what he promises to have fun, pure fun
