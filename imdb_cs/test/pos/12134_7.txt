Has anyone ever read Scorsese or David Chase (Soprano Exec. Producer) about "Death Collector / Family Enforcer"? I bought the DVD after I didn't see it for a while on the cable (like 20 years), but when I saw "Goodfellas" and the whole "Sopranos" still run today. In retrospect, both boys had to see Death Collector / Family Enforcer and engulf the taste, perhaps the inspiring tone of their masterpieces, both of which are the polar opposite of the romanticized Godfather Trilogy. Being a Jersey boy, it is interesting to see how the Jersey Meadows have evolved since the mid-1970s. It is not a marshy dump that used to be, although once in a while the body appears on a local waterway. Also, it's a bit bittersweet to see the newly built World Trade Center in across the river in the opening and closing scenes. Who could imagine it?
