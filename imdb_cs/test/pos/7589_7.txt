Every Sunday, it is an 11-minute short subject, featuring the talents of two young teenagers, a pair that would in the future turn into a note player. It is interesting and fun to see the contrasting styles of Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin who perform on Sunday's Uncle Deanna concert. Of course nobody knew how big of these young ladies I could be. . I've always wondered why Mayer held Garland and let Durbin go to Universal. L.B. she always had the prerequisites for culture, and he was the one who had Jeanette MacDonald in her studio and later hired such beautiful soprano voices as Jane Powell, Ann Blyth, Doretta Morrow, etc. at MGM, but she paid a big price for it. Deanna, along with Abbott & Costello and several Gothic horror monsters, have retained universal images. She was smart enough to get to the top and make her a stick. So in their salad days Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland.
