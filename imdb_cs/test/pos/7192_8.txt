The second live action trip for Asterix is ​​much better than the glued elements of ten different stories, called the first film, instead of being relatively close to the original comic book. In short, Queen Cleopatra has made a bet with Caeser to build a palace in Egypt to show that the Egyptians are great people. The royal architect Edifis tries to help Asterix, Obelix and druid Getafix. There are several laughing aloud moments, some jokes that only French could get (jibes to 35 hours a week) while others that are more versatile. Large budget special effects are spectacular but shaded jokes from the original comic. Depardieu and Clavier still work great as a couple, while Monica Bellucci is a perfect casting like Cleopatra. Also for comedian fans, cheerful pirates will look to cope with their absence in film 1.
