Of all 48 Brigitte Bardot films, "Une Parisienne" is considered one of the best. What we see is strange: because once a site has its own value, it does a lot more than just providing a cheap vehicle for a sex-packed BB look. <br /> <br /> This movie is your true and well-made light comedy, with a good and coherent storyline. From the beginning to the end, he enjoys French government circles in the late 1950s. It provides a lot of fun twists and turns and a few grotesques - all of which took place at least three major moves, including Bardot. "Une Parisienne" (= French for "Parisian resident") focuses on telling a story, not showing Brigitte Bardot. Brigitte serves the conspiracy very well with his talent for playing in light comedies. When you sit down on a couch on Friday night, tired and tired of weekly slavery, just turn on "Une Parisienne". This movie will make you feel better.
