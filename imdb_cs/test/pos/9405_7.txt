too bad to show palm trees that could not be more inaccurate for Connecticut in October ... that was filmed in New Zealand ... This case of Martha Moxley was "cold" 20-25 years ... her family worked hard to keep him alive and when Mark Fuhrman decided he didn't want him to remember just because of his participation in the Nicole Simpson case ... which might be harmful to his reputation (if it wasn't) ... By the way, he followed the police and tried to get enough information to write a book. ... using the flashbacks we can see the relationships that Marta has formed .... Carefree boys coming out of a motherless age and helping a father who has always been in a loop ... <br /> <br /> Plus The fact that they show real Martha, like she was a movie star ... she was a cute sweet girl from the next type. Other than that, the other characters were really great, especially Jon Foster and Toby Moore who played as Michael Skakel and Tommy Skakel respectively. They were also good, customers had to keep everything in the 1970s and back to the 1990s. I was wondering, even though I grabbed the boy Skakel. ..
