I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what strength it has! It was fun and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren could see it. It belongs with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was pleased to find out that one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These morning shows were a lot for them, they don't have today's children's cartoons. Today's cartoons seem to promote the idea that one needs something special, some magical formula or talent to succeed against evil or dangerous circumstances. While early cartoons did not mention too much evil - it was a much finer and safer time - they allowed us to develop our own talent and character.
