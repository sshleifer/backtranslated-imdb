There is this whole theory of horror that some people consistently adhere to that monsters and violence should be kept off the screen. Park Chan-Wook throws the concept out of the window and shows what it wants - and what it wants to show is almost anything it can think of. Leaving it to actors and dialogue to create subtlety, from a stylistic standpoint, Park is willing to do anything to get across. Whether it's a long scenario with a camera shining around a mah-jong table or weeks limited to one shot between two other scenes, a dialogue from the scenes before and after the bleeding over them, Park does not maintain a specifically structured style but focuses more to tell the whole story of the couple's relationship from virgin removal to complete dependence on total self-destruction - and uses vampirism as a legacy and priesthood as a drama. It's so simple, yet complex. You must give him credit. Too many people are ready to compare any modern vampire film with Twilight, with Twilight being almost always a smaller one, but the stories are actually comparable, but this is more raw and honest. None of this spark spoke of stupidity at night during the night, but anything, from the dirtiest, most desperate, and virgin sex scenes to potential spousal abuse, because these two nations begin to compete for power. It's the same solution - a man and a girl meet, a girl finds out that a guy is a vampire, decides to join him anyway, but without a happy ending, only with a limited time when they will be forced closer and closer to each other. lack of possibilities. Girls' motivation is particularly interesting because they desperately desire power and attention, to blame, frustrated by a man who wants to live in good lives, as best he can under the circumstances, but he is a hypocrite who cannot admit he only uses his Vampirism as an excuse against his moral training. The film is not perfect and tends to stretch (there are no three acts, five acts or some structure of games, just a scene after a character scene and a broken romance), but what's great about it is that Park Chan-Wook is willing to sincerely and sincerely show you while enjoying the fearsome tension and tension. It also provides a professionally chosen soundtrack that will hit the emotional high-notes very efficiently. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
