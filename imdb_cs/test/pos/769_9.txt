DRIVER CONTROL is a small film that sneaks at you. What initially seems to be a little fluffy, nonsensical comedy British style is basically a very nice story about the coming of age and the need for a significant friendship between young and old. Writer Jeremy Brock ('Mrs. Brown', 'Charlotte Gray', 'The Last King of Scotland') manages his own script here, and the result is a cohesive, incremental story full of fascinating and diverse characters, each performed by actors. Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint, who stands firm in his own place as actor for "Harry Potter") is a quiet, simple little poetic seventeen-year-old living with his bird watching Vicar (Nicholas Farrell) and his obsessive compulsive, rigid, evangelical mother with good adventurers (Laura Linney) in a house where "needy people," such as the murderous cross-dressing Mr. Fincham (Jim Norton), take precedence over family affairs: mother is, by the way, having an affair with a priest Peter (Oliver Milburn). Among other things, Sad Ben tries to learn how to drive a car. His mother is a poor teacher and decides she needs vocational training and needs a job to help him pay for the needs of poor Mr. Fincham. Ben follows the ad and meets Dame Eve Walton (Julie Walters), an older actress who is as zany as any character she has ever created. Hires Ben and the fireworks begin. Through a series of incidents, including trips to Evie's campsite, which they marry, two life lessons learn about each other: Ben learns self-esteem and confidence, and Evie finds a real friend who lets her drop her stagnant facade dear human being hiding. Julie Walters, who always offers the best skills in every character she creates, finds the role as no other: it's wildly wild and nice. Rupert Grint is the right choice for challenging Ben. The chemistry between the two is as gentle as in the classic film Harold and Maude. As always, Laura Linney is a great actress playing a role quite different from her usual repertoire. And the supporting cast is a panorama of subtle characterizations. This movie is a pleasant surprise and you will surely warm your heart and entertain those who love soft writing and directing and acting - and the message! Grady Harp
