This game is one of the best horror / shooter games I've ever played. The storyline is a bit jerky, but the game can never send you a lot of chills and excitement. Many people postponed the game when they found that there were no fraudulent codes and that there were very few medical potions and ammunition. But in fact, once you have passed the game, you are more familiar with monsters and different rooms, so you can easily get a second time. Puzzles are great, not too hard, not too easy. There are tons of different monsters so you will never get bored. And there are lots of game areas. You really feel like you're in a good Stephen Stephen novel. It's nice and scary. Choose this game cheaply and have fun.
