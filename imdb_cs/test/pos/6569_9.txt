"Uzumaki" takes place in a small Japanese country town where people are crazy. They go nuts over swirls and spirals. The crisis is getting worse because people are turning to snails and beliefs are everywhere. "Uzumaki" must be one of the most bizarre and original horror movies I've seen. The plot is really clever and the scenes with gore are really funny because the film is not taken too seriously, "Uzumaki" is beautifully photographed and the use of colors is top Characters are sympathetic and there are enough shocking surprises to satisfy fans of Japanese horror. Despite some merry scenes, the overall tone of this movie is pretty dark. "Uzumaki" is not as good as "Ring", "Ju-on" "or" audition ", but if you like Japanese horror movies, you won't be disappointed.
