The Beguiled is quite a satisfying film for those who are after the above things. It will be a disappointment for Clint Eastwood fans. Though Eastwood is doing his best here in his atypical role (except that his character is a charming little girl he is not so ignorant), the ambiguous nature of his character that follows from being a fallen hero to a manipulative and greedy woman The eater (to do it this way) will eventually handle too much for anyone who has seen him play heroes in the best Western tradition, morally a bit unclean, but still without the dark side. I think he can pull out this unlikely part, but those who really steal the show are two rival women, Geraldine Page teacher, and Elizabeth Hartman, a student head. We see that in every person there is a potential devil and a potential witch in every woman, especially in terms of sexuality and sexual desire. Hartman's Edwin is the sweetest, most innocent girl in the world until he becomes infatuated with John McBurney and becomes wealthy. This is what causes tragedy, as well as the director's secret desire, the forbidden fruit. He has an unbelievable and ugly secret about his incestuous relationship with his brother, whom he apparently adores. The fourth factor in this "unholy" love spiral is the evil Carol, played by Jo Ann Harris, who lures John from his crush to Edwin and to bed. The whole nature of the story gives this film a gothic impression, making it a very rare thing in the Western genre, but a popular thing in the 70s movies. The unique success of Siegel / Eastwood and the film not for the weak heart.
