It gives an ordinary guy / girl the chance to be on TV as their favorite stars. Most of the time it sounds like a singer they want to show. <br /> <br /> The next step to this - the team of people and customers is to dress the competitor as the singer. It doesn't have to look like them, but the probability that someone will get a sound that looks like a person who is exactly the same as they are very slim. It's a lot of fun for your Saturday night - and competing aren 't raging wannabes, such as on other TV singing shows. The fact that no prizes are included and is for fun means that they will attract another type of person. <br /> <br /> The only gripe I have is with the Kids version - it looks like they've done a stage school - what happened to normal kids?
