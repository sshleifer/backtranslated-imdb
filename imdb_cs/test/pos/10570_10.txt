This television adaptation of Sarah Waters was so lovingly finished that I couldn't find the words that would appreciate it. Not from "Tipping the Velvet" (also highly recommended) I saw such a performance by leading actresses, this time Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy. They behaved with their souls, and that's what gets to the audience! Supporters were also selected, made a great set. For those who think the story is just about a lesbian relationship - no, that's just one part. Another major theme is betrayal of the person you love. And the plot has other surprising twists. So the movie should be interesting for straight people or guys like me.
