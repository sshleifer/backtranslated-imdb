An opera diva has an accident that leaves the door open to her subconscious to take on the role. Betty (Marsillach) is now the star of Mac Beth, but someone who is hiding in the trenches has a planned opera. He gets his kicks off Betty's bindings, puts the needles under his eyes (so he can't close them) and murder the opera members in front of her eyes. "Opera" is definitely one of Argento's more ambitious movies, such as mixing with Shakespher's Macbeth, is the fact that the opera in the film is Giuseppe Verdi's version of Macbeth, but also Argento, just as Shakespeare uses ravens as a sign of death and misfortune. And just like ravens circling at Dunsinane Castle, who pretend to be a crazy Macbeth, ravens at OPERA play a key role in the killer's downfall. As in the old game, the killer acts to urge his lover. But I don't want to go if she says OPERA is supposed to be a remake of either The Phantom of Opera or Macbeth, the similarities are too fine. It's just a typical masterpiece of Argento, which gives this otherwise entirely basic thriller a lively shade of Gothic mysticism. with this movie and the final scenes in this movie are a little weird. <br /> <br /> All in all "Opera" is something wrong with masterpieces, but still good.
