Christian Duguay has ordered this neat little spy thriller at the beginning of his career. He plays regularly on television, though unfortunately decorated with some amazing scenes of violence and sex. Finally, I got to see a theatrical version on a $ 3 tape from a local video store. Naval Officer Aidan Quinn is recruited to be a notorious Karl Shakal, and has gotten into a role. Donald Sutherland Ben Kingsley plays Quinn's seniors, with Sutherland a true zealot and Kingsley as a more level-headed one. The first half of this fun game shows Quinn that he's trained and indoctrinated. The other half has him on the field, loves Jackal's wife and shoots her with various enemies. The idea is for Jackal to look like a turn for the Russians and let them take care of the world's most famous killer. Things don't get exactly right on schedule. Sometimes I almost expected the cast to be laughing at some of the fluffy dialogues, but they all play very straightforwardly. Finally, this is one amazing little thriller that deserves your attention. Jackal's former mistress, who teaches high-precision and very married Quinn to roughen her, licks blood from her face, and then goes down on herself, is worth the price of acceptance.
