I watched Love Life on vacation when it was filmed at a Florida film festival. It was a beautiful surprise to find a British film that was neither derived nor exploitable. A beautiful romantic comedy for change that enchants the audience's pants ready to sit and enjoy the fine pace of the movie. I found the transitions between the scenes a little distracting, but as a whole, I think Love Life is a winner, a ruby ​​in the dust. One for the whole family. Pleasant change to see a British film for a teenage audience who is not dotted with four words of words. Try to see it.
