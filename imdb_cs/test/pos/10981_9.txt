Witticisms, colorful characters, family relationships, coping with difficulties, living with fun and humor. This film has everything and more. What a great story of "every man (and woman)", with a top notch and script. It offers pure entertainment, lots of laughter, a lot of smile and pure fun for the whole family. Some reviewers describe the story. Will I just offer this comparison teaser? It's part of "Best of Show", "Grumpy Old Men," "Millions", and some other comedy and life splashes in one. This jewel of the movie most likely had a limited edition and is probably not available for hire. But it's now on DVD and I recommend it to buy. If you like old-fashioned fun and fun movies for the family, you can't miss "Manna from Heaven". This movie is a sure fire cure for blues or chase gloom at nasty weather days or rough times.
