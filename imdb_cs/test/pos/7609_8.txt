I saw this movie for the first time when it was still new and I was happy. It's a great story about Hollywood beliefs for teenagers. But it is not alive. Just as you would like to believe, these stories will never happen. That's why it's irritating to watch movies like this. They play with the brains of teenagers, just imagine how many girls in college believe in this magic and are disappointed. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my sister or cousin. The director should spend more time thinking about the plot instead of thinking about the actors. Yes, they (the actors) were good, but the idea is not worth 10. There are many movies about teenagers. So why don't we do better?
