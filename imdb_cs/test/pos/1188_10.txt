I first saw this movie in the theater. I was ten times. I just watched it a second time and I must say it was amazing. Music, dance, acting. It's a great story and said very well. When I was a kid after seeing him in this movie, I fell completely in love with Treat Williams. One of my favorite parts was when my mother was still screaming at him to give her pants and then finally said "how much do you need"? (money). That was classic. ; ). Moms are the best. If you haven't seen this movie because it came out, I'll say it again. It's timeless. He will do what all the great movies do; laugh, shout and think.
