Alexander Nevsky is a proponent of a film masterpiece. However, this age very badly. People choose not to mention it and talk about big battles and great music. Sound effects can be good, but in addition to the premonstration organ, all sounds are clear. I could be filmed by film enthusiasts, but I'm sure the modern viewer of Alexander Nevsky will agree that the blatant propaganda and scary music will turn the film away. I gave this movie 10/10 because it is undoubtedly a masterpiece. But he has his great pieces. German knight costumes are excellent and battle scenes are quite good for time.It is, however, a masterpiece that shows it's age.
