It is a versatile, insightful and courageous story about people in the life of a schizophrenic patient, their (and our) perception and realities. Although the main theme revolves around a wandering young woman, the story is flirting with physics, medicine, religion, and even politics because it challenges our perception of what is true and what is real. Konkona Sensharma expresses beautifully that the world Mithi lives in is as real as her. It is logical in this world and its thoughts are internally consistent, not the gibberish that we find in our world. <br /> <br /> Here are some great scenes you can watch while watching the movie (don Don't worry, these are not spoilers. I absolutely loved the way Aparna Sen hid the comments in the story. <br /> < References to quantum mechanics and relativity mingle with a witch doctor ("ojha" in Hindi), who performs her religious rituals that the "ghosts" who sit in Mithi's brain believe to leave. <br /> <br / > - The doctor prescribes the treatment of shock as a solution that is "believed" to work <br /> <br /> - The Perception Window - An An Review Book Scene. <br /> <br /> - The Illusion of Director's Illusion Searching for "Maya". <br /> <br /> - Reports from George Bush that tell the world that there is "no doubt" in his mind that there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (now it's not about Bush's perception about I am convinced that this is not so important and your public perception of WMD in Iraq. - One of the best scenes in the movie is where Mithi tells Anu "Charu sent this man to beat me" and Anu refuses. of course. Konkona did a fantastic job, giving a strange mix of confused thoughts in the brain of schizophrenics as her world and real world clashed. Aparna Sen was bold, but not brave enough to pose one big question: Is almost all humanity vicious to believe in God? She could put in several scenes of "normal", "healthy" people who pray and sacrifice for a Being that no one has ever seen or heard in all human history (the ritual / exorcism scene does not go far enough). That would be the final question: What is normal? Who is reality, is it Believer's or atheistic? IMHO, this film is a much more complex exploration of schizophrenic mind than "A Beautiful Mind". He looks at not only the sick but also the healthy, doing so from many different angles and illuminating our understanding of our own minds and our world. If the first one got 4 Oscars, it deserves more - at least one for each story, script, direction, Konkon and Shaban Azmi. It was really an experience to watch this movie and I'm glad I bought a DVD for my collection. This was a story that was very well said.
