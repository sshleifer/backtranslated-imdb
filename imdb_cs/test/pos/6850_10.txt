Carla Gugino literally melts the screen in this criminal. Her sex appeal, rich assets and sexy southern accent more than make this movie again. But the film has so many "other" things to be an almost modern classic. Simon Baker's introduction to one thing. A really big actor. Til Schweiger is so perfectly cast that I wonder why there is no huge "crossover" star. Gil Bellows completes this motel and literally steals this show. Other Gugino neckline easily perform best in film. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are so brilliant ... I can't even describe it. Great Chemistry. The music is so powerfully eclectic that it was a character in its own right. Wonderful to look at. People can say that Tarantino has influenced ... I disagree. It's uniquely unique and clever. Sebastian Gutierrez does a great job of directing this tightly woven film and cheating a lot of scenes that let me wind up. The end is totally ominous and you never see it. All in all, a beautiful movie that is for me the very definition of what should be a good movie.
