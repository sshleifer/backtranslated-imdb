This show has an amazing plot with good and recognizable actors (like Boston Legal Girl and Boris Snatch Butcher). Even the extras and the boy I thought might be weak surprised me with his skill. It's just the little things the director needs to improve. Like the one who recapitulates the last episode at the beginning of each new episode, he must be fired. Having a storyteller tells you what happened to what happened to the story. The only other little problem I had was that sometimes they do things too long, but not where there are shows like Prison Break. Anyone knows when it will continue the season?
