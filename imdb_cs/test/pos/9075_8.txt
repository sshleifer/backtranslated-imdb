My mom always told me to sit down and really watch this movie because it's one of her favorite ones, I've never done years before I caught one night on TV. This movie was great, I don't even know how to explain it. Not only is the cast excellent (Julia Roberts, Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin and Oliver Platt), but the story is amazing. It's strange, but not too scary, and that leads you to think. After this movie I stayed without a word and amazed by how much the actors and actresses are all really five. Where William Baldwin went, he is great. This movie needs to be seen for everyone if you haven't seen it go rent it, you won't regret it. Amazing!
