The film is a great watch very thoughtful. I believe it is a film about how you would be like living in a world created by catalogs. All the scenes are the perfect props of the Ikea catalog. When they break into the kitchen, they break into another perfect picture of how the kitchen will look in the catalog. When he is reborn or whatever you want to call, he will return to the cruel reality of life. I like the piece when she tells her new love that he left his partner. It pokes fun on commercial bliss by saying that you can have everything while it is nice to have the same things, but some things you don't want to share. Say without Say is a perfect ten.
