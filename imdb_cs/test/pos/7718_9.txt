I just returned from seeing this brilliantly funny movie. granted, part of the reason that I loved it so was because I could point out the people and places I knew ('I go there every day!', 'I work there!' drinks! "," hey! this is our postman! "etc.). But, still, if you're on "feeling-good" with a little spice (excuse the pun) - that's the right answer. Relationships, culture, and most importantly, love is all put together in a conspiracy. with preston (where the movie is set) recently from the city, it's good to see this job with the place and add a sense of look. is also a great representative of many cultures in this part of the north. <br /> <br /> Wonderful!
