Cute Movie feel a good movie I've never heard of this movie but ran through it looking at something to rent. I had great hopes for this film based solely on Flex in this movie. I've never seen him in anything worth it. It is true that this movie supplied to me. I enjoyed the story. The film is full of great actors and actresses. Cheerful Tasha Smith, Essence Atkins and, of course, Tangi Miller. I really liked this movie very much. I didn't give him five stars because it wasn't about some of the questions I thought the film should be described in detail. This question has probably been resolved, but I would appreciate the discussion that will solve these problems. I liked the film so much that I bought the movie after buying and buying it.
