It worked! Director Christian Duguay has created a very clever action / spy thriller. Actors Donald Sutherland and especially Aidan Quinn showed the highest performance. What a shame we haven't seen Aidan Quinn in other films like this. He was simply the best Ramirez / Carlos for what he was going to earn. The picture was very nice. Scenes are changing rapidly from start to finish, and the story doesn't give you a chance to get bored. The film is too underrated and I recommend it to anyone, otherwise you will miss something. Believe me, you won't be disappointed. That's why I give him 9/10.
