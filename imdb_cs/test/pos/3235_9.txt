Don't watch this movie waiting for Jane Austen's joke, sharp dialogue or smart social commentary. This time, the Northanger Abbey was updated in a very sensual way! In this version, Catherine's erotic dreams aren't just stupid fantasies, but joining the world of adult sexuality she's just peeking with her daily adventures. She is very primitive and honest by day, and her brisk Henry treats her with maximum courtesy. But as her own sexual nature awakens, her dreams shift so gently from mild to steamy to lurking! At the beginning of the story, Catherine's vision of sex is based solely on Gothic novels that devour in bed. It's as pleasing, sexy and provocative to watch her dreaming image of handsome Henry "dissolve" into a lurking dream of being kidnapped by romantic villains! At the same time, it is wise and touching to cut back on the bed in the morning - Catherine sleeps calmly looks so innocent one would never guess what actually happens in that pretty little head! Later, after Catherine was invited to Henry's Castle, he heard a family claim and did not fully understand its meaning. Leaping into bed, covering up with bedding and lying up and listening terribly, her striking blue eyes are the only visible sign that she is alert. Gradually, however, the beautiful blue eyes fell and closed as she plunged into another heated dream of innocent desire. This time Catherine dreams of being in Elizabethan times, waiting terribly outside the castle for "bandits!" It's pretty clear that she's more excited than frightened by the idea of ​​being kidnapped by bandits. She is shaking everyone with excitement and expectation! But then, after a frantic escape shot, we're back to the daylight world, where the maid chased her out of her room before getting into a healthy sleep. It is worth noting that Catherine's yawning with heavy eyes in the morning light is in itself a rather sensual symbol of how passionate dreams have been passionate! Finally, of course, Catherine's stern and unimaginable lover, Henry, wonders the nature of her fantasies and gives her a strict lecture. Interestingly, Catherine's immediate collapse into tears symbolizes not retreat, but progress into relationships with adults. In the next scene, she tears her Gothic romance and throws herself into bed. Significantly, this turning point is also marked by Catherine, who falls into deep sleep - except this time there are no dreams of believing passion. Catherine probably matured enough to be ready for the right one. Although Katherine Schlesinger has beautiful blue eyes and a lively expression, and all her performances are charming, it must be said that outside the heated dream sequence of this film adaptation they are excruciatingly boring. I give it to 9 stars just because romance can really enjoy it at dream level. <br /> <br /> If you would like to read a book about a really strong will of a young heroine who overcomes real darkness and danger in a true gothic environment, I highly recommend the Elizabeth Marie Pope PERILOUS GARD.
