This is a great production! I saw the show live twice in Chicago and my only production problem was the fact that I was only able to perceive fragments of what was happening. The stage consisted of three giant catwalks and platforms, and as action moves from one stage to another, sometimes you lose track of what is happening no matter where you are. As always, this is a thought-provoking sensory overload, skillfully captured in high definition with 15 cameras! The shots were masterfully edited, one of the best concert DVDs of all time in my opinion! I just hope and wish to release it on Blu-Ray HD-DVD so we can live again and again.
