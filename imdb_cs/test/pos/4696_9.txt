This is one of my favorite series, all categories all the time. I was fortunate enough to get a whole series on VHS a few years ago. I loved it when I saw it in -91 -92 when I was about 12. I love it so much or more today, which is remarkable given my (hopefully) better film appreciation and critical skills. Most of the movies I liked today aren't so happy today, except for the nostalgia factor. This factor is also present, but Robin of Sherwood is much more than nostalgia. There are just a few bad things about this series. First, the picture and sound quality is so-so, at least in the first few episodes. Fortunately, it will be better. Secondly, in the battle scenes you might have wanted a little more blood and realism, even though I know this was not possible in this case. So good things! And there are many. First, Michael Praed is Robin Hood. I don't think I've seen him in a single role since, which only reinforces this fact. As Robin, he gives such credible performance. Jason Connery replaced him with the impossible. The fact that Michael Praed did not become a bigger name as an actor is incredible. Or maybe it was his destiny to do it perfectly, then disappear. I like Nickolas Graces Sheriff from Nottingham. In fact, it is not a complicated character, but completely rotten. The relationship between him and Gisburn is just cheerful. Actually, when I was looking at de Rainault who was sitting in his throne, I was bored and looking at me, I laughed before he said anything. Another actor who deserves special praise is Ray Winstone as Will Scarlet. You can really feel sad in him and his hatred of the soldiers who killed his wife. Winstone is an actor who finally got his well-deserved Hollywood breakthrough (in movies like Departed and Beowulf). There's a lot of other great actors. I like displaying Robin Gang. They are having fun, playing, laughing, you really feel the friendship between them, the proximity that comes from a tightly bound group like this. These connecting scenes are so important. I think that British production with British actors is really better, compared to the -92 feature film version with Kevin Costner, who feels false, false, false. (Christian Slater as Will Scarlet, come on.) The cast who is able to speak English with a British accent makes him more believable, and I feel that actors, as well as director and writers, can put up a lot more in the series the Robin Hood gang than an American crew could have. Music is amazing, Clannad is perfect for the series. Music is another of those things just nailed. An exciting add-on is also a fantasy and a spell that is embedded there. It's not on top, but believable and just makes the whole thing better and more interesting. I also like the blend of comedy, adventure and drama. This is a few things that make this series so lively and original. It's by far the best version of Robin Hood I've ever seen. I will not wrap myself up with the quote "Nothing is forgotten". But one thing I will never forget is the fantastic Robin Hood for me. You see it.
