John Cassavetes is on the run from the law. He's at the bottom of the heap. He sees Negro Sidney Poitier as his straight and they quickly become friends, forming a sort of alliance against Master Jack Ward's tyrant. As someone who worked in the warehouse alone when I was younger, I can tell you that the warehouses are fighting, complete with falling packing cases and the quivering hooks are as realistic as possible. I was alone in these battles, even though no one was killed. The introduction of Sidney Poitier's widow is a variation on Shakespeare's Shylock "Should I not bleed?" This is an anti-racist film that was very needed at the time. <br /> <br /> All three basic characters - Warden, Cassavetes and Poitier - are excellent, with Warden being the most prominent of the three.
