This movie was great. It had everything a real fan of the event could want. A lot of people are shooting and / or mutilating, minimal romance involving sex, a hero who can be identified, violence at many intervals instead of an unnecessary conspiracy that only stores one scene at the end, and villains who ask for it. It seems that Bronson is at its lowest level of tolerance in this film and shows it. Ed Lauter makes a great cop and has no problem stealing into Bronson's conspiracy without stealing his attention. The film doesn't include a plot so boring or overly demanding that you watch this movie once and never again. Rather, you want to see Kersey in action and it just nudges. That's great.
