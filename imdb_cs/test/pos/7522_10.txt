Anyone who has spent time in a hospital or medical facility must appreciate this film. The land is absolutely wild, but fun from start to finish. Acting is excellent. George C. Scott is a brilliant doctor, but Class A fails as a husband, father. Diana Riggs, a sex symbol of the sixties and seventies (The Avengers), saves him from him. Surrounding is excellent and dialogue is very entertaining. I think I enjoyed the movie more when I saw it 4th, 5th, or 6th time because I caught much more of the richness of dialogue and the interplay of characters. It is worth seeing it again and again. In the near future, you just don't want to sign up for a hospital.
