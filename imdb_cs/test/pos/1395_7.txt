Although the video box for many copies of this film claims it is about people turning it inside out, it is a complete lie. In fact, in addition to the opening segment, the movie is not a horror movie either. With his sunken treasure, a legion of fish people, and crazy scientists, it's much more like Doug McClure's adventure movie. Obviously, this film is not a work of art, but it's fun to watch ... Just point out that the start is quite cruel.
