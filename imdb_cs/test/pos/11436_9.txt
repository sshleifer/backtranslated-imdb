This is an amazing new movie that is currently appearing in cinemas in my country. Her director, Calabria Gianni Amelio, is, in my humble view, perhaps the only contemporary Italian director, along with Nanni Moretti, to deserve to be called great (that is, except for the old masters who are still around and sometimes still filming) . It is one of my greatest regrets that contemporary Italian cinema has been sick since the mid-1970s, mainly due to the terrible lack of funding and care for new talents, which can be transferred to most fields, making Italy one of the most stable the industrialized countries of our time of production-wise (both in the industrial and cultural sense) ... unlike, say, China. And this is, among other things, the theme of Amelio's latest film. Few directors can talk to me about the true, current state of my country and the world, as Amelio can do, but his paintings also have precious timelessness and versatility. And for those who are already afraid that they may be slow, cumbersome and nice - sure: of those I have seen are certainly not, at least not if you are used to a quality European cinema. Basic plot outline: Vincenzo Buonavolontà is an outdated steelworks factory somewhere in Italy, probably in the north. It is played by Sergio Castellitto, one of Italy's most versatile and talented actors. When a major Chinese steel company buys some industrial machinery from an Italian steel mill, Vincenzo, trying to understand with a Chinese director who has not spoken in Italian, is trying to tell him that the machine is defective and its converter must be replaced with an he works on his own construction. He warns them that not doing so can have very dangerous consequences. Meanwhile, a young Chinese woman named Liu Hua acts as an interpreter between the two men, but she seems to be trying to find appropriate translations for some of Vincenzo's technical jargon. In the end, the Italian loses patience with her, practically pushing her aside and asking her to give him a Sino-Italian vocabulary so she can translate herself. Despite Vincenzo's warnings, the following morning he finds that the Chinese plant director and his staff have returned to their country without following his advice on the appropriate use of the industrial machine at all. Equipped with its great integrity, Vincenzo sets off for China. And here begins an endlessly fascinating road movie through China, a very topical 21st century Odyssey through the Asian giant. Last day Marco Polo is a search for the mystery of a mysterious nation? Not quite. As in all Amelio films, the journey itself becomes more important than whether it is carrying out its “mission”. In fact, the way a point is literally brought home, not with a touch of humor, is beautiful, charming paradox, and irony, so that my eyes were fixed as I smiling at the same time. The viewer is persecuted by the secret that Vincenzo's journey was ultimately useless, but he himself does not know, and goes home to a contented man, deceived by the innocent. At least you think he's happy. A bit. Paths that Ameli's characters go to in a totally dug site and download them to bare human foundations. They are currently without a name, a position, or someone to give them a word. These themes similar to Theo Angelopoulos are also explored in Lamerica, actually my favorite movie Amelio, closely followed by La stella che non c'è in the order of personal preferences. In the 1994 film Lamerica, two Italian blackmail travel to Albania to "do business". Like Vincenzo, they are going to go there, do what they have to do and then go back home. Instead, one of these two Italians accidentally ends up on an almost homeric journey through this devastated country just after the fall of communism. But let's go back to La stella che non c'è: once Vincenzo is in China, he predictably finds that the seemingly "simple" task of handing over a converter to a new owner is something other than straightforward. The new location of the machinery is almost impossible to determine unless it sets out on a difficult journey through China. When he meets Liu Huou, a young interpreter he has been mistreated with, he now works as a librarian, tries to talk to her, but reacts in a hostile manner and informs him that she has lost her job as an interpreter for him. in Italy. Played relative rookie Ling Tai, Liu Hua soon becomes Virgil to Vincenzo's Dante when she reluctantly figures that she could do worse than acting as a guide and interpreter for the Italian on his way (apparently for a consistent sum of cash). This young Chinese actress does not have the beauty of Ziyi Zhang, nor the magic of the movie star Gong Li, but her charming, expressive and pretty face radiates a combination of defiant power, intelligence, dignity and humorous humor. Forget as soon as you saw the movie. Besides, she and Castellitto have amazing emotional chemistry like star stars. Amelio combines dramas that are serious, poetic, mythical, post-neo-realistic and humorous at the same time, while retaining the heart's atmosphere. the ability to explore the fleeting nature of humanity in everyday, everyday situations. The documentary hides what is actually a carefully conceived tapestry of faces and places, which is also a view that can also incorporate cinematography of breathtaking beauty. The photographs here are functional and at the same time exquisite as they fit with the film on the displaced in the industrial and emotional wilderness. Amelia's Eye is adult, disillusioned, but never cynical or misanthropic. . The camera's camera angles also often make sense of Vincenzo's alienation in the eyes of the Chinese, bringing home a sense of objectivity and cultural impartiality, which is very rare in the films of the "known" Westerner, who explores the "unknown" non-Western country. I can't recommend this movie.
