Drew Barrymore gets a second chance at high school, on a secret assignment as a journalist. In flashbacks we see that for the first time there was a mild, big disaster. David Arquette is entertaining in a modest role as Drew's brother, who also writes to help you. Lots of subplots threaten, but never overwhelm the simple magic of the movie. Drew still makes her niche as the main innocent-sexy light comic actress.
