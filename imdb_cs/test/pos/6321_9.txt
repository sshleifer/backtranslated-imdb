The secret and its solution was a great noir conceit. But I have some questions, maybe I didn't pay enough attention. Who killed a neighbor and why? Who killed the surrogate girl and why? And some minor quarrels, they should show a stopoff in the hotel for the switch. Not that they should show the switch, but they should show Jim and the girl who went in the hotel, Jim went to the bathroom, went out and told the bartender that his girlfriend went to the car without him. then Jim returns to the car and sees the sleeping woman and the little girl in the back seat. <br /> <br /> This would allow the viewer to find a sporting solution to find solutions. I wish I could record it, I'd like to see it again.
