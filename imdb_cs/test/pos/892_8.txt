Like NIGHT STALKER and then X-FILES, the show created a fantastic situation and the main characters had to solve it. Unlike these, the hero (es) was not holding an empty bag at the end. They usually had tangible results. It was also clearly stated that "good guys" were in a dirty profession where they sometimes had to get some nasty stuff. Imagination, a joke, acting that has not always been taken too seriously ... I miss it. One reason is that I was hard to think about too many shows - BANACEK aside - which turned out to be a good job when the viewer grabbed and caught their attention just behind the bat. Writers excelled in the creation of extremely unlikely, if not impossible, situations that the characters had to find. the explanations, which often lasted 90 degrees, turned into a completely unexpected, however, yet it made sense. Too much, I agree with another reviewer that the Anabelle character was somewhat underused, but when she was on the screen, it wasn't just for eye candy. She was quite competent in her own right and stood up to both men's leadership when she felt it made sense. A rarity these days. Sullivan? If he wasn't at the department, he would work for the KGB or the CIA. It's such a cool, ruthless type. He knows how the world works and realizes what he can do to do the job. King? It's a game for him. He excels and he entangles himself with the ideas of detective / spy novels that he writes as his seeming "real" job. It's probably the funniest thing to look at the three, even if everyone has their moments and often too. I agree that any spin-off series with his character lacked the interest of the original.
