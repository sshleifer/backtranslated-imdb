Even for one I was very nervous to watch this movie. Although I knew it would be another type of film in the Revenge of the Foolish style, I was still overwhelmed. There is a lot of truth about this type of learning, and they strongly believe that it should be allowed in the "new style of education." <br /> <br /> Conventional teaching methods do not always teach students what they need to know or should know or want to know. <br /> <br /> This approach to teaching should be further sought in real academic courses. While there were too many at the party scene, it obviously had to be thrown there - for Hollywood's making a college comedy ... though we all know that life isn't really that in any way. Touch unbelievable, still funny and with the end of the killer. Amazing end. Crucial to the whole story and very surprising. Without the final scene, the movie would be half good. I liked this movie and it may not have been too much swearing or nudity or rough jokes to make it good. Great crew and cast, storyline and even the general type of broadcasting mandatory members "Hampton frat" was well done. American Pie 1, 2 3 and American Wedding or whatever clones do what they do, up to 1/3. Much better than most comedy about first year college with no. humiliating stupid jokes to make someone pervert. I liked it, although it was simple ... it was interesting and even my heart ... my only regret for watching this movie is that it wasn't longer.
