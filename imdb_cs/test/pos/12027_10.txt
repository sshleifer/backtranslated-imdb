I laughed for an hour. I didn't know who Dan Finneity was. Why haven't I heard of Dan Finnerty yet? He's hysterical, just like his backup singers. They do all these women's songs that we never want to hear a new experience. These songs blow away. That was last night on Bravo. Why isn't this Dan guy like "ultra famous"? Great voice! Charisma burn! He blew me off this show! I just read on the internet that he was once a member of "Stomp" I think there's nothing he can't do. I saw "Stomp" in the UCLA theater years ago and those guys were amazing. This show was made by Dreamworks last night! Does that mean Spielberg? Why doesn't Dan Finnerty start this movie. At the end of the show, there was a voice and every time the camera was cut to the audience, everyone was singing, singing or dancing. The whole show had this amazing energy. My only complaint was that it wasn't longer, but looking back at seeing how much energy these guys made, I think it wouldn't be possible for any human being with such a taste to function for more than an hour. I loved this show!
