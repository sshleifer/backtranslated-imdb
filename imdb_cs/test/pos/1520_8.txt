Earth's closet is not a happy movie. Nor is it associated with any kind of social realism. This is perhaps his strength. The distance from concrete time and nations strengthens the message, makes it stronger and tears off the burden of nationalism and propaganda, which often reflects a burden in films that appear to criticize nations in opiates (of course, I am mainly talking about US propaganda in the US). some commercial movie). The country bit box is much more than a message. It's a film of pure, surrealistic beauty, filled with the same pure, clinical form you find at work, like 1984, and it's the same. I am an old big fan of Alan Rickman, a man with a gold sarcasm (and I would add that this is incomparable sex appeal ;-)). The show between him and Madeleine Stowe is great. Every time I see him, he seems to play the character even more ugly than the last one. But pretty sweet tape. The film is missing in action. I don't want to crash any cars, but I want something to happen, except for a clean conversation. After an hour, I was really tired of the interrogation room, the predictable actions, and more than anything I wanted a more complicated look at everything, the world, the earlier lives of the characters, and the rest of the framework that was missing. For some people a nice touch. For me something less positive. By the way, Closet Land is a film that is worth it so you can embark on a journey into the abyss of human nature. Of course for us who really love Always Evil Alan Rickman.
