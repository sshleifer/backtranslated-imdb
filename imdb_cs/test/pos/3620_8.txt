Obviously, for the cheap to earn on the notorious "Mandingo", this goofy panding piece of blithely rancid Italian sexploitation junk really pours on dirty things with commendable lack of appetite and restraint: The evil arrogant white family who owns and operate a rich bondage plantation spends Most of the time the screen is plugged into hank dolls by each other and their various slaves. Director Mario Penzauti and screenwriter Tecla Romanelli have done this fruitful dirt with the overflowing excess of hissing sleaze: we have nasty rape, interracial copulation (one white lady makes wild love for a muscular black stud while he is tied to a cross), abundant nudity woman, brutal whippings, ugly degradation, a lot of lurid soft-core sex and a seriously twisted tragic surprise that unites the elements of incest, murder and dishgenesis in a dubious attempt to make a statement about the horrible inhumanity of slavery. The special kudos are fine for the foxy brunette actress Paola D'Egidio, whose lusty and unlimited depiction of a corrupt and lascivious evil bitch, Rhonda, will burn positively on the screen. In addition, Marcello Giombini's funky, pulsing tribal score will hit a groovy spot. Mauriz Centini's relatively polished cinematography also does the trick. Pleasing sea piece of slimy water.
