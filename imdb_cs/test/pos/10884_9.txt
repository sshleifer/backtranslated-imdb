What can be said about one of the biggest N64 games ever? That the action is fast enough to keep a seasoned veteran of the FPS Veterans literally? That graphics is great, up to the blasts that everyone loves to see? That nothing is as fun as playing multiplayer mode, and filming your friends and siblings in the back with machine guns? Very little defeats Goldeney's 007. The only thing missing was voice playing and a little more enemy soldiers. If you have an N64 and you love shooting people and stuffed spying, take it.
