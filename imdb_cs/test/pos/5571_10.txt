I admit that when I first captured Sci-Fi "Sci-Fi Prime" last week, but despite the fact that I was a fan of Sliders coming to the scene, Farscape is now easily my favorite of the four shows. Unlike most modern Sci-Fi shows (including, unfortunately, two new Star Trek series), this show can be fun without encountering MST3K feed.
