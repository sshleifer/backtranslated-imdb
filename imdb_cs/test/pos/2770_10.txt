I am completely disgusted that this film is not sold. Everyone who loves this movie should send a Disney e-mail and demand for it. Eventually they would have to sell it. I would buy copies for everyone I know. Everything and everyone did a good job in this movie, and I didn't find out why Disney didn't put this movie on DVD or VHS rental. At least I didn't see any copies. This is a bad good movie and should be seen by everyone. Children in the new generation can't see it and I think they should. It should be at least returned to the channel. This movie doesn't deserve a cheap download. He deserves the right thing. Now I am sending them by e-mail. This movie will be on DVD.
