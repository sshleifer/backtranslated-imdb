Cooley High is considered one of my best films of all time. Certainly reminds me of the days of my youth growing up in the towns of Cleveland and Chicago in the early, mid and late 1960s. What happened to Brenda and Pooter? Someone must follow these two sisters. Brenda for her beauty and Pooter for his innocent joke. Both deserve to be recognized even 31 years after the film was debuted. I think many fans of this movie would like to find out what happened to them, as well as the others who did it in this fun movie. I'm sure I think this movie should be put in some kind of FAME FILM HALL. The whole cast of this movie was great. My opinion on "Cooley High" is back in the hands of time, it was fun years.
