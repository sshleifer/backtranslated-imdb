This show is absolutely fun and is not trying to be a Greek drama. It certainly contains elements of what's with all the plots, but it's extremely engaging and fun. Las Vegas is the perfect venue for the show and will never be short of material to work with! Anything and everything is happening there! Actors in this show are extremely personal and you really want to see what they are up to and up to each week. The show is also very fun. Humor comes from characters and situations. It's not just thrown without reason. In this respect, it is a well-formed show. I'm definitely looking forward to Friday night and I'm happy to have my first two seasons on DVD!
