For the first time I saw this movie in a theatrical journey back in the 1940s when I was a kid and always remembered the end. There is nothing like the first impression, but some movies are always every time they are displayed. With them something resonates. This is one of those films and I agree with another reviewer who said Fritz Lang should direct more Westerns. To add that, I always liked Randolph Scott and Robert Young. In fact, Robert Young stars in what I consider my favorite movie, if I have to name just one, it's not an easy thing. The movie is Northwest Passage. This led me to Kenneth Robers' great historical novels. Western Union also brought me to read Zane Gray's novel, which in this case proved to be one of those rare times when I like the film better than the novel. Not that Gray's novel is bad; I like a better film story. The film is by no means similar to the novel. It is a completely different story, one of the greatest exits from the book I have seen. <br /> <br /> I can't add to other reviews except I agree with many of them. I also wish it was released on DVD. "What happened to Randolph Scott became the best of me."
