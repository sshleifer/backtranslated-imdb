I found this movie on Netflix and I had to add it to my queue. I wasn't disappointed when I got it because it's just as funny as when I saw it at the local theater at the time. <br /> <br /> It is on top of you with you. Different characters start their journey through America on "Honky Tonk Freeway, America on Wheels." This was a special comedy role for William DeVane as I remember him as Kennedy in the 1974 television movie "October Rockets" and felt that no one could pull that dramatic character off as well as he did. It reminds me of a bit of Dick Van Dyke in "Cold Turkey" where Van Dyke played a local minister, the role of DeVane as mayor, minister and activist was typical of small towns, so his character seems fun and real. Howard Hessman and Teri Garr as a spoiled family in RV were also at the finish for the time, just as anyone who traveled across the country with young children (still there?) will appreciate these scenes. The shots of a small town trying to survive reminded me of the little town I grew up in, but managed to charm and humor, which you often saw only in small towns. cities disappear due to the highway system and it gives a realistic if humorous look at what they were supposed to do to survive. (Does anyone use zoo animals?) All in all, it's a light comedy without a special message, but a funny look at America during the early 1980s. It's worth watching if you need a little good mood.
