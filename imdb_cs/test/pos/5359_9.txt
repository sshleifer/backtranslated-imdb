This first (and perhaps not the last) Wallace & Gromit feature meets expectations. There are plenty of jokes (some a little cheeky) as well as some great tributes to past science fiction movies. With the horror of horrible and formal movies being spewed out of Hollywood it is great to see such a great movie like this which is nice to almost everyone. If there is any justice, it will be the top of the box office and will at least be nominated for the best animation in the next Oscars. The animation is amazing; the characters are remarkably expressive and their adventure is great fun. This is one of the films that the whole family can enjoy. Charming, clever, entertaining and well done, what not to enjoy?
