THIS OVERVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! The decline of Western civilization ...... what a great title eh? And a rough great movie. This is the best movie I've ever seen. The close second being the talking heads of the film "stop making sense". I first heard about this film when Waynes World was released in 1992. I looked at the name of director Penelope Spheeris and thought of a cold name, what else did he direct? I thought the first name was pronounced as an envelope. After some time looking at the film guide I came across a critically acclaimed decline and realized that Penelope was a woman ..... my mum corrected me. I spent 8 years of my life trying to watch it. I finally saw it at VHS in Vancouver, where I currently live. It's worth waiting. This very well captures the LA punk movement. This is teenage anxiety for the best people. My favorite is the Germ group, which needs subtitles for lyrics, because Darby Crash sings so insane that you don't understand. I laughed when I saw it. Black Flag lives in an abandoned church, and X is a very intelligent bunch. He also laughed at a letter an idiot writes to Slash about how we don't need to save whales. After this I became a big fan of Penelope Spheeris and I saw all her punk movies-Dudes was OK and Suburbia is a cult classic! I own both on VHS. She's a real underground filmmaker and I love her stuff. I'd like to see this movie in 1994 when grunge was so popular. Then I was a big Nirvana fan, but unfortunately I saw it in 2002 and at that moment I grew out of grunge and now I'm listening to Crystal Method / Fatboy Slim. Quite a pace change, I know, but what can you do? But if you want a real punk movement, it's better than anything else. Much better than in 1991: Punk of the Year. It's a hard film that can be traced, but if you take your hands on it, you rent it, even if you don't like music, it's a great work. The days that would be easier to find are now so popular. By the way, Penelope produced a little known Albert Brooks film called "Real Life", which I also own. Very funny stuff in today's reality craptacular TV! Rent Decline ...... Highly recommended! Thanks!
