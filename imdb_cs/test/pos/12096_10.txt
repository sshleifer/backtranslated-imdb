This movie is one of the most memorable movies I've ever seen. I reluctantly went with a Turkish friend who recommended it. I am not an enthusiastic advocate of music documentaries, but when Aynur Dogan, a Kurdish woman who for several years banned singing in Turkey, sings her piece, the theater was astonished. I would like to give everyone a CD recording of this scary, wonderful song. And he's just one of the many artists they meet and record, and talks about his experience in performing in Istanbul. Even now, one month later, I recall Aynur's record in the acoustic hall and try to remember the music as it was in the cinema. Good work with the director of this film Faith Akin and his great idea to capture the many wonderful sounds of such a cosmopolitan city. They will certainly encourage me to visit Istanbul.
