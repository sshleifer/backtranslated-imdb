I saw a new film D tonight at a special pre-screening and I was so impressed by my sheer size that I felt I had to come to the IMDb and get the word out. It is true that I was already a huge fan of D's work - I loved the HBO series and listened to their music weekly (there's nothing better to sing with it), but this award actually made me even more worried to get into today's screening (For All of Us we are one or the other disappointed with something we love when they try to jump to the big screen with Tenacious D's "The Pick of Destiny", that's not the case. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this movie is harder than anything I've seen and is more fun and majestic than anything other than Peter Jackson, Pixar, and Will Ferrell could make it together, telling story D before we met them, created interesting Kage and Jables' histories upbringing, their coming together and how they were inspired to write songs about things like Lee, Sasquatch and Dio. "Tribute" and how it happened (which is different from the version of the HBO Series). After you have seen it, it probably will not be able to remember (ie Tribute), but your mind will be forever changed his genius. I'm not often going to the cinema anymore because of the high price of tickets and the problems with parking, paying blatant concessions, etc., but I usually make exceptions when somebody I really love or something about the same variety plays. "The Pick of Destiny" was so good that I had no qualms about seeing it again when it went out nationwide, and I plan to convince all my friends to leave. Last week we saw "Borat" and loved him, but that is honest with the good TEN TIMES BETTER. For anyone who really loves rock music and comedy brilliance, see this movie. The talent of these guys is so great that you shouldn't hesitate to support their cause. You will not be disappointed and rock gentlemen will rejoice at you.
