This is a really great movie! He'll get you thinking about your parents. As we all have the fragile relationships we all have with them unless we really try to figure out who they are like people. And equally important, we should remember to open ourselves and show them our real self, not just what we think they want us to be. Check out this document! IMDb makes me write more text than they will be after my commentary as special. Usually online comments must be short, and here I am asked to write more! Well, I went to see a movie with my parents, I thought later that they wanted to talk about their parents, but my dad wanted to talk about himself and things in life that he thought was okay. He wasn't a restrained man, but I was surprised he wanted to talk about the mistakes he thought he'd made. Mike and Kitty came to the film to do Q&A and after my father talked to Mike, a merry moment came while Mom talked to Kitty! I really just ignore my last few sentences to post this comment, and just remember '51 Birch Street, 'go see it!
