He didn't have so much desire for this movie, but he was pleasantly surprised. Very well made film, very well cut, does not really reach the height that Human Traffic did, but it is a very good effort. Well directed and I thought the lead actor got into excellent performance! In fact the only really bad performance in the film was from Tim Curry, who's supposed to be the name. Cool Movie surprised he didn't do it better than he has. I never heard of it until I saw it with my friends. <br /> <br /> I'm not a raver, but I think people who really like this movie.
