The film starts with a rough old Broadway producer (an exceptionally well-playing veteran actor Richard Carl), who is driven by a man who hopes to sell him a story for the upcoming game. However, there is a bad storm and their car gets stuck in the mud, so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. Fortunately, there is a castle nearby, though it seems strange that people inside know the writer and says he did not realize it was the home of the man he knew (and despised). However, although it looks like bad and inventive writing, it's not .... because it's all part of a sophisticated ruse writer to let a group of actors in the home stand out from his plot. However, on a partial journey through the ruse, the producer and his browbeaten assistant find that the mystery of the murder that takes place in the house is fake and I think the whole affair is pretty funny. But what no one realizes is that the leaked maniac is free and he is about to enter this tiny conspiracy - doing some awesome twists and turns. So when there is a real murder, the actors are really scared, while Carle and his sidekick are convinced it's all a scam. While I have explained some of the conspiracy, there are many other aspects of the movie that you will need to find out for yourself - and it's sure to entertain you and guess. As it is a B-movie in the public domain, I certainly didn't have too much hope for this little movie. However, I was thrilled when the film turned out to be much better than the average film - with a very interesting and Romanesque twist on the old clich√© of a dark and stormy night at the mansion. In addition, while the rendering of the film was very good, the dialogue was even better - with a lot of bright joke and a pleasant light pace. Full of pleasant surprises and well worth your time.
