Mel Brooks really overcame himself on this film. No one can deny that Blazing Saddle was a classic, and a breakthrough in this style of comedy movie, but Men in Stockings became the highlight of his creative genius. This movie is sure to be seen. If you like this movie, I would also recommend Space Balls and History Of The World. The same is true in reverse. If you've seen any of these movies, then there should be more men in Tights in your list.
