This satire is just really dead and nobody is spared. But even though this movie has a lot of laughter in a silly story and a grotesque imitation of Hitler (here cleverly renamed "Hynkel" and talking in funny pseudo-German), the general tone is quite sad, maybe because of the film's place in history. And the actors do not exaggerate too much. One of the greatest film moments of all time must be the end of the Jewish barber shop, if only things can end up in this way. It's no longer even talking to a character, it's Chaplin saying something he really wanted to say. If you ignore the technical aspects, the film doesn't feel old or old, it actually moves at a pretty nice pace. And the sharp humor we find everywhere in this work never dies, the only thing I don't care about is a grotesque, but that comes with the time I suppose. It's an incredibly daring, cruel move with fascism, it's so hard after all these years.
