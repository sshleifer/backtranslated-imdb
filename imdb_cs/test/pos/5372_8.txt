Ben (gentle Charles Bateman), his young daughter K.T. (cute Geri Reischl) and his new girlfriend Nicky (very attractive Ahna Capri) are on their way to a birthday party for K.T. They unexpectedly find themselves in a remote southern city where no one can leave, except for Ben, K.T. To begin with, children disappear and adults are murdered at an alarming rate.
