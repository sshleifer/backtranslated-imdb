This film is one of my most beautiful childhood memories. When they saw the Muppets (at the height of their popularity), Hollywood, singing and dancing, Miss Piggy, who was charmed by her beloved Kermit, Fozzie Bear does the best the manager does, and the generous cast of "add-ons" that bring the film to he turned. out to be "okey dokey". Kermit's melancholy number "ukulele" Rainbow Connection was nominated for an Oscar in that year, but it was beaten by Norma Rae "It Goes Like It Goes". I'll pick up Kermit's song every day! Get the kids and enjoy this timeless imagination ... once they find it, rainbow connections, lovers, dreamers and me!
