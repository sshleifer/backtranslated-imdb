When I first saw the movie, I was a kid. I was ten years old when it was released, but because my family never went to the movies, I saw it on Network TV. I remember watching it myself? It was only the second film that did not allow this reaction (Rocky was the first) and there have not been many since then. I can't say why exactly; Larry "Rain" Murphy didn't deserve to win more than Rocky Balboa or anyone else. I know I admired Murphy, not so much for what he did, but for how he did it. Stoic. He didn't need a stopwatch or freedom to find dignity. He ran because he could. He didn't need any other reason. I have a rule today that when I see the movie late at night on cable television (the only time he meets him most), I have to watch, no matter what I have to do in the morning. Fortunately, it often doesn't play like Shawshank Redemption or other favorites, so I still get a lot of sleep and never care about the story of one inexorable prison and personal victory.
