What must change in today's approach to movies like Boogie Nights is access. Access is terrible! Comparing it to Pulp Fiction, seeing only pornography and all its aspects .. come to people, there's more to it than in this beautiful movie. And to all the skeptics that Paul Thomas Anderson proved himself over and over again? Magnolia is one of the main reasons why I watch American movies at all and still believe in this "industry" that filmmaking is today .. And what will be blood there? This is a movie that will stay in film history, whether it likes it or not! Yeah you! The so-called consumer .. you know something: F # * k you! you don't deserve it, you don't deserve anything. So many artists today are struggling for recognition and it is becoming increasingly difficult to make serious films, even mainstream, because people just want to see celebrities doing stupid things. That's how Britney sells spears. Anyway, it was very painful for me to say, because I don't want to see, I don't want to believe that today all that is important is adding numbers .. sales revenue and sales return .. the spell that Fellini, Bergman and Kurosawa have brought and created the language of the cinema .. Because that's what PTA does .. creates magic !!
