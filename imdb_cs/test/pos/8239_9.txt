Beautiful, charming, supremely versatile and talented Irene Dunne is one of the top 5 or 6 American movie actresses. In more than 21 - as in all her films - she lights up the screen with a natural but charming presence. At the same time, it is an authentic and human, and charismatic, inspiring model. This role is essential to Irene Dunne, full of pathos and wit and a little misfortune. I love all her movies, and this film was a fantastic new discovery for me when TCM broadcast it last night. I hope they won't wait years to broadcast it again. Likewise, Charles Coburn is one of the greatest actors in all American films. True, he often portrays variations on the same subject, but never tired of watching his soft heart. Here's his perfect foil for Irene Dunne and Coburn is perfectly displayed. Their conflicts in this film are absolutely fantastic. You will never miss a rhythm. In addition, they represent the central conflict of film and the moral conflict of Irene Dunne's husband, described by Alexander Knox. I'm not so familiar with the work of Knox. He was recognizable, but that was all. However, cast with Dunne and Coburn, he holds his own. Delivers soft, gentle performance. His character has noble motifs that give us access to Knox's performance and never beat us like a holy grail. He is noble but contradicts and doubts his ability to successfully complete the OCS. His interaction with Dunne is always convincing. Dunne supports him without syrup or becomes a martyr and he answers in kind. Their scenes are very well done. The film itself is a fantastic moment and environment that is not featured in other films. I do not remember another film on the top of my head that depicts America that is still fighting against World War II, but in sight and focusing on the emergence of the post-war world. Not a usual WWII movie! This in itself is interesting; it is also important to plot and report the movie. Unlike other commentators, I thought the climactic speech was fine, but not great. Knox added it very well, but it wasn't as "tight" as it made me. I have heard better film speeches that deal with very similar topics. This served its purpose. For me, the greater the value of the film was a depiction of Dunne's life and Knox, reflecting the typical OCS experience. The sense of community among the women living on Palmetto Terrace seemed absolutely authentic - just like Palmetto Terrace itself, despite the fact that it was probably a sound scene. Incredibly short meetings of wives and their husbands OCS. Difficulty of OCS candidates, mastering the complex and complicated material they had to learn. Shabby "basic housing" - apparently hastily built. Tired and worn out furniture. Constant and harsh short terms - to return to base, to teach, to catch trains to the following "places". Tenants constantly running to their predecessors and successors in the housing base as they moved in and out. Yes, I think it was a glimpse of the real experience of World War II - dressed in some comedy, but very real at its core. I loved it, and I recommend it very.
