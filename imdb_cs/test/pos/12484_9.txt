Clouzot followed Le Corbeau, where no one knew who ate it, so everyone was suspicious, with another masterpiece of Quai des Orfevres four years later, in which we know that from the beginning (or we think we are doing) whodunnit. Top-billed Louis Jouvet does not appear for forty minutes by which time Clouzot has established a rich music hall environment, music publisher, etc and a fine cast of colorful characters; Angela Lansbury lookalike (Lansbury appeared in the eponymous woman in Paris) Suzy Delair behaves like a chanteuse whose desire to improve her charm inspires her husband's jealousy / accompaniment of Bernard Blier, who follows her to the home of an older aviator, just to find him dead already . From there things go seriously wrong, his car is stolen before he leaves the premises, so his pre-arranged alibi is out of the window, while in the meantime, his unknown, his wife confesses to murdering a photographer's neighbor, a wardrobe of lesbians in love with her who's she voluntarily returns to the crime scene and returns Delair's scarf and, if there is, wipes the prints of the murder weapon thoughtfully, a bottle of champagne. At this point, investigator Jouvet joins, and since then it has been the case to keep the plates in the air. Clouzot's output was relatively small, but practically everything was, as Spencer Tracey said in a different context, 'cherce', with Le Salaire de peur and Les Diaboliques, which still will come. In short, it is for lovers of French film.
