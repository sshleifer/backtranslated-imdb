I played this movie really this month and I love it. I was in the 60s (oh dear) so it is nostalgia in one sense. But it is a humorous premise, elegant dialogue and great performances that follow me. Dr. <br /> <br /> Winston's reactions to Stephanie at the end of the film are invaluable. (I'd be more specific, but I don't want to mess it up for anyone.) Who else but Matthau can play a man who's not upstairs, and still love him? As for Bergman's costumes, I think she looks just like her. I think she was "robbed" once when she appears in an evening dress. That doesn't suit her at all, which is too bad. I never liked it when I first saw it and still didn't. Goldie won an Oscar for her role. People thought it was a pioneering performance at the time, and yet it is one performance that I do not love like the others. However, it has the right degree of sweetness and likeness that is important to this role. And I agree - I thought Rick Lenz was great at it and it's bad that his film career wasn't going to take off after this. <br /> <br /> I hope more people watch this movie ... they will love it!
