BIG NEWS is that this movie is now available on DVD from http://treasureflix.com for all who wish it as well as on video. That's good news because it's one of my favorite movies! > <br /> I watched this film for the first time in the 1980s and it's a mandatory holiday review. Living in the small market town of Tewkesbury, picturesque and with its own traditions, renovations and traditions, we are also a cozy tight community. Now we are also confronted with large housing estates that threaten to destroy the community and can see why I love this movie. Most important and most important is that there are LASHINGS of snow !!!! Then there is a beautiful Christmas tree legend and also a Christian denouement because the whole community has coughed up money to help the poor farmer save his farm and stay in the community. Evil developers - only after the money is sent because the whole city promises its money to help protect what they have, which is very special. I love the way the entire community sends its Santa message through the mail that the hero didn't understand. He and his daughter have a long way to do after the death of his wife and mother's family. (There is likely to be a candidate for it) -the sleigh ride and most of all it is that a taxi driver whose engine is broken is mysteriously given a new one on Christmas Eve and none of them made it! There is a beautiful moment when Denver sings a lullaby and exciting search. A great fine film for everything Christmas really is about.
