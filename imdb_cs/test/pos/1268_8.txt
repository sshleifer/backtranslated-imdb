In this movie, I noticed two things. (This is not a spoiler, just a storytelling error.) When Cole takes Bill to his first B&E, he finds a "box". Once Cole finds out he says, "Boxes. Everyone has a box." A minute later, just before he discharges the contents to the floor, he says, "We are actually very happy. You don't see them often." Br /> <br /> I had to look at it three times, I couldn't figure out a few things. Then I watched the Chronological version and saw that they had flashes from last to previous during the time changes. So on some points we actually watched three different times in about 1 min. Netflix. <br /> <br /> Obsessive color.
