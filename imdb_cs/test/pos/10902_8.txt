After reading the commentary on this film and currently watching it, I can understand how you felt about it. The decisions taken were after listening to common sense. When the movie came out, I heard information about how it happened. The storyline was made from a real event. During the show, the actor, thank the people li'l, credited the prize to a former school teacher, unexpectedly a person's trip. Of course, many people come 'out' cabinets the most every day. Every trip is different for each person. In real life, the result of each individual will also be different. And the willingness to accept who they are is the most important thing in life to achieve personal happiness. For those around them, joy and honest acceptance can make life much fuller. For the film, the outcome of Howard's outside is much more comical than real life. And accepting the community showed others that Howard was alone and nothing else. Overall, the performances were crazy. Memorable quotes and the use of music are added to the stereo types out there in the world, but with the language and the face of humor. It's a movie. Sit down, watch with your mind open and move your head.
