If you read Carlo Hiaasen's book, the film is pretty much like the form, with some minor changes for Hollywood. In my opinion, it's a great family movie. Luke Wilson (Officer Delinko) steals the show from the all-star cast, which includes Robert Wagner and Jimmy Buffet. The children in the film do a great job under the guidance of Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Cody Linley. Brie Larson may be a little too small to play Beatrice. I imagined a bigger girl, maybe 6 feet, 175 lbs, as Beatrice. This could make her more believable in her role to defeat Danu. They should develop her "hard girl" character more, and she should bite her over a tire, or kick a soccer ball over a person. She's very pretty, and I understand why she was cast, it's the attraction of the box office. This is probably like PG as a movie gets these days, no sex, and very little violence. This film is fulfilled by a parent, a film with a strong ecological message, with children who have a deep appreciation for the beauty of Florida and its wildlife. It shows how adults have failed to steer our planet and that our children can ask for better. One of my favorite lines in the movie is when Mullet Fingers says: "Florida could use some mountains like Montana. Florida is so flat that there's nothing to prevent developers from clearing it off the coast to the coast." Also, Florida wildlife photography has spoken volumes without dialogue. As a family movie with 5-15 year olds, it's a great movie! As a bonus, parents will have fun, especially if they are "parrotheads".
