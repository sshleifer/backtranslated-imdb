After watching the film several times, I found so many subtle touches and emotions in the dialogue. Jing Ke, Assassin has become one of the favorite movie characters of all time. This gentle Chinese actor says more with his eyes and his economy of words and movement than any American big screen actor. Emperor Qin is brilliant when he leads viewers to believe in kindness in his heart just to release the cruelest acts on people around him. Promises he does with incredible passion and broken with evil fist. Gong Li, like every movie I've ever seen, is just fantastic. Her on-screen dominance is so elegant and emotionally charged. <br /> <br /> If you didn't recognize it, I loved this movie. <br /> <br />
