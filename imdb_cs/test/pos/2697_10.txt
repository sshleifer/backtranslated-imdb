For many years, I have not seen a better comedy than a king. I rate it one of the best. I just returned to Ireland from Arizona on American Airlines from a biz trip and accidentally showed some episodes. I laughed my head and later asked the stewards to play and do again. Thank you AA. Playing from the whole team is the first speed, and especially from Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but from all games, acting is excellent. I love all the cast, they're so funny. The King of Queens, whom I love and who is seldom seen in today's television comedy, is tough. Both Leah and Kevin play so well that every situation is believable and funny. I just bought the 2nd season while I was in Az this week and I intend to buy a full set the next time I'm in the US. My son, who is 20 years old also loves this show and her brilliance is that she has the spell to reach different generations. I would like to thank everyone involved in this amazing show - it's so appreciated to see this kind of TV show in what is in my opinion the era of a bad TV show generally these days except for the re-run of Seinfeld and the like like ... ..
