Ten years before "The Matrix" and hot for healing "They Live" came this brilliant piece of low budget science fiction creation. If you like bizarre, unconventional, intellectually demanding, David Lynch meets John Carpenter's filmmaking you'll love "Split". There are moments of true genius in framing and cinematography. Look carefully at the sequence of wine glasses at the art party and right after that scene involving the cue cards. The story includes a man named Starker who lives outside a society that wants to wake us from a dream. Like "Living", "1984" and "The Matrix", it is based on the assumption that we are all constantly being watched by the dark Big Brother government agents who know everything about us and have invisible robotic probes constantly patrolling the city. All this is revealed quite early on the property. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Starker invented a cure that wakes everyone out of the illusion of reality when placed in the water. Along with cinematography and thoughtful ways in which the director devotes his budget to cords, monologues are another major element of this film. I urge someone not to rewind, remember and quote classic quotes from this film for years to come.
