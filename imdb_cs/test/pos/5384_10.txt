Bwana Devil is reportedly the first major studio, a feature-length film shot entirely in the 3D process. Probably producer Oboler went to Africa to shoot another film, but after hearing the story of two man-eating lions, terrorizing railway builders, decided on this one. It's also a good story, almost like Hemmingway; fear, redemption, great white hunter and everyone. It is a story telling that seems to be dragging, almost as if the shooting in the new process was too heavy for the crew. The action scenes are stiff, almost too staged. However, these technical problems seem small due to the dramatic conclusion of the film.
