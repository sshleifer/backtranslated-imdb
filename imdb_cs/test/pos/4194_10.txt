I admit that I had the opportunity to watch this movie in the past and after about 5 - 10 minutes I felt like a lot. I was expecting a Monkey movie that was similar to a TV show, but instead I got ... well, I didn't know what I got to be honest. After finally watching this movie, I realized that not only had I closed my mind to the brilliance it was showing, but I was looking at it again and again. It is one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert because I try to decipher its meanings. And just when I think I invented something in the movie, it's the answer that is destroyed once I watch the movie again. Brilliance really. Most people who do not like this movie seem to want to watch a movie with a primarily clear plot. They want to explain everything and all the questions answered in the final. Sorry, this is not a movie for you. But if you like movies like The Matrix (and better, their sequels), I think you'll appreciate the idea that provokes you, it will be a passionate experience. Think about a movie as a dream. Nothing makes sense in our dreams, things we expect do not happen, people's places and things do not speak, act or function in the same way as they actually do. Complaining of "Head" is like complaining about the dream you had, you felt you didn't understand. The mind is a complex system, and the fact that a film called "Head" is just as complicated, is it difficult to combine the two? Music (and Music Numbers) Really Stand Out, Especially Two Songs by Peter Trek, which remain the best tracks in the movie, "Can I Dig It?" This film proves that The Monkees were much more than just four bad guys in the 'pre-fab' group (as their critics). they were telling them) in a TV show, but they are actually much more intelligent and talented than the world would give them. There are so many reports that can be derived from the film, both with regard to The Monkees and the "entertainment industry" in general, that it stands as a masterpiece of filmmaking that was far from time. I feel that this film is released as an independent piece at this point in time, in fact it would endure the respect and admiration it deserves. And one note: <br /> <br /> You could compare it to The Beatles 'Magical Mystery Tour' because The Beatles seemed just as weird and bizarre. However, in my opinion, "Head" stands far above anything the Beatles put on celluloid.
