I really enjoyed seeing this movie. I think it's a great, underrated Alfred Hitchcock movie. Everyone is familiar with the famous Statue of Liberty scene, but before that there is a really great movie. Robert Cummings is great at what I consider his greatest role, and beautiful Priscilla Lane shows that she also has many talents. But I think Norman Lloyd gives the best performance. His character, Fry, is so evil and evil. Although it is not too long, the film would not be the same without it. I give him 10 out of 10 !!
