STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> One-time heroin addict Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) gets from jail to his rogue Sparrow (Arnold Stang), the needy cripple wife Zosch (Eleanor Parker) and a little on Molly's side (Kim Novak). He tries to be big as a drummer in the band, but until his big break comes with being stuck in the fact that the only other thing he was good at is to be a card in endurance games. And try how he could, even the prison did not cure him of his addiction to the devil's drug - making him lie and deceive everyone around him and lead him to desperate measures to feed his habit. His desire to emerge from him is his only motivation for a happy ending. When people think about Frank Sinatra, they usually think it's classic songs like My Under Skin, New York New York and It Had it. Be you. So that no one will forget that he is also a renowned actor, and if his performance in the acclaimed From Eternity is not enough, he will also remember this sharp drama, dealing with what was ultra taboo at the time. Drug abuse. The film is often referred to as one of the first to be characterized by the graphic use of heroin (probably due to certificate 15) at a time when it was still a major issue. underground. In his portrayal of the main protagonist, Sinatra is fine, perfectly transmitting despair, despair and sincerity to a man who loses every second chance given to him. His cold Turkish scene is much more intense than Ewan McGregor in Trainspotting. The first co-star to impress is Parker as a machine is a challenging, needed cripple wife, using the guilt and husband of her husband to all the effects she can. As his secret lover, Novak still dominates some strong moments, but there are fewer stars than Parker. Stang makes his usual comical relief, like a blunt sidekick who follows the lead man around with his gaudy New York accent. Director Otto Preminger allows you to drag a bit, but it is still powerfully absorbing the film all the time, with a lot of unexpected twists and turns and which should be admired for being one of the first movies which bring such a powerful life. ****
