I wasn't waiting for this movie when I went to the theater, but I've been waiting for it for many years. To sum up, it was pretty damn good! Chad Michael Murray was pretty good, I thought he was going to be next Chris Flynn of Wrong Turn, but I was wrong. Elisha Cuthbert was also good, but the best performance has to go to Brian Van Holt. He played a bad guy too well, I think he was sick, sadistic and very cruel. The back story between the brothers was good, and I also liked the fact that there were no murders in 40 minutes. It gave you time to choose the character you wanted to see live and the one you wanted to see die. Jon Abrahams was pretty good as a goofy best bud CMM. I liked how Chad somehow shouted when he found himself dead, it was better than when he was like him: "Whatever my friend is, who cares." It turns out he really cares. Overall, it was a goddamn slasher god with some great effects. Bravo!
