Charles Bronson is back in his most famous role. In my opinion, this is by far the best movie in the series and my favorite movie ever. This film is not taken seriously because the filmmakers knew that all the social commentary that was needed was featured in the first film. Golan and Globus made this movie for Bronson fans, not for critics, and it works. DW3 was unfairly criticized as "waste" and "tired entry in a worn-out series." These claims would be true if the film were made to be taken seriously or to disseminate a statement, but it was not. If you take it as it is, DW3 is just a fun, action-packed action where Charlie makes street punks what we want. The event is non stop, the atmosphere is great, and the movie is just out and the best Bronson movie ever made. You can say that a penny pinching Cannon group has spent a lot of money on this one. It is believed that Bronson thought this movie was too violent, and that was why Winner did not point any of the following listings. I understand his fears, but as is always the case, you must move the envelope further and go through the previous record. In any case, this film was more violent than any other film made during this time. What makes DW3 the best of the series and my favorite movie ever (not the best, just my favorite) is action, Charlie's presence, unforgettable bad guys, and the ability to get the audience to jump on the bandwagon. The first movie can be technically the best, but this one is the most fun. In fact, Charlie has a few smart lines (though not much) and halfway an interesting story, photo, action, and direction to support him. Charlie has never been more intense or cool than in this one. Yes, it's exploitative, maybe it supports stereotypes, and maybe it's the same story as before, but Bronson's films always have and always will be worth defending an ordinary person and giving viewers what they want to see. Many argue that the DW series manipulates viewers, my answer is that movies don't manipulate us, fans are the ones who are in charge. We demand that Bronson blow away that he deserves dirt and, in turn, Winner and Co. deliver goods. And for those of you who still want to keep it, remember a few things. DW3 was the # 1 movie in America when it came out and was among the favorite favorites of millions of people on video and television because they realize that not all movies have to be epics, they just have to be fun. ********** / 10 You can't be better.
