It is not a movie that will excite you with its high budget, high-tech footage, fast camera movements, or flashes of costumes that an oversized and hungry director thought. But it is a director's film, who is also a very good photographer, who has a very good feeling that he is looking at things like a man, not as a demigod unlike most directors. It is not a film in which actors and actresses try to give their best 'performance' with unreal or at least learned gestures and mimics. Rather, it is a movie in which it is as real as it can be. In fact, they are not at all professional actors. Dialogues between the main characters, their expressions, their feelings are as real as they can be yours in real life. You will say the same lies to the people around you with the same regret that you avoid speaking with words. You show the same signs of harassment to an unwanted guest. This is the same sense of disconnection that you get in modern urban life. And that is your chance to see yourself outside, to be the main character. I've seen all Nuri Bilge Ceylan movies, incl. his short film Goat (Cacoon) thanks to those who put it on DVD. Many would compare it with Tarkovsky, Oz and perhaps Bresson or Bergman when he appears as a true author. And he is honest in that his films don't make money, but make sense to his life. That's the kind of sincerity you'll find in Uzak.
