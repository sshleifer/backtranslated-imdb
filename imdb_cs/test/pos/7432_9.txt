I am a passionate ff7 fan, for example I have the game then sell it (bad mistake) but then buy it again (good mistake ... erm) <br /> <br /> anyway, yes this movie is very good, the fighting is very cool, music very good, and cgi that you can not hesitate. just that I didn't disappoint with the film I felt was a lack of other characters, it was almost the whole cloud that is a great character, cant beat cid and barret. But despite the fact that the movie was great in my opinion, and has to watch. <br /> <br /> overall a great movie to give and give it 9/10 <br /> <br /> squaresoft to make more movies like this and you'll worship more than you already !!
