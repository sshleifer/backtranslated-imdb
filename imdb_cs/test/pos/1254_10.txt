Sure, this is one of the lightest stories Bruce Willis still has to this day - still touching. I really like Bruce's style and persona, I don't love everything he has ever been, but it brings me to "Big-time" for me in all his film efforts. The story begins ..... It's power, trust and style with the 'S' chapter. He drives Porshe, who lives well, in the palace estate with a spectacular view of the fair city. That's Russell Duritz. He is an image consultant for those who are up or down. His response, he's Russell Duritz, knows what it means to do it. It seems that as soon as life develops quickly and is based on allies, there is a problem in his house, the intruder is activated! Russell can't seem (yet) what's going on with him. It's different and yet it's somehow known. A little boy who looks exactly like ...-- he. As their lives break each other, it seems that he is screaming at him: "You have unfinished shops to take care of them now!" Amy supporting the young lady's story is probably the best balance he saw and has in his life. He works with him, he stands with his "ego" and yet he is defeated by Russell. So much. With Rusty his past 'self' now pictured and talking a mile per minute, singing too late at night, everything foundational becomes like jelly! Willis is fun, egocentric and occasionally out of his head in this cute modern era of Disney's The Kid classic and add his little heavy side kick to Spencer Breslin is the perfect addition to this sparkling childhood story of an adult and back to childhood adventure . Chi McBride is an inspirational support character because he is a heavy-weight champion, teaching 'Little' Rusty as to boxing to defend against tyrants on the pitch. All of this is a real movie winner with Lillie Tomlin as Russell's secretary and assistant. I originally saw it in 2000 'and then again a few years later, with the same enjoyment. This is a shiny family comedy that has a superb finish that warms the hearts of all Disney fans Recommended (*****)
