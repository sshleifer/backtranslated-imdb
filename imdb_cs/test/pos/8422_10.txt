This is a very moving movie. This is a story about a strange bond between a child and his grandfather. The villager (Arun Nalawade) brings his grandson, Parashuram, to the city to have his eyes treated. But he knows that Parashuram (Aswin Chitale) has a rare eye cancer and has to undergo surgery and lose both eyes. The film is about the emotions and confusion they are experiencing and how they accept the whole thing. The film avoids any melodrama and tells this story in a simple way. Even though the film is in Marathi, language is not an obstacle at all. This proves that in order for a good movie you don't need song items, superstars and usual masala. Excellent performance. This is India's entry for the 2004 Oscars. Speed ​​10/10.
