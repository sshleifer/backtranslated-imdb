This film came as a gift - a late night blue offer - so unlike other reviewers, I had no prejudices. I found myself stuck in my place because the film dictated its own rhythm, its own development. I was drawn to acknowledging my own deep love and humanity as I wished "good" would win - but also forced to notice that I was sometimes on the side of "bad" boys. The film is quite beautiful - the word "elegiac" comes to mind, more than because the film begins and ends in elegy. The film is far from depressing or confronted with me, the film acknowledges deep suffering - and then its cyclical nature - birth and rebirth, as well as death - the film celebrates the fact that there is a poet Aussie's "sometimes joy. Oh gods, I feel like I wrote a love letter to this movie - but it's there. Hola!
