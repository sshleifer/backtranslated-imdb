This is the best movie I've ever seen. It has all the tragedy and the happiness of love and hatred. And a deep friendship that even war cannot destroy. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful cast I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were the best in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you see Part 1, you'll want to see it. Some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home, then went out and bought a movie. I'm a civil war buff, but this movie was interested in its grandchildren. Every movie that can teach children history is great. I have books I, II and III, and when girls come from Florida every year, they want to see North and South.
