Bug Juice has changed my life. I know it sounds strange, weird, weird. But he did it. I'm from England, Bug Juice has never been aired there, but five years ago I went on vacation with my family and I saw it on Disney Channel. Once I saw this TV series that I was addicted to, I wanted to go. It was very convincing for my parents to allow my brother and I to go to Waziyatah. I've been this summer since I was 12 years old. If you are a teenager reading this come to this camp it will change your life. You make long friends on wazi. It doesn't matter who you are or if someone at home doesn't like you in the camp.
