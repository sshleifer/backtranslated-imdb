"Head" is one of those movies that you will have a lot of trouble convincing your friends to see, but as soon as they do, they will fall in love with it. I don't know how many times it happened to me. This movie is so funny and bizarre, really deconstructing everything Monkees has done in his career so far. Much credit goes to Bob Rafelson, who has largely ended his Monkee career with this film. My guess is he wanted to get away from directing the TV show and get into the features he did after that in big. Micky Dolenz is absolutely cheerful. I can't believe he didn't have a second life as a comic actor after this movie. This film has a lot of great portraits and a lot of wonderful psychedelic nonsense. I feel that the reputation of this film is constantly being built and I wouldn't be surprised if it eventually became a full cult classic
