Julie (Meg Tilly) is a high school girl who is determined to show something for herself and undergoes "The Sisters" rituals, a small clich√© presided over by snooty, homecoming. Carol Queen (Robin Evans). Sisters propose to spend the night in the mausoleum for Julie's final exam, preparing to drive Julie into the wall, but not knowing that the recently deceased, ill-intentioned psychic Raymar is buried there and plans to cause a trigger off the grave. While this debut picture for Tom McLoughlin ("Friday 13th Part VI: Jason Lives" and "Ever Returns") is limited by his apparently low budget, that's what McLoughlin and his crew are able to count on it. It's really scary, disturbing fares; it could very well scare the stuffing out of me if I was under 10 years old, even in my present age, it still got me to some extent. Some of the effects look hissing, but decent looking corpses and gore are created by Tom Burman, an experienced makeup make-up artist who, while tending to be overshadowed by more famous names like Winston, Baker, and Bottin , has a good resume with other movies like "Cat People" (1982) and "The Beast Within" to his credit. What I liked most about it was a real sense of premonition and atmosphere, an aspect that is lacking in some of the current trend horror movies. in our multiplexes. Tilly is cute and appealing in her role, which recently completed her debut film work in "Tex" before entering this production. "One Dark Night" was completed some time before its release to theaters in 1983, where it actually did a decent business during its first few weeks. Other actors do what they have to do well; well-known faces in supportive cast include equally attractive veteran singer / actress / voice artist Elizabeth (aka EG) Daily, Kevin Peter Hall, for once * not * playing any animal character, but who unfortunately ends up with very small screens, and none other than Adam "Batman" West. The director's wife Nancy, who would play Lizbeth in "Jason Lives", appears like a space girl in front of the arcade. It's a decent B level horror entertainment, maybe too cheap for its ambitions, and maybe not the slippery one (hey, McLoughlin * was * just getting started), but definitely good for some winters. <br/> 7/10
