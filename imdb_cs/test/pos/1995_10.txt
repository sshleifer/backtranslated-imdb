They all seem to compare with The Matrix and The 13th Floor, and when I first saw it, I agreed - I was expecting The Matrix and I was a little disappointed. But with repeated views, my respect for this film has grown tremendously. It should be remembered that Matrix is ​​a great action movie with some philosophical mumbo-jumbo. a moving action movie with a somewhat more interesting philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in. Existence is not at all an action film and is not (as many believe) about "reality" or some "deep" concept. It is about the human tendency to deliberately replace reality by artificial (both in its origin and in its behavior) with the world of believers. The most frigid moment in the movie is when Allegra Geller repeats it. "line". At that moment, you realize that the people in the game have voluntarily given up their free will to participate in the story. This is even more frightening at the end when D'Arcy Nader (or rather his player) comments on the opportunity to spend his life in the game. I fully sympathize with the "realistic" philosophy that providing interesting worlds in which people simply find the right predefined path to the ultimate goal is ultimately a recipe for mindless existence. Living "in the game" does not live at all, but it is a tempting way to spend time on Earth. As Allegra comments on the real world, "there's nothing going on here." It could even be jack into someone else's imagination and pretend to be doing something interesting. (Though I have to ask if Cronenberg considers it an indictment, given that he offers the worlds that they will experience in 90-minute excerpts.) <br /> <br /> After leaving the theater after watching this movie, I thought that it was one of those movies that were observable just to see how it ended. But when I saw it several times (thank you SciFi Channel), I realized how far it goes. Seriously, if you've only seen it once, it deserves further viewing.
