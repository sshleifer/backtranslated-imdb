A surprisingly good film created following an exorcist about a young woman who becomes obsessed with the spirit after she went to the holy church to restore life and life as a crucified person. The piece was Christ and two thieves, but Christ was long sold out. Problems begin as soon as the character is removed from the cross and seem to come to life and seduce the woman. From that moment on, she becomes a struggle for a girl's soul. Creepy, scary and much better than you think the movie works because its cast sells events that are definitely adult. It helps to be real people who are defective, so it's easier to apply. I really liked the movie and saw it for the first time in the last decade. It seems better than any of his countless titles.
