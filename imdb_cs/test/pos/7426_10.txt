gentle romantic comedy. errol flynn shows what agile touch for comedy he had. a talent that probably shows some of his true joking self. comedy writing on this film is excellent. eleanor parker does a great job as an exna flynna wife, which errol tries to get back. Eleanor is also easy on the eyes. The sets radiate grace and style in 1940 where appropriate. The comic timing of flynn and joke is shown here in its entirety, watching its double shots, its ability to verbally fight with a soft comeback strike, or to act straight man and his full credibility and honesty where necessary , this man could act! This is a shame errol didn't get a chance to do more roles like this throughout his career, he was multi-talented to the extreme. If you enjoyed "It Happened One Night" with Shield and Colbert or some of William Powell and Myrna Loy Comedies, you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> went well and had a lot of laughter. lost diamond movie.
