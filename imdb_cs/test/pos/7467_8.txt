I had the pleasure of watching these two chairs from (one of the?) Executive Producer at the Atlantic Film Festival, which was interesting because he laughed at very different times than the rest of us. Filmed in the Atlantic Canada, the film is about three teenage girls who, in one of their last years of their youth, devote a large amount of energy to sleeping with a married 30-year-old man, despite many protests. Definitely worth watching, but the humor was focused on a completely different demographic group than I live (man 18-25) so I shook my head rather than laughing. At the same time, the story is strong enough to keep itself entertained without laughing.
