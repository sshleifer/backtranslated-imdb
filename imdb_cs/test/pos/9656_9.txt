This beautiful and charming epic fantasy with lots of heart. I got lost in this sweet movie and I watched it at Mann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. It's really romantic with a touching message. Works of art and effects are visually remarkable, and the fact that the director is an amazing artist is so obvious. Frames are like watching moving art. He also has a strong and talented cast of actors. What a great surprise to see Joss Ackland, he's just a fabulous perfect king. Sarah Douglas is amazing as a villain and Christine Taylor and Tom Schultz make a lovely romantic couple. The fact that the film was made on a ridiculously small independent film budget will throw me out. It doesn't have to be slippery Hollywood stuff that we are flooded with, but it's a really nice movie that you can rent and enjoy on your couch on a rainy Saturday. Don't forget microwave popcorn. That's my advice. Just enjoy it.
