There I was on vacation when my host suggested us to be at this B-film festival in Breda. I was resistant because I wasn't on a trip to sit in a movie theater, but I have to admit I shouldn't regret the other one (especially with the contribution of Stephen Malkma). It probably helped me to know what to expect. SEA OF DUST begins as a typical costume drama. We have a young medical student to help a doctor whose city is destroyed by a crazy epidemic (which somehow includes exploding heads). On the way, he stops to visit his fianc√© and his father throws him out of his possession. He travels on, finds a girl lying on the road, another plague victim and takes her to the doctor. I was thinking. It all looked pretty predictable. And then everything went crazy and suddenly turned into a completely different film. Tom Savini appears as Dracula, the characters begin to travel to the "other side" of reality and dialogue becomes more and more funny. And when I thought he had settled in the groove, the image would change again to become really dark and bizarre. I won't spoil the audience for the first time, but there's a wonderful succession of hollow people, a lot of talk about religion abuse by society, and some over-the-top effects of gore. And did I mention Stephen Malkma? This is not a perfect movie (if you haven't figured it out at B-Movie), but it's worth the time for adventurous viewers. Great visual effects, great soundtrack, lots of interesting ideas. Acting is sometimes a little zany, but I think it's the right point. Funny I had to go to Breda to find an American picture that looked like a British horror movie. You are this ...
