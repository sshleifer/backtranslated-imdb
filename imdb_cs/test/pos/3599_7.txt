Once you can get through Nic Cage playing an Italian soldier who loves opera and believes in love, not war, you can enjoy this beautiful movie. This could be used as advertising for tourism in the Mediterranean. John Hurt is great and Penelope Cruz is not bad as you would expect. The figure of Christian Bale is somewhat one-dimensional, which is a shame. The main drawback of this film is adaptation from the book - after telling me the differences between book and movie charts, I feel cheated by a much better and more convincing storyline.
