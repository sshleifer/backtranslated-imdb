One of the better music bios. Dennis Morgan is great as a singer / songwriter Chauncey Olcutt. The support cast is very good, especially Andrea King as the charming Lillian Russell. The atmosphere of the turn of the century is the perfect environment. The technique is excellent. A simple plot, but the movie just makes you feel good. Morgan has always been underestimated as an actor and singer.
