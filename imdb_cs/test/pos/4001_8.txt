Chi-hwa-seong (Painted Fire) depicts the life of Korean painter Yang Seong-ub in the midst of a changing political landscape at the end of the 19th century in Korea. Topics of this film center around the process of art creation by the fire of the artist's desire and the expectations and demands of their audience and society. Yang seong-ub is playing masterfully as a complex character that turns from an innocent youth excitement to a hardened alcoholic tortured soul. This characteristic reflects a young eager artist who is increasingly difficult to create the spirit of artistic creation within himself without letting the creative fire drink through drink, erection and desire. Although this development continues overall with film, Yang's emotional complexity is still playing in a constantly oscillating way of building the final film. Interestingly, the movie cut copies this constantly changing and seemingly wild emotion or fire of the artist, as the scenes fluently move from one place to another, without any conventional "stimuli" for viewers that such a scene change occurs. For example, many scenes would change seemingly in the middle of a conversation to pick up another place and place. The film's visual scenery is beautifully presented and also oscillates from sharp (and perhaps bleak) black-and-white scenes to more colorful and vibrant environments that replicate the Yang images again with either simple black ink on white paper or added color. The colors of the rainbow enter the film in points where the author observes nature and especially women, which are then reflected in his paintings. The theme of the artist's individual desire to create against the expectations and demands of society arises in society. the film through various points, including class honors, rule domination of the artist, accepted standards of artistic elite and the basic wishes of the common masses. Instead of creating his own entirely original works, Yang will find himself mostly renewing masterpieces by other artists throughout East Asia. The question therefore arises whether recreation itself deserves artistic value. I wish I was more familiar with the political events of this period in order to understand firmly the story. I cannot comment on the role of the GOK in artistic expression and / or censorship. Overall, very well-played film and cinematography are often breathtaking. A great movie that you can see and then think about.
