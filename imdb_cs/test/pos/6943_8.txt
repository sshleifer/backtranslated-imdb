Even though I lived in Australia in 1975, I moved overseas, it didn't take long for me to make a living by the constant industrial turmoil, the universal worship of mediocrity - unless you were an athlete! - and the kindness of so many Australians who have chosen to ignore the cruel pace of change that occurs in countries in the north. As a result, I missed The Dismissal, along with many other television dramas from the 1980s and 1990s that originated in Australia, such as the excellent Janus and Phoenix series I have seen together since with Wildside. The Dismissal story is fair to me and, to my knowledge, accurate. However, as to public "outrage" it only shows one side of the image, not as families were upset by controversy. I know my two brothers wouldn't talk to me for months. However, this comment is, in my opinion, very one-sided. The inevitable fact is that, despite the fiery manifestations of rage from a substantial part of the community, Australian voters chose - and certainly chose - for Fraser, as they did again two years later. <br /> <br /> This, historically accurate, and docudrama worked great.
