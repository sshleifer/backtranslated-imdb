Um, hi .. Rainbow Brite .. the name itself is hard to take seriously, as if it was a cousin of Strawberry Shortcake .. but when you're a kid, this is definitely a serious thing. So, there is this nasty, ugly, spoiled girl, and she wants the others, among others, to the light of the universe, to discover the Rainbow Brites, and Rainbow Brite and her friend Cris are bound and determined to stop her. As I recall, Murky and Lourky played a smaller role in this production. Maybe they wanted too much money? So anyway, snotty, the bad girl has a strong gem and she feeds it too much to make a rainbow belt .. imagine? But in some way, Rainbow gets her belt back and re-energizes it with "star sprinklers" and kicks bad girls' ass with the help of Cris and his prism bracelet, and also save the entire universe in the process. So good triumphs over evil, nessess triumphs over roughness, and rainbow brite and color kids are once again safe to spread color and joy to all mankind.
