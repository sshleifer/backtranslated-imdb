I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2002. This is the first Indian film I've seen in Tamil language, and although it shares some similarities with other Indian films (beautiful music and director The film tells the story of Amud, a premature nine-year-old whose parents tell her that she has been accepted, and so the odyssey begins, which will take them all from India to the war ripped off Sri Lanka. Amudha plays PS Keerthan, and she is one of the few child actors I have seen that can be premature yet uncomfortable, her charm and beauty held the film together.
