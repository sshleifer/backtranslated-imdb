Twins Effect, playing some of HK's most popular stars, offers one of the most enjoyable movie experiences ever to appear in HK. He has something for everyone, action, comedy, horror, romance and some drama. This movie cannot be taken too seriously, otherwise you will be lost, but if you leave the brain at the door and just watch the movie for fun, you have to enjoy it. Great special effects, great action, cute twins, great HK actors, fun movie! <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to everyone!
