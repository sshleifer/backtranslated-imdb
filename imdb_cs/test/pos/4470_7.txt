This is another film where cinematography is the best thing I recommend. That would be fine if the film was a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in film art, that's not good enough. The theme of interspecific respect and cooperation boldly enters the forbidden world of interspecific love, but its approach is stereotypical, suggesting a lack of understanding of the behavioral motives of both species. As with many films, you always wonder what an innovative director and more creative screenwriter could achieve. Unfortunately, we probably never know.
