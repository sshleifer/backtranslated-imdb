Vanaja (2006), written and directed by Rajnesh Domalpalli, is an extraordinary film from South India. Mamatha Bhukya plays 15-year-old Vanaja, who lives in a rural area with her loving but alcoholic father. If it succeeds in life, it will have to overcome low caste and poverty obligations. I went to the movie and expected to see a poor girl crushed by the company. This is not what Vanaja shows us. The young woman is attractive, intelligent and ambitious. He will not accept her fate with tears or simple resignation. She wants to succeed and it is never clear that she will fail despite the chance. The work that Mr Domalpalli draws on his amateurs is miraculous. Mamatha Bhukya is excellent in the title role, and Urmila Dammannagari does exceptional work as Mrs. Rama Devi, a wealthy landowner who is formerly a famous classical dancer. Vanaja teaches South Indian classical dance as well as real life. I couldn't say how good Vanaja dance is according to Indian norms, but many dance scenes were stunning. (Don't think Bollywood is a classic dance. It's also very different from ballet because in ballet the dancer raises his heels off the floor. for a movie that you must not miss. It will work on a DVD, but it will be better on the theater screen because the dance will show a better advantage. However, if your DVD is the only option, then you see it. Just make sure you see it.
