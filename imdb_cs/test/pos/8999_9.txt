I think some of America's best baseball movies are one of the best films ever made. When this film was in production and heard it described as a rugby film. I read about the Highland team in the newspaper, but I didn't have much expectations for this movie about sports that didn't interest me. Last night I looked at it "on demand" and loved it almost as much as my favorite baseball movies. Ryan Little and the cast and crew have done an amazing job. Particularly convincing was Neil McDonough. As a "bad dad" he displayed a subtle range and a subtle but moving arc. I also enjoyed actors from the Pacific Ocean. I was lucky to meet many of these great people and this film captures their wonderful spirit and culture. Flashback showing how Islanders culture has become such a key element of the Highland team would be a great addition to the film. Some nice movies have been made recently in Utah. It's good to see such a good quality movie from Beehive State.
