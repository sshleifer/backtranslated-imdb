Too bad it seems that this little thriller-masterpiece nobody knows. Where larger budget movies fail, "Terminal Choice" brings a lot of excitement, shock and bloody violence. A bit to see a gem that deserves to be searched in your local video store. The anonymous guy under him is fine when he says you never trust hospitals again ... it's so effective! Also a good ending, not really a twist, but it doesn't end up as he would have thought. Yeah, that's Ellen Barkin in the early role ...
