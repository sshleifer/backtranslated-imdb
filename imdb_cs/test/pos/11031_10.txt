I'm collecting movies at the Super-8 and I managed to capture this entire print last week on E-bay. It looks at least for the moment, it's the only way to see this movie in the NTSC video country. I've seen it available on DVD Region 2 many times, but never Region 1. <br /> <br /> I've just watched it a few minutes ago and I'm impressed by it. It is a strong proof of freedom and the search for one's own place in the world. Photos and music were amazing and I felt like empathy for some characters. I like the idea that I was probably the only one in the US watching "When the North Wind Blows" tonight! Long Life Avakum !!
