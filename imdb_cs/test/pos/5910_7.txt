Everyone knows Lindburgh succeeded in the first transatlantic flight. So how can there be any tensions or intrigues in this film? Well, it is. Don't ask me, but it is. Partly due to the director telling the story, but mainly thanks to Jimmy Stewart, it is a funny performance as if it first appeared in front of our eyes. Despite the fact that half the film is filmed in a crowded cockpit, it is as dynamic as any action. So if you're afraid to see this movie because you think you already know the story, do it. I think you'll be amazed.
