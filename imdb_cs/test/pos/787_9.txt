Buster Keaton was probably at his most enjoyable when he made short 20 minute movies, and they don't come more rib-ticklish than this gem. The Dead Pan comics will engage in a photographic mix with a wanted criminal. This leads to his elaborate avoidance of several street policemen and co-passengers who identify his face from the "wanted" sign. The goat is choc-a-bloc with brilliant gags in place, from the opening scene in the bread queue to the amazing lift chase at the end. Keaton never feels like his silence is missing because the sound is never there. His films are explained through amazing (but incredibly dangerous) things he has done to himself. It is not difficult to see how influential he was - man is as amazing today as he was in 1921.
