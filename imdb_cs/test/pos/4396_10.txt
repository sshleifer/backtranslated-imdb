My husband received a DVD at OBWAT for Christmas and was the best gift we received! We watch her every time we have to laugh and have seen her 12 times! The scenery in this movie is beautiful and the music is excellent! you need to pick me up and that is also daily! If someone needs a proposal for a good gift for movie lovers this movie is it! The characters are cheerful, charming, and their facial expressions are too funny to describe! a fan of George Clooney, but now I'm also a fan of Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro (Pete) and I'm looking for them in other movies now! You have to see the movie !!!
