Image with Danny Devito and Billy Crystal. They are both famous actors, and in this charming comedy they mean they're trying to kill each other's pets. Billy Crystal's pet peeve is his ex wife who stole his book and give her a name on it, and Danny Devito's pet peeve is his pernicious mother. Billy Crystal is the author and teacher and Danny Devito is one of his students. This classic comedy is very entertaining and for all ages. Danny Devito seems to be acting as a child in this movie because of his evil mother who keeps him constantly. He says things like "You have no friends!" and when Billy Crystal fell, she said, "Burry him before he stinks in the cellar!" He also puts Danny down by calling him "Lard ass!" and other things just to make him angry.
