After I saw Undisputed 2, I knew what to expect from Isaac Florentin. Shepherd: Border Patrol is a decent movie (not Van Damme is the best, but certainly not his worst). Supporting cast of VD, but it makes sense. The storyline and storyline was done before, so it's nothing new. It's Van Damme. Do we really not expect much of the amazing plot? So let him talk about what we all want to watch this film anyway: fighting. Without giving up, I thought how movies were made and filmed well, better than a few VD of recent films such as Second in Command, in which the entire end of the fight is HORRIBLE. With Florentine behind the camera, and if you saw the undisputed 2, he seems to know how to shoot and enjoy fighting. A few fights in the Shepherd reminded me of the older things we wanted to see. The fighting was good, and I said "hah, awesome" a few times aloud. However, I was hoping that I was thinking a little more about how well I thought Undisputed 2 was. Something I found interesting was VD's daughter in the movie, I thought "wow she's a bit hot" coming up to find out his Bianca Van Varenberg, JC's real daughter of life. I've never seen her before, so it was a nice recovery. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie isn't bad. Yeah, the story was done earlier, but at least JC was trying to make a good movie. Next time, add another hand to the fight! I think he still has a lot to do to make another big budget ... his performances have improved because he does DTV and is really in great shape at 47. I don't know about you, but I'm one of those who thinks most of his DTVs are actually good except Derailed. All he has to do is get back in the shape of "bloodshed" and make a martial arts movie ... and I think people will react well even if they don't go. This movie is definitely worth renting. =)
