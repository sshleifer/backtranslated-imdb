Kon Ichikawa spent World War II and saw the effects on his people in Japan. But also the novelist Shohei Ook, whose book was the inspiration for Ichikawa's film Fires on the Plane. It is a film about people in this war, or perhaps more generally in wars in general, who have lost their humanity. The soldiers who weave through these fields and jungles in this story are almost hopeless, if not already. It makes Stone's platoon look like a picnic: at least they had certain things, like food, after all. They have little to no reserves or supplies or ammunition, no back-up, no sense of anything. they go their way into the struggle they've reached. They cannot even get proper hospital care unless they can no longer walk or have lost limbs (for example, if you have TB, you are on the road). But his prism is one soldier, private Tamura, that we get a full sense of futility, both in her bleak scenes of nothingness and boredom and decay, as well as flashes of intense and brutal violence. Tamura wants to get some medical care in the movie. That's right at the beginning, and his superior officer - with his eyes fixed and an expression that has been exhausted for years of struggle - that he will die if he doesn't find a hospital. Not really, but it will eventually end up with some soldiers: initially with a platoon that seems to be working somewhat, but is actually led by a powerful brute force that only wants Tamura's hideout of salt, and then later with two other stray soldiers who are part of the group , which was previously ambushed when crossing the road. The story isn't a straight line, but it doesn't need to be. Tamura's journey in Fire on the Plain is narrated in medallions, small stories like coming to a seemingly abandoned enemy village. Two of the populations are returning to get some supplies, and Tamura sneaks into them. It's an unbearable scene because we haven't seen him do anything wrong with Tamura yet * but he does it in this scene, not so much out of evil, but out of fear and despair (that is, even without spoiling the way he's getting a salt stash) . Small scenes are created brilliantly and with devastation, as a simple task of finding a pair of walking shoes that seem to be none. Or when Tamura, later in the film, finds that his teeth are torn and fall out of lack of complete hygiene. So much for eating, so it goes. It should also be mentioned that this is a terribly realized film from Ichikawa, shot in a sharp black and white view of fields and forests. we see black-and-white and white. Ichikawa also ensures that his actors get everything that is authentic, not only emotionally, but also with their stiff look and desperate look at them. It is as if Ichikawa had to have all the survivors of the film, as well as the characters who survived in the wild; By the way, by the way, I also mean cannibalism. The shock of this is doubled; First, the way a soldier tells half a joke about eating other soldiers in Tamaura, who asks whether this is true, and only in response to being "not asking" for the word of caution, and the other to portray cannibalism. alone, from a crazy hungry man on a hill who pulls the intestines out of his lap and says with a straight face to our hero that "You can eat me when I die." This makes things particularly brutal when it comes to a director who shoots short "action" scenes. That is, I think, more brutal than 'Private Ryan' in their portrayal of violence in battle, a carnage that is totally random. The scene I would like to point out, which contains only a shot that is impossible to watch, is when we see from a high angle a group of about twenty soldiers walking slowly, a hail of fire that only kills four or five, but it happens fast and the soldiers are just going through the same crawl. This is not the only demonstration of the terrible massacre that is displayed - when it is needed to be bloody, but it is being sprayed across the screen like something completely different from a macaroon - but it all drives it completely. <br /> <br /> All acting is overwhelming (especially Funakoshi, who seems to be most at ease and most appalled at what he sees in the finest appearance of most of the time), all major pieces provide something else for a terrible experience and all is the ultimate question with the anti-war film: how can or why people fight in wars like these? It's almost too depressing to say, so Ichikawa pushes our noses straight into the mud and dirt and blood and requires us to take it, so maybe, sometimes, it never happens. Or hopefully, until the end of such a dreary and big movie.
