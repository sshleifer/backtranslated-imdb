Ponyo, written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, is a small story that speaks of respect for the ocean, respect for the young and old, and respect for cultural differences. This is a new story about a small goldfish wishing to be a girl rather than telling about Disney's Little Mermaid. Miyazaki animated by hand, a moody, magical movie for young and young hearts. The film starts with a slow wavy blue-green palette of anemone, jellyfish and dozens of small fancy goldfish with baby faces. There is no need for narration, the movement of creatures and the music of Jo Hisaiahi at the beginning. Released last summer in Japan, Ponyo won the Japanese Academy Award for Best Animated Film and Best Score (Jezebel.com). Fantastic goldfish, Brunhild, leaves his ocean at home for a jellyfish. When it reaches the surface it is caught in a fishing net full of other fish, rubbish and sludge. She is propelled into a glass that is rolled to shore where five-year-old Sosuke (voice of Frankie Jonas) gains it. When he breaks the container, he opens his hand and releases a small goldfish. Brunhild tastes his blood, which heals Sosuke's incision, and sets in motion his transformation to man while balancing nature out of balance. Sosuke puts a small goldfish in a green bucket and names it Ponyo (Noah Cyrus), which means soft and jelly like. Sosuke's mother, Lisa (Tina Fey), allows him to take Ponyo to a school that is next door to the nursing home where he works. Lisa is a crazy ride on a picturesque winding road, past a dry dock, through a busy fishing town, and along a tree-lined road to home for caregivers, Miyazaki represents an amazing sequence of actions and perfectly illustrates the hectic morning of her parents. Miyazaki created another strong, independent, female character in Lisa. Making her a loving, sensible, modern mother, both Sosuke and Ponyo. Lisa's telephone conversation with a non-arriving home-again husband, Kiochi (Matt Damon), because the ship captains have to make another ride is a typical female response. Later that evening, Sosuke logs in with a signal lamp to talk to his father as the ship passes the cliff where their house sits. Lisa refuses to acknowledge Kiochi's apology and jumps up and signals "Bug-off, Bug-off, Bug-off," it's a cheerful scene. But when Sosuke takes the signal lamp and tells his father "Good luck, I love you", Lisa hugs him and tells him that he has a good heart, it's a very engaging scene. My personal favorites are older Miyazaki, grandmother-type women in a wheelchair in a nursing home, Yochi (Betty White), Noriko (Cloris Leachman) and Toki (Lily Tomlin). Their exchange over Sosuke's tiny goldfish is amazing and reminiscent of bickering between the witch of the wastes (Lauren Bacall) and Sophie (Jean Simmons) as she trudges along the long staircase at Howl's Moving Castle. Pony's magical father of the sea god, Fujimoto (Liam Neeson) resembles magician Howla comes to take Ponya back to his ocean. Fujimoto uses one of his elixirs to try to put the nature back in balance, but the magical little Ponyo escapes once again the exciting next elixir in the process and causes the tsunami. This red-haired little girl who runs on the backs of huge dolphins to get to Sosuke reminds the audience of the stubborn, adventurous little Mei in Totoro My Neighbor. Ponyo is as adventurous and curious as Mei. When Fujimoto realizes what Ponyo has done, he calls for the Gran Mamare (Kate Blanchett), the goddess of the ocean, to help with the situation. This wise, calming goddess comes into a blue striped garment that never ends. She has a private conversation with Lisa on the future of young children, which helps viewers understand Sosuke and Pony's relationship is not what lovers but brother and sister would be. The quiet and simple end of life is typical of Miyazaki films, leaving an audience full of hope.
