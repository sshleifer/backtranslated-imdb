Little Vera is the story of a Russian teenager, her family and her attempts to find meaning and value in a life that is falling apart. In her quest for meaning, she falls in love with the more intellectual and rebellious Sergei, whose hatred of her deeply confused parents is quickly out of control. Little Vera is shocking and distracting in almost every direction. Drinking a father, allowing and failing to understand the mother, casual lies and the wrong direction of the brother and Vera itself, who have forgiven them all their flaws, are shocking and a little worrying. However, the raw honesty of the film is somehow more shocking than the story or characters. Little Vera, in confined spaces and vast urban decline, has presented a totally different view of Soviet life than was previously seen. In fact, Little Vera is a portrait of the collapse of Soviet society in shades of pain, despair and rust. It is an implosion of a family that is opposed to the implications of the entire social order. Although the film is painful and desperately dissatisfied, it is definitely worth seeing if it is just an understanding of the feelings and cultures that Russia is still transforming. today.
