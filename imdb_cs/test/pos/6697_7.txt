A blend of Alien and Ghost Busters? It starts very promising, then slows down to almost boring. LifeForce has some amazing special effects that they were able to produce in the mid-1980s. The story is interesting, but ultimately there is a lack of shine. He was rated R for nudity, sex and gore. Mathilda May's ethereal and wild (naked) beauty is very clear throughout the film. Bizarre movie and cost a lot when it was made. <br /> <br /> It could have been a bigger classic with a better script, but unfortunately it wasn't a big hit, I think it was pretty bad. So something's gone wrong with this, but it's still fun.
