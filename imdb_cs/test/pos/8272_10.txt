I am so happy to have recorded it on a VHS tape when it was shown at the Master Piece Theater. This is a movie I can watch over and over again. Just as living in the early 1800's in England is not hard enough, Prue was born with a "hare lip" and is ejected from birth. People in her village accept her somewhat, but they are always afraid of being "from the devil's smithy" and turning to her quickly. Especially when her family touches a lot of bad luck. She is strong and courageous, but she avoids Kester Woodseaves, a traveling weaver who catches her eye. Partly because he is afraid of rejection and also because he thinks he's so masculine he should have a woman who is as beautiful as a lily. Kester is a modern man who does not believe in the superstition of time and speaks his mind and follows his heart. The film remains true to Mary Webb's original story and is stunning from start to finish.
