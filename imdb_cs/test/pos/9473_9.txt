I took my eleven-year-old daughter and eight-year-old son to this movie and I can't remember a movie that made me laugh SO hard - literally out loud, a deep burst of laughter because this movie is fun. It is admitted that the story is predictable, but the ride is so enjoyable that it doesn't matter how it ends. The actor's senses of timing were impeccable. The actors were perfectly cast. My children mentioned that Amanda Bynes is the last of the young female actresses who do not disturb the life. It's so refreshing. My kids said it was their favorite movie of 2006. Our money was well spent on this movie.
