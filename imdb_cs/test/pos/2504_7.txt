Besides being shot mainly in Rockport MA, which is a beautiful city where my mother once rented a small facade, and I spent a great summer as a kid, it's a fun and cute little movie. I must admit that I had no desire to actually see this film, even though I have a weakness for romantic comedies (I don't know why). The trailers I saw were not appealing, the cast didn't look so interesting and I had no idea what it would be. Finally, I found out that it was an interesting meditation on relationships and family. I really enjoyed it and I must admit that I thought this movie was one of the most overlooked gems of last year. I am disappointed that so few people have enjoyed the "human" that this film has presented to the viewer. I've read a lot of the bad reviews of this movie and I have to admit a certain level of shock to cynicism that prevails in them. As a graduated student, I think I'm pretty cynical, but that was a beautiful little movie that deserves much better than it got.
