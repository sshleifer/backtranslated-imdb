I remember seeing the movie trailer and I knew I had to see this movie. It looked like something that would be up to my alley. "United States Leland" is an amazing movie. It is not the one that will leave you with a pleasant, pleasant end, but instead with a sad, empty feeling. And when I say he leaves you with an "empty" feeling, I don't mean it as a bad thing. I believe you intend to fill this empty feeling with your own thoughts about the characters and general motives of man and how he acts as part of society. Ryan Gosling is perfectly cast as Leland. It is intelligent, yet stoic. I like the way she tells the film with her magazine. Supporting casting is also great. Kevin Spacey is very good, as always, and Don Cheadle is amazing as Leland's teacher and mentor. It was a great story and very smart and provocative. I warmly recommend.
