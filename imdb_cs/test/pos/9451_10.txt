This was a fantastically written script in terms of perceiving things from a different perspective. The comedy was timely and not exaggerated, acting was generally amazing, and the line of action served the greater purpose of generating misconceptions when we think of people based solely on their external appearance. A plot of twists when Amanda Bynes's brother / sister tries to play football on teams of boys looking for a new love interest instead. Tatum Channing is a place where a real misconception lies and does a first-class job that they don't care about, later realizing that the most important thing in life is friendship, not attitude.
