"Planet" is a stunning piece of film making. For just Â£ 8,000, Stirton Production has long been one of the most original sci-fi movies. The film, which is physically intimidating to Mike Mitchell, is a combination of great special effects, narration and well-planned action. From the opening battle to the pounding finals, everything about this movie seems far above his budget. <br /> <br /> To start with special effects, definitely not "Revenge Of The Sith" standard, they are level, if not above, such as Babylon 5 and Farscape. And for pricing the same as well. Detail and movement is excellent and captures imagination from off. The construction of everything, ships, weapons, entities is top-notch. The imagination and creativity involved is a real surprise for the film of this budget. Another surprise was the strength of the story and the arc. There are several twists and turns, most of which are well written into the script, surprising and well played. I was surprised that two years in production and the first idea 15 years ago, how important some aspects of today's society are. With events around the world there may be some resonance with lengths that mercenaries are forced to go to to survive. Even sound effects are in place, just like atmospheric music. In addition, the use of lights and costumes contributes to a professional look. Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen looks barren and lonely. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, this movie looks 10, if not 100, as many times as the budget has spent, and testifies to a creative, hard-working team of people, from the director, to cast, effects through a producer and a healthy team. Amazing effort, I suggest you get your hand on a copy of ASAP
