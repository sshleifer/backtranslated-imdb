This movie is powerful. I watched this movie at 3:00 in the morning and was supposed to be working at 6:00 in the morning. I couldn't get out of bed and go to work. This is the strongest movie I've ever seen. And that made me cry and feel the pain of the family. I think Emilo did a great job doing this movie. I agree with previous comments from other opinions that this is the only movie I have seen that brought home war and showed what the family had to go through, what passed the veteran. It's almost a broken heart to think that then people just thought you could come home from a life changing experience and be the same person you were before you left. Kathy Bates reminded me of my mother in a way. I believe she really showed how women felt and acted at that time. I am surprised that this film was not for another award.
