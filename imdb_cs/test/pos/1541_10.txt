Earth case. The title itself raises ideas of mystery. And that's really what's at the heart of this Amnesty International movie. The secret of government, a personal secret, both are an integral part of this story. By far the greatest acting that has been seen for too long, both Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe have been phenomenal in their portrayal of the government investigator. Victim, respectively. In this unusual standard movie, there are only two actors, and it is clear that both actors were dedicated and talented enough to pull the viewer into this small bubble of the world and close the door. <br /> <br /> THE WORD OF WARNING ... <br /> <br /> It is not stated in the description of this film that there is a subplot that deals with child sexual abuse. While there are no graphical details of abuse, nature may be difficult for some viewers to follow - especially given the intensity of the film as a whole. I'm not a big fan of Amnesty International movies, but this movie drew me because acting was so special and I can't help making this movie one of my favorite favorites.
