I was five when the exhibition was held in 1958 and later it was a regular spectator. I remember really enjoying the show, along with "Leave It To Beaver", "My Three Sons", "Ozzie and Harriet", "Dick Van Dyke", "I Love Lucy", "The Real McCoys" And now I enjoyed the first season of "Donna Reed" on DVD and followed the first two episodes. Donna Stone turned out to be an intelligent, well-behaved, problem-solved, calm, staying home with Mom, similar to June Cleaver and unlike Lucy Ricardo. In episode 2, I particularly like how Mrs. Reed becomes a substitute father, trades in sweat dresses and boxing gloves while teaching her son how to defend herself physically against a much larger tyrant. While none of my neighborhood mothers grew up, including my own, meeting the idealistic standards portrayed by Mrs. Reed, it is refreshing to see good manners and intelligent decision-making prevails at the end of the day. to today's accepted standards of vulgarity, selfishness and indifference among neighbors. I can't imagine Jeff and Mary Stone telling parents that interference in neighboring yards is fine when the dog is left outside to bark all day, is acceptable, or to tell his mother to "shut" in the supermarket in front of everyone.
