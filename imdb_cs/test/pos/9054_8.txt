Hick Trek is clearly a movie that envies even El Mariachi-level budget ($ 7000). However, creators are occasionally able to pull out decent effects (often due to great adjustments) such as rays, the situation on board a cat boat and the unique way of communicating Slim T. Jerk with his boat without using traditional communication. equipment. Acting has its rough spots, but the "Horns" view of McBoy is excellent and Fluffy is definitely not too hard on the eyes. I wish the film was longer than its approximate hour - and that should be considered a compliment. This film is a success thanks to the sincerity and hard work of the participants.
