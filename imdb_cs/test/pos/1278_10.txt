Given Christopher Nolan's chain of successful films, it's not important for me to look at his filmography, watch his debut in black and white in less than 70 minutes, with a small budget, but which includes all the characters that made him a master of film director and narrator. Although short, the film is no less grasped by its meandering plot, which lets you guess because the assumption is not scratched. the surface of this story, which is quite amazing with regard to the depth of the story's structure and its characterization. As already mentioned, we follow a writer named Bill (Jeremy Theobald), who begins with the usual obsession with subsequent random people, who scatter the streets in a yuristic way that could initially be seen as research before forming their own Rules and smashing Yippee. He meets a charismatic Cobb (Alex Haw) who turns out to be a thief with strange sensitivities and a modus operandi, and soon finds himself hooked on how he hangs with him. Going about breaking and entering and speculating about the livelihood of their victim, as well as the pursuit of a femme fatale blond (Lucy Russell), a minor gangster who rejects his every progress. He said in a nonlinear way that comes with scenes that aren't totally summed up at the beginning, it sets the movie on several views as you study, Nolan keeps this tension and intrigue with you as the audience he expects and wants that will be properly delivered. There are enough twists to spin the film into a dizzying crescent where the free ends begin to unite, and the brilliance of the star story begins to shine through. It's also amazing how, as the first inexpensive feature, something that is smart and sophisticated can be conceived from its own burglary experience, with Nolan involved in all stages of production, from writing to shoot, produce and direct, after a year of working on the project. shooting can only happen on weekends. Here is an example of successful film roots that should inspire and encourage new filmmakers. Now I'm going to be patiently waiting for Christopher Nolan to start out later this year, whose trailer is such a joke.
