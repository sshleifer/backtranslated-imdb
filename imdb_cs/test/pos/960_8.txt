I do not know why people consider it mushy or unpleasant; It's not like American pie or anything. I don't know why people are insulted by universal plugs; because it is part of a conspiracy, advertising is excusable. This is a fun movie with good dialogue, good humorous joke, good story, good morals (which fortunately is not very happy), GREAT acting and kitschy ending. <br /> <br /> (a smaller spoiler) The basic premise is the classic story of a shepherd boy (Muniz) who lies so much that no one believes him when Wolf (Giamatti) comes. So he gets his best friend Kaylee (Bynes) and goes to wolf madness. Frankie Muniz may be uncomfortable in other roles, but not like Jason Shepherd. He is well versed with the absolute certainty of his character, and there seems to be a lack of expression at first sight; Amanda Bynes. What more can I say? The girl has a gift. She is funny, talented, versatile and very attractive. (I'm just 6 months older than her. I need to get to California soon.) In fact, she was a boy's part of the best friend, but she became a girl once Amanda was interested in the creators. Which works pretty well because the part would be pretty boring without the blessings of Bynes. Paul Giamatti is a very talented man. While some would play Marty Wolf as evil and evil, Giamatti made him - not just a jerk, he thought of you, but on LIKEABLE jerk, a blockbuster that comes to life on the screen, rather than intentionally dimming it. And I doubt that many other actors could get rid of the psychological breakdown that Wolf will also undergo. <br /> <br /> All in all, a great movie. He loved seeing Jaleel White mock. He loved to see all the little references and such built into the movie. (One of the guests at the party scene is director, Shawn Levy, another is former co-founder of Bynes Kenan Thompson.) I loved seeing Amanda in those outfits ........ Get a DVD if you can. She has all kinds of great things in addition and beautiful Mrs. Bynes is your guide in the offers. :)
