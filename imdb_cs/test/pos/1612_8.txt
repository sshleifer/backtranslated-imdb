Thomas Mann's controversial novel is the basis of the film "Death in Venice". Although the book is a hero by the author, in the film director Luchino Visconti, who also wrote the script, transforms it into a composer. As such, author / composer, Gustav Von Aschebach (Dirk Bogarde) on the verge of mental exhaustion is a burnt-out craftsman. After a long and successful career, he now seeks peace and tranquility of less hectic life. He decides to go on vacation to Venice, where he hopes to rejuvenate his declining ambitions. However, while staying in a picturesque seaside resort, the young young boy Tadzia (Björn Andrésen), who watches him closely, strikes him immediately. Although Gustav is fascinated by the wondrous youth, he must find some private time away from the boy's governor (Nora Ricci), while having to cope with the invading plague, which seems to have invaded the city. The film dialogue, as well as the novel, remains subtle as well as several brief encounters of boy and artist. At the end. unlike the book, viewers are hinted at by cues and imaginative flights of imagination. Their affair is never given to wing, essence, or opportunity, and it was not for a short resolution in the book, the film only allows "what if." but definitely criticized by prying eyes. Great story and classic Bogarde. ****
