It is an amazing sight, you should forgive a pun, on 22 women talking about their breasts - theirs, their mothers, other women and how they influence so many aspects of their lives. Young girls, old women and all of them (with all shapes, sizes, configurations, etc.) Talk about development, reaction, celebration, hiding, improving or reducing breasts. It's charming, wonderful, sad, funny and everything in between. Interviews with documentary shots and clips from the famous old "young women's movies" that the girls took to the cafe to watch, the interviews are a fascinating window for men who love women and their breasts to what the other half must say when You don't know you're listening.
