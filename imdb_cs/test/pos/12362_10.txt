This landmark movie now can be seen in two different versions on the Grapevine video release which also includes the English translation of the novel Selma Lagerlof, which she based on Swedish folktale. The first version is Swedish editing under the name PHANTOM CARRIAGE. The second version is a reconstruction of the way it was shown in the United States under the name STROKE OF MIDNIGHT, released by Metro (previously it was M-G-M). The current American version has long since disappeared, but a detailed overview in The New York Times allows us to know how scenes have been edited for home release - and both are fascinating to see. Each version of this film was presented at The Loft Organ in Salt Lake City with a live theater organ provided by Blaine Gale. These performances included a live recording that is part of the Grapevine Video DVD along with a novel and notes on these two versions. While PHANTOM CARRIAGE follows the order of Lagerlof's novel, STROKE INTERVIEW is in some ways easier to follow. Seeing two different adjustments is a lesson on how silent movies could be effectively changed for releases in different countries. Some viewers view this movie as a horror movie, which is definitely not. This is a moral play with the supernatural shades that are used to hit his sharp message. The direction and performance of the performance of the great Victor Sjostrom exceeded time. It's easy to see why M-G-M brought him to Hollywood to direct films like Lillian Gish in LISTER SCARLET and WIND, as well as Lon Chaney in HE WHO GETS SLAPPED. In America he was known as Victor Seastrom. He would also star in the lead role of WILD STRAWBERRIES by Ingmar Bergman, which would allow a masterful performance. Bergman was greatly influenced by KORKARLEN or PHANTOM CARRIAGE on his earlier days. This is a powerful film worth spending time exploring and studying. Grapevine Video is an excellent way to do this.
