I expected a good movie. What I got was an even better film. Chemistry between James and Smith is just incredible. I'm glad to see him in big movie once! The film works because the actors play perfectly. Will Smith is fantastic with his endless spell; Kevin James is cheerful and Eva Mendes ... well, let's say he plays the bitch / sweet / annoying role to his best. What I loved about the movie was the fact that Will Smith didn't even have to try to be nice. He just was! "Date Doctor" had all the right moves, said everything in absolutely perfect ways, and never went over the top. <br /> <br /> Funny parts are cheerful ... and cute, romantic parts are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. And no, it's not a cub.
