I must say it's one of the best movies I've ever seen for naruto. The event was much better than the first movie because it had a much more fighting scene and it came at at a faster pace. it was amazing, the choreography was great, like most of the visual effects. but it is basically the same as the first movie. in the series at see them fight against other ninjas, but in the movies (1 + 2) at see them fight the machine of mass destruction. it is nice to see how they are fighting something other than a ninja, and it was great to see a power other than the chakras. and how other people from another country cross the ocean. Sakura eventually killed someone who is stronger than her. (It really became strong) it was much better than the stuff on the series I'm watching now. When u watch this fast action movie scene it will definitely make your heart a pound. With the new jutsus and garra in the movie, u know it's good. and the music was also good, but I found something missing. But the last theme of the song was plus. (dind dong dang) I think it was a really good song. I totally recommend it. <br /> <br /> In all I give this movie 10 because I just like it. If u decide to watch it, enjoy it. lol
