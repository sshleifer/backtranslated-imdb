With a long disdain for network television programming, I remember the first time I caught an episode of "Police Unit!". It was a coincidence. It was during the opening network of the show to run on ABC in early 1982. I am a chronic channel surfer and was flipping the dial one evening when suddenly appeared a "police unit!" Is the opening credit sequence on my screen. I immediately recognized it as sending out the introductory titles "M-Squad" starring Lee Marvin, one of my favorite favorites. I stopped surfing. Then, of course, the command staff came up, followed by the immortal Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln. Now I thought, "What the hell is THAT ??". Then came the "special guest star" Georg Stanford Brown settled down the declining safe. From that moment I was addicted. The episode was "Fear Ring / Dangerous Task", with its comical references to "On the Waterfront", and "Muhammed Ali", but most memorable of course were all view gags and non sequiturs. Leslie Nielsen and Alan North in their free parody of Lee Marvin and Paul Newlan of "M Squad" were an absolute rebellion. "Finally," I said, "the network television program is really worth watching !!!". You wouldn't know that it would only be canceled a few weeks later. Leave it on the net - I should have known. Anyway, I bought a DVD collection of all six episodes and today they are just as fun as they were 27 years ago. "Naked Gun" movies were amazing as well, but I really missed Alan North (he was as good as Ed Hocken), Peter Lupus as Nordberg (what they thought casting OJ in this section?), And especially William Duell's "Johnny "" a shoe guy. " Great stuff.
