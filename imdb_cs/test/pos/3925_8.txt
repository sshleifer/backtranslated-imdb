My college theater had a special movie yesterday. I have to say that I think everyone was amazed at how good this film was. Although my roommate didn't care about me, he's not on horror movies either, and he just went to see if Paris Hilton could act. By the way, if you're worried about it, don't be. I'm not exactly one of her fans, but I have to be honest and say she was pretty good and has the best scene of death. Overall, all the actors were very good. I'm not going to go into detail because I'm sure you know about it. The characters are very intriguing and in fact are taking care of them, especially the characters of Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray. We meet them as opponents' siblings and end up having to work together. Another plus is that it does not have the elegant appearance of Amityville Horror or Texas Chainsaw Massacre and feels more like a documentary rather than a music video (Don't get me wrong, I loved Texas Chainsaw and enjoyed Amityville). Now for Death Scenes. In most movie slasher, whenever a character is stabbed or killed, the scene immediately cuts off to another scene, but not in this one. When a character is about to die, she dies pretty badly. But filmmakers don't stop and add something extra for each victim. I will not say anything about the scenes of death and will let them see for myself. Although it is a great slasher movie, it has the shortcomings of almost all slasher movies (exploring a haunted house when you shouldn't be, getting up with a suspicious character, breaking up and screaming so you can hear you). Also there is a little stupid plot twist that has been wasted and has not added to the movie at all. You could say that it was just added at the last moment, and if you took it, it would have no effect on the film. Basically, if you're a horror movie fan, check out this movie. You won't be disappointed. It's all you need to be a great movie slasher, maybe the best of the year, though it's a little early. Tension is felt and this is sometimes a funny movie. If you hate horror movies, it's likely that you like it, and if you're split, I suggest you do it.
