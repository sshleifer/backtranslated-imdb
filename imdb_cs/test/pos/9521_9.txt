Starting with "My Name is Joe" as a scene in the career of Alcoholics Anonymous BKM into a crazy spiral of infidelity, double standards, and classified issues. but what do you expect from a family of lawyers? Really funny movie, with some of the most outrageous characters, because The Birdcage, conspiracy and subplot are intertwined with surrealist scenes of decadent Parisian life (sometimes at a wedding reception in men's toilets where grandmother's bride and her frightened girlfriend smoking drugs and cracking blue jokes? No, neither I!) leading to the final scene of almost arcadian symbolism. <br /> <br /> Great.
