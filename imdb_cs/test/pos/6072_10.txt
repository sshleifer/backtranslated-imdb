In a critical scene, as Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) lies in a swimmers cave, she writes something that loudly writes to Hana (Juliette Binoche), claiming that "light has come out, and I am writing darkness ..." beauty cannot be more perfect for film brilliance far from the tedious English patient. " With such a dramatic flutter that it holds firmly on its feet, and the power of a film that will not be left, this film proudly celebrates the secrets and romances of World War II, taking elements of Casablanca and Lawrence Of Arabia along with some Independence in the form of Tuscany. The English patient pulls heartily and takes us with a mysterious first act, a romantic second act and a beautiful ... beautiful final act, and that's not 'It's just amazing pace and setup, it's the performance of Ralph Fiennes, who keeps us sympathetic, even though Count Almásy, from the very beginning, proves to be an absolutely inexorable character. He usually performs as a villain, turns out to be tainted, but ultimately human in color as a man who has received a desperate love that he must fulfill. Many of them will criticize this film on the basis of the so-called "glorification of adulterers" "but those who know nothing. The contrasts between the two periods (before and after the plane crash on start) are spectacular because the patient is a regretful person who suffers from what he has done, the evil that once lacked him, while the person before the fall is an individual like anyone else. He wants this woman, but he can't have it, Fiennes will bring the human qualities of Almása in a way he couldn't. He couldn't be a better actor for the job. So please take these notes to heart, look at the movie, know nothing about those who call it "boring" or "despicable", and should be ashamed of such a one-dimensional view of the movie, a look that neither studied nor repaired, and probably does not plan to correct. The English patient is the best of any movie he has ever won Best Picture Oscar for many reasons hidden in their poetic triumphs.
