The title suggests that this film is a sequel to the "American werewolf in London". None of the characters from the previous movie will return and is not even mentioned in this movie by title. So as a sequel, AAwiP fails, a man would say: <br /> <br /> I dare say the opposite. American Werewolf in Paris is a charming, powerful horror movie. It's one of the best werewolf movies I've ever seen. And I saw quite a bit of my share, like the American werewolf in London, Howling, Wolfen, The Wolfman, and the Underworld trilogy. The story tells the story of three Americans visiting Paris on holiday. At the top of the Eifel Tower, one of them rescues a woman trying to commit suicide. What starts as a romantic relationship slowly turns into a nightmare when the dark secrets that lurk in the city are revealed ... <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed playing in this movie. Especially the two stars of the film: a woman who tried to commit suicide and a guy who rescued her. They have good chemistry. But the other two Americans also play their part nicely. I did not find anything annoying at the acting, so for that thumb! The effects on werewolves are nice. It doesn't look too cheap or fake. Of course, opinions are divided on the subject. But let's say I wasn't disappointed. There's also a lot of humor in this movie. There are some really funny scenes you'll probably remember for a long time. So to sum up, the American Werewolf in Paris doesn't have to be a direct continuation of his predecessor, but it's still a nice movie. Ideal for werewolf fans! 7 out of 10 Stars!
