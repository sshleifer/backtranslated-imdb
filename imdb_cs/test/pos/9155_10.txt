I loved this show, but then I don't remember that she never loves anything he did, starting with the "Americanization of Emily." The city sheriff, who is trying to steal a blind city and go to Mexico, must love it. Like everything he does, he has a tongue in the cheek that denotes it as Garner. James plays the same character on many of his shows and movies, but it never disappears. <br /> <br /> P.S. re: Killing off the main character <br /> <br /> If I remember that "good" brother was killed and replaced by "evil" twin in an effort to increase the rating, ie; making it more like any other west on television at the time. I think this show was too long before his time and I'm still missing. Television is missing without Jimmy Gam's show.
