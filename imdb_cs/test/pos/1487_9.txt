This TV series is about a stupid and unconventional English gentleman who gets to all kinds of merry misfortunes. I remember seeing Mr. Bean and his family in 1990, when I was a child. My family laughed so strongly in each episode and its content still appears in our daily conversations twenty years later. The memorable scenes that are still in my mind include Mr. Bean, who is trying to get out of the parking lot, shoot the lights, count the sheep and the pool. We bought all of Mr. Bean's videos on VHS, with no expensive expense. It's worth it because we watched them over and over again! It's so rare to see a very funny TV series that is suitable for all ages.
