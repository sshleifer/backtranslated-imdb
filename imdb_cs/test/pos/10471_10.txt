The French Babbette appears in a humble house of two Danish sisters wet, cold and alone. The fleeing revolution in Paris, she seeks refuge in an obscure religious community on the windy Jutland coast. Unknown to those who so generously marry her, she's a great cook, food artist. Babette is dedicated to her adopted community through thrift, productivity and shared belief. He only leaves when he wins the French lottery - 10,000 francs. She returns loaded with exotic cargo, forms of one meal reminiscent of her father's sister's birthday, the founder of the community. This food floats darkly in the minds of believers who deny joy, but its subtleties are translated by an aging military officer who, as a young man in Paris, has learned to appreciate the sensory experience that is developing here. Food is the pinnacle of film, a community of love in the intermediate art of food - intact uplifting about art, love, and the meaning of life.
