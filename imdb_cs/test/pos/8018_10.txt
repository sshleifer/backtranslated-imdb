While "The Jackal" [remake of the excellent "Day of the Jackal"] has better aesthetics [and a shipping budget], this movie nails a real person "Carlos" down ... Quinn stands out by that the Navy Officer resorted to appear as Wiley Jackal to pull him out of hiding, and turns to Kingsley and Sutherland to do so. Risking your family, your career, and everything you believe takes on a task, though totally reluctant. <br /> <br /> To say more, it could spoil ... it's an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 Niro ~ stars [of 4]
