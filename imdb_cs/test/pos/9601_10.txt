I cannot add much to what has already been said, except that I will need 10 lines for minimum rules. In fact, I have DVDs on VHS, but the quality is pretty poor and I desperately need it to be officially released. Just imagine what extras I would like to see (Tim Healy's character swears one of those 'Footballers' programs would be great!). Can you imagine it now, right? But of course, most people seem to have to continue to dream of releasing a DVD. Certainly God must be someone at the DVD publishing department at ITV, who also knows something about British culture, is the web savvy and has enough of them to look at IMDb now and again? Oh, good.
