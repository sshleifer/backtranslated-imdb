I'm not a big fan of film musicals. "Annie" was a theater show I loved, but the movie was a flop. "Phantom Of The Opera" (and I believe there were three) failed to match the production of Weber. But I loved it. The DVD will be a place of honor among my breeders. Although it is a film adaptation, it somehow captures the taste and atmosphere of a live theater. Bette Midler, always a delicacy, is exceptional in this role. There's great music, lots of laughter and even a tear or two. I saw most of the great musicals of the 1980s and 1990s. I missed something, so it's not a comparison. But if it comes to life, I'll be first in line for tickets! But this film is so good, I'm going to be in a strange position when I wonder if theater production will be a movie.
