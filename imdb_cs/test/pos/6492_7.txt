In August Days / Dies d'agost Marc Recha gave us the sun-saturated Catalan road movie, which is mostly a meandering improvised meditation on brotherhood and the cultivation of the dead. Beautiful, sometimes large, richly atmospheric 35 mm. landscape images, a nice soundtrack and a Catalan language narrative are as charming as the mood if you are content with a trajectory that has no momentum and nowhere. Director Marc Recha and his unidentified twin David are stars and the story is expressed by their younger sister. Marc studied the life of Ramon Barnon (1940-2001), a socialist editor who was a family friend. He felt it was saturated with information and had to rest. The break has changed into the creation of this film, which seeks to capture the mood of Barnils' conversations, the ideas of the Spanish Civil War, the dry season they are experiencing, the harsh landscape, the affection of the Rech brothers, floats and tanned nudity and all the characters or stories they came when they camped from their van. This leads to the persecution of a giant catfish and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers. Finally, David has to go back to Barcelona to be with his daughter and Marc has to go back to his project and it ends there. I found it fascinating to listen to the extended Catalan narrative with its mixture of Spanish and French-sounding words (possibly related to Proven√ßal?). It is not a big movie but its attention and meaning as a selection of a film festival with its pure visual and auditory beauty and its way of playing with genres and mixing autobiography with fiction and in a fresh and coherent way in a documentary way. Official Selection of New York Film Festival 2006 at Lincoln Center.
