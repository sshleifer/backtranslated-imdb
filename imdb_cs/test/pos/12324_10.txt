The entire film, a refined adaptation of one of Joyce's "Dublin" stories, takes place on the night of January 6 (Epiphany), 1906. Most of the film takes place at an annual party given by three spinsters (two sisters and their niece). ), where a group of upper-class dancers meet for evening music, recitations and dinners. While alone there are very few conspiracies, the interaction and conversation between the group reveal a lot about Dublin in the early 20th century, when the commotion for independence began. Cast, all talented Irish stage actors except Anjelica Huston, are universally amazing and one feels that he is the guest of the gathering itself. The charming final scene, between Mrs. Huston and the amazing Donal McCann, reveals much about the marriage of the characters. There is a blessing mixed with humor and insight, and for those who like quiet, thoughtful movies, "Dead" is highly recommended. My wife is from Dublin, every 6th of January we are doing a ritual to watch this amazing movie. After many glances, he never misses me, and every time I pick up something I missed.
