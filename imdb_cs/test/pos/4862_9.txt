Cleopatra 2525 is a very fun, fun show. You shouldn't take the whole show seriously, but if you want to have fun, it's your TV show. Being manufactured by Xena is a quality guarantee and Cleopatra 2525 is not that different from Xena. The female warrior formula is brought to the future where it does not have to fight with warriors or gods, but with dangerous robots living on the surface, and people are forced to live underground. Along the two seasons Cleopatra develops an interesting and witty underground world and we know three main characters: Cleopatra (Jennifer Sky), Hel (Gina Torres) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt). Everyone is different, but as a team they work really well. The three main actresses appeared earlier in Xena, like most of the regular / guest games (there are some famous faces from Hercules or both shows). I really liked the character played by Danielle Cormack (Ephina in Xena), which is very different from all her roles I knew before. So if you like Xena and Hercules, you'll love Cleopatra 2525. If you don't know them, try it: I'm sure you will like it.
