I have seen many Dustin Hoffman movies like Straw Dogs or Rain Man and I liked it, but his characters are often calm or even shy. I expected to be in this movie just like in Straw Dogs, but I saw a completely different person. He was more energetic in this movie and reminded me a little of Al Pacino in Serpic. The film was very interesting from start to finish. I liked how Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do everything in his son's. This film is also revealing. Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise they adopt without involving other people.
