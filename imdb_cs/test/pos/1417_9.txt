Stephen Hawkings is a genius. He is king of geniuses. Watching this movie makes me feel stupid. But it's a great movie. Not too fun, but very interesting. Film centers around a wheelchair bound Stephen Hawkings, a man who makes Einstein's average and his theories and scientific discoveries about space, time, galaxy, and black holes. Anyone who sometimes finds himself in a time when he is really intense will come to the point where they think they have the universe and the universe figured it out and swear as soon as they sober it up to write it all down. Here's the man who felt the feeling for more than six hours. Here is a man who, despite the suffering of Lou Gehrig's disease, has become the greatest mind the world has ever seen. Watch it and listen to how he formulated theories on black holes. Amazing. You won't be the same when you see.
