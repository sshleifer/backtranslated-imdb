The end of Suburbia, as it should appeal to general citizens and mass consumers, is likely to become a status of cultural reform. The film uses a super-cynical analysis of authors, policy makers and social philosophers towards the paradox of suburban style - especially in the post-war era. What we've created in America is a place with "none of the equipment of rural life, and none of the amenities of urban life in the city." This is a recipe that is laid out in the suburbs, and the film focuses on the singular idea of ​​"Oil". Essentially, in the most general sense, that the world is nearing or at its peak in oil production, and when we realize it in full, vital lifestyle changes will be in place, whether our best interests or violent violence against us with quality. . living and residents of the slum in Calcutta could not describe us. If nothing more, the end of Suburbia will siphon the viewer down to make him feel comfortable. That must happen. It is a bleak look at our own way of life. The ambivalence lies mainly in the critical analysis of each film. I anticipate many unprepared viewers who flick the film like a smug liberal propaganda - like the movie by Michael Moore. What they can't consider is that such a reaction is all too normal when such a message hits such an incredibly difficult environment of the vast majority of the masses. This is true, and a student who studies spatial planning can tell you that we should prepare better, because what we have in maintaining the quality of life in this shrinking sump of illicit resources is faster than the race of people affected by the black epidemic.
