I looked at this cartoon as a child, a father, and now a grandson. It's my favorite cartoon. I love characters, great songs and very good drawings. I totally love the main song that appears throughout the cartoon. I think it's a beautiful little cartoon. Everyone I have shown it just loves. It's too bad to open on such a bad day (Pearl Harbor bombing). If it weren't for bad timing, it would be a great success. I hope I can find a DVD because all VHS tapes don't do justice. I think if someone shows it to his child, he'll come up with the same result. They will just love it. <br /> <br />
