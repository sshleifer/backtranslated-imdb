This is a low budget, well acted a small gem. Alice, a small town of Massachusetts teenager, full of existence, embarks on a journey to escape her mother who overcomes burgers and her own job as a check-out in the super market. He sets off for Florida and stays with his richer friend in high school, a freshman in Miami. After her car breaks suspiciously on the road and loses all her money, she ends up with a retired couple at RV who also travels to Florida. The couple, Judith Ivy and Bill Raymond, are very hospitable and it turns out to be a prostitute and her pimp. Slowly, Alice is lured into the truck to stop prostitution, while RV meanders along the way in a general direction to Florida. Despite flashing flashes, we learn more about Alice and her desire to leave little Milford. We also see a couple in a new light, and their lives and the choices made by the couple and Alice seem quite trustworthy. An excellent, well-made film that you will think about when it's over.
