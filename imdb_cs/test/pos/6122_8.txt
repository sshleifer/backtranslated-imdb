For me, the Pink Flamingos lived up to its reputation as a shocking, disgusting, repulsive, kitschy movie that I expected it to be, it really contains everything except the kitchen sink. We treat her for almost two hours of ugliness, which never ceases: rape, sex, sex with chickens, transsexuals, castration, murder, cannibalism, and horrible portrayal of the anus singing. It's about a strange couple who start a family trailer race, trying to steal their title as "the most vibrant people alive". A divine (fat guy in the thrust) is an incredibly ugly human being who actually becomes painful. Believe me, when I say this movie is not the one to quickly forget, especially the final scene in which Divine eats crap from the sidewalk. I've always thought John Waters was reevaluated and I can't say I like the movie, but it's an experience if you ever see it.
