The first picture has returned from oblivion and now you can hear and see it! In the fall of 1894, at the Edison Laboratory Complex in West Orange, New Jersey, Thomas Edison's companion William Dickson tried to combine two existing technologies (phonograph and kinetoscope) to record sound and image together. In this case, Dickson was unable to synchronize audio and video playback, so this experimental film was never released to paying viewers ... and then (unlike many silent movies created by Dickson at that time for Edison), he has no official name. The Silent Image (recorded at 40 fps) was in the Library of Congress years, known to film historians as muted curiosity. It was also known that the "soundtrack" was recorded on one of the raw wax rollers that swarmed at the National Historic Site of Edison ... though no one knew which one was. But now it has changed. Recently, curators have placed a wax roller that has broken into several pieces. They were rebuilt: playback was obtained and the sound was digitized. Walter Murch, the Hollywood veteran of the soundtrack, cleared the background noise and adjusted the digitization to synchronize with the film image that Murch digitally compressed to 30 fps. The sound and image are finally synchronized! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a man's voice off the screen, calling, "The other of you are ready?" Go on! ' (Invisible speaker remains unidentified, but was probably Dickson's assistant Fred Otto.) Dickson plays the violin on a huge tripod-mounted funnel on the screen (one of Edison's sound recorders), while two male lab assistants beside him in full view of the camera they go round each other because of the fast dance dance of Dickson's music. The film lasts barely 17 seconds: just so long we can wonder about this raw technology before we are provoked. laughing looking at two man rolling in his arms. Speaking of this, here's the WARNING: a familiar but very inaccurate reference book ('Celluloid Closet', late Vito Russo) includes a frame extension from this movie and identifies it as 'Gay Brothers'. This is incorrect. 'Gay Brothers' is a completely different film that Dickson made in Edison's lab during the same period. "The Gay Brothers" never had a soundtrack: it's a short feature film about two brothers who aren't "gay" in the way Russo thought. Mr. Russo, the deceased, wanted us to perceive Dickson's experimental sound film (probably the first film musical!) As a 19th century homoerotic artifact. (Hmm, what is it about gays and musicals?) Sorry, there is no such content. This vital movie deserves a rating of 10 out of 10. No 'lost' movie should ever be considered irreplaceable if it was not intentionally destroyed: I'm glad to announce that this movie is finally available to viewers, as his producer intended, more than a century after his filming!
