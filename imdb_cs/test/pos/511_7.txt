It seems to me that many people do not know that Blade is actually a superhero movie on par with X-Men, Daredevil, Punisher and likes. What all these heroes (and in the case of the X-Men hero group have in common) is that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel. Blade was originally a normal man (in a blue suit) who was chasing vampires for personal grudge and eventually faced Dracula himself and was dull for lack of a better word. So boring in the fact that the character was suspended and in fact never used in the Marvel universe. At least until it was rediscovered. David Goyer made a brilliant blow when he took a Blade figure and turned it into a leather canvas of a dark knight. He can't take all the credits, and Stephen Norrington, who has the best of character with his distinctive visual style, has to do much. The Blade character (Wesley Snipes) is amazing in this film and blends martial arts with Batman as darkness. Snipes is quite good as the title character and is successful in bringing duality and inner character demons. But he is quite a tough actor in both voice and attitude and is only interested in one movie (which is clearly seen from the inferior sequels). Kris Kristofferson is also good and truly brings the tormented character of Whistler into life with energy and a sense of timing. However, N'Bushe Wright is quite weak as a leading lady who makes her character relatively flat and lifeless. Donal Logue is pretty funny and handles a lot with a smaller character. German, Udo Kier, should be mentioned because it brings a lot of finality and style to the vampire race, probably from his experience of playing Dracula. Stephen Dorf provides the best performance in the film and its chilling performance because Deacon Frost is one of the best on-screen bad guys I've ever seen. The story is good and I feel that it restores a vampire genre (something that hasn't been done since Robert Rodrigues' by Dusk Till Dawn) adds a lot of contemporary elements and keeps a comic feeling. Being a comic book does not mean that the film is unrealistic. Far from it. Great efforts have been made to make the film seem as real as possible. Including effects that are pretty good for their time. I found that vampire "money" is very nice. Instead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies Norrington decided to leave vampires spontaneously com-bust that looks great. The fact that overall effects have been well done contributes to the credibility of a film that would otherwise fall on the face. As mentioned above, Norrington has a very different visual style that distinguishes him from the directors of the following Blade films. Del Toro is almost as skilled, but I prefer Norrington style. His style gives the film a very special look and feel, but above all, it gives the movie atmosphere. Very tense dark atmosphere that fits perfectly with the main character and story. Along with the visual style music that also works well and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the movie. All in all Blade is a very entertaining movie that should have about 8 from me, but a few unpleasant flaws (which cannot be revealed without the cast of the movie, enough to say, many of them are located near the end of the movie ) makes this movie to settle down with a high 7. <br /> <br /> 7/10
