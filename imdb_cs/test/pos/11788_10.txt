Aah yes training show was great. Not only do many women get in shape, but many teenage boys also have great exercises. I'm not saying that the show is by no means unsuitable for family viewing, but if you check other works from the producer, you will find other adult themes that are also excellent in his works. Many viewers were looking forward to the show, and men and women all received good information and a wonderful release from training. The girls were perfect and beautiful, the show is classic and should participate well in syndication. The show should always be in place, because there are never enough opportunities for health and beauty.
