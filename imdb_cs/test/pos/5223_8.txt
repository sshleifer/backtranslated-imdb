044: Great Trail (1930) - issued October 24, 1930; view 4/5/06. BIRTHS: Richard Harris, Harold Pinter, Robert Atkins. DOUG: In Hollywood, Raoul Walsh introduced his latest film The Big Trail west of a trek to the west across the border, where the 23-year-old actor John Wayne appears. In 1930, we see a lot of "primacy", but few "bests". In addition to John Wayne's first film, we also have the first widescreen movie (though we only watched the full-frame version). Interestingly, the decision to make a movie in widescreen was basically because the widescreen screen became more popular later: to compete with a television that had not yet appeared commercially, but curiosity still appeared. Likewise, this film was extremely good. On the opening cover cards, we learned that this is the western most traditional species, America, the country who should live on it, etc., And it's an excellent demonstration. Walsh gives us some amazing visuals of the car company in the wild (when they reach the cliff, each rope must be in a row), and we also get to the vengeance that includes Wayne, who watches the man who killed one of his friends. (Remember something similar in Stagecoach). Wayne's hard cowboy routine is there at least in part, and he would certainly continue to develop in other films. Since this film represents all the work of Wayne in the early 1930s for the Odyssey, we will see his face again until we arrive at Stagecoach, but as soon as we do, we'll see him at the end of the Odyssey and beyond. KEVIN: Ah, our first sound western and John Wayne's first lead role. It's Raoul Walsh's The Big Trail. This review will be short because it's been a few weeks since I watched it. I enjoyed this film, but it wasn't far from the masterpiece. Mostly predictable adventures had several surprises, such as the bad guys brain, Red Flack (Tyrone Power Sr. in his final role) being killed halfway; I thought the boss would be in the end, but it ended with Bill Thorpe (Ian Keith). I remember not liking how Breck (Wayne) kills Thorpe and finally revenge. I understand that this is what he was supposed to do in the story, but I don't like his thoughts much when he tells Ruth why he has to do it. I think he had a much greater responsibility to the hundreds of settlers he led through the rugged west. The last movie he viewed: Animal Crackers (1930). Last movie chronologically: Nut Soup (1930). Another film: L'Age D'or (1930).
