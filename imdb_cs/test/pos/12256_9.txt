... there was "Broadcast News" and what a good thing it was. This simple one just stands and sounds barbaric yawp in a way that resonates two decades later. There are moments - especially with regard to cutesy scores - when this movie becomes a little eighty. or a little too "Sleepless in Seattle." Fortunately, there are few and far away. One-third of social satire, one-third of a romantic comedy, one-third of drama, three faulty but cute people at its core, it's smart and moving and almost incredibly funny. Especially Holly Hunter has never been more fun watching a comedy role. (And yes, I'm including "Raising Arizona," her next star hence, in this review.) <br /> <br /> Legitimate classic.
