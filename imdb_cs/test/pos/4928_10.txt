Tiny Toons is the first cartoon I remember as a child and I loved her every minute. When I was four or five, my parents bought the video How I spent my vacation. I saw it again and again until I discovered a new word. A few days ago my three-year-old cousin came and had to have fun. I decided to show him this old memory of my childhood. New I laughed, but I was surprised how much I laughed. Like every Tina Toons movie and the episode, humor is based more on wackiness and slapstick humor, and it succeeds immensely. Bugs, Babs, Plucky Duck, Maton Pig, and Fifi all endure the amazing adventures of Bugs and Babs white water rafting with a little help from Superman, Plucky Duck and Maton Pig traveling to the biggest amusement park just riding on a monorail, and Elmyra goes special search to find cute kittens in safari country. Some of the classic humor stands in this Tiny Toon adventure and is one of the best crazy comedy I've ever seen. My favorite gag had to be a monorail when Hamton and Plucky arrive, ride a monorail, and leave Plucky's dismay. No matter what your age is, you'll laugh with tears without having to deal with language and nudity. Tiny Toons Adventure: How I Spent My Vacation. They play voices: Charles Adler, Tress MacNeille, Joe Alaskey and Don Messick. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 5 stars.
