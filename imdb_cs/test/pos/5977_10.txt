Even if Voskhozhdeniye was your favorite movie, you could watch it at most every ten years. It's just too emotionally strenuous. It is considered the most beautiful film Shepitka, this story is the story of guerrillas operating in the Belarusian forest in the dead winters in the German occupied Soviet Union. When attacking the audience, the sheer physicality of war experience, especially the hardship of winter and snow, the real struggle for survival against nature and fascists, there is always a subtle, barely derived subtext of the text of moral judgment and whether one can be moral or immoral in one context, but otherwise in another. The guerrilla group hiding in the forest is attacked by a German patrol and loses food supplies. Two men, Rybak, who know the area, and Sotnikov, a Jewish teacher, have the task of going to a small village for food. They find that a village burned to the ground with nothing edible and nothing more than charred beams and foundations in which a child's mirror is hidden in one cubic hole. The overwhelming feeling is that who will bring the brutality of war to the earth and curse people. I was thinking about the war that the Americans and the British brought to Iraq and how to bring the horrors of war to the people is an act of a degenerate nation. to get, under duress, a lamb from a coworker. The Germans arrive and both guerrillas escape under fire. Sotnikov is hit in his feet and holds the Germans as Rybak leaves with his lamb. Sotnikov becomes so desperate to prepare himself not to be taken alive and to remove his shoe to put a bullet in his head. Rybak returns and Sotnikov pulls out of the fire. Rybak pulls Sotnik through the forest, bloody meter behind the meter, all in one long step. Every meter is pain, yet it continues to be drawn through deep snow, ridges, across depression, through black stumps that burst under the weight of men. There are several similarities to the film dictionary of Tarkowsky here - long takes documenting the process, the effect of repeating use, and the resulting emotional stress that builds a longer shot continues. In the background, unnoticed because of the action, the question hangs - Rybak has committed immoral behavior by returning to Sotnikov? Whether under the moral standards of Marxist-Leninism or just an ordinary imperative of survival, was it not his duty to get food back to his starving band and leave Sotnikov to cover his escape? To sacrifice one man to survive? Which leads to the question - Can a man who is immoral under one philosophical system be considered moral under another moral system? Guerrillas come as another curse of war in a farm that contains a woman with three young children. She is agitated by the scourge of war and barely hangs on her three children. They barely rest when more Germans appear. They make their way to leave and are directed to the attic to hide. Sotnikov's cough gives them away. When a German finds his head to look and no one reacts, he threatens to break fire through the loft and Rybak's nerves and they are captured. Who here has moral responsibility? Sotnikov for Cough or Fish for Cracking? Both guerrillas and mother are tied up and taken to a nearby town that passes ominously under a wrought iron arch at the entrance. They will find the director and the little girl already in custody. They are interrogated by the turncoat of Belarus played by Tarkowsky's favorite Anatoli Solonitsyn. Sotnikov holds his head during interrogation and torture and just asks what was the prewar investigator's profession? He does not answer, but the "teacher" was likely to answer his easy post at the desk. Rybak, on the other hand, begged for his life and even offered to join the police. The previously unseen defect of the character, which has made the "bad" moral decision, the ambiguity (sentiment) that disguised him from judgment, now becomes obvious, disturbing, and very ugly. Five sit in a dark cell. They are all scheduled for the next day. From there, the elements of the Christian parable are stronger. The original Rembrandt lighting and compositions are used as other ideas about Christ's Old Master. He decides he can save everyone if he blames everyone. He must be kept alive until dawn so he can save everyone. He asks his mother forgiveness and the director, who knew what was going on, did not feel such despair when he dies unnecessarily, as before. Morning comes. The Germans don't care if Sotnikov takes all the sins of his companions or not. Everyone will be hung up. They follow the steeply sloping street, which is the virtual Via Dolorosa. The bench is taken to the place of execution, which is the gateway to the city. There are five ropes hanging out of it. The bench is only three, so Sotnikov stands on a stump that Rybak digs out from under him. They're all hung up. As Rybak descends the road with the Germans, someone in the crowd calls him Judas, an unnecessary allusion, Shepith's only mistake. Rybak imagines several times that he is shooting in the back and trying to escape, die an honorable death and unsuccessfully tries to hang into the shithouse, but leaves the Germans as a battered dog. But if Rybak is morally entitled to return and save Sotnikov's life, is it wrong to try to save his own life?
