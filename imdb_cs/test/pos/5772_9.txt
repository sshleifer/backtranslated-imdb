This zany film rivals Ghost and Mr. Chicken as one of Don Knott's best film performances. Knotts is an accountant for City Hall Podunk, which is good for citizens' scams. They fire "three competent accountants and keep a stupid one" (of course, Knotts is dumb). When his trash cohort accidentally empties a bad trash bin, Knott finds himself in a bizarre trap set by the city council. Fun moments in the movie include the Bowling Alley Restroom scene, and the cemetery scene is absolutely cheerful. A typical Knotts, nervous ninny act is well used, and as usual is surrounded by lots of crazy characters of actors from the sixties. Such actors as Frank Welker and Pitt Herbert add to the chaos. How can you expect Knotts to be armed with a big car, a pretty girl, and no real trace of what he's doing. Fun for everyone, especially nostalgia enthusiasts, but just about being loved.
