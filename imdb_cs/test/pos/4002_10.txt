Wow, What a wonderful movie! Mr. Im did it again! His latest work, ChunHayang (2000), was a great movie, but this one is even bigger. This 66-year-old director, who was selected as the official feature film at Canne for the second time in a two-year series, is getting better and better at what he does with Korean culture. Simply put, Chihwaseon is about a great Korean painter, (Ohwon) YANG, Seung-Up, who was considered a miracle at the end of the 19th century. The basic story of this film tells the story of Yang, Seung-up and the historical background of his time. He was an orphan, but in his youth he was picked up by a noble man named Kim, Byung-Moon. This Mr.Kim becomes a mentor of Yang, as well as a lifelong friendship, and continues to support his great talent, which he knew first. With Yang's great effort and natural talent, his fame grows faster and faster than his country's strength, Korea falls down. Jang's personality portrayed in the film is very complicated and one of the best actors in Korea, Choi, Min-sik goes deep inside Jang's soul. Suffering eyes reveal the struggle of the great artist's life. Sometimes he is very serious, but suddenly turns into a wild maniac. He drinks as an alcoholic and whenever he sleeps with courtesans. Even, he said in the movie, "Without alcohol and women, I can't draw. (Alcohol and women are my only inspiration)" At the height of fame, develop your own style, travel all around the country and never give up your pride as an artist for authority money. I don't want to give out all the details, but I think you definitely did something about the movie. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing about this movie is cinematography. It is so breathtaking as to capture every beauty of the landscape. Each scene is like the work of Jang's painting. And the script is also perfect. Above all, it is a deeper meaning of what a true artist does. For example, Kim advises Yang in the film that 'before one holds the brush, one must set a goal in life'. This is a very moving and inspiring line and there are many more. Go Watch this movie if you are going to a festival in Canne. Chihwasun will be the biggest movie ever made that deals with the life of a painter in film history.
