While the concept of "data doctor" is one thing that will save this film from being an otherwise average romantic comedy with a standard chart for that genre, I found it nice to comment on it, so I liked it much more than having an average plot without many twists. Will Smith will do a great job, as always, like Hitch, a man who devotes his life to advising men on how and how not to win over women ... since his unsuccessful attempt to keep his college girlfriend. There's a lot of laughter in trying to help his latest patient, overweight, strange asthma, Albert Brennman (Kevin James) to successfully judge the beautiful colleague Allegra Cole (Amber Valetta). Also, when she decides to get rid of a woman she encounters in a turkey bar that doesn't seem to want him, Sara (Eva Mendes) attracts him - it seems to be great to deal with him, so I guess from at that time he never actually practiced his own rules. Unfortunately, Sara is a columnist who is interested in a "data doctor" who, along with Allegra, has a seemingly sleeping guy like Albert, especially after Vance Munson (Jeffrey Donovan). suggests that the doctor he saw disgusted him when he did not realize he had refused to see him. Problems follow and Hitch is stuck left thinking about what to do with his own relationship, while not being any big help to Albert when he tries to figure out what more to do in his. Acting is good, there is a lot of humor and some other fine points with meaning. Hitch's character is funny and wise, sometimes he can be both at once. Is it true that a misunderstanding when a woman is grieved in something that one has not really done (why do they always show it?) As ordinary and irritating - guess it would not be if it was first, not fifth, time I saw it but the rest was completely new. I just wish that this movie was longer - I remember watching it 3/5 when it once played on the TV - but I still approve. Certainly worth paying for its brevity.
