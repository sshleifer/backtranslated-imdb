1 Let's pause for a moment and stop pretending we could, could or should know, "how it is" or "it should be" in space. Human knowledge in this area is probably primitive, as the Middle Ages maps say, compared to today's satellite maps, so we really have no idea. 2 Given that it's "just" BBC TV dock-simulation, it gets much better than many big Hollywood markets budgets, and that's just incredible. All in all, a show that is worth seeing because it shows CGI an improved and fictitious description of what we know about the solar system so far. 4 probably fictionalization and CGI - the whole thing is the only way to taste it for the general public. Watch clips from REAL spatial missions and REAL spatial probes? The quality is generally average and poor, and the comparison would be between looking at the chest x-ray (and what it tells about the human body) and comparing it to the CGI-ed cyborg ... which would be the funniest? The X-ray of the chest is real, while the cyborg is just a fictional SFX. 5 actors do a good job. No one will tell my grandchildren, but very fair for being a BBC dock simulation.
