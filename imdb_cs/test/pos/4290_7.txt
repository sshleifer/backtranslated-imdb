Separate LIES changed my life. In fact, Q&A did. SPOILERS BELOW. You only read if you are watching trailers, or if you have already seen it: Emily Watson is cheating on Tom Wilconson's character. My first response to Emily's puppy-dog eyes was, "It's over. Dump her. She was stuck for some reason. Not in a pathetic way. She just listened. And she tried to accept her needs. Sometimes he needed to leave. But I still wanted to see her <br /> <br /> Consequently, Julian, a screenwriter and director, talked about the movie, I'm glad he did, because I'm honestly I'm also you, and I was too immature to get to it. Tom's character loved her, and no matter how much her pursuit of her needs disagrees with what she wants, she will always love her. The fact that they wanted to be with someone else did not do it, and when you get in fifty, there's a good chance you won't find the love of your life again, so you can't be as dismissive as when you were younger e try not to make things work because the alternative can be much worse. She needed what she needed, and she couldn't help herself. He had to learn to let go if he wanted to be a full-fledged man he could be. He helped her persecute her lover, even if he did. Another thing: Julian said guilt is the strongest instrument of the manager. Again, the strongest controller tool is blame. At the end of the movie, Tom released her from her burden. He felt the need to let her know he loved her, but not to get her back; he wanted to let her know that she might not feel guilty or wrong about the relationship, just because it ended in such a terrible way. It's not my way to play a message-based movie, rather than a performance, especially when I understand this message better when the director explains it, but I make an exception because I feel like I'm one more mature, than I'd see a movie. > <br /> The realization of the film was a nice British speed. Rupert was slimy and ugly. Tom and Emily were their usually solid, real characters.
