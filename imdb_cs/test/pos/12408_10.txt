This film about a group of small urban teens who decide to rob a local bank is excellent. Justin Walker wants to get out of his little town, just like Jimmy Stewart in "It's a wonderful life." Unlike George Bailey, however, Brian robs a bank to finance his dream of attending an art school, even though his father doesn't support it. Offering Brian to act as a customer and distract. It's an alluring offer that is offered to many people and I ask what they do. Brian does it. When the sheriff (James Remar) and his power surround the bank, things go from bad to worse. It's a standoff with even Feds moving to kill children if they have a clean shot. The sheriff must stop it and try to end the distance slightly. Unfortunately, the tension rises and the teen turns on himself. Some are out of control. The paper cutter scene is terrible and hard to trace. Very intense!
