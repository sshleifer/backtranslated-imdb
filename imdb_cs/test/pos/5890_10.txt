World War II veterans are returning home and hard to adapt to civilian life. This excellent drama is professionally managed by Wyler and beautifully shot by well-known cameraman Toland. Despite its almost three-hour length it does not move for a while. Sherwood offers very human characters and a great dialogue. Andrews has perhaps his best role as a man trying to quit. Also good are Wright as a young woman with love, Mayo as tram wife Andrews and veteran Russell as a man who has lost both hands. However, top honors go to March and Loy as a long-devoted couple face challenges while getting reacquainted with each other.
