I saw this movie a week ago and I had to convince my friend to come with me because this movie seems to be getting such bad reviews. It is certainly not "Human Traffic" or "Lock, Stock ..." but it is by no means a flop. I think that the fact that there are so many big-budget movies at the moment means it was ignored, but it shouldn't be. I think he's trying to do what he wants to do - to entertain us for an hour and a half and to be happy and content. I'd rather go and see the 'Mummy' that looks boring. And no, I'm not a teenager. Don't listen to critics, Star Wars fans don't. This movie is well worth seeing if you just see the magnificent Luke de Lacey and Rupert Penry-Jones. Go see it!
