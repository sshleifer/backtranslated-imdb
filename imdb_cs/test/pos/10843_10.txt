The BBC has surpassed itself with borders that have crossed with Tipping the Velvet. In the past, they were "brave" with the work of Dennis Potter, but this mini-series (as shown in the UK) is excellent. Andrew Davies' work comes first - I did not read Sarah Water's novel, but I can imagine that it has done real justice. Remembering how foolish it is - most men watched for it - it turned out to be the main rhetoric and sales point when it was originally advertised. The fact is that in the 1800s they boast about the lesbian side of society - at a time when most people thought it was old men and bounty boys - it was good - lesbianism took place mainly behind closed and often decent doors. You can also look at Tipping The Velvet as a "love story" - in fact it is - as well as "self-discovery" that many gays / bi and straight people go through and comment and repeat all over time. /> <br /> If you haven't seen it before - either on TV or on DVD - you'll get it - you'll be in treatment - and even making and shooting is perfect. Just try to hide your blushing parts - as I said - "bawdy" is the order of the day - and watch out for "phallus" or two! <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
