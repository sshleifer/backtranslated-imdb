There are a few movies that have a massive number of non-stop ninja actions as Ninja III: Dominion. It is a story about love, redemption and revenge, but it is above all a story about people being thrown away and killed without reason. If you were looking for a movie where the ninja goes absolutely nuts and takes all kinds of people to their graves just because it is a ninja and can do it, it's a movie for you. I can't think of any movies to compare it, because no movie is amazing. Wait, have you ever seen the two-headed thing? There is a part in where the titular thing is riding a motorcycle and about a million cops chasing them / them around them, but they still crashing and what not because you can't grab a thing with two heads !!! Well, it's like a Ninja III. I highly recommend this movie especially if you like the following things: Ninjas, Swords, Lucinda Dickie from Breakin 'and Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo, video games about being a bouncer in a bar, ambiguous and underdeveloped love stories or "good" ninjas.
