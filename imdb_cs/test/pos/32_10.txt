LACKAWANNA BLUES is a nice scenic game by Ruben Santiago-Hudson and an even finer movie that the author has edited his own life story for the screen. This brilliant movie lights up a rich-color screen, soft music, brilliant cuts, an excellent direction from George C. Wolfe, and a cast so stunning that it is mandatory to view! Yes, it's just so good. The story is based on the author's life as a 'Junior' child (Marcus Carl Franklin) exalted in the inimitable home of the compassionately empathetic Rachel "Nanny" Crosby (With Epatha Merkerson), a lady who devoted her life to helping the disenfranchised team that she transported them from the south, from psychiatric hospitals and from streets to Lackawanna, New York. The boy recalls all the lessons he learned about the life of the house's inhabitants - strange characters with painful past - and the disintegration of his racially mixed biological family saved by Nanny. Countless figures of the home are too numerous to be outlined, but are shown by some of the best actors in the field: Terrence Howard, Rosie Perez, Mos Def, beautiful Carmen Ejogo, Louis Gossett Jr., Jeffrey Wright, Ernie Hudson, Charlayne Woodward, Jimmy Smits, Patricia Wettig, Macy Gray, Liev Schreiber, Kathleen Chalfant, Lou Myers, Hill Harper - The list goes on and continues. In the course of the film, we show the cruelty of racism, the history of desegregation, the dynamics of drug abuse and violence, the infectious joy of African American musical contributions to our musical culture, and the courage of a gentle woman who has struggled with all the world's difficulties it could keep the dignity of those with whom it came into contact. Epatha Merkerson is completely submerged in this role, the role the world makes as a beacon of reason in the world of chaos. She offers one of the most overwhelming performances of recent years, and had this film released in theaters instead of HBO, she would without doubt add an Oscar to place alongside her Golden Globe award. The entire cast is exceptional and Wolfe handles acting and story as a master: as riffs in a jazz work, he puts small moments of conversation with each character and Junior with lightning scenes from a story with a matrix Dance festivals in local clubs that overcome peak with incredible blues, jazz, dance and joy. The production crew mounted this little miracle of image with extreme care and never for a moment noticed the attention of the momentum of the story. Very recommended, almost mandatory viewing!
