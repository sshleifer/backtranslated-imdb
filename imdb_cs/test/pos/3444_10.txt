When I saw this film, or rather a set of films, my conception of human interaction and the extent of potential experience has changed irreversibly in my teens. This monumental exploration of individuals and their historical environment reveals how every human existence is full and intense. People are portrayed as they are for themselves: their experiences of the smallest to greatest inner and outer phenomenon are described in detail with the greatest art and perception. Edgar Reitz shows a wonderful recognition of human motivations and desires. When these phenomena are opposed to the immense time allowed by the length of the work, one cannot help but understand the power and liveliness of happiness, defeat. , lust, love, sadness, melancholy, that everyone feels. When I saw these films, I felt my future experience of how my life would inevitably twist and oscillate as a result of both intended and random events. I gained a sense of longevity and what it meant to think about past lives, memories and contexts. A masterpiece and revelation. I just want the BBC to show it again. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows where I can get a copy, they could contact me
