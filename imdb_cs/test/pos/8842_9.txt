"The Thing" is John Carpenter's best movie. By combining his talent for building tensions and shocks with dignified production values, he created a perfectly crafted sci fi / horror film. By filming under truly difficult conditions, it creates a very believable isolated research base that sets the tension before something happened. The cast of the ensemble works well with Kurt Russell, who demonstrates the charismatic leader, even under the beard. Slowly building tension with times of cruel horror (thanks to the effects of Rob Bottin's meister - currently director Freddy vs. Jason) The carpenter creates a film that was rarely closed. Since this came out in the same year as ET, it couldn't be any more different! It's worth watching watches. 9 of 10. <br /> <br /> p.s. The DVD is excellent. Lots of add-ons and best DVD commentary (with Carpenter & Russell). Plus is remixed in Dolby Digital for even more frightening sound effects.
