The working title was: "Don't Spank Baby". Wayne Crawford has become a successful producer, such as Valley Girl, Night of the Comet, and others, though he wasn't too amazing in this little jewel. Abe little known that Abe Zwick should get a lot of work out of this movie, but not. Filmed at Moberly Studios in Hollywood, Florida, at the same time, Tarzan films were filmed. This film is definitely for those who appreciate the abstract. The film was originally filmed with some nudity and much more graphic scenes. For reasons known only to Tom Casey, the bloody slasher scenes were tagged with LSD, and nudity was removed. Although this version is worthy of looking at those who are so inclined, in my opinion the original version would pack a punch needed to make this film full of Slasher 70's Cultural Classics.
