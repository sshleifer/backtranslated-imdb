If I had to decide which of Ernest's best films didn't happen, it wouldn't happen all the time, it wouldn't matter. <br /> <br /> All of Ernest's movies are fun, but the best of them are the ones that Jim Varney does a variety of characters. In addition, I know that I enjoy the comedy styles Bill Byrge and Gailard Sartain as the Chuck and Bobby Tulip brothers. "Ernest Goes to Jail" contains all these elements, as well as a funny script and supportive cast that includes several beloved actors. That's why I chose "Ernest goes to jail" as the king of all Ernest movies. Don't agree with me if you have to, but you know deeply that I'm right.
