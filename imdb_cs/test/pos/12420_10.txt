Yesterday I went to see Monster Man. It was a long wait and after a lot of expectations and building, I am glad I came and fulfilled my expectations at each level. It is true that you cannot really wait too much to hear the plot, but after reading some reviews I was thrilled. What fan wouldn't want to see a clipping of a tousled inbred hick who cuts with the people who make him a monster truck? I went to expect a cross between Road Trip and The Hills Have Eyes and got a lot more. That was a horror comedy that actually worked. The filmmakers got it when you found yourself shaking and laughing at the same time. Kudos to Michael Davis for going out with Gore and pushing the envelope with humor. Let me give you a few reasons why I love this film so much: First, it's a story. It was made to death in so many other films. College guy gets the wind that his childhood crush is getting married. She is a 25-year-old virgin, hops in her Vista Cruiser and decides to go on a trip to confess her love, hoping she will head down the hills and all good. Hidden in the back seat of his estate, he is a good friend of Harley. Harley is a loud, ex-boyfriend who laughs and talks like Jack Black in High Fidelity. You can't help but like that boy, but if he were your friend in real life, would you have to keep a smart bat (laugh all you want, but have you ever been hit by one)? in chess. So he's a little uncomfortable, at least, but you can say he's a loyal friend, deep down ... By the way, they're on their way and when they stop at the bar, they desecrate the locals. . Now they are being chased by a leather clone in a monster truck. And it is done. Yeah, they'll pick up a beautiful hitchhiker along the way, but I'm too lazy and hungry to get into it right now ... so watch the damn movie. The second thing I love is humor. This one had some of the worst laughs from all the Cabin Fever movies. How is it wrong? Well, I will not go to the whole cat scene and as for the matter of "corps burrito", I leave it on your virgin eyes. The bar full of amputees was somewhat disturbing, and the guy who looked like John Turturro also worried me. Harley, though she is a totally unpleasant type of brother, can really tear off one liner. By the way, love clogs. I need a new pair .. <br /> <br /> GORE. This one is pouring her on hard. While the first hour is like a demented road comedy, the last third is about blood and guts. If the film did not maintain such a bright tone, it would be a little distracting, but seeing how it all played for laughter, it is not possible that it would bother you. If you're still in your chair when it comes, you'll probably see humor in it too, but seriously, there were buckets and buckets of red stuff. There was a great conspiracy that I didn't see coming and when credits rolled, I was completely satisfied. I got exactly what I came for and I'm really glad I bought it. Like Cabin Fever, it will be a lot of repetitions. <br /> <br /> The film's appearance was excellent. It was a purposefully inexpensive look that began to scream the whole thing in the late 1980s and loved exaggerated colors. Obviously, the Monster Man was conducted with a relatively low budget, but like Cabin Fever (I'm sorry to compare these two) it actually works in favor of the film. Cabin Fever was an Ode for the 70s greats, that was the answer of the 1980s. So take what's worth. No CGI here. That's what we all needed. I'm not entirely sure why it wasn't a theatrical release because that's all Jeepers Creepers had. Thank God for Lions Gate.
