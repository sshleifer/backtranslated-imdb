In one of Charlie Chaplin's best short films, Little Fellow placed the trenches of World War I, where he brought his unbearable courtesy and endless patience to the drunkenness of life in the trenches where soldiers lived for months before they finally set off. over the top overtake the enemy, and usually to their deaths. Someone in Chaplin's skill as a comedian must do something as rough as a trench warfare in such a brilliant comedy, but the irony he uses in the film makes the most unpleasant conditions fun. All the best of Chaplin's movies, shorts and others, this one is full of brilliant and unforgettable scenes such as the scene where the pieces of chalk are killed on the board in the trench when one gets when he gets his helmet fired , the scene where he and his fellow citizens are sleeping underwater, opening a beer bottle and lighting a cigarette, and of course overtaking the enemy. All these scenes are show-stoppers, reminiscent of Chaplin's most beautiful scenes. This one should not be missed!
