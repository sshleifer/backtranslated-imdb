Being a pretty fan of Charlie Chaplin following a good vibe after seeing the first 'gold rush' and then 'city lights', I was eager to see the 'great dictator' as I was told it was, probably his best film. I was also impressed by the fact that it was a talkie; My first, Chaplin-wise. The beginning is a typical Chaplin and glaring proof that when it comes to sound, chaplains can decrease while not just relying on music to set the mood and do speaking; it is funny, well-timed, and slapsticky elements, such as falling from an anti-aircraft weapon, are well connected with jokes. It was good to draw the viewer with this "classic Chaplin opening" and at the same time to start the storytelling of the characters who recognize each other. What was also well done was the way Hitler was fake. Every scene with Hitler or 'Hynkel' in this movie was funny and even now; It makes you wonder how exactly you know who is spoofing and creates an internal response of some kind. The way the English language is mixed with German German during the dialogue scenes is further proof of how Chaplin was able to adapt to the era of talkie. My favorite joke was a five-minute speech that gave Hynkel only English translators to translate it into a few words; to think that you have returned to Hitler's shots, maybe at some point in your life you have seen that you have manifested your speech and actually laughed at him. Historically, the film also got a few things. Hynkel is seen to get his photograph with children; something that Hitler did for recognition when manipulating the media, but here Hynkel is seen yawning and acting bored; stabbing Hitler's lured technique of victory over the German public through sympathy (Oh, hugs and kisses kids. Must be OK!). The film also has a fantastic assumption that a Jewish civilian went to the ghetto between all the ways that take place, but the catch that is not forgotten. Films like "Pianist" and "Come and See" are two good examples of Nazi cruelty to the "worse" people that we can all look back at today and shake their heads, while at the end of the 1930s, when it was filmed, cruelty and exploit it, making it even more astounding. Chaplin was able to swap weapons and batons for tomatoes and pans and still pulls him down. But what I didn't like about the movie was the fact that after opening he settled into a real story. . This slowed the film up and it is very noticeable when the foot was removed from the gas. The film began to run into stories and stories. It was a barber and a female neighbor in love and anticipation of the destruction of Hynkel's palace, while none was actually developed. "Giving the woman a shave," and "the one who has the coin in the pudding, the gags appearing in them pointed to these conspiracies, but in the end they only materialized in excuses that were ripped out, unreal gags, which was disappointing. During the final level, the great dictator gets the thrill of introducing an Italian dictator who adds a little needed life and an apology for comedy to the movie. It works the way we see it arguing, and more clumsy tactics are used when Hynkel tries to "overwhelm" his Italian counterpart through a series of dirty tricks (even though they are witty confused). Despite several weaknesses in the middle segment and the fact that at the end I felt that the message was a little forced in the throat, the Great Dictator is holding on to watching today, but that's just because he was making money with gambling that no one else really did they didn't know they were there.
