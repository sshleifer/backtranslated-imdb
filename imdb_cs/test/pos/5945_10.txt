It's a deeply stupid humor ... but I loved it. Jean Dujardin is a great actor in this movie. Bérénice Béjo is cute. It makes fun of all the secret agents like James Bond: refreshing !!! It's probably the most precious film I've ever seen. I've seen it three times before and I still want to see it again. Buy a DVD as soon as possible. You will not regret. It's the kind of movie you don't have to have a great script because it's a parody. The only flaw is that the OSS 117 is too short. It's a gem. It's not really common to see a French film gain success in the US, but I think this one has everything to succeed. Believe me!!!
