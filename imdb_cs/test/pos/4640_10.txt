After all these years, it's still funny. Midnight Madness is good fun for all ages. He presents Michael J Fox as a typical 15-year-old problem maker. Melio and Blaylak are by far the funniest characters in it and Leon is perfectly cast as a weird master of the game. The noble romance between Adam and the girl could not be any cheese. Fagabeefe !!!!
