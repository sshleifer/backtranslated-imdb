In "Hoot", a new boy comes to Florida from Montana. First, he faces the usual problems of joining a local tyrant. However, he soon learns of a bigger problem: a chain of franchise restaurants is trying to build a place in the city where many owl owls live. This film has the appearance of a family movie, but it is more radical than it seems because it shows sympathetically how Roy and a few friends are not ashamed of legislation (including private property vandalism and briefly kidnap restaurant chain managers) in the name of ecology nothing less). Now one can or cannot agree on these actions, but at least the film has the courage to break away from its beliefs. Good, solid movie, all together.
