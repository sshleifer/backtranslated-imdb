The problem with other casts in the Dorle Gray rorle is that they either looked too old for the game (Hurd Hatfield, Helmut Berger, Josh Duhamel, David Gallagher, Ben Barnes) or were unable to pull out an English aristocratic stilt-free way. Dorian is eternal 19-year-old (or so), all dairy skins and honey locks, as described by Wilde, so the task is to find an actor who has maturity and range for that part (ie, who can portray naivety, ruthlessness and manipulativity), but at the same time he looks like someone in his late age. And Peter Firth will rip him out of this great British TV adaptation. Gielgud as Henry Wotton, though substantially older than what Wilde meant, the wonders of his scenes - Wilde's aphorisms never sounded so natural and unforced. Especially George Sanders in the 1945 version was very weak compared to him (and his costume didn't fit). Finally Jeremy Bratt plays Basil as the most male and at the same time gay. trio, again apt interpretation. The film generally contains enough gay overtones without Dorian turning to a homosexual - it's all for all people, and there is no cure or sexual perversion that he tried in 18 years covered with the story, but it makes him more narcissist than homosexual . Looks like he's got the same kind of confusion on both sexes as he should according to the novel. Of course, the budget for this production wasn't too big, so it all feels a bit wild. Especially Dorian's encounter with brother Sybila suffers from an obvious studio look. Also, the last shot of Dorian (the puppet I suppose) in his white make-up as a toad is more cheerful than convincing and Basil's death scene is unwittingly funny. (Also, if I remember, Basil should be killed sitting at the table.) <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very nice adaptation. I'm sure it would be nice. The only thing missing is the sensual side. Not so much of a sex scene, but Wilde's decadent world of fragrant flowers, luxury fabrics and precious gems is not really explored, that is, aesthetics are completely missing. But just like "I, Claudius," the excellent acting ability makes it easy to forget these shortcomings in production values.
