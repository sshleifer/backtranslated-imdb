Don't Torture Duckling is an absolutely stunning giallo distraction for Lucio Fulci. Unlike other subgenre heavyweights such as Mario Bava and Dario Argento, Fulci takes a decidedly bold, grounded and socially receptive approach to telling giallo in this film. There is nothing glamorous about child murders and border pedophilia (gutsy subplot for 1972), and Fulci wisely shoots with a calm and unfriendly eye, avoiding lightning, melodrama, and directing history. Proceedings are interrupted by bloody and immediately thinking pieces that are still reinforced by Fulci's sharp sense of realism? the deeply disturbing scene of "killing witches", especially with brutal brutality, feels like a snuff film. The composer Riz Ortolani reserves these scenes from the massacre with wild-striking strings. The film ends with a contemporary lyrical and violent ending in which theology, morality, fanaticism and superstition clash. It is a deeply effective ending that has the ability to leave the viewer in a confused and disarmed torpedo. Fulci couldn't choose a better place for this movie. I do not want torture duckling was photographed around the ancient city of Matera, Italy. As Matera is modernized to this day (emphasized by the shift from agricultural to industrial), it has a reputation as a UNESCO-sponsored container for mysterious Paleolithic spirits. The anxieties of the real life of Materani are reflected in the film characters who wear their Christianity on their sleeves and terribly confront any exotic tradition (especially witchcraft) that goes beyond the norm. Interestingly, Matera was also used as a booth for Jerusalem in the Passion of Christ by Mel Gibson. If anything, it adds Fulci's message even more. Catholic guilt and grisly slayings are such resonant combinations.
