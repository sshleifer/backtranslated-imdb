Oh yes! Hollywood remembers how to use a good old pattern, and when lightning strikes, it's a pretty wonderful feeling. Rarely does Hollywood create a masterpiece, because lately it seems more interested in rushing and getting the most rewards in a hurry or too many cooks in the mix. Usually good scenarios are the result of a talented writer who has full control over his property, understands his material, and is a good writer. Then there is a little important part, often neglected by marketing genius, who often lack creativity and vision: a good actor. A good actor can make a difference between an average, half-cooked experiment and a fully realized film that may not be an important and relevant film, but that contributes to its genre and can eventually become a classic of its kind. We get very few romantic comedies and we are hungry for them. Buried in sexy humor "Sex in the City" is a romantic but stormy relationship between Big and Carrie, and people flocked to "Mamma Mia" because it had some romance, skillfully played by Streep and Brossnam. It could be a stupid musical, but it touched us because it was played with intensity and conviction. "Nights" offers us more, with the amazing talent of a woman who does a wonderful job in romantic movies, Diane Lane. From the moment we, as a child actress, appreciated how her talent combined with her grateful soul allowed us to see the heart of the story's protagonists. A few years back, she teamed up with Mr. Gere, which provided us with tortured, romantic and sexy performance as a wife who is not very sure about the consequences of her actions in "unfaithful" work that should be brought to her by at least one Academic Award. She's back, doing a more impressive job in this romantic gem as a woman who has given up her romantic prospect, and suddenly realizes there might be another chance around the corner. Mrs. Lane makes this movie a pulsating intelligence and passion. Her facial expressions convey volumes about the different emotions her character goes through. We can read frustrations, desires, despair, anger, hope, loss and range that is beyond reach for many tradable types that Hollywood constantly pushes down the neck. Here is a mature performer who has the gift of designing real emotions and allowing us to connect with material in such a way that we move when we become part of the experience. Mrs Lane is so triumphantly watching him go through the transformations from the first movie scenes to the very end. Her discoveries become ours because we celebrate with her the power of hope and love. She is able to bring back the insurmountable joy of a person in love, just as a teenager does, yet it does not allow you to think of her character so stupidly or irresponsibly. Her eyes are distinctive jewels that can move cynically in the audience. It's one of the stars that can only do wonders. In it, the classic feeling of the big movies back yesterday. Her work recalls the passionate and intelligent work of Hepburn, Davis, Garson, the women who played everyday types and made them unforgettable because they created complete characters. <br /> <br /> We admire the beautiful actresses who are restoring real life legends and are rewarded for it. Half of their work is done by the mystics of the characters they publish; but just as anyone might think of you, it's a role like Lane in this movie, which is more impressive because it is created from scratch, has a personal imprint, and is capable of reaching heights without the prior support of theatrical material such as the game, and the background of the famous legend whose life is paid on the silver screen. Lane's character is one woman whose experience can be any of us. It represents our dreams and emotions with great quality, class and the right amount of sentiment. It is quite a remarkable achievement and we should be grateful to be able to find such remarkable performance today. There are a few adjectives I could use to pay tribute to her work, but I can only say that in my humble opinion, every single film of her work in this film testifies to one of the greatest shows which a live performer has ever put on celluloid. Thank you, Mrs. Lane.
