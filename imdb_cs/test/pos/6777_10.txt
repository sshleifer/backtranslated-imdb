Many Americans are lazy, and this is reflected in our DVD tracking. Many of us do not like doing the time to read an hour and a half (or more) of headlines, so we decide not to see many foreign films. One movie that stands completely for your time, no matter how mundane the task you think reading subtitles is, however, is "Green Butchers". It's by far the best foreign movie I've ever seen and the highlights of many American movies I've seen lately. It is a complicated situation that is called in a remarkably simple and humorous dialogue. The depth of the character derived from this movie is AMAZING. The way Svend and Eigel (sorry if spelled wrong) feed on each other's contrasting personalities, is downright magnificent! The actors were well occupied, and I hope they're contemplating ... needs little of Bjorne and what's her face ... just make me Svend and Eigel on some way with supportive characters and more wonderful dialogue! For the author of this subtle scenario, I say: Write more! The story itself is somewhat twisted, but you'll find yourself prey for the evil guy anyway ... without remorse. Please check this movie out!
