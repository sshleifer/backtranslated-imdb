cool flick. nice to watch. I hope to see more from Fred Carpenter soon. I really like the location setting with all the new york links. it was interesting how it finally unfolds. The stress factor was effective and acting, though simple, was also effective in displaying characters. A bunch of neat little tricks is put into this movie that makes everything better. I think the actress who participated in her did a great job in her role. casting and directing in this movie seem to be seamlessly linked and the quality of the shooting is very impressive. the film is not without its soft moments, which gives it a pleasant balance.
