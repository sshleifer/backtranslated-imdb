Imagine this. Someone will make a film about a massacre in Colombia or Virginia just the movie that was directed by the guy who was doing home alone (I know it's not just me) and stars Sean Astin from Goonies !! The image of the terrorists is overwhelmed by buckets of water on top of half-open doors and balls, and that's why you need to see the movie. unfortunately it doesn't go all the way by actually putting the skateboard on the floor for the evil Mexicans to set off, but halfway there you have to put over 7 but not 9 because it wasn't crazy enough. Too bad it seemed to be a comical cheesiness, well worth the cult status
