But we certainly saw it and I and many other people actually expected worse. He also had some good parts that I hadn't expected to do in other areas. <br /> <br /> At first, acting was above average. I like Phillip Seymour Hoffman in this movie and I liked Tom Hanks. Hoffman was glue to this film. If it weren't for him, this movie would crumble and hit the rock bottom. His performance was by no means overwhelming, but absolutely necessary. He gave good humorous, cynical performance in what most other actors could easily create his character in clich√©. Tom Hanks really did a nice job and did not disappoint, but he did not impress. What I couldn't stand was that Julia Roberts was involved in this film. She was as big as I ever saw. She is a bad actress for one, at least for me, she was young for her character and she was fake for the character she was playing. <br /> <br /> The director was average for me. I'm not really a big fan of recent movies Mike Nichols and I'm not completely overwhelmed by this. It was made with such a Hollywood, cartoon hat that I couldn't stand. The worst part was that he was trying to make it a really meaningful movie at the end. I love meaningful movies, but not when the film at the end tries to hurry to the scene or two, and show something that tries to justify the rest of the waste in the whole movie. This is something that Mike Nichols seemed to have done a lot in his recent record. One impressive part of this movie was writing. The dialogue was connected very well and was able to launch the story. Writing was what was able to really make this film above average. In so many scenes, I found myself partly laughing at writing. Well, that's something we've seen the least. Lots of scenery was good in the movie if you got what I mean, but not much other than that. I liked that this movie didn't celebrate everything America did. Obviously, throughout the war in Afghanistan, the United States has provided weapons to the people now against us. This cinematic kind of show is too much to blame. This shows that what may seem good in the short term can turn into something terribly bad in the future. This movie had a good original message, but it just didn't deliver it correctly. But overall it was fun.
