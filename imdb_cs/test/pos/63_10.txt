It's a really great movie (after being able to ignore Blake Edwards Pink Panther links that seem obsessed and are extremely rude). Julie is, as usual, beautiful - singing and great performing. I remember seeing it at the Odeon cinema in Haymarket, London, when it was released. However, Julie is a non-look at the UK STAR premiere! he was most unhappy and (apparently!) because of shooting aerial shots for Darling Lili over Ireland. It was a reasonable excuse if she appeared in any of these aerial shots, but she didn't. Two box flops in a row have ruined her film career for several years. But Darling Lili, like STAR!, Deserves much greater public recognition.
