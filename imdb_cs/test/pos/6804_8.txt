During my 13-year schooling, I went through a high school from a kindergarten, just one day when my class went on an excursion. When I went to school, you went to school from 8:30 to 3:30 and the excursions were not accepted. But for some reason I couldn't remember this advanced age, we went to see the movie - National Velvet. I don't remember the movie, so on the eve of my 57th year I decided to visit it again. It's a movie about a time that no longer exists. The time when people believed others and did not block their houses. Time when people got the advantage of doubt. It was a time when the family was the most important thing. This movie does it all and much more. It shows love and trust and care and kindness of people. It wouldn't be bad if every family would watch this film once in a while and discuss its report. It was a pleasure to see young Elizabeth Taylor, Mickey Rooney at his best, Academy Award-winning performance Anne Revere, Angela Lansbury before the murder, she wrote, and Donald Crisp, who played for nearly sixty years. What movie!
