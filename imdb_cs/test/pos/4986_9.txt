One type of western that I like very much is when the apparently weak, who is reluctant to fight and respond to the challenge of the strong, ultimately decides that there is no other way. It's a great moment in this movie when John Parrish (Glenn Ford) goes to the saloon and decides to confront Wade Matlock. It is a type of scene that applauds the viewer. In my opinion, Violent Men is a great western, I would rank him among the best. It uses a wide-screen, beautiful mountain scenery. Women have a crucial role to play. Caroline (May Winn) is employed in Parrish, but she feels she only uses it as a way to get out there and move east. He wants to sell a ranch no matter what the price. Martha (Barbara Stanwick) is tired of helping her crippled Lee Lee (Edward G. Robinson) but will do anything to always get a bigger ranch and more power. Meanwhile, she betrayed her husband with her brother (Brian Keith). Her daughter Judith (Diane Foster) sees everything happening, but she feels helpless because she doesn't want to hurt her father. Parrish connects all the small farmers and uses a strategy he learned in the army to go against the Anchor ranch. As if warning Lee: "Don't make me fight because you won't like my way of fighting".
