It was in September 2003, when I heard that the BBC was about to resurrect the WHO DOCTOR and make it "Bigger and Better", but I heard these rumors in the press earlier and thought it was all - rumors. But then it was mentioned that Russell T Davies was going to produce and write a show and then one Saturday afternoon in the March 2004 Channel 4 news interview with cast cast in the title role - Christopher Eccleston. Yes, Christopher Eccleston is an actor I have always been impressed by watching his film debut in LET HIM HAVE IT, and it had to be true if he was talking on TV. As the months passed and more information was released, Billie Piper was cast, the Daleks would return and The Mill, a Hollywood company that made FX for GLADIATOR, was contacted for special show effects. A few weeks before the first galore broadcasting trailers announced the return of a new series, massive billboards in London informed the public about the show's return, tabloid newspapers carried massive photographic aids to foreigners, and Christopher Eccleston appeared on programs as diverse as BLUE PETER, MASTERMIND DOCTOR WHO Night Edition), THIS MORNING and Friday NIGHT WITH JOHNATHAN ROSS. In fact, this new series of DOCTOR WHO, which had to be the most publicized program in British television history, should have been more bloody. Was it so bloody? Undoubtedly it was a great success with almost every episode making the top ten shows in the TV charts. To give you a clue about the success of your review, one episode (The Ark In Space episode two - February 1975) of the old series came into the top five television charts. The opening series episode made number three with two more episodes of either beat or even previous record and this is at a time where there is far more competition in terms of television stations and selection. Let's laugh and cheer for the fact that DOCTOR WHO filled HIT ME BABY ONE more time, CELEBRITY WRESTLING and painted ANT and DEC'S Saturday NIGHT TAKEAWAY. Of course much of the success is the breathtaking visuals and cast of the famous prestigious actor in the role. Most of what you see on the screen corresponds to what you see in the Spielberg / Hollywood movie. There is a Dalek invasive force counting tens of thousands, exotic aliens, 19th century Cardiff that looks like a 19th century Cardiff and a night shoot that is actually a nighttime shoot and did not stick a dark filter on the screen. I promise you will learn more from directors who have worked on this series, Joe Ahearne will be in Hollywood for one day and there are some shortcomings in the new WHO DOCTOR series and all should be at the door Russella T Davies. It may be questionable whether soap opera and post modernist elements are successful or not (in my opinion they are not), but what is not in dispute is that the weakest scripts are written by RTD. As I mentioned in my CASANOVA review, he cheats the audience and does the same thing here: when faced with armed soldiers heading his guns, doctoral mosses "delta attack plan" that makes no sense to anyone in the audience but allows him to escaping from a tight spot, naked Captain Jack suddenly pulls out the laser he is hiding, and RTD scripts are full of these types of deus ex machina frauds. In fact the final episode is corrupted by the very ridiculous concept of what "bad wolf" is which seems to have an RTD out of a tight spot more than a doctor. And in the end I'm trying to remember if any of them were actually into the Doctor? More often than supporting character or Doctor's companion who saves the day. The show is called WOC DOCTOR, which is not interested in TYLER, so can we see the cover character save the day, just like it did in the classic series? One final point about the Doctor's display is the way it is written as a funny loon. Eccleston is best known for her serious and grim roles and is absolutely breathtaking on the scenes as she shows grief, like a tear flowing down her face at the end of the world, but more often than not, she is written as "Tom Baker on Speed" character. Obviously, Eccleston didn't do a lot of comedy in his career - he's not very good at it <br /> <br /> I'm starting to sound like I hate this show? I'm sorry I didn't want to, but it's just that some expectations have been met or overcome by some others not and are almost all on Russell T Davies, which fortunately contributes less in the way of scripts in the next series of DOKTOR WHO. Let's look at other traditional stories of a human base that is threatened by monsters, as we saw in the 1960s and 1970s, imagine a story like The Sea Devils with Joe Ahearne's massive budget! Oh and one last request - Can we see these "NEXT TIME" discarded trailers? They reveal all the best episode pieces next week
