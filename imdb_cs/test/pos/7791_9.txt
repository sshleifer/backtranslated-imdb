The best part about this movie is that you can view it again and again. I watched this movie at least 10 times in the last 12 years and still it makes me laugh like I was looking at it for the first time. I really like good comics like Orgazmo, Cheech n chong, Monty Python series and many others, but this in Hindi is one of my favorite movies. Some of them recently in Hindi are Golmaal, Munnabhai series and Herapheri series. So all I can say is Hindu comedy is finally evolving. But Andaaz Apna Apna is quite different from the movies I said above. His what I call Hindu comedy and very little of what appeared around 1994 in Hindu film. Theers to Rajkumar Santoshi for a great movie.
