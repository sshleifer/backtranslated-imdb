Like some people here, I love / loved Stingers! It was much later in Norway. That also means we're in the 176th episode. (yes, that's true) I have to say I really love Stingers! That can cry, laugh, smile, and so on. I think I'm gonna die the day we get to Episode 192. Stingers could be on the show (except for Gray's anatomy) that I'm really watching! The actors are amazing! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personally, I think it is one of the best approaches we have! I know he's not like SUPER-known, but she's a really great actress! Stingers makes me be a cop! I love it! <br /> <br /> Do you know if you can buy episodes?
