MPAA Rating PG-13 <br /> <br /> My Rating: 10+ <br /> <br /> My * 9.5 / 10 Rating <br /> <br /> William H. Macy Brings Stunning Performance as the role of Mr. Neuman. You feel compassionate and afraid at the same time. The story begins as a comedy and slowly, but it almost becomes horror with the twists and turns Macy tries to master. I couldn't get away from the movie even when it was over, and I couldn't believe it when it was over. MUST SEE. <br /> <br /> THIS PARAGRAPH COULD BE CAUSED BY A SPOILER SOME <br /> <br /> After looking at the movie, look at this story: The Neuman are the United States as a whole, and Meat Loaf Aday plays is people in the United States who are antisemetic. This was a very nice movie and would be recommended to anyone I saw on the street.
