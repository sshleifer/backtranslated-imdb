Since I am a huge monkey island fan, I started out of the terrible one because Ron Gilbert didn't do it. The boy was surprised! Although it is not as good as the first two, it has a comedy I wanted. I was a little nervous about the new graphics, the new SCUMM engine and just because it was on CD. But it all came together and it was interesting to finally hear the voices of your favorite characters. I was especially pleased that SWORD BOJ returned. And the whole story of finding a large uncovered circle was simply incredible. Continue and try this adventure in two CDs. And now we can rejoice because Monkey Island 4: Escape from Monkey Island is coming out soon! This Fall!
