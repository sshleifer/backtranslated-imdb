at least for me. and somewhat unexpected - as an object. a movie that challenges you to your beliefs, your life, your approach to everything. that helps you see the world, we live through the lens - or many lenses ... a moving, surprising and scary movie. <br /> <br /> and benefits from one of Kevin Spacey's best performances ever. Jeff Bridges posted very well. there is no false note in this tango. it's a perfect dance. perfect 'to the end. <br /> <br /> what reveals the end? well ... all you want to ... <br /> <br /> a movie that he will want to see again. maybe not right now. maybe after a few days. months. flight. But it's something to go - or go back.
