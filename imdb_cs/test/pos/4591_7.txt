This movie is a lot wrong. I will not lie. I will say that most of the problems feel like they came from a budget that was cut out from under it, and some bad adjustments to the hack work. <br /> <br /> It's not office space. Don't go in anticipation of the Office Space comedy level. It's very funny. It's a mess, but very funny. Funny movie mess. By making Caddyshack fun. Clutter of unrelated entertainment scenes filled with some very annoying scenes. It works as a whole, and it certainly deserves a broad release. This is the best comment on Wal Mart / Starbucks / MTV Nation that you could hope for. The fact that the film explores the idea that stupid people behave at an alarming rate, while smart people aren't, is great in my book. It is not very politically correct, but at least some debate is worth it.
