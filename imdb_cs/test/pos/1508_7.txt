One who says Lucio Fulci is not one of the most important names in the history of splashing is probably mad. The Italian director is a legend among hardcore-horror fans and his work transcends the genre's barriers (which may forget his genres). Western, crime or fantasy flicks. This is probably his bloodiest movie, and unfortunately one last. Horror director (Fulci as himself) begins a hallucination of terrible murders. He goes to a psychiatrist who convinces him he's a criminal. At this time, the doctor begins a long string of serial crimes. With such a plot, the film should be filled with something. And there are rotting corpses, crashed or melted heads, stings, decapitation, sawing, and many more. Sometimes the film is bored with excessive violence, which will certainly please drug users.
