I'm not a golf fan in any way. On May 26 at 10:30 pm the film began with a scene in the late 1800s. I love old movies, but not golf however, inside the first scene a young boy (Harry Vardon) is awakened by the voices of men. He goes out to ask what they're doing, and he's told they're about to build golf. So, then I turned off the TV, but something made me and it was again. The film is excellent. Now we'll see the young boy; a professional golf player who is chased by childhood visions. Then we meet the true focus of Francis and the decision he makes for golf. You meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the classroom that is so obvious during this period. Then there is little Eddie Lowery, his cadre with encouraging words and little pressures that are the instrument of Francis. I don't want to give out too much. I was up to 2 A.M. This is great, look at the movie.
