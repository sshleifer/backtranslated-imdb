At the beginning of this film, which I observed at IFC in the morning, I was filled with a sense of claustrophobia and total discomfort. The feeling that you were trapped without escape was so strong that I didn't know if I wanted to continue watching ... though I didn't think I had a choice, so the situation was. But gradually, this feeling of discomfort waned (though it never disappeared completely), and I felt like I was in trouble with Tessa and Bobby, and I really hope in the hope that they can come back to themselves . Really just a moving, strong story fitting into a small package. I had no idea that Sarah Polley had anything to do with it until she looked at her little things, so I love it even more. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend it. ... If you ever get caught on the Independent Movie Channel, or enough to find some other way to see it.
