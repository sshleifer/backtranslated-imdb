This film, soon William Wellman, has an important message, especially today. It represents the idea that sometimes there are things that are more important than your personal safety or well-being. The film, which has Walter Huston as the lead, is stolen by "Chic" Sales as Grampa. It is the most comprehensive character in the film and the joy to watch. You know some familiar faces if you watch many movies from the 1920s and 1930s. Wel worh your time to watch if you get the opportunity. Recommended.
