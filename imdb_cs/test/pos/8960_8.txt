Yes, this movie has many gay characters. He also has direct characters, characters who are unsure of their sexuality, people who are looking for some truth about their existence. It's not a film about sexual orientation. It is about the loneliness and difficulty that people often encounter in connection with each other. Filmically, Denys Arcand cleverly balances the different dimensions of relationships and contrasting, constantly changing relationships. The serial killer element is a little less successful (feels more like a way to wrap different points of the plot and, unlike the rest of the movie, is thematically heavy). Thomas Gibson focuses on film production; it is a quiet performance, but behind a nice, arrogant exterior it slowly reveals a frightened soul who is afraid to show or receive love from the people around them. The support cast is strong, especially Mia Kirshner as a friend of Gibson, a home-for-rental with precognitive forces. Her role is more metaphor than literal conceit - strangely innocent and at the same time corrupt, representing the light and darkness of the characters' sexual consciousness. The film includes and often surprises in the evolution of its character. The result is somewhat similar to Robert Altman, who controls David Mamet's screenplay - dialogue does not diminish from some observing observations aside from a few moments in the beginning. Often in our search for love and conventional "relationship" we ignore the love that already exists around us - in our friends, family, those who are able to see us as we are. Arcand and writer, Brad Fraser, do some attentive observations of the different ways people try to escape, and deny their loneliness, and how this denial goes back to fear us in so many unexpected ways. This film is an experience. For bigots who cannot get through the sexual orientation of some characters, there may be no greater, transcendental message of hope and redemption. Loneliness is a universal experience. A film like this, which dares to explore the darker side of our lives with a clever and receptive eye, deserves applause and open access.
