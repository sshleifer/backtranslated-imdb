Every review I have read seems to have missed a crucial point. Shakespeare wrote for accent and pronunciation as well as for Northern in other games. The Scottish accent changes the emphasis and rhythm of the language and deeply influences what is said and the way it is used. Listen again and notice the difference. The game is well done and the rhythm of the words is much better than the people who use the accepted, polite, well-laid out English. I remind me how a teacher at a school in Leicester, unknowingly, asked me to read a piece of Walter Scott written in the Boundary tone at age 14. I come from the Border and when I read it how it should be read, it did it all.
