At first glance, a movie like Northfork, a city to be flooded in 1955, and a group of 6 characters who are sent to evacuate the remaining burghers, can be just a movie. When we soon meet the remaining priest who cares for a sick child, a greedy landowner, we could be prepared for a simple story that we could easily spend. However, when this film is first introduced, you will notice amazing widescreen cinematography, and the church hall scene lacks a wall that opens to pastures and scenic mountain views with cattle feasts. Soon it will become clear that after this scene and a few cities, it is imagined that it is not an ordinary film and no ordinary story, it is something very special and unique. At first glance, things are not as it is clear, but cinematography and the landscape that the viewer witnesses are astounding, and the characters that inhabit this small, soon extinct area are just amazing in the word. This is what can draw you closer to this qwerk movie, or be bored to sit where you expect something to happen. Deep spiritual movies and dreams as qualities give her a slow and methodical approach that I'm sure some viewers will carry, but if you are patient with him and see a bigger picture, the film is great for testimony. <br /> <br /> Rating 8 out of 10
