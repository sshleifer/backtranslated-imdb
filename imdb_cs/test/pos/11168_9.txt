I read comments on this movie before I watched it, and I didn't expect much, but like B, it's curiosity. I think you have to be a kind of person to enjoy this kind of thing, but I really thought it was amazing. People should only look at it because it is one of its kind. Don't expect much of it. Behavior is bad, the transitions were probably done on a PC, etc. Definitely B movie, but still worth a try. Very funny. Mild gore, and some controversial motives, so probably not something that should show Gran, but for an adventurous viewer I would say it must be seen.
