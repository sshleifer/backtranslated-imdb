Imaginary Heroes is clearly the best film of the year. It was sheer and sheer pleasure to watch. I was riveted. The entire audience at sunset five was riveted when the movie ended no one moved, talked, nothing. I think this film is a perfect example of the power drama has. Especially because it is an example of the quality of the drama / work of this younger generation. There were moments in the film, many, as well as at least seven, where I was hit by so much beauty, emotional beauty that I couldn't breathe for a while. And for a catharsis addict like me, it's about the best censorship experience I could ask. It is the result of a powerful, masterful narrative and direction. Like heavy-weight stuff like Burtolucci and those guys. <br /> <br /> Each foil element sits close together. There were no wrong steps at all. The cast was amazing. I was a huge fan of Emile and Ryan for a long time and I thought they were never better. I was going to be stunned by this movie. And I promise that I will overwhelm all the people I know. It should be seen. It should win awards.
