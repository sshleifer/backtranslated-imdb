I saw this movie at night I couldn't sleep, I loved it and was looking to find out when it would be again, probably the best movie I've ever seen, at that time, and even now the cast is full of people Never seen before, but it seems it's a real life story coming out of NYC, that's the kind of movie that increases the enjoyment of watching because you see it, you hear it and feel it from the moment I saw Wirey drink beer and imagine watching it what it must be like growing up without a father, there are so many lines out of this movie i use on a daily basis, like "personal time alone" in the bathroom drinking 7-11 drink, big movie
