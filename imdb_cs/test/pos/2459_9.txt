Emilio Estevez enjoys the wonderful HOMEFRONT game and makes it an engaging movie. <br /> <br /> THE DOMESTIC MILK has an extremely powerful cast - all seemingly kicking into their characters. Here is the TOP NOTCH! Credits must be director Emilio Estevez. The visual transitions between past and present were very smooth. The sound effects during the battle scenes were cool and effectively added to the tension. Remove all elements of Vietnam from the story and still have interesting characters struggling with good and bad full family dynamics. (The viewer can see this point more clearly by keeping in mind the scene of "discovering old photos" from the beginning when the rest of the movie is watched). <br /> <br /> As a movie, I found HOME WAR to be more direct and to a point than BORN ON JULY 4. Fine effort - almost 10. <br /> <br />
