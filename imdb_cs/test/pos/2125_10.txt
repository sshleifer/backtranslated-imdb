I have a 4-year-old daughter, and before this movie she was about Disney princesses, now she watched this movie and all she could talk about is Princess Genevieve and all her sisters. I definitely recommend this movie to all young girls. This movie is one of the best Barbie collections. This shows all the good values ​​a mother would like to encourage to little girls. With great songs and dance moves, he gets his daughter up and tries to mimic moves. The accessories are also good, one works on how good your memory is. Certainly I would say it is necessary to see for children and adults as well.
