A very positive news for our youth is shown in this film. Through rugby sport, a high school rugby coach leads his players in his behavior and lifestyle, in the ON and OFF field. The action and direction are good. Rugby shots are just fine if you know some rugby or really cool if you don't know much about it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie, which is worth watching, especially when this sport gets more and more adepts every day. The story is based on a real story that takes place in Utah. The coach portrayed in this film was at the helm of the Highlanders for over 30 years (and loses only play every 3 years). <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
