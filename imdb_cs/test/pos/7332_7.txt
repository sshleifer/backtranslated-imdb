I thought it was a beautiful movie - very brave. Such beautiful images - and I like to use breaking glasses w / applause. Also, as the best friend repeated the line about "..and she's one year older than me .." she showed that their friendship was re-developing and growing, but maybe there's some competition left ... I loved the shots of the hands feeling fabric . The dance concert was beautiful. The beginning seemed slow, though… it took a while to feel for the characters - the husband could be more offensive - he seemed absent, so when the other characters talked about him - that really didn't fit. The matter came. The best friend and husband seemed random. The doctors' meeting seemed to indicate that there was not much time left (to live…), so when infidelity was discovered, I did not feel so sympathetic to a character that was more like a relief. ! the end was so great that the lines btwn. her and her husband, and the scene where she is dragged is brilliant!
