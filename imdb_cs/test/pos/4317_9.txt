Watching the last 2 episodes I remembered to add TV from my childhood. It turned out in the wild west, very dusty and dry, and there is a small saloon, a man enters a bar / lounge, is thirsty like hell, lips cracked etc., Just passed the desert Nevada and hasn For several days he does not drink water. He shouted to the bartender, "embrace a potato chipset" when eating them, we can feel the thirst getting, we hear a background voice that says ... "Keep thirst building, build it until you can hold it more .. ........... then throw him out with the TEAM "The man drinks TEAM (soft drink) It's like a few dozen bags of potato chips thirsty is so intense that I can no longer keep it, Season 2 has even more Twists and Turns Than Season 1. The End answers a lot of questions, but asks many more questions, hopefully we know the answer in Season 3, but I doubt because I feel LOST has a momentum going much further than 3 seasons if people behind the camera keep a good job. <br /> <br /> I'll keep following for one.
