The decline of the series is amazing and PS director can't get enough credit to make these movies. I am a little surprised to see that many people will not see this, but not the two, but it is worth revealing if you want a picture of punk in the transformative years between the late 1970s and early 1980s. The film starts with a blistering collection of music videos that play over the music of the band. Many band interviews and punks that offer an insight into what survived have been on the low rung of the main rock ladder. There is no internet, no bad jobs and no hostility in this genre. For new kids who haven't heard about these bands or are just starting out on their own, this movie is a real rock lesson. All the band's performances (and many of them) are amazing, especially FEAR, who will never cease to amaze me. This and the second installment are amazing time capsules that offer to those who care about a rare insight into the lives of these mad people. It's a real punk, just like in a conversation with Darby Crash when he recalls a painter who mysteriously / suddenly died outside their house and took a week or so to figure it out. The EMT chuckled at this, and in real terms the interviewer asks her girlfriend if she is sad or upset that this guy died while painting her house, which is the answer "no i hate the painter". How about Black Flag renting its flat / trial space for $ 16 a month! My jaw almost collapsed when I saw myself renting ten decades to practice 400. Between this tracking and Deadwood I feel like I was born in a bad time, I just missed those cowboy days and old nights way. People and bands associated with the film have paved the way for what is harder today, and have done it in their own unique way. Brilliant movie, ten stars, see Part 2, as well as its equally amazing, Part 3 though, I don't know what to say.
