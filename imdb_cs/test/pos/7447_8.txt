Then he watched. It's damn amazing. Fights are fantastic and magic is really cool! It's just like a video game in games, with some amazing hand-to-hand combat. This movie is for fans: "For those who once loved this world and spent time with their friends, gathering and spending their time again ..." I never played Final Fantasy. I think it pays to be familiar with the Role Playing game in general; knowledge of the genre will help you to better understand some of them. I think that if you watch out and accept what the movie suits you, it's pretty easy to understand. There is a lot that is not explicitly explained, and if you require that it should be then you will probably be confused and irritated. Watching a movie is like being dropped into the middle of some big saga, and having to put as much of the puzzle together as possible. I like this approach; you get into the mystery and confusion that all the characters go through. But as I said, I just accept it. If the weird red lion thing that speaks, appears and starts kicking ass and taking names, and the other characters just say it is an old friend, accept and move on; you don't need a backward bioflash, or all you can say. You are an observer here, something that goes beyond your experience and division. So: fantastic graphics and animation, great acting performance, a great video game in the style of music, including story and characters and maybe some of the best fighting you'll see in a while. It's worth seeing, and while it's for the fans, it's perfectly accessible to people like me who have never played games.
