When thinking about Soviet cinematography, Eisenstein propaganda masterpieces or Tarkovsky's dark meditation come to mind. These are great movies, but they are generally not the funniest material. However, the lands inside the Iron Curtain seemed to have their escapist musicals as well as the states. In fact, from the 1930s until the 1970s, forty of these songs-and-dance extravaganzas were released to much adoration by the public. But they are completely unheard of in the West, so this document is trying to correct this situation. He does a great job of introducing these films and putting them in the right cultural context. Despite the fact that I have never been a fan of musicals, this documentary was absolutely convincing from start to finish. It's proof that no matter how many movies you see in your life, you're just skipping the surface of what's out there. <br /> <br /> It's very fun with movie clips themselves. While some musicals are an obvious propaganda that shows workers how much they love working in the mode, some movies (especially the latter) look quite perfect from a production standpoint. Besides, they're all extremely camping because they're strangers to my western eyes. There are several similarities between them and the American musicals I am used to, but the presence of a strict government enforcement message gives them an incredible advantage. They certainly do not resemble musicals in the West. This documentary is one of the most bizarre and entertaining movies I have seen in recent memory, and its absolute necessity to see any film enthusiast. (9/10)
