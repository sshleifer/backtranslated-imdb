David Attenborough brings his wildlife fascination, this time under the sea, in this extraordinary 8-episode journey to all animals under the sea! <br /> <br /> The camera is astounding, bringing to the screen really breathtaking shots of these whales! But the best part, as well as seeing every episode, is how they did it! Whether it's the creation of the creature or the impressive footage of the whales, it will explain in about 10 minutes how they did it! 2001 had some great TV shows on our screen. But unlike this documentary jewel, it makes them very lame! But in order to show off this documentary series as the best TV series of 2001, it doesn't mean that this series offers quality entertainment! Overall, this is the best TV series of 2001 with no competition and maybe the best TV series 2000s!
