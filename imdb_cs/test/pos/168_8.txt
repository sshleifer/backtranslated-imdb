This pleasantly perverted and strange early 80s teenage body never gets into the overwhelming peak of the deeply disturbing and criminally underestimated moppet movie "Devil Times Five," but it is still an above-average child opus killer. Slim but useful plot concentrates on three wrong twists - two fellow brothers and one spooky teen girl, though an angelic girl who was born during a solar eclipse on June 9, 1970. When a strange antisocial trio holding a tightly closed and exclusive circle, reaching ten years, suddenly returning to murder and declaring an open season on the unfortunate, unsuspecting local yokeles of the sleepy and peaceful California Meadowvale suburb. . Writer / director Ed Hunt, usually incompetent deaf hack responsible for such wonderfully pathetic clunkers as wonderfully dopey "Starship Invasions", the noble missing Jesus Christ vigilante parable (!) "Alien Warrior" and the tremendously stupid "The Brain," makes it pretty solid and able to work: killing scenes are abundant and reasonably brutal (arrow over the eye is particularly ugly), there is considerable smattering of gratuitous nudity and soft-core sex, a lot of tension is neatly crafted and maintained, some nice dollops of dark humor interrupt the damn crumpled chaos, and the surprising gloomy end will truly shake. perfectly observable and absorbable: Jose Ferror as a small city doctor, future TV series "Jake and Fatman" Joe Penny as an amateur astrologer, "Lori Lethin as a dear hero guard", Susan Strasberg as a school teacher, "American Ninja" Michael Dudikoff as chowderhead chow , and Cyril O'Reilly (a lonely mizantroscopic vampire in a terribly melancholy "Dancing Damned") as a libidinous teen dude who gets a bag while doing what you're thinking about with some naked hot chick in the back parked van. Billy Jacoby (who went on to star in so late 80's direct-to-video dross as "Dr. Alien" and "Demonwarp"), Andy Freeman, and especially scary adorable Elizabeth Hoy is really creepy and convincing as a horrible threesome evil and amoral rugrats. And yes, it is none other than Julie Brown, a strange comedy who has been surprised by the Top 40 hit with the cheerful novelty "The Homecoming Queen's Gotta Gun", as a beautiful, expressionless, full-fledged red bimbo that makes a very lengthy, utterly alien, yet still the hissing and highly prized naked striptease while dancing in her bedroom on a cheesy blaring rock song! All in all, this baby size as a robust and satisfying slasher item.
