One of my favorite Hartley movies. (As if it could be "bad".) Although it may be a little more on the religious side of things than we would normally expect. However, he still insists that Hartley leaned down on everything we all got used to. The first picture Jesus and Satan discuss their ideas, opinions, hopes and regrets over the approaching end of civilization. Imagine the whole conversation taking place in several bars in your area. And as another conversational (apart from visual) distraction, let's throw it in PJ Harvey as a savvy companion (aka Magdelena) to Mr. Chist. Then, just for smirks, in the background, sometimes present the Salvation Army group (played by Yo La Tengo) to serve as another diversion. The road to moral justification has never been such a pleasure. Quite possibly more questions than answers, but that is fun. And as always, Donovan is a brilliance.
