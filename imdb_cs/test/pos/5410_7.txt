It is difficult to judge 'Imaginary Heroes' without mentioning that the director and screenwriter Dan Harris is only 25. You can hardly believe that this film, which is not just a mature work, professional and profound, but also some defects of a specific routine for older directors. The setting is an American suburb, too familiar with "American beauty" or "desperate wife." As in "American Beauty," the film is turning to suicide, but here it is happening at the beginning of the film and we have left a middle-class observation that has come to terms with the death of a talented sportsman and son. Emile Hirsch plays a younger brother, Sigourney Weaver is a mother, both are excellent, trying to cope with the loss, find reason and motivation to survive. Harris drives his actors with a certain hand, and the first two parts of the film (there are four total as the seasons) build a wonderful tension, with trusted dilemma and real issues. It is the second part of the film, which slightly disappoints, looks too tired and conventionally, and I suspect producers may have interfered with the work of a young writer and director and tried to bring him closer to the Hollywood convention. This is not how the film can be a dark version of "American Beauty" with a different focus. However, I am sure that in the coming years we will hear a lot about Dan Harris.
