The surface is one of the best exhibitions I've ever seen. NBC is so stupid to cancel a big show like this, and the worse of all just leaves. NBC or someone else should give the surface at least one season just to finish it. It's as if NBC has given you a book you read, and in the middle of it they decide to take it away and then you'll never find the end. I just want to see what happens to everyone and, most importantly, find out what happens to Nim. I think I can say safely about most surface fans is that we want to save Nima! Nim got rid of all our hearts and then NBC cut them to two. Come on NBC, just give Surface one more season!
