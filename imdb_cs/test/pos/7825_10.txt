It is typical of people who complain about something when they have nothing to do with it ... So it's about a homosexual who fits on straight women. First of all ... This is a true story, so you can't say its an incredible second of its written by homosexual, so the whole thing about being against homosexuals is just stupid. Personally, I think it was the best love story I've ever seen. And I'm very gay. I think it shows that real love is about personality, not just about appearance and sex. And he has nothing against anyone who is gay, straight or bi unlike many other shows. Perhaps we are in Europe to make it more cus most TV here are a little deeper and make you think more than American TV ... Plus we are not worried when it comes to displaying some things. If you want something funny with one of the best Englands (Lesley Sharp) and you want to see a decent, trusted love story without too much sap, that's for you. I know I like it
