I found the entire 3 DVD file on Wal-Mart in a $ 5,50 negotiation box, so I thought I'd look again. A total of 13 hours to watch it all (26 episodes). I was born in 1948 and in the 1960s I saw most of them on television. Many independent stations have repeated them for many years. Better than I actually expected, time was kind to the apparent sincerity of his creators and to the obvious gratitude and respect they give to all Allied fighters. and women. More abstract and arty than a straightforward document, but very true in its depiction of the causes and end results of World War II. This war was highly dependent on maritime transport, and the ultimate victory was dependent on who reached the ultimate world ocean championship. The Allies were the ones who could do it. It is also interesting to see how they strive to strike a balance between the big events and the individual soldiers and sailors who made them. The score is impressive if it is too much today's standards. I read somewhere that Robert Russell Bennett contributed as much as Richard Rodgers to the final score. I imagine Rodgers provided all the main motives and it was up to Bennett to get to them. Good job! It should be seen by every ruler or potential ruler. Warning for tyrants that wars are ultimately won by ideals, determination, and supplies to support them. Logistics: their quality and delivery determine any winners. The allies outproduced and outperformed the Axis material, attacked their own source in the process, and insured their eventual defeat. Sorry, producer, Henry Salomon, lived a very short life. IMDb facts were somewhat modest, I need to know more about it. Before his early death, he made several other excellent documents. It could be said later <br /> <br /> Trivia: I had all 3 LP recordings from the background music in total. Unfortunately, the producers have decided to add the sound effects to the last one, immediately relegated to just the novelty, rather than for serious listening to music. Too bad, because it contained some interesting but smaller themes in the series. Silly things like 16 inch shooting, torpedo shooting, bulldozers, airplanes ... especially for kids. <br /> <br /> RSGRE
