I first saw this film at the premiere party in the hometown of Mr. Zwarts Fredrikstad. There, between directors, musicians and other Norwegian celebrities, I laughed and laughed ... I just couldn't stop. If you like the comedy with black humor, sharp lines and great performances - that's one movie you have to see! It's like mixing "True Romance" with "The Wedding Singer" and adding a hyphen "Mad About You" to Hilarios! <br /> <br /> 10 points!
