Consistency is perhaps this film's biggest problem. The film begins as a fast, stylish and simple, entertaining political satire, but in its second half the film becomes a more serious tone, almost in a way. Of course, it is also a very serious subject, but I would say that the film would be better and more effective if it was completely done in the same style as the first half of the film. <br /> <Br /> The film is also relatively short with a mere 102 minutes of running. The film because it doesn't seem to be the story's story. Of course, following the events of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan is implied in the film, but the film does not go deeper and does not explain much, which feels like a cheap way to celebrate Charlie Wilson without showing the other side of the medal. Real events in the movie are also simplified, although the story sometimes becomes unnecessarily complicated. Yes, the movie would just be better if it wasn't going to be so serious at times and more light overall with its style and atmosphere. For example, the film was supposed to be more like "Wag the Dog", finding the right combination of satire and sensitive political issues. <br /> <br /> Because of this disparate style and way of telling, acting is also mixed. When Tom Hanks plays his character more playfully and comically, he is just great. But it's hard to take his character into the more serious and sensitive film moment. Philip Seymour Hoffman is always excellent because he is in every movie he plays. He also received an Oscar nomination for his role in this film. Most other actors seem to be in this movie just to be in the movie. This is especially true for Julia Roberts, whose character I found to be too mysterious to have a clear purpose for the film. She made a superfluous impression on me and is also unforgettable in this film. It's not that the movie is a bad watch, in fact it's pretty good and nice, but if the film dared to make the film a little worse, the film would be better and especially more effective in it what he was trying to achieve. <br/> 7/10
