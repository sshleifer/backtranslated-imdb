The "Autumn Spring" tells of the misery of a modest, threatened, 78-year-old Czech man who pampers and cares for everyone who knows him in his wicked ways while his wife carefully plans his funeral. Hana (Brodsky) shows us how to get the girls to kiss you when your 78 and how to deal with them in the elevator and thank you for moving that way from day to day in this warm and glowing look at old age. A creative, fun, but socially unacceptable way to enjoy life while refusing to be included in an old people's home. "Spring of Autumn" is a discreet, subtle comedy with news for all ages, which will have the greatest appeal with mature foreign film enthusiasts. (B +)
