I went to see this movie in the Lexington signing book, Ky last night. After a wonderful night that consisted of a few short words with Mr. Bruce Campbell (you have to tell everything, not just Bruce or Mr. Campbell; D), friends while the books were signed, and the QnA session with our favorite dead light killer was dimming. So that nothing goes wrong, I'm used to going into detail ... but I loved the movie! Mr. Bruce Campbell did a great job and kept the classic b-movie. The characters were classic 'b' characters, the place was refreshing (what movies did * you * know are based in Bulgaria?) And the setting was both almost original and fun! On top of that, the humor that is cut up throughout the movie, which kept the audience laughing over much of the movie. Although this film doesn't have a big general appeal to people like some, it is a beacon of fun and laughter (as Bruce Campbell said) "b-movies" that are referred to as "movies" "(Bewitched, Dukes of Hazard, Charlie Factory and Chocolate?!).
