The trader of the four seasons is not what I would call a happy film at all, or even one that would amaze me to the point where we praise him to heaven (there are other Fassbinder moves like Veronika Voss and the underrated Satanic movie) Cook) . But it's definitely no less than a fascinating experiment looking at those in society that you and I and others we know may know, or really don't want to know. I imagine that in the early 1970s, in Germany, the generation that came out of World War II had a stigma to live, but it tried to do what it could. This is the stigma that floats throughout this film, and in many cases in Fassbinder's work in general, but mainly because the Four Seasons looks at the middle class and the particular married couple - the distant, depressed, angry Hans. a fruit vendor and his long-standing wife - that is nothing less than the pursuit of realism in the melodrama mask. If Cassavetes was a crazy German, he could make this movie, maybe even as big. The story sounds simple, where Hans's drink got out of control, beats his wife (this scene is one of the hardest, maybe just in all the movies, the way Fassbinder's camera remains uncut because his wife is helpless and their daughter tries to stop him in his madness and then she is ready to leave him. When standing in the room, her family holds him back, she calls for divorce and he gets a heart attack. He is recovering, his business suddenly begins to flourish with some help from some good (or not so good) employees - and yet it just continues his desire, for another woman and his desperation in general. yet it is in this simplicity that Fassbinder attempts and for the most part succeeds in achieving a mood of fear, a tense atmosphere in the kitchen or in the bedroom or on the street that you can cut with a knife and bleed. The weakest part of all of this can be playing ... at least it was my initial impression. Hans, played by Hirschmuller, may be present, with only the slightest movements in his face and eyes, and for a moment it doesn't seem to be a good actor. The actress playing her wife, Irm Hermann, and her sister (Fassbinder Hanna Schygulla) have a better price, but only because they are more given to act conventionally, as when crying or looking. It takes some time to adapt to what is essentially emptiness in his boy Hans, some of his own psychological suffering or self-pity, which penetrates himself and those who want to behave around him with some sense of normality, especially when Hans becomes successful. Not everyone clicks in the four seasons of the Trader, but enough to recommend it to those looking for a different piece of life than you could use. with more modern American movies. Fassbinder's world here is the struggle between the melodrama he loves in the cinema and the cruel, overwhelming sense of humanism, which he feels personally and puts into the characters who identify themselves in some way for a better or worse character. Are the Epps Family You Know About? Or could you be them too? Who's gonna say that. It is a methodical study of the tragic emptiness in the human spirit and all its goals.
