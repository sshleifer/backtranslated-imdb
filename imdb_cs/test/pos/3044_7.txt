The autobiographical book by Pat Conroy "The Water Is Wide" has proven to be somewhat like the southern "Up The Down Staircase", despite the pattern for the teacher against him, "Conrack" really moves the audience with every small breakthrough and creative flash. These students (uneducated blacks on an island off South Carolina) are actually shown as teachings, and their collective wide-eyed innocence is remarkably sweet. One real party actress (Tina Andrews, an amazing performer) plays the "hard matrix" that Conrack has to crack, and when it falls under his spell, everything seems to be a breeze. However, the story is not ready for a happy ending and I was not ready for the quiet simplicity of the final. It's beautifully done. The scenario is constantly evolving, but director Martin Ritt is very smart to always come back to the solid presence of Jon Voight. Scenes such as where he moves in his van vent his frustration over the speaker, do not add much, but the whole movie is filled with episodes that evoke emotions, and the end is their return. ** 1/2 of ****
