20 years later, and this film still has an echo of its size that floats around. Never has the movie surpassed the incredible Valley Girl soundtrack. The film completely encapsulated the 1980s to such an extent that it could only be realized many years later. Nicolas Cage at his best. A film that has the nature of realizing how sad Hollywood has become (in terms of quality). The special edition of the DVD is packed with lots of accessories and it's worth buying because you have enough material to sift. Certainly.
