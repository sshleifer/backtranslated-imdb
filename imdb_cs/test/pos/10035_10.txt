The film is excellent. One of the most remarkable things about it is that Flynn's performance is excellent. It is worth stressing because he was often derided as actor Bette Davis et al. I remember the scene where Flynn gets Arthur Kennedy drunk to put him in his fate in the Battle of Little Big Horn. A cold, computational look at Flyn's face as he does it is extraordinary - much better than a lot of boastful Spencer Tracy or many other stars they could do. Another thing to note is the outstanding performance of George P. Huntley Jr as Lt "Queen's Own" Butler. It's confused why he stopped making movies shortly afterwards - one would think he would be built after years as an actor.
