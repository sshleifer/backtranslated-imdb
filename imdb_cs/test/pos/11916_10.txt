This film is a perfect example of a great escape! I loved this movie and was sucked in from the beginning. Sure, it's just an action movie, but it's not fun watching movies? The cast of this film is very strong with likeable characters. Friendship between boys is so realistic and appealing, it's heart warming and merry seeing a group of teenage boys interacting - especially this group of boys !! Sean Astin makes a great rebel, avoiding being a teenager prematurely. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you want fun! I really enjoyed it, even though I watched it on very dirty and old VHS that was terrible quality (Go DVD!)
