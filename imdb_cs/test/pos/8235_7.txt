During WWII, there were bazillion films created by Hollywood and after seeing many of them they start to look alike. However, OVER 21 is unique in many ways because it shows the side of the war you won't see in other films - so it's worth seeing, even if you've seen more movies! Alexander Knox plays male lead but Irene Dunne is the real lead of the film - which looks amazing for a 47-year-old lady (yes, I checked - was really old when she was making a movie). In OVER 21, the pair play husband and wife. He enlists in the army, much to his father's dismay (Charles Coburn) and newspaper owner where Knox is employed, and most of the film takes place when he is in officers candidate school. The film shows little Knox at school, but instead focuses on Dunne when she lives in a nearby Spartan home for her husband. During this time (as the British say) they hold a "stiff upper lip" and do their best - even if they're not really a housewife but a well-known professional writer. Sometimes she gets very short visits to her husband, but she spends most of her time working in the home and keeping Coburn in meddles. Eventually, she decides to stop the poisonous Coburn from phoning continually (he always complains that his paper won't survive without his son) by pretending to be Knox - writing wonderful editorials that everyone assumes he was written by him. While there is nothing shaking in this movie, it's a very interesting piece of life. In addition, everything around is very good. Interestingly, this film is a fictional overworked experience of experienced screenwriter Ruth Gordon and her husband Garson Kanin (also a famous screenwriter and director). When Kanin joined the army during World War II, Gordon soon wrote and starred in the play that became the film. <br /> <br /> By the way, I noticed some of the reviewers really liked the end of the movie. and were inspired. Although it was very good, it was also very sad, because all these hopes for a better world after the war were short.
