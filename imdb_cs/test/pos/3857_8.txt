I have to say one big reason why I thought AristoCats was so big that I love cats !!!! I like cats that this movie seems to have given me a big score, but not only that, it was definitely a good movie as well, and I love where the movie settings are taking place. animated, and I really like how actors actress doesn't sound so professional for the voice of animals'. The film seems to me to be a classic, but I think it's not an IMDb because it has, yes, I think it's too low a rating. the best animated movies there is and I can do it over and over again!
