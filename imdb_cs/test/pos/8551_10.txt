I was packed to see many other people who enjoyed this movie. He watched it first when I was young and then several times later late at night. Then unfortunately not. I am almost 49 now and so I wish it could be made available on DVD. Why not? The best role of Anthony Quinn, no one could have been more suited to the game he was playing - I mentioned it to other film enthusiasts of a similar age, and unfortunately, no one I know can remember. As a daughter of a generation that went through World War II and its aftermath (and I am deeply fascinated by what this generation has endured), I think this film has brought me an amazing film look at some of the heartbreaking questions of today. For classic final scenes this film is excellent.
