A love letter is one of my favorite books, so I was naturally skeptical when I heard it was a movie. But I like it. I found myself smiling at the whole movie. I admit it is not a great movie, but a pleasant hour and a half. I thought Capshaw and Scott were perfect like Helen and Johnny. Just as I imagined them. And the city and the scenery were also fine. I recommend this movie, but don't expect too much, just enjoy it.
