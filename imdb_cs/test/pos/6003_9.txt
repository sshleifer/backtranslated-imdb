I remember when I was broadcasting this NBC mini-series when I was in high school. After reading the novel, I thought I'd look at some adjustments. I didn't expect much from the TV mini-series, but now I may have to look at the others. This is actually an excellent and best possible movie version. Writer Simon Moore, who wrote teleplay for the original mini-series Traffic, which was based on Soderberg's film, came up with a brilliant narrative story that helps the story go very smoothly. Gulliver returns home for the first time (all on one trip). Gulliver, playing Ted Danson Cheers, is a little crazy when his wife Mary Steenburgen greets him back to her home. Unfortunately, the house is now owned by local doctor James Fox, who has designs for Steenburg. At first, Gulliver seems to be disturbed, but when he begins to tell stories about tiny people, it's all that Fox needs to throw him into a crazy asylum. All four Gulliver's travels are in this version related, in the same order as the novel (only time it was made on film). I love the way his current situation reflects his flashbacks. Gulliver's little son, whom he has never met, reminds him of the Lilliputians. Doctors watching him in his cell from the mezzanine loom over him and reminding him of Brogdingnagians and the doctor's scientific questions remind him of the crazy scientific experiments and the theories of Laputans and professors at the academy. Finally, when he is brought to justice, he is reminded by Houyhnhnms and Yahoos. The cast is amazing and includes Peter O'Toole, Ned Beatty, Alfre Woodard, John Gielgud, Kristin Scott Thomas, Omar Sharif and Warwick Davis. The biggest mistake of the mini-series is that acting is really uneven. You have all these subtle actors, but smaller characters are often played by actors who were probably in the episodes of L.A. Lawa, but they don't do well in costume drama. Ted Danson is not particularly great, though he has several sequences where he excels. It's probably better that he didn't try it, but all the other characters in the movie speak an English accent. In fact, Steenburgen is quite good and overall is pretty good. Another mistake in the series is that adventures are becoming too fast. It is not credible that Gulliver spent eight years from home, as he claims. In general, however, Swift's tone and purpose are very well captured, while with its structure it adds a new emotional level.
