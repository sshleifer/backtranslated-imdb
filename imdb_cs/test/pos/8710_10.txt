This is one of the best and most remarkable vampire stories ever! I love this movie really. The character is great, even the place and the story. The picture is really not a big budget production, but it's worth seeing. OK are some mistakes in this movie (especially castle and place names), but such mistakes are typically and almost in every horror movie. The scenery fits perfectly with the story and is close to reality, I can say I'm honest because I visited them once when I was in Romania in my vacation. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the best part of a series of subspecies.
