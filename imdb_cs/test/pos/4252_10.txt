1969 was a year. The place was in New York. Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film to achieve some recognition. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope has achieved a much wider release. Libra (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more profane and unpleasant. These two films were spiritually lively, to the point that they had stopped the Prince's feature film career for several years. The subject is Putney Swoope. And it's a crazy farce / satire that must be seen to be believed. I'm not going to go through a conspiracy here. What a conspiracy? People looking for a plot will scratch their heads. Scratching! This movie is not about PLOT! One could compare this to Mel Brooks' movie; just without the Hollywood parody Mel always threw. I also see a little Monty Python in it. By the way: This movie was shot before Monty debuted on BBC !!! I noticed that the Gags and the lines that are dead are cheerful. You have to see them in the context of the movie. There are some shortcomings in the film; but also the shortcomings are unique. For example: Actors often repeat SAME LINE over and over again; and somehow it works. How many syllables Mario? Putney says Borman Six Girl must have a soul! etc. <br /> <br /> Shooting B / W is excellent. Sound / score is even better! Editing is just that. The activity is above average. The script is invaluable. Jokes are un-PC as you can get: MR. Bad News says: "Sonny Williams just caught a motel with a 13 year old girl" Putney says "Well, at least he's not superstitious" Uptight Conservatives be careful. The anti-foundation thinking of this movie will drive you right out of the room. Nothing is sacred. <br /> <br /> There are many things in this movie that concern today: NO SMOKING !!! Reverse Racism; with African Americans to treat the Caucasus as garbage. Manipulating mass media over the masses; Madison Avenue, Deroit, Hollywood deliberately treads on what every eight-year-old can say is pure waste; Internet, I'm talking about a "drum"; Interracial dating; I could go on and on .... <br /> <br /> I should also mention that there is about 8 minutes of this movie that was shot in 16mm color. These are the ads made by Putney. Places work quite well for the first time. But he is bored on repeated views. The real magic is in the B / W sections of the movie. These are non-scenic lines that will stay with you: "Rent Yourself A CHORT Schmuck". "I love you, I love you, I love you ... did you take a pill?" "anything I have to say would be useless". And many others. I also liked the battle with the mounted slipper on the wall: "The game's keeper wanted me to return her ... I got into such a fight, I decided to have it!" Standouts in the cast include Buddy Buttler as Putney's bodyguard # 1. He was to be a much bigger star. Antonio Fargas as Arab. He continued to fame on television and in movies. Arnold Johnson has a real look like Putney Swoope. Instead, Robert Downey used his own voice because Arnold couldn't remember any of his lines. Also, Downey realized that he could add more dialogue / jokes later if he was named his leading actor. The film has some drawbacks. The short run time is one. I wish that the beginning with the White Council members would be extended. Stan Gotlieb and Allen Garfield are excellent. The end seams that were thrown together, as if they couldn't think of other gags. All in all, it is one of the best budget-independent movies that is time-independent. The time when very little indys played outside New York, Chicago, San Francisco and L.A. Anyone who loves satire and comedy should see it at least twice. Downey's Putney Swoope is before and after time.
