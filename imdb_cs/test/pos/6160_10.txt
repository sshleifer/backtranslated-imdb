There is nothing less than beautiful photography / cinematography in this film. The fact that you will look for and hope for another flying sequence will tell you that they have enough. Acting is fantastic, stories are seamlessly woven together and dogs are beautiful ............. <br /> <br /> They have to rent, view or see. > <br /> Don't be afraid of subtitles ........ <br /> <br /> it's worth trying a little bit of an aversion therapy <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> br />
