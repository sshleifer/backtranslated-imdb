For the first time I saw this movie as a year and a half ago and I loved it, I decided to get on DVD last year on my birthday .. It has the right amount of tension, action and drama. his full of rebellious children, in which one boy William Tepper (Sean Astin) has a difficult adjustment due to previous rejection by other schools because they could not control their rebellious act and now commit other acts of rebellion there The school is taken over by terrorists for a random day and which real reason is because leader Luis Cali's (Andrew Divoff) father was sent to jail and the leader will do something including killing students, setting bombs, and so on so that his father returns. Alongside William Tepper, his rebellious friends at Regis School, one of them is primarily Joey Trott (Wil Wheaton), in which this guy holds a troubled past. live in a mafia family and be posted on school regis, because they hate their father for who they are and who now has to deal with these terrorists who took over the school, so William, Joey and there friends have to unite to stop these terrorists from violent acts and dangerous tactics. This movie was really amazing and I believe people should notice more, because when people think of a good film hostage, they would say "Die Hard" and even if I had to agree with them, they must recognize that Toy Soldiers was a good thriller, it certainly beat my heart because students are my age and I would be afraid to confront terrorists like these if they took our school ... But overall, this film is really worth a good 112 minutes of its time and if I am decided to rent or buy ... I'd buy it! I recommend it with lots of humbug! 8/10
