I'll start by saying overall that I enjoyed The Long Kiss Goodnight. I would give it 7/10. Good: 1. Meeting: Samuel L Jackson is fun in almost every role. In this film, she does not play her usual character, a type that is under control, instead Geena Davis is under control and Sam is on her way. His timing on his tracks is great and is the highlight of the film. Geena Davis also gives great performance as Samantha Caine / Charlie Baltimore. He's a credible action hero, and I don't think too many other actresses could replace Geeny Does. 2. Action: This is a very action movie. Things are pretty much always crashing or blowing, or someone chasing someone else. Special effects are particularly good for nearly 8 years. I see some green canvas stuff, but it doesn't take too much from acting. <br /> <br /> Bad: 1. Why did I need to adjust half the movie? This movie had to be edited in the script so it didn't run as long as it was. Maybe a drama or something that can run so long, but people really have to be into the movie all the time to keep it. I think that if you end up with the first half, you will be thrilled to suppress the other half. 2. Geena Davis is a cold weather and tank top, but never looks cool. 3. Some things are unrealistic. Sam Jackson flies a giant sign after being fired from the room and then landing on the tree and just getting up. When you see this part, you'll think it's a gag. total funny movie 7/10
