Haha, what a big little movie! Wayne Crawford strikes again, or rather it was his first big blow, the delusively fun little ball of manic kitschy energy camouflaging as a psycho killer movie. It's actually ** a great ** satire on post-hippie American culture in the land of overpass, although the film was actually filmed independently in Miami. This resists any type of convention-oriented or device-based study that I think: SOMETES AUNT MARTHA DREADFUL THINGS may not be a technically proficient movie, but it's a wonderful little piece of America made by people who were in a cheap place. honest, ambitious, imaginative and had balls made of steel. It took courage, nerves and guilt to make this movie, which surprisingly seems to have passed the test of time. This film is fresh, vital, lively, unforgettable and charming, enough to recommend anyone with a sense of humor. Last year I dug up when I was fascinated by "star" Wayne Crawford (here billed under his pseudonym Scott Lawrence), a maestro of what can only be called a regional film-making, usually a B-class variety. He is a writer, producer, director and actor in one, probably the best known for the 80's apocalyptic favorite NIGHT OF COMET. Here Stanley plays, pants wearing half of the truly amazing characters, apparently gay spree murderers on the lam after knocking down some old lady in Baltimore for her jewelry. The legend of the unexplained screen Abe Zwick is absolutely convincing, as Paul, who represents Stanley's aunt Martha, the cross dressing of clothes that made Stanley think that he committed murder to ensure his loyalty. Martha looks like a female sailor from the SOUTH PACIFIC Support Corps in her coconut bikini, but no one seems to notice - or does she care? - that she is he, has no visible means of income, seems to spend all day worrying about where Stanley is, and stumbles around in her butcher's robe's robe. Only in America ... <br /> <br /> As the film opens, two of them have just arrived in Florida and set up a residence in what looks like Ward Cleaver's old house, a crystal-lit and designed TV house. clich√©s as surrealistic. In one unforgettable scene, Martha and the unwelcome guest sit on the couch, talk about problems and drink Budweiser cans in one of the most fascinating, subversively ordinary sequences I've ever seen outside of John Waters' movie. Then there is Stanley, always in trouble when he's a mop that is at the top of a hippie with a STP patch on his waistcoat that drives a psychedelic painted van that is as soft as a Batmobile, drinks milk directly from cardboard, snorts drugs with bombs with bomb. , and piled donuts in an old cigarette box for fast food. Opposites attract, I think. But Stanley also has something he doesn't like when young ladies steal, try to remove their trousers, and it always seems to be up to Aunt Martha of the problems they inevitably lead. The bodies accumulate, the noses of the drug addicts them into their house like a flop, Stanley's birthday cake is tousled, and they all meet at a local pizzeria shop before heading to the hookah hangar where girls are dancing in their underwear. Things get out of hand when one of the neighbors tries to get Marty too crazy, which naturally prefers to keep people close at hand when they are roughly invited to a nice chat. And this is a woman who only carries a butcher knife in her slip, but loaded with .38. Eventually, the strange duo finds themselves trapped in the body, baby, and no place to go, eventually retiring to an abandoned film studio, where the technical staff undoubtedly borrowed the equipment used to make the film. I just hope they first politely asked for permission and cleaned themselves up. Of course, it must be said about the relationship between Stanley and Martha / Paul, because dancing around the fact that these two are at least suggested to be a gay couple would lack the primary essence of the conspiracy. We never see both getting intimate and even though Stanley mentally mentions being "wrapped" in one scene, their relationship is more symbiotic than sexual. Certainly it is not a "gay" movie, with rich female nudity and 70s misogyny air that cannot be denied. Stanley & Paul never checked their implied sexuality on the screen, even if it was a movie that should do it if it was important. It's not, the story is not about their sex, it's about the volume they share, and how weird it is. Not their homosexual, but their diversity of individuals who are two of the strangest movie creations that have ever inhabited my TV. <br /> <br /> The film is unique. Only a few thousand dollars were made for what looked like borrowed studio sets, occasional on-site jobs, and a few public places that smuggled the camera crew when nobody was looking. Dialogue is completely bizarre, mundane and pleasantly esoteric. It's a movie that will surprise you, not everyone will like it, but for those who want a low-budget American horror / thriller like NIGHT GOD SCREAMED, HELP ME! I AM LAST, DO NOT USE THE WING AND PLACE AND CHILDREN WITH GOOD THINGS, you have a winner here. 8/10: I would usually say something like "He deserves a DVD restoration", but somehow I think it would ruin the cheap movie environment, and Wayne Crawford, you, sir.
