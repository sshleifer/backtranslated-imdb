It's a movie that is seen on TV and only once .. I think it's good, but it's too lengthy and the plot is so familiar, it's not very original, but it's not boring. The Best Thing of the Movie Are Performances, Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon are a great actress and have done a great job in this movie. I give it 7.
