Yes, this is one of the better TV movies and I wouldn't expect from Joe Sarenta. One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a big fan of The Carpenters, I had to sing all their stuff at primary school and high school and I had to do a lot of solo stuff Karen sang. I thought he was one of the most beautiful pop singers of the 1970s - and that he was a child / teen singing these songs and learning music - one thing I was looking forward to was meeting this woman. I never got past, died three weeks before it happened. And yes, it affected me because I didn't know anything about anorexia - and I couldn't understand what happened. When this TV movie was made, I got enough sense. Perhaps not everything in Karen and Richard's life is open to the television audience, but when I opened up the parts that were shown, I understood much of the music industry of that time. What upsets me is that I write "at that time" and see "now." No one has learned a brave thing, although it is a very informative and cordial look at the problems of the family in the music industry. <br /> <br /> These movies are not for fun. door and show us something. Here was a beautiful woman who got into the whole idea that her talent was weight-based. She was fine. I did not know that. She had mixed reports of her weight from the brother she loved, the parents she loved, and the music industry that cared about her appearance / weight more than the inside. With the onset of MTV it deteriorated. With 'American Idol' it's like puss festering in English accent. Beautiful TV movie, I'm sure later someone can give him HBO treatment, but in any case, many lessons to be learned, the absence of another amazing talent.
