my favorite science fiction, incredible ride through mistrust and distortion of reality. Probably the best performance I've ever seen playing Jude Law. Incredibly original with interesting character development and a story that rotates and rotates so fast it takes a few minutes after the film to fully understand its genius. Even more fun watching it again at the end changes the beginning.
