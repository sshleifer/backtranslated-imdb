This movie surprised me. I first saw it more than 10 years ago, and it stays with me. It's just plain boring points, and I personally would end it - it didn't deter me from watching him over and over again and recommending to others. Acting is _fantastic_. Cast and director are doing a great job with the script, and anyone who likes 'other' movies, who has the patience to sit and say, "What the hell is that?", And letting them draw this movie a chance. If you want Alan Rickman to be goofy or see things explode, it's not a movie for you.
