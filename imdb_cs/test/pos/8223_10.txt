Bill Irwin's Regard of Flight and Clown Bagatelles are some of the most entertaining (both in terms of physical comedy and verbal and visual gags) I've ever seen. My father recorded this special when he first aired in the 1980s and my family has loved her since. We quote it quite constantly. It's crying shame that copies aren't available to buy. I have a bad copy of VHS I received from a specialist distributor a few years ago, but Mr. Irwin's performance deserves proper DVD processing with a renewed version of the original performance and interviews with performers / producers and other examples of modern clowns. Bill Irwin's talent deserves more attention from the audience than he liked in his limited broad performance. I will share the "Regard of Flight" with friends quite often, and although I am always welcomed with a small amount of skepticism when I mention it is a mixture of clowns and vaudeville, I still have no one to see it without loving it. If the powers that sometimes appear on this IMDb list, please consider publishing this and other works by Bill Irwin.
