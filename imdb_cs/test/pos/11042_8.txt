039: Anna Christie (1930) - published February 21, 1930; viewed 3/10/06 <br /> <br /> October 24, 1929: Black Thursday, Stock Exchange falls. Now the country and actually the world will look to Hollywood to escape the global Great Depression. BIRTHS: Anne Frank, June Carter, Yasser Arafat, Bob Newhart, Barbara Walters, Doris Roberts, Ed Asner, Dick Clark, Roy E. Disney, Gene Hackman. DOUG: For a long time our Odyssey has been reunited with Greta Garbo's first soundtrack, a simple character study called Anna Christie. Excellent performance from Mrs. Garbo, who immediately showed the bat that her talents could pass from a silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to store them. How strange). One thing I noticed over and over again is the way the Swedish accent sounds like replacing the letter J with Y. Anna ends up as the only character I liked; I really didn't care about my estranged father or my mentor. Sound recording systems seem to be getting better (no one cares to talk into secrets), but the camera still doesn't move. We will be sure it will keep track of how our odyssey will continue. KEVIN: Our first film from the 1930s is Greta Garbo's first silent movie, Anna Christie. This is a very simple movie, with only five different locations where we spend long stretches of 89 minutes of film, often with a static camera. It was great to see Mary Dressler in the sound, and quite cheerful, because what we hear is an endless string of hearty but drunk curses. I really liked the performance of Garbo because he keeps the film in the most beautiful moments. I didn't really like George Marion or Charles Bickford, maybe because I wasn't sympathetic to one of them, so I was relieved and excited when Anna finally stood up and showed them that they didn't belong to either of them. her estranged father or her muscular bound Irish friend. It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion has not missed a step from silence to sound. <br /> <br /> Last viewed film: Speedy (1928).
