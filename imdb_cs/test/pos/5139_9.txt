Hoot is a nice young person film about a group of high school kids trying to keep a chain of pancakes from the bulldozers of land that is home to some of the endangered ears. Acting is pretty good and fresh faces are nice to see. Many well-known comedians are in this film and keep humor almost nonstop. It's a movie for young crowds, maybe 5 to 11 years old. I thought it was a nice change of pace from adult movies that hit the screen these days. There is no realism or accuracy about life in general for adults or children. It's just a lot of fun with the constant message of saving the beautiful places in this country from becoming over-developed. If you remember the day you were not fighting for a buck, you might remember that money is not everything. Many people over the age of 12 will enjoy it if they really do not have a soft place for old special schools.
