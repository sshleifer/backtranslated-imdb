I don't see why all people give this movie a negative review?!?! I loved this movie! Bled is a form of abstract art, and if you don't appreciate art, I see why you don't like this film. It was a great twist of average, played a vampire movie. If you're looking for a fresh, new and sophisticated new vampire movie, then it's for you. But if you want one of those who become bats and wolves to melt in the sunlight movies then watch your old dracula play. Sure, it's a little on the low budget side, but they did a great job with the budget they had. I am very happy to find this movie because I wanted to give up the genre of vampires. I thought this movie was great! I give 2 inches to a writer, director and all involved in the film.
