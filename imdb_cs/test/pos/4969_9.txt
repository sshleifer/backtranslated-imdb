It's almost 50 years since I saw "Jennifer" for the first and only time. I didn't know the title of this movie until I tried it on this website, but I told many people (especially grandchildren) how movies might not contain graphic details to scare you and leave a strong impact. The story skillfully introduces you to concepts that, if true, will put Ida Lupino in a very dangerous situation. Every time Miss Lupine discovers a new "reality" she draws the viewer into her confusion and fear. This film has such an impact on me that, almost 50 years later, I still mention it as one of the most scary movies I've ever seen. However, this film does not contain blood and gore, which has become popular shortly after filming this film. It's amazing what a good story can do and great actors.
