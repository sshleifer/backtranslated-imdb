This could be my favorite, it's an amazing movie of all time. Like many preschool children from the 80s of repeated ninja revenge, the ninja phase of my childhood was born. I thought Sho k was bad then. Jet Li could get him both feet in the cast! This film has crazy transitions that include flashdance, exorcist and Lee Van cleef ninja television show. ugh. But as my friend says that anyone who can get a good movie, it's true that a genius make a movie that starts with a ninja to survive 17 shotgun blasts long enough to take over the body of arobics instructor to get revenge. Wow. While previous commentators have noticed a sword flying from a wardrobe on a cord, no one has ever understood the mighty love scene. Where a sexy senior male cop takes off his shirt to expose the back dog's mane. Entertainment never ends. Rent it !!!!!!
