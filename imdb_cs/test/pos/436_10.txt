I just saw the beautiful Jean Renoir movie, French Can Can. It is a visual joy and great fun. The recently produced Moulin Rouge fades in comparison. I haven't done enough praise for a recent movie. Now I'm more convinced than ever that my review was right after I saw a filmmaker master as a version of the same story as Jean Renoir. He managed to get great performances from his entire cast and the great French actor Jean Gabin was in a rare form. The dance sequence at the end was one of the most exciting I've ever seen. It was a long time, but I didn't want it to end. This film deserves more recognition than it has.
