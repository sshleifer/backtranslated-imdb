I don't know if this movie will hit my heart as it does, because the feelings of friendship, love, proximity to others, or the warmth of this transformation creates Babette's cooking, but when the banquet starts and for the rest of the movie, I choked. Yes, it's a good movie, but no dirt mawkishness or easy sentiment. Please note that chart elements are discussed. Babette's holiday tells her story with restraint and care and allows us to discover for ourselves the values ​​of grace and love. We just need to know that Babette Harsant (Stephane Audran) was a French refugee who took refuge in two aging sisters in a small community on the coast of Jutland. The sisters lead what remained of the father's flock. He was a pastor of belief that taught that salvation comes through itself. The sisters sacrificed their duties and faith. Those who are still honoring the pastor's long-dead teachings and his spiritual guidance. However, as they grow older, the small community has become ugly and argumentative. Nurses do what they can. For the 100th birthday of the pastor, Babette wants to cook dinner for a small group that the sisters will invite. The nurses reluctantly agree, but when they see the supplies Babette ordered, they and their guests are concerned. They are used to the general price of dried cod food, boiled, and bread soup, water and small beer. Although Babette has improved over time, what she sees appears to be approaching irreligion. There will also be a visitor for dinner, General Lorens Lowenhielm, who years ago chose the ambition of his love for one of the sisters. <br /> <br /> What do we experience? There is austerity of the aging faith of the community and the stone, the wind-swept huts in which they live. There is a candlelight heat in the small, crowded nurses' dining room. And then there is the transforming power of Babette's art, watching her cook, watching Erik, a young boy helping her, serving and pouring, looking at the old parishioners, with the help of fine wine and excellent cooking, gradually rediscovering their community and love and friendship. The general serves as our unexpected guide because he is the only one who knows what extraordinary dishes they eat. The general tells the story of his incomprehensible dinner companions, the story of a famous woman who was an exemplary chef in the famous Anglais cafe in Paris. "... this woman, this chef, had the opportunity to turn dinner into a kind of love affair ... a love affair that did not distinguish between body taste and spiritual taste." He, too, is transformed into a man who accepts what he has become, yet he will always know the value and love of what he has previously chosen not to accept. Old couple kiss. Two old men remember past friendships. And Babette, who had spent everything she won the lottery at this dinner, had the opportunity to be an artist she had once been in France, an opportunity she had embraced with love and friendship. Babette, now as poor as her when she came without a penis, will continue with her sisters. The general in the carriage with his aunt returns to his estate. And older guests leave their sisters' homes to return to their own cottages. They pause and look at the bright night sky and stars overhead. They spontaneously hold their hands in a circle and dance and sing this hymn ... <br /> <br /> "The strike clock and the time goes for eternity is near. Let's use this time to try to serve the Lord with the heart and So that our true home we find, so we find our true home. ”<br /> <br /> They smile at each other Everything was reconciled. <br /> <br /> Babette's Feast is an amazing movie full of emotions, unspoken understanding, wisdom. and of course the food that will leave you with a snarling stomach.If you win the lottery to afford what Babette has created and had her skills and art, here's what she served: <br /> <br /> Potted Soup potatoes and delicacies (rich turtle) served with amontillado sherry Blinis Demidoff au Caviar (small buckwheat pancakes with sour cream and caviar), served with Veuve Clicquot Cailles en Sarcophage with Perigourdine sauce (boneless quail stuffed with foie gras and truffle puff pastry with truffle sauce enriched with Madeira) served with Clos de Vougeot, fine burgundy Salade Cheese and fresh fruit Baba au Rhum with glacee fruit and fresh figs Coffee and fine brandy
