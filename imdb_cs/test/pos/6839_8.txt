This was the first directorial work of Sebastian Gutierrez, the writer of Snakes on the plane and Gothic. Anyone who has read my reviews knows that I love capers, and that was doozy. Kidnapping and woman shot in the process. The FBI has Emma Thompson on the kidnapping case, and a police chief (Roscoe Lee Browne) assigns Alan Rickman to solve the murder, which is the senator's wife (Hal Holbrook). These two make an excellent pair when they work together. The kidnappers / killers have lovers of Simon Baker (Land of the Dead) and ultra-hot Carl Gugino (Sin City), along with several partners. . They kidnapped a hotshot computer tycoon and they drive his accountant around the city before they get the batter. Things go fast as new twists and turns appear. The whole thing is brilliant and definitely "piss in pants because you can't go to the bathroom or you miss something" excitement. Now, to be absolutely honest, I'd give this movie 10 if there was more of a movie the guard was watching in the hole. I'd like to see more Beverly Hotsprings and Yvette Lery, but hey, that wasn't part of the caper; just glaze on the cake. Thompson and Rickman should definitely do more movies together. One heal: Agent Hawkins: So fill me up. Detective Friedman: This comment could be misunderstood as sexual harassment, Agent Hawkins. Agent Hawkins: Let's get out of the way, then you never worked under a female superior. I got to where I was by pushing paper and playing pretty - I never fired a gun, I'm just in this job to prove to my father that I'm not a coward. I give a decent head, so I was promoted to all the good candidates, all men, all of them were just as talented in fellatia, but the gender quota had to be filled. I am also stupid and idealistic; you are hard and cynical and usually right. I'm secretly in love with you, but it's hard to show. Did I skip something? Damn, that's a great dialogue! Gutierrez not only directs a great movie, but can also write! And I said Carla Gugino was hot? <br /> <br /> Put it on your list.
