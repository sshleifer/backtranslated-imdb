I'm a night director of film directors ... especially mega buck, multiplex variety. Although I am not an art student, I still have a high threshold for hanging up infidelity and buying into a filmmaker's vision if I can find it. That's why a jewel like 'You Are Alone' is such an exciting find. Intimacy and stimulation pulled me in and never let me go. Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage give thoughtful nuances to the show, and director Gorman Bechard shows a clever hand in what constitutes an intrusive day in the lives of two terribly damaged people. <br /> <br /> Down Spoiler <br /> <br I bought a DVD version and shared it with several people. The reactions varied, from distrust in Daphne's ability to complete the task for which Buddy had paid her the inability to watch the whole movie because it was too real and emotionally devastating. As a forced skeptical movie viewer, I must either be grabbed by the collars and brought to the ride, or hung up and seduced by the director. This film took a later trip to me and I was so affected by the end that I felt that Daphne was in horror and pain in her role in Buddy's demise. My response to this film reminded me that many years ago, many years ago, I watched Peter Greenaway's "Cook, Thief, His Wife and Her Lover". By the end I was fascinated and discouraged and totally unable to take my eyes off the film. I have watched and appreciated this film several times, as the director has shown. I am familiar with the other work that has been done, including a few brazen movies, "Galactic Gigolo" and "Attack of the Killer Bimbos" and a mixed "The Kiss" bag that I recently taught the producer. in fact, it is not a director's vision. Too bad I loved the previous two movies and I even found an interesting "The Kiss" but the "The Kiss" wish was available in the director's style with all the original visions and music. I look forward to the future work of this exciting director and director, Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage.
