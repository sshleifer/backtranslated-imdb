I won't argue about it, but I'll be short. basically for those who don't know how prue actually died ........... the first time a demon killer hit a bagpiper and joked with an energy ball they were flying around the blood wall. Phoebe The third sister descends down the stairs, saying a spell that sends him away but is not defeated. (NEED THREE THREE) leo comes to heal both and so on. they are exposed along the line, and the only way can be saved is for a demon named tempus to return time. The only way to do this is that phoebe stays in the underworld. agrees, tempus will come back. now it is again around 7:00 in the morning. the demon comes with a pacifier and jokes with the energy ball. they fly through the wall again. but this time phoebe did not say a spell that would blame the demon. the demon kills the doctor. doctor flies through the window. he is dead. The demon goes in the whirlwind wings of things and glass on the door breaks, which is a great effect bye way and there is a airy sound. where it ends. Now .......... what the whole world doesn't know if they don't pay attention to the next episode. although what I'm about to say wasn't shown what's happening to me, believe me ................ because this time there was no phoebe to call leo when it came later. Piper survives because her injuries are not as fatal as prue and leo treats her first before joking, so at that time prue is already dead. solved the secret. ps calling on prue with spell should work !!! and she was supposed to make a surprising look in the last episode
