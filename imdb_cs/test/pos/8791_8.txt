Great movie! oh yeah! Full of energy full of fun, representing our generation, our alienation: a hymn to positive thinking despite this world we live in, a story of a great party, a story of a lot of friends who desperately need to do something in a week and the only thing you need to do is Club. But fun and extasy get bored! Very funny, pretty grotesque in several points, pretty shot ... and great soundtrack!
