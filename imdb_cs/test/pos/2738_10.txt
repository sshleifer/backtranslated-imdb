During the short Golden Age of movies with the Super 8 magnetic sound track, we purchased a GAF Projector for $ 148.00 per close-out at the Downtown Chicago Camera Store. GAF seemed to get out of the camera and projector business; even if they continue their other businesses, such as the former Sawyer Vue-Master 3 Dimensional viewers. <br /> <br /> We didn't even know or expected fast access to Betamax, VHS and any DVD revolution. With the Super 8 Magnetic Sound Camera, which we also bought, we took several sound recordings like our daughter, Jenn's first holy communion and her younger sister, Michelle's graduation. That was all around 1979-82. During this time, we also bought several daddy toys that go with him; like some Super 8 Magnetic Sound LAUREL & HARDY Movies and W.C. Shorts from Blackhawk Films, Davenport, Iowa. We also chose Columbia Pictures Home Movies Sound of the then-forgotten classic cartoon, UPA GERALD McBOING-BOING (United Productions of America / Columbia, 1951). It was a hit of our home movie! The wife (Deanna) and the meself who were members of this generation Baby Boomer remembered the character of Gerald McBoing-Boing; for Gerald had a network television show on CBS, early Sunday evenings, ca. 1955. Bill Goodwin was notifier / host. However, we have never seen this original UPA theater career; nor was it known to us that the young master McBoing-Boing was the creation of dr. Seuss from "Grinch", "Horton" and "Mulberry Street". <br /> <br /> The staff gathered was very talented and deep. Excellent production values ​​are obvious. Director Robert Cannon and supervisor John Hubley were veterans at the top of their craft. The writers were Theodore Geisel (Dr. Seuss himself), Phil Eastman and Bill Scott. Mr. Scott is remembered not so much for his writing contributions to UPA, but for being partners with Jay Ward in such television features as ROCKY & BULLWINKLE, MR. PEABODY, FRACTURED FLICKERS, GEORGE JUNGLE, HOPPITY HOOPER and FRACTURED FLICKERS. With Jay Ward Productions he was a writer, voice, and Kibitzer-general of the whole company. Caricature gets its only "voice" from Narrator, Marvin Miller, Radio / Movie / TV. Do you remember him? He was Michael Anthony on TV Ssries THE MILLIONAIRE (Don Fedderson Productions / CBS Television Network, 1955-60). The distinctive color scheme and imaginative design went to make UPA animations feel special loneliness, fear and eventual triumph. And we can add that the animation is definitely a variety "Limited". AS with so many great stories starts with a simple assumption; man was born differently. In this case, he is a young boy, Gerald McCloy, who was born to create sound effects in communication and not talk. Children can be cruel and soon nicknamed by their not so flattering nickname of a group of teenage mockers who chant: "Nya, nya, your name is not McCloy; it's Gerald McBoing-Boing, a boy who makes noise!" At this point, the animation team does an excellent job of moving emotional transfers in a young outcast from happy and carefree to isolated and lonely, and finally to depression and despair in not being able to turn to anyone for help and understanding; nor for his mother and father. A hauntedly dark scene with a highly stylized scene that includes stylized escapes, including a train and the same stylized snowfall, brings Gerald to the brink of absolute despair. But then he is interrupted by a gentleman who announced that producer Gerald wants a producer of a radio program to provide sounds for a show in the studio. One Premiere is with Gerald They play in the sound department and leave in a huge limousine (which apparently expected those Stretch Limos of our day) to the health and admiration of their classmates and the world. IT has been said that there are so many conspiracies and in this case this story is most likely a variation on the Ugly Duckling; A sad and lonely boy finds his place in the world and true happiness. NOTE: United Productions of America, or UPA for short, was an excellent center of creativity in the Cartoon area. They were responsible not only for GERALD McBOING-BOING and several sequels and TV series, but also a very popular MR. MAGOO Theatrical cartoons and the subsequent TV show (with Jim Backus' voice talent), Classic Original TV Cartoon FROSTY THE SNOWMAN and somewhat bizarre cartoon of DICK TRACY (with Tracy's voice created by Mr. Everett Sloane!).
