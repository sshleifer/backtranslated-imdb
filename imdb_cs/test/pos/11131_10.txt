I really hate musicals because the music numbers start from sudden and usually spoiled scenes, but this is completely different - it's just brilliant. The fence might not be a challenge for viewers, but the simplicity of people's life stories makes this movie great. I saw it at least ten times and I'm still not tired of plotting, characters or music (I just love the soundtrack - that's the only soundtrack I really wanted to have, and probably only the one I owe). <br /> <br /> For me, it is a necessity to see the kind of movie, great characters compiled with fun songs and a lot of things to think about after the movie.
