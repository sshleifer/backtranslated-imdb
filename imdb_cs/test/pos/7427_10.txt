This movie is a hidden gem. I don't understand why this film won't get more time. Errol and Eleanor Parker make a real attractive and lively couple. And their chemistry is perfect. I really liked the touch of his daughters on him as her Robin Hood. I highly recommend anyone with Errol Flynn. It's nice to see Errol playing his father. In all respects from his own children he was a very attentive and loving father in real life. The support cast is also great. You can't go wrong with the support of players like Hattie McDaniel and Lucile Watson. Hattie McDaniel makes a movie that's much better from go-go. This film has now become a holiday tradition in my house. Enjoy!!!
