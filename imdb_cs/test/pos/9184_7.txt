We haven't seen a movie in his commercial debut, we just caught it on DVD. Expecting the worst, "Hitch" has proven to be a pleasant experience because of the three principles in it. Thanks to Andy Tenant, the movie has an easy pace, and although it is predictable, the comedy has several winning moments. Hitch is a sort of "day coordinator" for losers like Albert, who is not exactly what a person would think. But Albert is a real man who would not go unnoticed by the same women he would like to take without any expert help. Enter Hitch, prepare him to overcome the obstacles he cannot overcome, and while Albert is overweight and never able to cope with social grace, he conquers us because he is real, in stark contrast to all the phonons that perform bikes. in Manhattan. The basic mistake most designers make is that when it comes to preparing sites for Hollywood movies, it's how it's in touch with reality. The apartments in which these characters are located are so rare that just for the magic of movies these people can live in places they like. Obviously, most filmmakers are engaged in fantasy because most of the city's population would kill them for such fabulous spaces as those who appear in the movies, let alone the same people who are shown in the movie. they could not afford. Will Smith is a charismatic actor. He has a disarming way of spell without doing much. However, the film's surprise is Kevin James, who as overweight Albert not only wins us, but also proves that he can stand in his scenes with Mr. Smith. Eva Mendez is fine as Hitch's main concern. In smaller roles, we also meet Adam Arkin, Amber Valletta, Michael Rappaport and Phillip Bosco. <br /> <br /> "Hitch" is a fun movie that you can watch with Andy Tenant's inspired direction.
