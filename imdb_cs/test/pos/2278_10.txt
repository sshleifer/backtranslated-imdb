You have to like baseball and you have to look a little like Tom Selleck, but if you meet these criteria, you should use this film thoroughly. Selleck plays a former major league star who finds himself in business with Japan when his career ends. A really well thought out and fascinating view of Japanese habits and behavior. Great supportive performances by Selleck's manager ("Japan's Clint Eastwood"), his friend Takanashi and his interpreter. The chemistry between Selleck and Takanashi works very well, it's really a very nice romantic movie unlike baseball. Before becoming a permanent shilling for Allstate, look at Haysbert. The film packs nicely. Easily in my best fifty all movies and maybe my favorite baseball.
