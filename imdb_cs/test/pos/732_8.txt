Geraldine S. Masters (excellent Annabelle Weenick). Among the colorful assortment of colorfully crazed patients are the insatiable, aggressive nymphomaniac Allyson King (delicious Betty Chandler), string judge Oliver W. Cameron (beautifully taunted Gene Ross), paranoid Vietnamese veteran sergeant Jaffee (played by Hugh Feagin), the gentle giant Sam (friendly William Bill McGhee) and hazel old deer Mrs. Callingham (absolutely irritating Rhea MacAdams). These patients are dangerously encouraged to act on their imagination. Masters, which obviously leads to a brutal murder rash. Director of S.F. Working from a thoughtful and well-thought-out Tim Pope scenario, Brownrigg carries out the professional work of creating and maintaining the choking booming and tense atmosphere of seething madness and oppressive claustrophobia. Robert Farrar's scary score, grimy set design, a couple of wild grisly murders, Bruce B. Alcott's eccentric no-frills movie, lots of deliciously robust, scenery-scarfing histrionics from the game's non-cast name (Ross in particular is a total eye-enduring hoot) and the utterly shocking surprise of the carnage adds to the overall infectious feeling of fun of this choice of a cruel piece of low-budget regional cinema that has been used for 70 years.
