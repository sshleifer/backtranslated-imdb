It's a great movie in many different ways ... perhaps the most important thing is that it represents the remarkable tragic story of Aung San Suu Kyi and her struggle for freedom and democracy. Beautiful gaming, beautiful cinematography, breathtaking action and tension: "Beyond Rangoon" has it all. I've seen this film several times over the last ten years and it always means more to me. Not everyone will like it (that is, a relatively low rating on IMDb), but because it is not a conventional Hollywood tanning; instead, it invites the viewer on several levels. I never followed him without wailing at the end and promising to live more meaningfully.
