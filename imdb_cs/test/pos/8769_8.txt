"The Saboteur" of Alfred Hitchcock (1942) (not to be confused with another Hitchcock movie, "Sabotage" made in 1936 which has a completely different plot) is not the Master of the greatest film of tension. The dose does not have the depth of "Vertiga" (1958) or the tense atmosphere of "Rebbec" (1940) and certainly has no dose of emotional impact and gaming talent that can be found in "Notorious" (1946), but what the dose has the excitement, adventure and peak nail biting . These two conductors are quite weak. It's easy to see why Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper for the role of Robert Cummings and Barbara Stanwyck as the role that Priscilla Lane took over. Also, the patriotic speeches Cuumming says (written by Dorothy Parker) are dated badly, and meeting a circus ensemble is poorly done (beard to bearded lady is obviously false). However, the last half hour is the edge-on-your spot of the site, the top on the top of Stature Freedom is very well done, and the film is a clear ancestor of "North Northwest" (1959). Two villains, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd are very good and the start of the fire in the aircraft factory is an excellent sequence. This is not the best Hitch made movie, but it's certainly one of his most fun.
