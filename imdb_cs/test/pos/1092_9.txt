I still remember watching Satia for the first time. I was completely blown away. Here was a movie that was very different from the other Gangster movies I saw. So realistic, so Mumbaiyya and so believable. Despite the "society" (which was a very good endeavor) and the "Vaastav" (more focused on the protagonist's journey) that came close, no underworld movie could live up to Satya. watching Ab Ab 56 for the first time, I told myself that "Indian cops now have their own" Satya. "Nietzsche's quote at the outset itself says it's not an ordinary movie. The meeting "at the beginning of the film is a relaxed way it is done. There is a cool and frightening feeling because you realize it is part of their routine. <br /> <br /> Ab Tak 56 is not a story of an honest cop or corrupt cop, but a cop who is ready to do what is needed to get rid of criminals when all legal means are exhausted, with simple shots and camera angles, director Shimit Amin can capture the essence of the characters and give a realistic and rude feeling to the film. The music is also impressive and scary and stays with you long after you have left the film room. ‚ÄùSandeep Srivastava did a great job as a writer dialogue If I start to familiarize myself with my favorite dialogues, I'm afraid I will end up transcribing the entire movie script. The film boasts some stellar performances. Yashpal Sharma is unbearable as Sub-Inspector Imtiaz Siddiqui and Jeeva is a joint commissioner of Suchak. Revathi, Hrishita Bhatt, Mohan Agashe and Kunal Vijaykar have small roles that play to perfection. Nakul Vaid as newcomer Jatin Shukla was a revelation. A scene where he must hesitantly shoot an injured gangster? Oh my god! He learns under the guidance of Sadhu Aghash and firmly believes in him. Prasad Purandhare as Zameer Zafar is impressive. His talks with Sadhu are real gems of dialogue writing. Never before has there been any such a beautiful relationship between a cop and a gangster in Indian cinema. a fan of a devotee. As an inspector of Sadhu Agash, Nana gives the show a lifetime and one of the best I've ever seen in Hindu film. From the way he talks to his expressions, from the way he taps his cigarette on the road, they drink tea? it's almost like Nana couldn't do anything wrong. It is the best place in every scene, especially when Jatina is teaching how police force works. His cool and complicated way to do things is sometimes scary. His dialogue and body language convinced me that he was one of the best actors in the country. It's a pity he won no popular awards for this. Shimit Amin, the last, but by no means the smallest, does a great job of combining all these talents and exploiting them. to come up with a modern masterpiece of Indian film. In an industry that is long used to telling stories, Amin takes the original script and revives it with beautiful treatment. I just hope he will continue to do great work and not give Bollywood-isation! If he can, I'm sure he'll be able to count in the coming years.
