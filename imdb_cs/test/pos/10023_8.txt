Felix watches the actor test his lines: "Ham, ham! My kingdom for ham sandwich!" A dramatic guy who tells Felix he will have to "sacrifice my art and go to the movies." He's in tears. Felix just looks at him as if he is a nut, and shrugs. The old man tells Felix to "go there" and find the money to fund a trip to Hollywood. Felix thinks, "How does he expect me to get the money?" Within minutes, of course (this is a cartoon), he notices a shoe owner who exhibits a "bankruptcy" sale on his market. store. Felix comes up with a plan to throw him out, and the man promises $ 500 if it works. Well, he does, but you want to go alone and leave Felix home. In the outrageous scene, Felix turns into a briefcase, and so he gets to Hollywood when he gets there and goes back to the cat. Then we witness Felix's attempts to get into show business. His auditioning scenes are very funny, especially his imitation of Charlie Chaplin. In addition, there are cartoons by some famous silent movie stars and executives. Overall, there is enough material in this 9.5-minute cartoon. It's amazing how much more you can earn in the next 2.5 minutes, provided most animated movies are seven minutes long. In any case, there were a few laughs and more zany things you can only see in the cartoon, like Felix has a duel of giant mosquito swords! Crazy things.
