I really enjoyed this movie. This has challenged my emotions and beliefs, so it is a true artwork in my book. The meeting was insurmountable. I would never look at this movie with anyone I couldn't cry, I don't think I would cry harder on all the movies, maybe because I look at me, I don't know. It is visible.
