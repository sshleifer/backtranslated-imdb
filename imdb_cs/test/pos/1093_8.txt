It is by far the most complete movie about the police force I have seen. Though not directed by Ram Gopal Varma, it has all elements of RGV film. Dead straight dialogues, blunt treatment of the subject, brilliant direction, and excellent performances (even those with little work to do in the movie). The chemistry between Nana and Don, even if they are professional rivals, is amazing. And so are small events, such as an insider who does not give Imtiaz information, even when he is thrown into a locker, but only to Nana when he is out. Changing working conditions with the change of seniors is solved beautifully. The first half is absolutely biased, moving like a documentary with Nana, who acts as a Jatina mentor and explains the complexity and philosophy of the work. cinema. Definitely not to be missed.
