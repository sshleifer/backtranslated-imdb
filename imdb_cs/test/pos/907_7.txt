This is one of L & H's abbreviations most often cited as the first "real" L&H teaming and perhaps one of their best quiet features. J. Piedmont Mumblethunder (Ollie) is a millionaire who came to the docks to greet his nephew Philip, whom he never saw. At first, Ollie laughs with everyone as this strange little man leaves and attracts great attention to himself as he behaves during a medical examination, but is somewhat humiliated when it turns out to be the guy he is supposed to be. greeting. He was told that Philip was a good boy, but he had one weakness - women. Mumblethunder and Philip went home, but their journey is continuously interrupted by Philip, who breaks into a little dance every time he sees a woman and then chases after a woman. Huge crowds gather every time it happens, not so much because they chase skirts, but because Philip also has a kilt. Finally, Mumblethunder manages to drag Philip into a tailor's shop to look at the right trousers, but Philip escapes from there to pursue other skirts. There's a lot of laughter all around. It's also nice to see a short one, because boys aren't exactly the characters we know and love. Ollie is largely his usual character, but it is a pleasure to see Stan acting differently than his usual human and child character. He shows that he was not a grim trick and excelled in other types of roles when he got a chance. With a running time of 19 minutes, it is short and sweet, providing classic inserts that still hold me in the stitch.
