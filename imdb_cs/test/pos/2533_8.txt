When it was released, in the early 1980s, Pixote brings Brazilian society the problems of young offenders, and the impact of this in Brazilian society. I can't watch the movie at that time because I was too young, but now I got a chance to watch it a few days ago. It's a very brutal movie, but everything is absolutely true and sad. pixote is the name of a 12-year-old boy who lives on the streets and survives with offenses; he remains while in the detention house, and when he left it, he continues to plan robes with other cakes and a prostitute, played by Marilia Pen. the boy is still addicted to marijuana and smells glue with other teenagers to forget his sad reality. Image quality is not the best, but the film is absolutely realistic about Brazilian issues and must be seen and admired.
