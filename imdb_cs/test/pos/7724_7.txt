There were approximately 60 different films and television games, in addition to the classic opera of this story about the sexual mad girl and her hapless lover soldier. This story has been done so many times, in different ways. Vicente Aranda directs Joaquin Jorda's adaptation to the Prosper Merimee & play classic. This is the story ONLY Bizet's Carmen opera <br /> <br /> Pas Vega is an exciting Carmen, full of passion and ability to manage simple men to do terrible tragic things. Leonardo Sbaraglio is an unfortunate soldier who is involved in the poisonous Carmen Web site and has led him to do bad things. Jay Benedict is the author of Prosper, who tells this story. There is not a lot of action, but there are some very hot sex scenes. In fact, it's almost an NC-17 movie. <br /> <br /> Because I've seen this story so often in so many I think I wasn't too overwhelmed. It is a very well made movie and will be of interest to those who may not know it. <br /> <br /> My overly excited review could also be that I miss the fantastic opera score Bizet . <br /> <br /> Look because you can like it more than I do. <br /> <br /> Rating *** (of 4) 82 points (of 100) IMDb 7 (of 10)
