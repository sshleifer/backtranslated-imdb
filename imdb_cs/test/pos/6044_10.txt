I went through the MCRD Parris Island boot camp in 1953 and this film is about the exact display of what shoes went through at that time, even after burying the bad. Many of the "actors" in the film were an active duty of the Marines. This movie may be more enjoyable for Marines than others, but I feel the movie itself is very good and Jack Webb has done a "good DI". Semper Fi!
