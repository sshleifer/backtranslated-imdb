After further thinking about this film, I find it too easy to reject it as a dream Boy. Actually, I got some spiritual power from Northfork ... Angels exist ... we are definitely talking about angels ... we don't even realize it most of the time ..... I really needed this film at the point of spiritual and emotional haze in my life. Yes, as I wrote before, it says so much ...... I can't wait to get to heaven ... <br /> <br /> "To be so sick of all the FX and Formula, I found it the movie as a real cinema, all I can say is that I have been touched in so many ways that I have sorted it all out, North Fork is an amazing movie that brings the viewer into and out of the gutter. pay attention because you will need to use the brain and the heart God has given you to follow the story, these are the people who speak most importantly, I want to see it a few more times so I can take it all! <br /> <br / > Industry has to study this film to realize that we exist. Br /> <br /> I thank all those involved in making this film. "
