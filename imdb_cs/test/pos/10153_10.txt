Am I the only person who believes this American version is much better than the 1934 English movie? The English version has no tension, looks antique and has a very low budget and has extraordinary behavior (except Peter Lorre). The 1956 version, in addition to high-end production values, shows James Stewart as the perfect "innocent" American abroad and gives Doris Day her best role at all. The peculiarity is music - the music of American film is almost classical; compare the "Albert Hall" sequences of both, and you agree that Bernard Herrmann's music is much more exciting than the original version (even if it's basically the same music!) The only mistake in the 1956 movie is the ridiculous encounter in the film I would appreciate any an argument that would prove to me that the English version is better.
