Multiply named and strangely occupied, "One Dark Night" aka "Mausoleum" is one of the better early horror movies. Original and quite raw, we briefly meet Adam West in this film about telekinesis and heads for teenagers. Meg Tilly dared to spend the night in the crypt of "The Sisters" high school gang hoppers in blue satin jackets. Initiation is interrupted by the recently buried body of a massive murderous wizard named "Raymar". Surprisingly amazing makeup and spooky effects paint this cooling film in style and bring a heartbreaking peak.
