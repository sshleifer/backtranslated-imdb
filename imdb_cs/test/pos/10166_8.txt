"The Man Who knew Too Much" (1955) is Alfred Hitchcock's own remake of his 1934 thriller about a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) on a holiday in Morocco where they were imprisoned in a nightmare that involves murder, espionage, assassinations. and the worst of all, the kidnapping of their 10-year-old son. The film Hitchcock himself considered superior to the original is great fun. Stewart and Day have good chemistry. The film is full of wonderful comic scenes and dialogues as well as chill tensions. The inclusion of "Que Sera, Sera" has proven to be a brilliant move, as the song rarely matches content and plays such an important role in the film as "Que Sera, Sera". Hitchcock also admires us to live music played by Arthur Benjamin "Storm Cloud Cantata" for nearly ten minutes while the scene at London's Royal Albert Hall where an assassination of a very important policy has taken place, it is taking place, and both the scene and the cantata are simply amazing.
