And she really was beautiful (Laraine Day, that is) - herself, her part and her performance. An engaging story of selfish vs. of selfless love, same man, rich heart and dipsomaniac Robert Cummings. One of his bouts of inebriation leads to an incident that infuriates the local community and tests the confusion of two sisters (Jean Muir and Laraine Day) that are close to him (and to each other). Their comfortable and somewhat superficial environment is ended because both girls confront the subsequent crisis and respond to its contradictory demands for caution, integrity, loyalty and love with the consequences that are very different for each of them. With abandoned old vanities and beauties, their real characters are revealed in fascinating contrast. Beautiful Discovery on TCM!
