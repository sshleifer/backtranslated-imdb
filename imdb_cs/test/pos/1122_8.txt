This is a decent effort for B-Movie Martial Arts. Ian Jacklin, a former North American Kickboxing champion, is at the forefront of action scenes. Muscular Matthias Hues gets a chance to add more to his badman persona martial art in this movie than in all his many others, and if you're a fan of The Teutonic Titan, rent this movie now! Renee Griffin is also remarkable as a romantic interest in this film. It starts with an attitude, but soon warms up to the hero and in a stylish fashion they make a "two-backed animal". The fighting scenes are good in American tradition (NO Hong Kong acrobatics here!) with added realism from Benny "The Jet" Urquidez playing himself as John Larson's coach (Jacklin). Overall, this movie seems to have more sub-plots than most of its genres, so get more story.
