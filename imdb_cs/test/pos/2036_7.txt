ROCK STAR / (2001) *** (from four) Blake French: <br /> <br /> "Rock Star" is the story of no one who becomes scornful to realize that his dream is not what he imagined. We've seen it all before (in better movies), but this human story captures the world of rock and roll with a brutally honest and sharp edge. It gets recommendations for its visualization of the atmosphere. John Stockwell's "Crazy / Beautiful" scenario portrays a tough universe with unforgettable images - he doesn't explain what it is about, it shows us. "Rock Star," originally called "Metal God," star Mark Wahlberg as Chris "Izzy" Cole, a Pittsburgh office retailer who dreams of becoming Bobby Beers, a fiery lead singer for heavy metal rock band, steel dragon. Although Chris is already singing for his own rock band called Blood Pollution, instead of writing his own songs, he insists on performing only in those steel kite, and only in the exact way they do it. His group is irritated by Chris's obsessions and gives him a shoe. This devastates Chris, as well as his supportive parents and loyal friend Emily (Jennifer Aniston of the TV Friends). Then he receives a phone call. It's the Steel Dragon band. They saw Chris's tapes and wanted him to replace the recently fired lead singer. He plunges into the dizzying world of sudden glory for a while - from the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star. Unfortunately, it's not as beneficial as he expected. <br /> <br /> The real story inspired the concept of "Rock Star". The reseller of Ohio, Tim "Ripper" Owens, really replaced Rob Halford, lead singer in Judas Priest, after initially singing for the band. The rest of the film is probably fiction, though most what happens must represent the experiences of many other bands. The film describes in detail the various agony of a rock star. It explores aspects of the tour, differences in personality, the dangers of drug abuse and violence, fighting relationships, sexual freedom, dishonesty, and extreme actions by all manufacturers to please fans and keep their popularity high. I've seen all of Mark Wahlberg's films, and that's the first to get affection. Wahlberg, a former singer / model, made films like "Fear", "Boogie Nights" "Three Kings", and recently Tim Burton lacks a remake of "Planet of the Apes". I'm getting more and more admired by the young actor. Although he did not perform in many successful films, many chances were given to him and made a number of roles. "Rock Star" is his best film to date. I can't think of many actors who could convincingly portray Chris Cole's struggles and desires. Wahlberg really makes a rock star. Jennifer Aniston also lights up the screen. He creates a chemistry-based relationship with Chris that builds on audience participation. It is tragic what happens to their relationship. We take great care of these characters. During the film concert scenes, director Stephen Herek (who also directed "The Holy Man" and the live action version "101 Dalmatians") creates a pleasant atmosphere. It captures scenes with intense urgency and raw, unmistakable energy. Music numbers provide the film the best, most involving scenes. Unfortunately, Herek can't keep her energy and taste. The three-quarter mark loses sparkle as the film becomes boring and unpleasant. I understand where the story has to go to show the negative side of fame, but this film loses everything that went before it. In the "Almost Famous", much better rock and roll movie, there is a certain amount of interest and life in even the most terrifying scenes. Here they feel as if the creators have lost their passion. The message comes a little late and suddenly in the story. The film turns into a moral story that wants to offer us a sad goal. Filmmakers can also stop everything, appear on the screen and say, "Now the audience, the moral story is?" We understand the subject, but it's too immediate. The personal discovery for Chris must be gradual. Fortunately, all this is happening in the last twenty-five minutes of the film, barely enough to completely destroy eighty-five minutes of reasonably good feature. "Rock Star" is not a great movie - see "Almost Famous" if you want a remarkable film about rock and roll, but for Mark Mark, it's a turning point in his career. <br /> <br />
