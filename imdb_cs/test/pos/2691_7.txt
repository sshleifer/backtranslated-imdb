I recently started watching this show in syndication and find it a bit hit and miss. Some episodes are stupid - Doug is angry with some trivial / juvenile thing and acts silly etc. <br /> <br /> Still, others are quite entertaining and sometimes touching. These include episodes that face the complexity of characters. For example, a "youthful overweight friendly guy marries a sexy woman" theme is found in several sitcoms. (Carrie also has something about her, she looks wise. It's not just running a sexy sexy girl.) But Carrie has the advantage - she can be pretty in her eyes, but she has too many personality traits that are not too far apart from her father. And she easily admits to it - for example, one episode revolves in her lack of desire to be nice to coworkers. Personally, I found her sexy, but you have to be the right person to live with. Amiable Doug is a good match. And deeply, I also like to see simple things. Maybe not as much as Doug, whose nirvana is watching TV and eating a big snack next to his big screen, but no gal culture. This lack of too sensitive a party is one of the reasons why children do not have children. Of course, the simple pleasure of a guy is nothing that one can sneer at and add magic to the show. They live in Queens as an ordinary working class - realistic in this sense. And overall, fun and enjoyable sitcom, esp. if you just want to relax. In the end, he's a little tired, so it's probably good to end. It had a good run. See also Becker.
