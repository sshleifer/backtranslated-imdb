The best thing to say about the movie "Transportation" is that it brought attention to the excellent British mini-series "Traffik". As many people have noticed, the current film suffers from a shortening of the story to accommodate the short range of cinematographs and the time when theater owners turned to measure the success of the film with overpriced food sales. First I recorded this mini series in 1990, when it was released on Public TV and I watched it many times. The whole series of documentary styles has a strong element of tragedy and destruction, as characters move towards their eventual fate. The strongest of these three stories is the Pakistani family, who was forced into the city to find a way to keep the body and soul together after the poppy crop is burned by the military in the staging power deployed to Western politicians. Family harassment is similar to that of the "City of Joy" rickshaw family. Finally, the farmer finds a job, but compromises his pride and honesty. Pakistan's film segment is of particular importance for today, fighting Al Qaeda supporters and giving some understanding. supporting these movements among disadvantaged poor people in Pakistan and Afghanistan, who rarely receive money in these countries. The film shows that farmers see barely 25% of the support that should encourage them to grow other crops. With the American inability to see anything other than black and white - good guys v. bad guys - it is interesting to see another view where there is no black and white, only shades of gray. <br /> <br /> Spoiler forward. The only problem I had with the story was that, rather than the things that went on as it used to be, as if it were in real life, it was a work of fiction that had to be wrapped up with "bad guys" who got it what came to them. Otherwise, it was a great job of the kind we see too rarely. The cast was excellent and the German and Pakistani placement helped the film "another" feeling (what a change it made to see the Germans as something other than villains in a film from World War II).
