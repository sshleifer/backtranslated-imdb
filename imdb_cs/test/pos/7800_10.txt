This is my favorite Indian movie of all time. He's a comic genius. Salman Khan is cheerful. But Amir Khan steals the show with his witty dialogue. Karismus Kapoor's clothing tells its own story - wondering if the stylist deliberately let her wear some clothes just to make the film fun (in one place she is wearing a diaper). Andaz Apna Apna is the only genre of comedy genre that made me laugh from start to finish. There is no one boring moment, every scene is cheerful, even songs and dance moves will make you laugh in the stitches. Above all, I loved the scene in which Amar (Amir Khan) "gets his memory". I've seen this movie so many times that I've lost count. And I'm so glad this time Bollywood can take all the credit for this fantastic movie, as far as I know A.A. And it's not a replica of the Hollywood movie (THANK GOD). Overall, I recommend this film to anyone who understands Hindi / Urdu and loves good comedy. <br /> <br /> Watch how you love it !!!!!
