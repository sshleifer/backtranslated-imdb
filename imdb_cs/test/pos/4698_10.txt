As stated and stated in many previous comments, this unique series has many excellent features and ingredients to its credit. More than 20 years after he was originally handed over, he is still being watched and watched and has a huge global fan, something that must mean that the creators of the series have undoubtedly gotten something right. The root of the series's brilliance and remarkable attraction, however, must be that it rests on beautifully written dialogue and timeless characters? they are all animated by amazing actors. The characters are especially beautiful because of their complexity. Unlike many other modifications of Robin Hood, and indeed many other film and television productions in general, good guys in this series often make mistakes and can be seen to have obvious flaws, while baddies, although featured as evil and ruthless, often they can understand and even sometimes seem quite sympathetic. This makes Robin Sherwood a story about the multilateral, REAL people? rather than good and bad people? something that greatly contributes to its uniqueness and remarkable attraction. Also, though very much being an action series featuring numerous amazing bits (which are notable in themselves seeing how this was done long before today's computer animation, green screens, and so on. So, beyond each of those endless boys who fall castle Walls, horses and fires, actually there is a real person who at some point falls from a castle wall or horse or fire), there is always an amazing dialogue going on between the different characters in each episode. But in the final analysis, is it generally baddies of the series? Nickolas Grace as Sheriff of Nottingham, Robert Addie as Sir Guy of Gisburne and Philip Jackson as Abbot of Hugo de Rainault ??? who gets the best lines and who more than often steals the show with their arguments full of wit and cant. "It's a wedding, not a celebration!" It's just one of their many timeless "pearls of wisdom" that seem to follow life :-). 20 years after the fact, is it really hard to believe that Robin Sherwood was originally made for television? and probably not with a lot of money? in order to provide volatile Saturday afternoon entertainment for small children in the UK. Filmed in beautiful places, with smart, amazing scripts and featuring remarkable stunts and fantastic actors? Many of them give the performance of their lives in this show? This in many ways seems to be more professionally made and has more production value than many Hollywood movies.
