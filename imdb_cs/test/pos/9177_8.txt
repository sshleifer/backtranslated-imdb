- It is hard to find fast food in this society in which we live, so a man named Hitch is obliged to help people find love for women who are beyond love. His rules are that he will only help you find love and not just some casual sex that looks like a lot, but soon the word will begin to spread and people will start to get a bad idea of ​​what they are doing, which begins to complicate the relationship with the woman they just met that he is madly in love with. - I must say it's really nice to see Will Smith in a movie that doesn't make him save the world from aliens or robots. There are no jaw effects, nor is your body showing off. He's just a normal guy in this movie that was really nice. He doesn't necessarily have to stretch his acting muscles in this movie, but then the story doesn't say it, but it was still nice to see him relaxed and not showing his torn body to be jealous of us without six packs. His character here, like all his characters, is likable, funny and charming, something that almost all characters in this strange love story seem to share. Kevin James's character is just an ordinary man who needs help playing with the girl of his dreams, making you feel for a guy and a root for him every step of the way. the only character that was a painful place for me was the character of Mendez because he was so cold and calculated that it was hard to believe that Smith could fall for her. They must love the challenge I think. <br /> <br /> -This is part of the review in which I will be joking about how I would never need Hitch because I am such a player, but I just got over writing about 16 reviews for other websites and I'm still working on a small project so I'm a little tired right now. While the film is packed with ample charm and sympathetic characters with funny lines, it slowly but surely falls into the sea of ​​formal romantic movies, where everyone is forgiven after a great scene, a terrible mystery, and even better than before. But hey, there are 4,000 films about a loser who overcomes adversity, so I think one more movie with a predictable ending that has been done almost to death won't do much damage. I really like the movie, because in the end you don't need a formula to get the right girl, just be yourself and everyone gets into the game that is the subject of the movie and why it works so well. I'm sure if the character of James turned out to be a girl after everything Smith's character said, then it would be a pretty empty movie, but how it works to work really well. <br /> <br /> -This is PERFECT movie date. It's sweet, it's funny, and it's romantic, so anyone looking at this movie on a date should get it after it's over. and some I mean sex
