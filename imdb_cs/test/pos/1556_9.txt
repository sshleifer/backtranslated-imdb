I gave it 9 stars out of possible 10. If I had just teensy weensy a little more plot line I'd put it 10. <br /> <br /> However, it's a very interesting movie. Judith Ivey, playing a sympathetic old floozie, should get an Oscar for her performance. Emily Grace (portrayed by Alice), who I've never seen, also does a great job and has the most sexy body I've ever seen on film. <br /> <br /> In the rhythm of an old car, Alice radiates from them. For Florida, where he has a friend (or maybe it's her sister, I'm not sure, and that's my fault, not a movie) and high hopes of going to college that she and her family really can't afford. Br /> <br /> It seems to be somewhat vulnerable to the road on its own, and will surely meet some slightly-looking characters and find out soon that there is a hole in one of the tires. At that time she is calm and assisted by a woman named Sandra and her husband Bill, an older couple traveling in RV. They go south, to Florida and take it under their wing, but are they all as they present themselves? Footage and paranoia enter the story when our young heroine learns about new life lessons.
