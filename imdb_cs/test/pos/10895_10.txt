Quite simply, Goldeneye is the biggest N64 game ever. Learning curve is just about perfect condition and you will still play with friends of the month, because multiplayer mode is nothing special. <br /> <br /> The system for obtaining fraud once requires some degree of skill, rather than just knowing which buttons to press, and the Aztec challenge at agent 00 is overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Total in all - it's the best game I've ever played on N64
