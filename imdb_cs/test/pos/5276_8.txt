Well, if this movie was made much later in the history of cinema, it wouldn't be particularly useful. However, in 1898, the films were in their childhood and they were almost all somewhat boring and had no real story to say - instead just showing normal everyday people doing daily activities. If it is visible today, almost all of them are hopelessly boring and very, very short - often less than one minute! So in the light of this short movie clip, it is quite swollen and can only make you laugh. Two boys, a miller and a chimney sweep hurl themselves - falling and throwing flour and coal dust as they diverge. That's all - the movie is over before you know it.
