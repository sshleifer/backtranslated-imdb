I would like to point out these excellent points in favor of this movie: <br /> <br /> # 1 Angelina Jolie Sex Scene <br /> <br /> # 2 Foley Artist Overcame Himself <br /> <br /> # 3 The fence was quite strong <br /> <br /> # 4 DVD contains trailers and chapters stops <br /> <br /> # 5 No animals were damaged in making the movie <br /> <br /> # 6 homages to blade runner over movie <br /> <br /> # 7 burning trash can <br /> <br /> # 8 funny man without feet <br /> <br /> # 9 Jack Palance's voice has added a real dynamic to the movie. <br /> <br /> # 10 Sage advises, for example, "When you eat with the devil to bring a long spoon". # 11 Angelina Jolie was only 18! To sum up, it was an evening of fun.
