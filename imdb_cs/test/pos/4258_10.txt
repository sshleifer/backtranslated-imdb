Made at the height of Black Power, this film depicts African-American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson), who became CEO of the corporation after White CEO died (white managers hate each other and can't decide who should succeed) . Once in power, he decides to make her a militant organization. I don't know how Robert Downey Sr. did it, but he did it! "Putney Swope" is the ultimate blow to the American power structure. Looks like it looks like Richard Pryor's mind. This is a comedy classic in every sense of the word. A real masterpiece. Hilarious.
