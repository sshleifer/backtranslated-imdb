The work of love. Every frame is perfect and catches you. Then the complete emotion and storytelling will guide you through a dream that will stay with you long after the film. The director gets your heart and leads him over 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are part of the emotional ride of the characters. I saw this film at 2 festivals and I got into permanent ovation at every show. The remarkable storytelling goes beyond nationality and language, and I felt that I was part of a drama that unfolds before me. Casting is as perfect as you can. Vijay Raaz, Camille and Benoit have their own. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates a good movie theater. I can't wait for the commercial release of this movie.
