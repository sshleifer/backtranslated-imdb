Thirty pieces of silver and kiss for happiness. This one was another totally unexpected gem. I am usually not a fan of tension / thriller. This satisfying 100 minutes has more twists than a wooden pretzel. It has a titilating erotic romance, reminiscent of "body heat" in more ways than one; has cops and crime; political intrigue and just a dash of daily soap. It is the right touch of courageous violence that must employ any professional criminal job. Emma Thompson, (FBI AIC), gives her role with grace and humor, and gets my voice for Limey's best false southern accent. Alan Rickman, a local cop who always steals the show, is excellent, but not exaggerated. They work well as a couple. Plenty of conspiracy conspiracies that never go out of control and reunite at the end of the movie. And who is this amazing woman, Carl Gugino? I want her to carry my children. Carlo, if you're out there, let's have lunch
