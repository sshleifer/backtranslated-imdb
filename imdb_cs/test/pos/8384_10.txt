That's what I thought when I heard about the Inglorious Basterds cast. And I'm from Germany to movies. The guy is over 50 years old, and so far he has played almost on average TV shows - and he hasn't played major parts there. Obviously no one noticed what he was capable of. Thanks to QT, now he has one chance to change - and - let's just say it was bingo! She is a living proof of what a great colleague Tarrantino is. By the way: I think it's a great privilege to watch a movie like a German who is able to understand everything. And the German dialogue is written almost as well as English. Now I could repeat what many others have written here. In short: QT is back.
