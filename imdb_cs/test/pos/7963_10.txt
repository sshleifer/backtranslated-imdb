How often do we live our romantic life on a big screen, with heavy issues and passionate encounters? Almost never, if what I see as normal life around me is something he would judge. Novels, as previously mentioned, are hardly ever earthquake issues that will leave you on top of the world, or dough and bruised wounds. Romance, in its day-to-day way of living a million times around, is a slow, gentle and silent affair. Something that grows in you, so slowly, probably without noticing that it is slowly taking over your being. Nobody can tell me when I'm in love. For if someone did, I wouldn't believe him because no one would know me. And then it is just a feeling, a certain knowledge that you feel this noble emotion. That you want nothing but the best that you never want to see is suffering from a moment of sadness. That you are willing to take a great deal of pain for them. I would not go so far as to say that I am willing to die for my beloved person because we are all humans, and we do not know what we are able to face in the face of death until it is upon us. Is the love between the main characters of the film, always so subtle and undervalued, no less noble than the love between the Roma and Juliet? Unstable emotions, unspoken feelings, communicate much more than the repeated cries of "I love you". The limitations of the main actor, who was constantly appearing in the scene, watching his love interest through the cafe window, but never moved to learn about it, were simply heartbreaking to watch. Most of us would be unselfish to remain hidden, knowing that her emotions and feelings could not be reciprocated? For another comment, how do I deal with my own certain death? Although I can say that I was seriously ill, I cannot say in all honesty that I have ever come close to death. Will I be so calm that all my affairs are fine, and I have instructed others to accept what I left behind? I suspect I will be calm, because I will not have a choice in this matter. Can I be so selfless? The answer will have to be negative. I can put myself in anxiety because I know that your life is forfeited, that fate has made you a mortal blow, and that future events, few of them, are no longer under your control. Life is nothing but a series of small events whose climax may seem great for some in retrospective. But very rarely.
