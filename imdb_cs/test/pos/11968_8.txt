When I went to see this documentary about the musicals of the communist blocs, I was expecting something absolutely demented, in the spirit of the communist "Cop Rock". Some scenes have brought, including a nasty clip from a Soviet film called "Tractor Drivers". You would think that filmmakers have the task of creating ideologically correct musicals that sing, dance and perform at a party. face unbeatable odds. And yet, one of the surprises of "East Side Story" is that some of the films presented seemed promising. One was the mid-1950s East German endeavor called "My Wife Wants to Sing," in which, as the name implies, the unhappy Hausfrau seeks to initiate a singing career despite the objections of her traditionally-minded husband. Br /> Another really interesting film, also from East Germany, was called "Midnight Revue". In this film-in-film, producers spoof their own creative situation with the story of a group of filmmakers under Party Commands making a musical. (On-screen filmmakers themselves make a musical number about avoiding "too hot" items very reminiscent of the 1957 tone of "Silk Stockings.") still a lot of fun to watch. (See the final dedication to the person who made it all possible.)
