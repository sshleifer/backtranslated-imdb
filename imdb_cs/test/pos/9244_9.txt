I found that it was a fun description of the problems an independent filmmaker might encounter (something I never thought about). The film kept my interest all the time and I laughed loudly more than once! I'm not a filmmaker, so I don't know anything about technology, but even though it was well edited and fluently told the story. As a disclaimer, I contributed to this effort after I provided music for the soundtrack, but I wasn't involved in making this movie and I couldn't tell you anything about the Repo Manu, except I remember seeing it back when i am (i'm not really a science fiction fiend). I liked the comparison of the movie from the creation of punk rock files with punk rock music. My wife went with me to see the movie and didn't know anything about it and we had a great time.
