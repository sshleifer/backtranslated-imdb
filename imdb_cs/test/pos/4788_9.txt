I saw it when I was twelve. It was a movie that made me understand what a good secret was. I have read the entire Happy Hollisters Child Secrets series and have been about the family of children who have always had a man. But we readers couldn't solve the mystery along with them. This movie showed me that a good secret is what makes the viewer / reader, in the end, say, "OH !!!!! COURSE !!!!!!!"
