I would say it is a very pleasant and somewhat moving film despite its shortcomings. I didn't believe for a minute that Matthau knew he was the first dentist. Hawn's character seemed to recover quite quickly from suicidal depression at the beginning of the film. Not to mention that the whole thing seemed ridiculous. However, the film succeeded because of its good pace, humor and its stars. Maybe Matthau wasn't a dentist, but he was as fun as usual. Bergman brought a great deal of sensitivity to the film (especially during the scene where he and Matthau went for a drink after work) and also a lot of humor. I believe it was her performance that made my brother noticing this movie after hearing a few scenes. Hawn's performance is remarkable, though Oscar may have been a little more. Basically don't take this movie too seriously and you will have fun.
