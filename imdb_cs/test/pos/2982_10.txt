Michelle, Anic√©e Alvin, was so pretty and I fell in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best movie of my youth. "Seasonal reprise" of Elton and his arranger Paul Buckmaster sings in my head forever ... Please, if you know where I can find a VHS movie, send me !! My husband 26 years and I saw it as Juniors in HS. Yes, then he was my friend and still is. I think we both closed our eyes. I think we may have been drawn into the movie by Elton John's music, but then we were swept away from it all. Paul and Michelle were just about our ages when we saw the movie - so easy to identify with !! It's amazing to hear that Sean is doing well, I'm also in "helping professions" (RN). I thought his performance was good and very believable. "Michelle" came as very sweet, fragile and vulnerable. I think the main issue is that if they didn't have to deal with the "real world" they could be happy and be in love. How many times we all just wanted to have "Calgon's moment". If we had no external concerns and could cope with our "basic needs", it could be a little easier. I have a 15 year old daughter and wouldn't have a problem with her seeing this movie. Children see so much worse these days that it's very tame. For those of you who are trying to find a CD my husband (huge fan of Elton John) was able to get a 2-CD set that came out in 1992. This is called, "Elton John-Rare Masters" Polygram Studio. It has all the friends of the song as well as many others. As far as we know, it's the only "Friends" CD with music. We also had LP years ago and were excited to find a CD. Good luck. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves the theme "young love". I just wish it was on DVD now!
