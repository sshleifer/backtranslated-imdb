Where to start, I like a scary snow monster named Jack Frost. The whole concept works well for me, we thought he would come back and he was. Changing local to tropical resort works. Seeing old friends and meeting new characters. Scott MacDonald does a great job like Jack Frost, you can tell when an actor enjoys playing a villain, you can see, or in this case, hear in the show. Yeah, Jack Frost 2 is a welcome sequel that's better than the first. I have one complaint, little Jacks or Jacklings as I call them. They looked like hand puppets. I think they could do a better job with the Jackling, the mouth could be wider, but the CGI was good and the movie was worth watching again and again. If you like JACK FROST, then you will enjoy this sequel. No questions or debate, 9 BIG STARS.
