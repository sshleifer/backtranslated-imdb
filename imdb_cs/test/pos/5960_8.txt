This is probably one of the best French movies I've seen in a very long time! This "pastiche" or parody of spy movies is very well done and will make you laugh from start to finish. Some references to today's world are very subtle. The entire Moroccan context of film is to be understood in the light of today's French culture / environment. This means that all jokes and - seemingly - shocking comments that could be understood as such are allowed and accepted because it is a parody. <br /> <br /> My sisters who have seen this movie have told me that I should go too and make sure I have a great time and I really had! If you like old 007 movies with Sean Connery and also like movies like Airplane or Hot Shots, you'll be pleased. I just hope this movie will be released on DVD in the USA ... Wait and see.
