Wow, this summer I certainly saw enough Kelli McCarty. I didn't know the woman had done so many erotic movies in the last three years. It's like seeing a future softcore star flower in front of me, just like Michelle Hall a few years ago. "Passion's Peak" is the third quality movie I've seen of Kelli McCarty in, with "Girl for Girl" and "House of Love" being the rest. "Desire and illusion" was fine, but it was not spectacular. There is spoilers in this review, so read only if you want. The story begins with Christina (Kelli McCarty) heading from the city to the mountains. She inherited the house from her dear grandmother and plans to make her a mountain hut. Before she can reach down, some woman named Kim (unrecognized but totally aggressive in this movie) will start to book guests to stay there. Now he must quickly get the house into shape - Chip (Bobby Johnston), a childhood friend, comes to rescue. Chip helps her get the house to work. She hires two local slackers to work in her box - Chip's sister Bait (Samantha McConnell) and her sex buddy Hank. <br /> <br /> Now the guests are coming. First arrives Eric and Linda (Flower), two stereotyped lawyers first. Linda and Eric get into a huge argument during the evening in the middle of the movie that leads to their break-up; sad things. Next, there is a romance novelist Sophia, played by B-Goddess movie Monique's parents. Again he uses the stupid alias Scarlet Johansing and this time he has a very professional look - of course with blond hair. It wouldn't be Monique if she didn't have at least one scene to play with herself - and she commits herself during one of Eric and Linda's sex scenes. James and Shene (Devinn Lane) also appears on a small weekend getaway. Shene, James and Christina have nothing in common. So far, James and Christina have used it, but Christina has turned it off to go to this hut. James comes to the cottage to take Christina back, but his plan is moving away. Christina spills the beans into Shene, causing Shene to go to him and down to the local bar to get rid of the locals. Shene ends up in Erica's sleeping bag and leaves together. Bait realizes he wants something more than just having sex with Hank, and Christine finds a real love with Chip, where Sophia dipped her and wrote in her next novel. In fact... if you ask me, this whole film was like a novel. I don't know if the scriptwriter went for the effect, but I'm sure I'm impressed. Sophia had some of the best lines in this movie, playing on the idea of ​​being a live action novel. It seems to be enjoying all the fighting and backstabbing going on. <br /> <br /> Now for sex. There was enough, and it was the usual bump-and-grind. Monique made her fair share of moans in her two sex scenes. This film was tape, and the story will actually keep the audience somewhat interested in sexual scenes. Women: A- (Monique was just Monique. Of all the softcore actresses I have seen through in my opinion, it's the best of acting, can act and be sexy, which is why she keeps on position 1 in my Skinemax Top 10. Kelli McCarty is better off doing softcore movies than she's on the soap opera "Passion", I don't know why she didn't do more of them. Flower was the only background scenery for most in a limited role. Samantha McConnell still impressed on me, and Devinn Lane is another hardcore actress crossing Go to softcore realm and do a decent job on it.) <br /> <br /> Gender: B (It was good but not amazing.) Lots of moans. version, believe me .... most of the good stuff is out of my grade. My class is for an uncut version.) Story: B (A solid story they throw in "Ooh, building inspector closes us down" to run to the end that messes things up. A basic story between Christina and James was a nice and Sophia dialogue, full of metaphors and images usually found in novel novels, was a pleasant touch.) <br /> <br /> Overall: B + (I found this movie to be not sure Erotic Hall-Of -Famer as "Girl for Girl" is, but it's a decent addition to the Skinemax collection.
