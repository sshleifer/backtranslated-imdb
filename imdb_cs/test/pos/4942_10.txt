This game was one of the main reasons I actually got PS2. I remember playing Soul Edge (sometimes called Soul Blade) back that day and being addicted to it. <br /> <br /> I played the original Soul Calibur, but I never got a chance to play it for a huge amount. time. But I bought a version of Soul Calibur II from Gamecube and that was what really caught me on the show and I was excited to hear about Seoul Calibur III. This game still gives us classic characters like Mitsurugi, Cervantes, Nightmare and Taki. However, it also adds several new characters like Zasalamel, Tira and the unplayable Night Terror. A strategy based on "Chronicles of the Sword" is a new feature I like, it can be quite challenging in later chronicles, but it's a good addition to the series. Soul Arena has several missions in which you have to fight a certain enemy under certain circumstances. (The exception is "Final Battle" in which you just have to beat Night Terror.) It's another gentle touch that makes the game all the fun. <br /> <br /> In some scenes in Stories you should be pressing some buttons to get a different result, it may be in order to avoid / block an attack or get a better end. (Each character has two ends) All in all, this is a great game and I would recommend it if you are a fan of fighting games.
