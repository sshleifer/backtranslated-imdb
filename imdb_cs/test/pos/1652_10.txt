Fantastic movie! One of the best noir movies ever made. Bad guys, bad girls, precious robbery, twisted morality, kidnapping, everything's here. Jean Servais has a face that would make Bogart proud, and the rest of the cast is full of character actors who seem to know they're good at something. Get some popcorn and have a great time.
