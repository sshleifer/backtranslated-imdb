There are only a few movies that can be called `must see 'and SHEPHERED is one of those movies. In many ways it was a while ago (and you can say that it was a source of inspiration for several well-known films) A copy of many that equals none is really one great movie. The story is complicated, but it develops as a tense but often entertaining thriller and a highly thought-provoking exploration of the nature of mankind. The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where people have to live underground and chaos exists. C. Thomas Howell is a "shepherd" who protects the people for various religious leaders by killing all ineligible members of society. The whole thought was thinking about our company. It's really brilliant social commentary, which is more than I can say for some recent sci-fi / action blockbusters. MATRIX RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS made no sense of any real innovation, just dull effects of video games. But the SHEPHERD score on the action scale too ... <br /> <br /> Once again, this movie let the viewer catch his breath. Peter Hayman proves that he is one of the few brilliant directors. We're talking 100%, high quality, home kung fu fighting! It was excellent. Really good special effects, shooters, bleak futuristic cyber-punk noir style? the film has its own elements. <br /> <br /> When we talk about SHEPHERD, it's impossible not to mention what style it is. The vision of this city is really overwhelming. It resembles paintings by Tim Burton's very unforgettable vision of Gotham in BATMAN. And these sights are photographed by Graeme Mears with a skill level that puts Gordon Willis and Conrad Hall in shame. Even special effects have proved amazing. Undoubtedly, the scenes in which they are fought are monuments in all film fields. This film is a ballet of stunning visuals. On the basis of everything, however, is an interesting story, which is led by a strong cast. Acting (especially Rowdy Piper) and conspiracy are great and well directed. Unlike many futuristic films made with strong artificial flavor, characters are believable and dialogue is natural and full of wit. I'm always proud to see a great movie like SHEPHERD. It's a shame that she didn't get a good distribution and did nothing in the box office. It's a rarity worth looking for. This film will impress you and make you feel 10 times cooler to see it!
