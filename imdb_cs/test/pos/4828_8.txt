This work is quite atmospheric, with a few surprises a few really scary elements. I found out that this work is more rewarding than I expected, given that lenient reviews have been given here on IMDb. The dialogue comes as natural and honest (considering the circumstances), even if the overall course of the film goes from predictable to cliché, when heroines fall when they run, and explore strange noises when they lock doors. Typical horror fare. Local characters are some of the worst clichés that portray Appalachian natives as in-bred developmentally armed freaks. The characters of children and principles are GREAT! The development is adequate and Scout Taylor-Compton seems to be developing his talent pretty well. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not going to say it's totally original or the best thing from sliced ​​bread (It's not that great anyway), but this is interesting and I haven't been back for 107 minutes. I wouldn't say it's an amazing movie in any way, but there are some really good horror elements. However, there are some really slow places where story / character development seems superfluous to the whims of the director (or film editor). All in all, it's good for a rainy night, but not so good for viewing on Friday / Saturday night. <br /> <br /> Price for 7.6 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
