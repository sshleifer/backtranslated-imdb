I wasn't expecting much from this movie, it was just one of those movies I thought I was watching because it was on TV. I certainly underestimated this film. It's a guy who kills his girlfriend and boasts of his friends. I was very satisfied with acting, the characters played well. It was a particularly big scene where Feck (Dennis Hopper) and John (Daniel Roebuck) talk about why John killed Jamie. It's annoying to hear how he explains that he wants to feel control and that's why. But Feck loved the girl he killed. Feck felt remorse, while John felt nothing, the hell he was proud of what he did. You really think of people. Keanu Reeves did a great job like Matt and Ione Skye was good. It's weird to see her as a valedictorian in 'Say Anything' and eat like Clarissa. Every actor did great on ...... It was great to change. It was a great movie and I would definitely recommend it.
