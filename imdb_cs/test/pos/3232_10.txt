The film is beyond expectations, an excellent insight into the human condition. What exactly controls Mila to paint her ass. What could push a man so far that there is only a way to escape is to have a back passage repeatedly painted by strangers. <br /> <br /> This film is not afraid to stand at the right angle of the face. Simply breathtaking. Hit the sequel or anything that comes from the genius who did it.
