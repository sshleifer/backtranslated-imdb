A story of love and hate, tragedy and happiness, and above all a friendship that takes place in a very interesting time of the American Civil War. <br /> <br /> You'll be interested in history, get you emotionally and make you feverishly wait for the next episode. <br /> <br /> In addition, casting was wonderful. Many superstars appear in short portraits, a large number of talented mimes play the lead roles - Kirstie Alley and Terri Garber should be mentioned here - that's just a great example of how TV production should be. <br /> <Br /> Don't forget the sheer beauty of Wendy Kilbourne showing Constance :-)
