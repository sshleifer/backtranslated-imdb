Not since Bette Davis in 1933 "Ex-Lady" saw a movie that was much better than his star said it was! Most of the bum rap "Atoll K," a.k.a. "Utopia," a.k.a. "Robinson Crusoeland," a.k.a. "Escapade" has over the years come from horror stories Stan Laurel said about his production. Since he had suffered a stroke during the shoot, it seemed to be overheated by death (you would never know that Laurel survived Hardy for eight years from the initial two shots of them together) and then was diagnosed with diabetes (once adjusted the diet that he returned to health), understand why Laurel didn't think this film was the most enjoyable experience of his life. Yes, it's wrong: the cheapness of production is manifest, dubbing is terrible, and Laurel and Hardy were too old to do the best movies. But it's still really funny and LÃ©o Joannon's story presents elements of political satire (sometimes libertarian, sometimes communist) that could be expected from more socially conscious comedians like Chaplin or Marx Brothers, but never from Laurel and Hardy. The film deserves credit for being different (though its debt to the classic "passport" of Ealing Studios "Pimlico", which was created just a year earlier, is obvious) and to incorporate Laurel and Hardy into a rather irritable completely different from everything used before. That's not a great movie, but it's definitely better than the eight rough for Fox and MGM they made in the early 1940s. I believe that what was happening was that the technical cruelty of the film kept it from earning a cult following among teenage teenagers born in Marx Brothers.
