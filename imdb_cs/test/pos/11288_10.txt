I want to overtake this review by saying that I have no idea what "Ono" is about. The only thing I really know is that God is killing himself at the beginning and again giving birth to Mother Earth, who impregnates herself with God's semen. She then gives birth to a son. The rest is very subjective and you have to interpret it in your own way. The God who killed himself marked the beginning of a scientific revolution when people began to ask about the doctrines imposed by the Church, such as the geocentric view of the universe and the like. The Earth Mother symbolized people who began to think about themselves and rejected church "this is because God says" views. " Tribal people were the church whipping at them, trying to force Christianity in the throat. I'm not quite sure how the Earth Son fits into all this. Mother Earth and Tribal people seemed to fight over him, so maybe she represents people's freedom or something. I have no idea what the final parts of this film mean. Bludgeoning, rape, then disassembling Mother Earth and Son Earth and grinding the ground like mortar and pestle could mean anything, but that's where the fun of this movie lies; You can interpret it in any way. It may not be definitive, you can let your mind wander. Sometimes you don't even know what you're looking at because it's a strange angle or it's too fuzzy. The only thing that disappointed me was the fact that I was expecting a really scary movie. I went into it and thought I'd be on the phone with a premonition of a seven-day warning. What I got was different. It wasn't scary at all, but my imagination vanished. The effort to decrypt the mysterious film message was a creative challenge. There were many scenes that were really beautiful. Mother Earth just after she was born and the final shot of the forest path in mind. So, overall, I have to say I enjoyed this movie. It's definitely the safest movie I've ever seen, but it's not a bad thing.
