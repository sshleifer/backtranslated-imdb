OTHER KARATE KID, in my opinion, is an excellent combat fight. I thought Eric (Chris Conrad) and Julie (Hilary Swank) looked good in their clothes. For me, Ned (Michael Cavalieri) was a real tyrant. It was because he got Julie in trouble with director Wilkes (Eugene Boles). If you ask me, Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside) was pure ******! That's because he was a very cruel man who wouldn't tolerate mistakes. My favorite part was the ball and showdown between Julie and Alpha Elite. Finally, I highly recommend this hit for all of you who like martial arts or are fans of Hilary Swank.
