*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** It's easy to see why the script for this film won an Oscar. At least during the first half. My head spun from all the clever lines that lit up. Noel Coward plays a New York publishing house ("Why don't you publish books you like?" - "What? And corrupt the public?") Who enchants and manipulates many of his hangers. Then he dies in a plane crash and the story turns into a bizarre takeoff of the Dutch takeoff, where Coward has to find someone who truly mourns him before his soul can rest in peace. Very fun to get bizarre. Looking at Cinefest in Syracuse in March 2003.
