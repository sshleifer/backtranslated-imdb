I have 2 complete lifetime sets, these are my favorite movies of all time. Love all the actors and actresses .. Awsome picture .. Love Patrick Swazy .. This is a movie that showed his real talent. But still, he won't get credit for the display he showed! In these films, many credits were wasted. The way they portrayed dry and dusty civil war monologues. Do it in one of the greatest love stories of all time and show all the obstacles of life, which means real freedom. But how all and all freindship remained solid, even though the war divided kinship and freindships up. ! Simply the best .. Gone with the wind doesn't compare with this movie. Patrick Swazy at his best, .After watching this movie a hundred thousand times. I became a big fan of Swaza .. And they followed his career since then ... they have all their movies after they've done North and South!
