This is an OK adaptation of Dan Brown's breathtaking book. I can't say he's a novel or very good, but they made a movie that you can enjoy. Given the excellent story, the result could be better. The movie is pretty long, but in the end I felt that some things were missing. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. The negotiations were well done, but the character development phase was very weak. For people who haven't read the book, things may look too fast. From my point of view, instead of trying to put so many things out of the book, they could try to make important scenes more appropriate. What makes the book very good was all that consisted of a puzzle, along with an excellent portrait of the Vatican. You don't see one of the movies. Too much hurry and time use is not a good way, these are the main issues of the film. So it's worth watching, but it could be better.
