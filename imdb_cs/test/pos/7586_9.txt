I have seen more than 2000 Studio-Era sound movies - including lots of Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Shirley Jones and Deanna Durbin's own universal features - plus a decent amount of live and studio music comedies and operas. And I assure you that no one who has the task of singing in front of the camera and microphone, or perhaps elsewhere, has always had DURBIN'S SOLO here ... mono soundtrack and thirty microphones and everything. The boy from Canada sings this piece from "Il Bacio" as if she was living and writing herself, and then appeared on a retrospective in Italy late in her career, not as a child who learned it from her music teacher. > <br /> If you miss this Extra on DVD - or skip to solo Garland - you're just getting rid of it because this cheap MGM teaser has just captured one of 20c's greatest performances.
