I could watch this movie all day! I love it. Probably my favorite movies. By the way, "badger1970" there are several parts with bad language, not bad, but it's not exactly G rated. Great movie!!!!! I recommend to all. In any case, it's 10 lines of text for me, so I'll write until I allow it. Okay ... You're still writing ... This is annoying. Ugh. I still have four more. By the way, WATCH THIS FILM! Even if you've seen it before. DO NOT HAVE TO! Was it still 10 lines? No way. Only 2 more lines left. I don't even know why he wants me to do it. I think I'm done. Wait a minute, I'm not done, SORRY, guys. I know that torture is listening to me. I suppose you can't read this comment ... But you should because I wrote it. I guess I did it now. Finally, bye.
