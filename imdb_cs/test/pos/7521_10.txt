Certainly the highlight of this film is its cast. Diana Rigg, George C. Scott, Bernard Hughes mentioned a few. doctors over the years before I thought about it. This comedy challenges the ostentation and prejudice in all aspects of our society by setting up one of its institutions, which are "Straightest" ... Medical <br /> <br /> The idea that such steps could be possible, it might be a shock to some, but it is a joy for everyone with a perspective of experience. Dr. <br /> <br /> Brock (Scott) undergoes a mid-life crisis of monumental proportions before our eyes when we and he become in love with the prospect of his involvement with Miss Drummond (Rigg). The thread of absurdity is woven into this wonderful blend in the form of irony that it seems that hospitals are killing their own workers because they are poorly managing them. The peak is unpredictable (if you are en it) and has made it even more cheerful if you happen to guess. It's not everyone who has a brand of humor to be sure, and if he has open access for them, he is funny witty. Br /> <br /> I loved every minute and I was glad to see it on DVD.
