I've never seen this movie before it was broadcast on a local wired sci-fi network. It reminded me of the Irwin Allen television series from the late 1960s (Time Tunnel, etc.). Excellent effects (beat Star Trek 5 they did 20 years later, but then it wasn't very hard to achieve). <br /> <br /> I found a very interesting and mature script for this type of production. They would need a couple of touches to tie some free ends at the character level, but it is surprisingly interesting for a children's film (especially a look at a futuristic Euro-policy, surprisingly similar to today's European Union!) reminiscent of the Twilight zone in general (as other users have shown), but in this case it is a compliment. <br /> <br /> By the way, great sets, <br /> <br /> 7/10
