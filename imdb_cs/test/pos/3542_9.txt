What can I say? You only expect the best of the BBC drama and MESSIAH is no exception to the rule. MESSIAH is a great thriller, a really shocking and scary story about a serial killer who cuts out the victim's tongues and replaces them with silver spoons. Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of seemingly random events before more lives are lost. But it's warned - even though it's a "15" rating (in the UK), MESSIAH is a bit of a horrible movie. Some murderous scenes are similar to those in SE7EN and one or two can be really stomachs. But if you do, sit in a chair and enjoy ... even if you are most likely on the edge or hiding behind it. mild violence and severe terror.
