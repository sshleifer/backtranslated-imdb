A beautifully engaging song with the same name as the film won the best Oscar song in 1955. Love is a lot of wonderful things. It's a April rose that grows only in the early spring. Love is the way of nature to give reason to live. This golden crown that makes man king. Once on a high and windy hill <br /> <br /> In the morning mist two lovers were kissing and the world was still. Then his fingers touched my silent heart and taught him to sing. Yes, true love and a multifaceted thing. How can we forget such a beautiful song. Henry King, the director, had the privilege of working with Jennifer Jones twice this year and for a film with a poor rating of "Good Morning, Miss Dove." Jones was nominated for "Splendored Thing" but could also be easily nominated for Miss Dove. William Holden is great because the war correspondent sent a report on the 1949 communist revolution in China. His love for Jones, an oriental doctor, was cute and unforgettable to watch. While the end is not pleasing, it is still one of the greatest novels ever on screen.
