I don't think I've seen a movie of a high school girl for a lifetime to create her own college just to impress her parents. Today, movies are either remakes or sequels, or conspiracies that have been used in many different movies. This one has an original story and is followed by comedy movies. With this well thought-out story and mixed laughter, it's a good movie. Now I saw better, but when I went to the theater, I was thinking about another party with drugs / beer / frat with some innuendo innuendo (aka "American Pie" movie), but I was surprised. To sum up, I enjoyed the movie and next time I mix up the paper for the movies, check out the show time to "Accepted". If you want to laugh loudly, that is.
