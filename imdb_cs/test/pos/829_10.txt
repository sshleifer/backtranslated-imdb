Well ... it's time! Van Damme is back and kicking in this action thriller, which is his best film in recent years. The plot is not very resourceful, but the whole issue of border patrol is interesting and ex-Marines like drug smugglers are fine. But what makes this movie amazing is the fact that Van Damme is back in martial arts. His latest movies were more actor oriented, but in "The Shepard", JCVD ​​is back to dropping bad guys and seems to be in excellent shape. There are some formidable combat scenes and Van Damme shows that he can still pull the old famous 360-spinning heel kick. For being a low budget action movie, she has good sets and great stunts. Van Damme says some funny lines and shows he's improving as an actor. I'm glad he came back to deal with some Van Damage ... I was released due to lack of fighting in his recent movies. Scott Adkins is great in his role and Van Damme and he has 1 on 1 showdown at the end. Overall, it's one of Van Damme's better movies and you will enjoy it. And they have to rent for JCVD ​​fans. I just kept my fingers crossed for another epic of martial arts like "Bloodsport" or "Kickboxer". Nok Su Kow!
