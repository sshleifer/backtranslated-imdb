I got it in the mail and I was surprised. As a big cinema fan of the 1970s, he is not very satisfied with this kind of movie. Despite the obvious low budget for this film, the performances are generally good and you can see why Pesci was to become the greatest actor ever. I'm not sure how authentic this movie is, but it's definitely a good contribution to the mob genre .....
