If you consider yourself a horror movie fan, it's likely that you've seen Hideo Nakata Ring and Dark Water. They're great and Ring's doing it smoothly in Hollywood (maybe Dark Water will be modified soon?). While Ring is almost 100% pure heart pounding and nerve breaking, the story of two sisters is both nerve breaking and twisting mind. Together with others, I consider this Korean film a brilliant and clever ending horror movie. The only mistake of this movie is that some consider its the first 20 minutes slow. It's actually typical of Korean and Japanese movies. I consider it carefully planned, rather than slow, I think it is a "quiet moment before the storm". With a thorough introduction to the characters, the viewer becomes more involved in the character, one of the strongest Korean and Japanese films. Like Ring, the story of the two sisters did not exaggerate the terrible look. Rather, they let our minds do intimidating work alone. So it is clearer and more frighteningly elegant. I'm not going to be surprised when Hollywood remakes this movie after bringing Ring and Grudge / Ju-On over. Don't miss it!
