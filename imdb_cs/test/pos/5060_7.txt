An Arab American is kidnapped from an American airport and flew to "somewhere in North Africa" ​​where he is tortured. Reason? His cell phone got a call from a famous terrorist. The CIA decides to avoid legal means to determine whether a phone call is a guilt or just a mistake. After watching this movie we can only pray some terrorist not accidentally hit the wrong number! In addition to the release, there are several related side stories. One involves the daughter of the Chief of Intelligence (secret police?), Who tortures the suspect, and her involvement with her lover, who is in a suicide bombing night school. This story is too resourceful, but interesting, especially when we see its outcome. The director uses a neat timeline to connect viewers. The second side story is a suspicious woman's attempt to find out what happened to her missing husband. She gets an old lover to help. He (Saarsgard subdued) is an aide to Senator (Alda) and soon gets a cold leg when he realizes that his job is not worth revealing the truth. Witherspoon is wasted in this role. All he gets is to look pale and pregnant, with one brief rage attack. Streep is good and cold and stereotyped as government. (CIA? NSA? Homeland Sec?) An official who appears to be a Cheney clone. Gylenhall is also unnecessary because a smaller analyst has entered an area where he is above his head, even if he finally gets the "right thing". <br /> <br /> I found a movie that is somewhat petty, but thought it wasn't the subject. Certainly it should not be considered definitive and certainly has an ax to be crushed. Like "The Kingdom," it scratches the surface of a very complicated subject. The film tries to give us an idea of ​​the release, but can only end up being a "warning story" about one corrupt one. The point of extradition is not "torture" but the acquisition of "suspects of terrorism" in order to avoid legal (ie obstructive) obstacles. Torture, of course, can be employed, especially if extradition is from our hands - though we are obviously not guilty about this - but the intelligence that can save lives is vital in this "shadow war".
