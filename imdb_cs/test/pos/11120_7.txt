The film follows a lot of students at NYC High School of Performing Arts. There's Coco (Irene Cara), a black singer who, despite everything gets to the top. She is helped by Bruno (Lee Curren) White Musician. Then there's Doris (Maureen Teefy), who wants to be an actress - but shy and scared. She becomes friends with Motgomers (Paul McCrane) - reportedly the only homosexual student at school and is romanced Raul (Barry Miller). Then there's Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray - who unfortunately died in 2003) who is a homeless and a great dancer - but can't read. Then there are different teachers (Albert Hague, Anne Meara stand out) trying to teach children. The songs are great (the name of the song and "Out Here On My Own" were nominated for the best song-- "Fame" won), the dances are energetic and the young cast shows a lot of ambition and talent. But this movie lacks a ship in the drama department. Many plot lines are brought up and completely left to the end of the film. Why did Coco do porn? Did Doris and Raul stay together? He did it? And what about Montgomery - what happened to him? And he graduated from Leroy - and how? There are too many long speeches (Raul has two) and moments that lead to nothing. I suppose there were cuts in the script - I can't believe the movie just remained open. Yet it is worth seeing acting and music again. Basically it's not one bad song and the dances are full of power (and in one place they stop running - literally!). My favorites are "Fame", "Out Here ..." and "I Sing The Body Electric", which is a great final song. So I recommend it, but I can only give him 7 - a scenario really needed to tie loose ends - and not. Trivia: They wanted to make this film at a real school for theater, but they couldn't get permission. The Dean of the school read the script and said the film was too bad. That's right - there's a lot of bad language, but that's how high school kids talk. Avoid a TV version that is unreasonably exaggerated.
