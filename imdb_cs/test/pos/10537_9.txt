I saw it at the Tribeca film festival in the family section. I'm not sure if one of my kids really got the movie, but I have to say it was a wonderful short movie. 'Nostradamus and I' is an interesting short film about hopes and fears that we all felt like growing up in the 1980s, which in turn widens the way my kids feel today. Today we had Regan, we got Bush. Instead of a nuclear war, we have Terrorism. I really identified myself with the main character and I dated "Curehead" in high school. We all felt like "nothing matters" when we were 16, but it's great to see a movie where it all seems to matter !!! I probably wouldn't put it in the family section ... there were a few too damned words for the younger kids, but it was an amazing and enjoyable movie.
