I would buy it and "thirty seconds over Toyko" today if it is available. I also saw this movie after seeing big Jack Webb billboards in his Blues dress on the highway at the age of 12. He always admired Jack Weeb as John Wayne's type and the American all the way. Almost became a Marine just because of this film but served instead in the Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Army Reserve for 32 years. They did not see this movie on television and would like to own it on DVD. At the very least, if it was on TV, I'd copy it to VHS and use it on DVD. I also have a large collection of World War II and Korean War films and I am always looking for new versions on DVD.
