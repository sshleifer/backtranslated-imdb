I saw this movie back for a while and it doesn't seem to be watching. Does anyone know where I can get it? I feel it's worth seeing again. I'm sorry I never heard of Chloe Nicholle until this movie is. Yes, he can act. When I first started watching this movie, I mistakenly invented it for another of her movies, Sex Spa. The plot seems to be similar, but the roles are reversed. This is the first movie I saw Dru Berrymore. I looked up at some of her other movies and I feel like she looks better like a blonde. <br /> <br /> I agree it's a good opening film. Not too soft. It's not too hard. You have to start somewhere.
