With WWII over, film studios quickly rushed to focus on the vet to return home. "The best years of our lives" was probably the best example. It depicts various people returning home and how they have to adapt not only to pre-war lives but also to the changing world. Perhaps the most interesting member is actor Harold Russell. When he lost his hands in the war, he plays the hooked men, where his hands were once, and reminds people that he wants to treat him the same way as others; he went on to win the best supporting role and a special Oscar for the role, making him the only person ever to win two Oscars for the same role. There will probably always be a debate about whether it deserves the best picture more than "It's a wonderful life", but I definitely think they did a good job with him. Very good.
