Although not very often mentioned, "Don't Look in the Basement" is a very interesting movie and is definitely worth watching. The story follows Charlotte Beale, a young sister hired in Stephen's sanatorium to replace Dr. Stephens after being murdered by a patient. Many patients start bothering Miss Beale, and her boss, Dr. Geraldine Masters behaves as if hiding something ... <br /> <br /> This movie has many attractive characters that actually end up and have sympathy during the climax that doesn't happen very often in horror movies. The music score is great and reminiscent of "Dark Shadows", Rosie Holotik, Rhea McAdams and Bill McGhee are great, the story is very interesting and has a great ending. This movie has a camping atmosphere around it that no other film I've ever seen was able to capture. Many horror fans have never seen or heard of this movie, which is really unfortunate because it could be a horror classic. "Don't Look in the Basement" is definitely worth watching all 70s fans.
