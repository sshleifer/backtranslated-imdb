I have a problem with film snobs who consider Americans to be non-bullies who can't appreciate the gentleness of more sophisticated Europeans, Les Francais, Les Italiens ... just about anyone from le continong who is a foreign language in English. If the humor in "My Father Hero" is different from the humor in "Mon Pere ce heros", it is because the French sense of humor is different from that of the American. Not better, not "smarter", just different. If you think it is for Hollywood to "borrow" French cinema, consider how much the French cinema borrowed from Hollywood in the first place. Where would Belmondo and Delon be without Bogart? Truffaut without Hitchcock? Jerry Lewis - Not known for his gentle and cerebral style is idolized in France.Go character ........ Monsieur Depardieu is extremely good as an unhappy divorced premature 14-year-old daughter on vacation in the Bahamas together. Unknown to him, he presents her to other people in the hotel as her lover to become more interesting to the boy he has eyes on. There are "hommages" on "Green Card" and "Cyrano de Bergerac" entertainably inserted and M.Depardieu goes with it all very well - naturally. He makes a good Maurice Chevaler impression with "Thank heaven for girls", which is actually funny and somewhat touching as his audience, all of whom believe he is a lover of a 14 year old girl, getting up and leaving two - would - two as she moves away , blissfully unaware of what is happening. When he turns to the end of the song to acknowledge the applause, the expression on his face is invaluable. Without him, the film would be really average. With a huge figure that controls the screen, there's a lot of fun. No oven, no six packs - just a real person - type of being.
