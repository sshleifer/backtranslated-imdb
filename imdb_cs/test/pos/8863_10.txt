The John Carpenter thing is handed over to the best horror movie ever made. Not only that, but it's also on my personal favorite movies of all time. What makes a movie so great? It's hard to put a finger on it. Everything seems to work in the thing, it's one of the few occasions where everything seems to fall. The film is even superior to Alien in creating a moody atmospheric hell. The fact that it's not just about gore (which is a wonderful btw) but is able to create a paranoia that is unrivaled in movies. A truly amazing movie that is worshiped by all horror enthusiasts and anyone who has a good taste in movies.
