This is the first movie I gave for 10 years. If there was a movie that needed to support the mouth, that's it. Boxing 4 million USD is a shame. People don't know what it is about. If you have any awards for Blues or just for the good use of excellent music, that's why you see it. How many people knew Jackson could sing and damn well. You hear that books and movies ridicule that they are about salvation. After seeing this, you will never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word. Yes, it's bold, sexy, homemade truths, bizarre and real. Isn't that the best reason to see a movie? Those who get my meaning won't stay away from seeing it another week.
