I started watching this show by chance, but I love it. The fact that the main character is in a wheelchair is something that is missing on television, especially for kids showing. My five-year-old nephew (like most children) would just be staring at people who were in wheelchairs or had some other type of disability, but after looking at Pelswick, it seemed to be a normal event. Every time he saw a wheelchair, he simply said "Like Pelswick" and continued what he was doing. And YES animation is a little rough, but if you can watch the first Simpsons season, then it's not that bad. "Genie" is actually an angel who is there to help Pelswick learn in life. He cannot walk somewhere else said that he could walk some time, I saw every episode and he never went to my memory, he is a paraplegic he has no feeling under his armpits (he mentions it in the episode). When it comes to humor, if you can get a copy of the "Ntalented" episode that lampoons boy-bands, you'll instantly love this show.
