Down with the wind is one of the most popular books ever printed. It is by far the movie of all movies. The romance between Scarlett and Rhett made people dream around the world and turned the main actors into cinematographic icons. Can we ask is it really necessary to do a sequel? And ... there are some big shoes to fill in. Well, there was the first book. "Scarlett" Alexandra Ripley is, we must admit, well written and fully respected by the world created by Margaret Mitchell. He picks up exactly where we left our heroine and gently takes us from Mitchell's legacy to his own imagination. In Scarlett's book, defeated after Melanie's death and Rhett's departure, she travels to Charleston, where she lives with her mother-in-law in the hope of getting Rhett's love. Her typical manipulation behavior is once again inspiring a lot of criticism from Rhett and driving them further apart ... until a boat trip that changes everything. Scarlett now carries a secret. The series follows the book quite accurately until the arrival of Scarlett in Ireland. Since then, the book and series slowly part ways. The real ending is different, but of course both Scarlett and Rhett are together. <br /> <br /> The production of the series has been announced worldwide to find another Scarlett O'Hara. Many countries have created their own TV shows featuring young actresses who have auditioned. Finally, about twelve girls were selected to take part in the final tests and interviews in Atlanta, Georgia. Unfortunately, the producer did not find any Scarlett among these actresses. Sad for girls, great publicity for the show (it has already been sold to many TV stations around the world before filming even started). Robert Halmi, the producer who bought the rights to 'Scarlett', said he discovered the right actress while watching TV, gave her a call and signed a deal two days later. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer (who played in 'Willow' and 'Scandal', the last movie that Robert Halmi was watching for a loyal evening) isn't Vivien Leigh, but she's definitely Scarlett! Her performance is not a copy of Leigh, she makes her own character. The main difference between GWTW and 'Scarlett' is the fact that the leading character develops and grows as a human. This is a series privilege, why copy something that was done before? Since there is a gap of almost seventy years between the first and the second story, it is natural that both authors emphasize different aspects of the characters. While Mitchell works around Scarlett, who deals with the consequences of civil war and fights for Tara, Ripley lets Scarlett face the demons. This is the most interesting aspect of the series for me, we recognize Scarlett in a different way because he learns that not everything can always go as he wants. I totally agree with Timothy Dalton's choice as Rhett Butler. He portrays him with charm and irony, and is less cardboard than Clark Gable's performance. The rest of the cast was well chosen. Julie Harris is cute as Rhett's mother, John Gielgud gives a very entertaining performance because grandfather Robillard and Sean Bean are always in the best spot to play a dirty character, his Lord Fenton will make no exception. But a bad decision with Stephen Collins as Ashley and Ann-Margret's adaptation of Belle Watling was a waste of money. Costumes, sets and locations are sophisticated and convincing. The newly built Tara set looked exactly the same, and it's a moving sequence in the series when the house first appears. It makes sense to continue ... Well, six hours of romance are for me. One to watch!
