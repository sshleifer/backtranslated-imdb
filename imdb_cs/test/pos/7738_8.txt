I love this movie, despite the fact that it just lacks to be great. It's fun for adults, full of problems an adult can relate to. Acting is excellent. It's fun to watch John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands as a middle-aged couple feuding. Who knows how much it came from their marriage? Susan Sarandon was never more curious or appealing than her free character, Areth. Raul Julia is husky as a lusty goatherd. The scenery in Greece is magnificent; New York City settings cause me to overwhelm because of the many shots of the World Trade Center. Stom Yamasht's fantastic score. Why do so many things, why isn't this a great movie? It is a little turbulent and too long, unfocused and uncomfortable unbalanced between humor and drama. Yet it is engaging, fun and deeply thought out.
