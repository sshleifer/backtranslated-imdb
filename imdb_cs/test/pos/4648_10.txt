I hope so and how can I get involved? This film is classic and mature with a laugh, adventure and cast of all the stars, 80 years old! What happens when you group together a group of athletes and sororists, a group of debating nerds, a group of misfits and a couple of couselors? <br /> <br /> Lots of laughter to beg for more! David Naughton plays as Adam, the leader of the "Yellow Team", a kind and modern college advisor who helps students with everything from getting a class that wants first dates. His nemesis is Harold, the leader of the "Blue Team," played cheerfully by Stephen Furst of "Babylon 5" fame, no good loafing son rich, former college athlete with plenty of trophies to make any famer halls jealous. Pit two of these against each other and throw in the "red team", "white team", and "green team", the incredible "look" at the observatory, the consequences of cheating on minigolf, the super tour of Pabst B Lue Ribbon beer factory, and hate old landlady among other adventures, and you have all the assumptions of night to remember! Check out Michael J. Fox, Eddie Deezen and director Andy Tennant in one of the latest films he worked on before he became a director, and you have all the stars, merry, cast. The only side of this movie was the performance of Debra Clinger as Laura. It's overworked, but the rest of the movie is so good that it can be easily ignored. <br /> <br /> I own this movie and I can never watch it! <br /> <br />
