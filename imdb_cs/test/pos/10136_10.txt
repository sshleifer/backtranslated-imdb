This is one of the best movies I've ever seen! How can anyone tap this movie, just my imagination! First, Gooding's and Harris's performances were simply spectacular, especially Gooding. This is the only way I can describe acting: spectacular! You have to imagine how hard it would be to play such a character and pull it out; then you see Gooding and his performance was magical. As for the plot, because it was based on a real person, it goes where the characters' lives go. For all action enthusiasts, this may be a bit slow, but then it's not an action movie. I definitely give this movie 10. It deserves nothing less!
