I believe this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best performances in the movie, and I've seen most of her movies. I saw it for the first time on television when I was fourteen and I was so scared. Now and then, and I still get a lot of much. \ tI know these days that this movie would probably not scare people too much. Thirty I love movies that don't show graphic details, let your imagination do the work for you. The cast in this film was excellent. Jess Walton, who was a sister in the story, was very good, although her part was quite small. She also starred in the amazing television thriller that appeared at the same time you never returned with David Hartman. I got Eileen Heckart's greatest performance as a housekeeper. Eileen was as good as a lady with a very poor disposition. George Maharis, who played the husband, was quite effective. Of course, this story had a lot of so-called conspiracy bugs, but I still like the movie anyway. I highly recommend this film to people who love a good thriller without graphic violence.
