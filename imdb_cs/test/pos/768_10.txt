charming. I love the movie. I want to see this movie because Rupert Grint is a fantastic actor. His expressions are great, spectacular. the film was excellent. Julie Walters was also perfect. I think Rupert is the only red-haired boy I love. Rupert has a beautiful smile, a beautiful voice. and a beautiful accent. I think the movie was great and was great to see Rupert in another thing, but Harry potter. and his very good actor so he deserves it and more. he only has a golden globe, but he probably deserves an Oscar Academy award. There are some actors who do not act very well, but have an Oscar as well. It does not matter. but it is perfect, brilliant and beautiful
