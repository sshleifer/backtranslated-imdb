It was recorded that John Ford made "big, blockbuster" movies so that he could afford to make "little" movies that he loved so well. Wagon Master, with young Ben Johnson, is clearly one of his best, if not the best, movies. Instead of shooting, wagons, complicated work with horses, and the inclusion of Indian plains, they are all Ford trademarks. As in many of his other films, Eisenstein, there is a great influence of the Russian director in this film. To support the cast including Ward Bond, Russell Simpson, and Jane Darwell are excellent as well as many, the smaller character actors used by Ford, including his brother (the one who plays the drums). While Ben Johnson continued to earn his well-earned support for the Oscar for The Last Picture Show, his teammates, Harry Carey, Jr. did not reach these heights. Although his father, Carey, Sr. became a Western leader in the early films of Ford, Carey, Jr. He spent most of his career in supporting roles. This is a must for John Ford fans and fans of Western movies.
