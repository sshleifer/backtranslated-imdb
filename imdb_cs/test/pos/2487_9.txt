Punishment Park is a pseudo-documentary film by Peter Watkins. The assumption is that the dissidents of the nation (hippies, musicians, demonstrators, pacifists, etc.) are rounded and tried by the tribunal and then given the choice of a prison or running a criminal park. It's a 52 mile exhausting trek across the desert to the American flag, with the police, the National Guard, and various other authorities in pursuit. The idea is that if you do it on the flag, you are liberated. The Tribunal consists of a number of conservative types, all condemning any behavior that is not like their own, and there is no outcome except for a custodial sentence or the possibility of a "Park of Punishment" for all those in court. There are a lot of things that are still true in this matter, which is quite intrusive in itself. The people running on the route are promised water in the middle of the road, which is not true, and the persecuting officials are mostly sadistic partners who are just for a little bit of target practice. This is not a very graphic movie, but it is shocking in its ideas and topics than anything else. It's scary, it could happen. It's not a very positive movie, but it's definitely worth seeing. Warning: it may make you angry. 9 of 10.
