This show is really Broadway American Idol. He has singing, British Guy, a guy who is sometimes a nice, and super-nice woman. Of course it's different because there is a sing-off, and there is dance and some acting (we just don't see some of the actors). I gave this show 7 because there are a few improvements that I know that many people (including me) would be if they were for the show. The first thing to change is the decision of the referees to return home. I know they want to find the right Danny and Sandy, but America should have the power to decide who's home. It really makes no sense to sing-off. The person with the lowest number of votes is the same at home. Other things to change are to see how they actually act on the show. What is Broadway without acting? The last thing to change is the song that the eliminated people sing at the end. Discarded Danny always sings the same song and discarded Sandy always sings the same song as she leaves. Because every week they sing those songs, they get annoyed. I admit I am not a fan of Grease, but for some reason I am addicted. This show is very underestimated. It has so many unforgettable performances and moments.
