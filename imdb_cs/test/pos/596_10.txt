I haven't seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager. I grew up with muppets on Sesame Street and later realized how much effort and time these characters brought to life. Jim Hensen was a genius and master of the muppeteer. When I watched this movie that day, he took me back when I was younger and it seemed a lot easier. For this piece of time travel I rate this movie 10. <br /> <br /> The Territorial Line explores how Kermit moves from swamp to Hollywood. Mixes and gags are classic muppetism. I'm glad these movies are still for the next generation. I hope I never grow the muppet spell.
