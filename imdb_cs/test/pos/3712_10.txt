Beautifully photographed and tempo short film. Evocatively it captures the feeling of this family and most of the country in the period just before and after Pearl Harbor. I appreciated the visual appearance of the film - naturalistic and poetic at the same time. Great work of great D.P., David Boyd. Although a family movie, the story never becomes maudlin or saccharin. We understand and believe the motivation that drives a young boy to his odyssey. I understand the love of a younger brother for his older brother and I do not question why he sets out to do what he does. I understand that he is driven by a deep desire to be with his brother in this time of crisis. The boy is tough and Jonathan Furr's performance is excellent, as is the performance of veteran Ron Perlman.
