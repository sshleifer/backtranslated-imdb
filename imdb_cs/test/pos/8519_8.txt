Irvine Kershner's "Never Say Never Again", a 1965 "Thunderball" remake of "James Bond", is not to be beaten by Terence Young, but this film by Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli is well worth watching if you call 007 aficionado. However, despite the lack of clever tools and the lack of a live musical score, "Never Say Never Again," is an above-average, thrilling thriller on the doomsday with high-flying experiences from an experienced cast including Sean Connery, Kim Basinger, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max Von Sydow, Barbara Carrera, Edward Fox, Bernie Casey, Alec McCowen and Rowan Atkinson. The film with a brush surprise from the refreshing title titles all along its exciting but lengthy 134 minutes. Unlike sagas James Bond with their breathtaking spectacle moments, "Never Say Never Again" provides several of these scenes because of its disproportionate budget. The film actually contains only three tools: an explosive ballpoint pen, a wrist watch with a laser and a motorcycle with icing. In addition to the tasty opening song Lani Hall, the composer of Lewis Legrand's orchestral music "Ice Station Zebra" leaves a lot to wish for. Legrand replicates none of those stupid jazz cues that make John Barry's music unforgettable for regular Bond franchise. All in all, "Never Say Never Again" seems to be more suited to the first two Bond movies "Dr. No" and "From Russia With Love"? access to the ground. "Never Say Never" presents Sean Connery James Bond as 007, who saw his day and was taken from an active service to teach. Ironically, Roger Moore was a year older than Connery and Moore's Bond 007 films as an active young boy. Sean Connery seems to be responsible for making 007 a more mature secret agent, and a number of changes are taking place in Lorenzo Semple's script, which emphasizes Bond's age. Initially Connery lobbied to play Bond without a hairpiece, but the mercifully wiser minds won, and Connery's sports hairpiece. He looks tanned and fit and looks better than he was twelve years earlier when he was thrown into "Diamonds Are Forever" at the last minute to replace John Gavin. Connery worked on another film and gained a weight that he couldn't remove in time because "diamonds are forever". In 52, Connery still has a youthful power here despite the inventive requirements of the screenplay. The action unfolds with 007 unilaterally trying to save a kidnapped woman on a remote desert island. He sends several guards armed with machine guns and frees the woman, only to stab him with a knife to the side when not looking. The whole sequence seems to have been an exercise designed by M (Edward Fox of "Day of Jackal") to test Bond's ability. The new M does not share its predecessor the use of field agents. M decides that Bond needs to clear his "free radicals" system and has 007 wrapped in the Shrublands. While at the clinic, Bond notices suspicious activity between the nurse and the patient and notices how she observes them. The sister is none other than Fatter's killer Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera of "Dr. Moreau Island") and is in charge of making sure no one sees the USF officer Jack Petachi (Gavan O'Herlihy of "Superman 3"). Petachi is part of SPECTER's plans for Maximilian Largo's millionaire entrepreneur (Klaus Maria Brandauer of Out of Africa) to steal the black powers with two nuclear warheads. Demons implanted Captain Petachi's duplicate eyeball, which has access to highly sophisticated computers and can order weapons. After stealing weapons for SPECTER, Fatima Blush takes him out of the way by throwing his pet in his lap and then attaching an explosive to his broken car and throwing it out. The first part of "Never Say Never Again", in addition to the SPECTER planning conference, belongs to Fatima, who oversees Petachi's stay at the clinic and then repeatedly tries to kill Bond, one at sea with sharks and later at a motel. with explosives devices. Finally, Bond meets the beautiful blond Domino (Kim Basinger of "Mother Lode") and sneaks into Largo's charity banquet at the Monte Carlo Casino, where two faces in a sophisticated video game called 'Domination' to see who will rule the world. Bond catches him and Largo hates him twice because 007 is his only opponent with Domin and his side, which Fatima can't even remove. Bond and Fatima have it after chasing a motorcycle when it returns a favor and throws it out. Their earlier meeting in the Bahamas, when they connected the device to attract a shark, is lame enough. As in the original "Thunderball", the villains restore the kidnapped nuclear warheads at sea, but only warheads themselves. Bond flies to the Bahamas where he meets his diplomatic relations, Nigel Small-Fawcett (not less than Rowan Atkinson of "Mr. Bean" fame, who fears that Bond can kill someone and destroy the island paradise, and of course Nigel Small-Fawcett serves as a source of comic relief for the film, CIA sends Felix Leiter (Bernie Casey) to "Guns of the Magnificent Seven" to support Bond This is the first time an African-American portrayed Leiter: part of the problem of rescuing Domino from Arab slaves while Leiter and he save the world. Never Say Never Again is a richly respected James Bond thriller with many neat touches, but it never creates the danger of franchise Bond movies. Indeed, "Never Say Never Again" looks like a dignified Masterpiece Theater at 007.
