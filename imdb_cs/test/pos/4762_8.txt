I like other reviews of this movie. They reflect my attitude. I am a 70 year old guy, minus disco and childhood "Star Wars". There was nothing big about this movie except the chase scene. Therefore it was good because it was hard, basic and economical. Roy Scheider carried a film that was based on the crew, 7 Ups, that backed Gene Hackman in "The French Connection". The people in her were believable and the average ones who burned the coffee themselves showed fear in the chased scene and almost lost it after a close call. It might be easier to say what's missing. There were no luxury weapons, just basic revolvers and rifles. There was no hard philosopher, ala Tarantino. There was no kung fu or samurai nonsense or a fantastic trick. There was no clever person to do some complicated system based on the hundreds of things that were going on, including the plans of everyone else. Criminals were bad, but they didn't shoot people for it. In fact, the number of bodies was only three. something that the average movie would pass in the opening credits these days. Today it can be G! There was no kidnapping of the busload of children from single schools, nor did terrorists hurt half the city. There were no high-tech hijinks, nor crimes in themselves very mobile or brilliant, the highest tech I saw was the ATT touch phone. He had no underpinnings or funny character development. Also, no sex or women, except one woman gangster who was screaming when our hero let her go. It was some small business that used its connection with the local crowd and the police to kidnap local gangsters for some easy payouts. Insurance companies. Vito played Tony Lo Bianco, who did a great job, as well as Roy Schneider, Buddy, the chief of the 7 police officers he informed and exploited. What happened to Tony Lo Bianco, looked like a Pacino boot, good looking and talented? What it was was a great NYC background for a simple crime story. A place that was bleak and dehumanizing without being a sociological study. It had a simple conspiracy that included this bearable regime, when one of Buddy's cops accidentally pulled, literally pulled, accidentally shot. Since Buddy and his 7 ups are hot dog units, both NYPD Brass and gangsters thought he was involved, because the hijackers were masked like cops who lured the gangsters into harmony. Apparently the gangsters believed they had lawyers and rights to protect them from ordinary police. Even the gangsters were plain, old and ugly, without royal slavery or soprano. It's a good basic movie with a unique chase scene between two 70 years ago by Pontiacs. Even the cars were simple and economical, not even GTO or Trans Am, like acting and story. In the days of Batman uber-hype or "24" levels of intensity doomsday scenarios, this film reminds us that less is better. It should be shown that film writers and directors should be warned not to dazzle, entertain and eventually insult us with stunts, aids and a clown of psychotic behavior.
