If this film is not at least selected for an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film, I will stop waking up at night watching the event. Fridrik Thor Fridriksson proved that money is not the key to creating a good film, but originality. From the cold land comes a warm but thoughtful film of a mentally ill man and his struggle against the mad world. After such insight, you ask whether a man is crazy or in which he lives.
