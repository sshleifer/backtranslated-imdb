'War Film' is a Hollywood genre that has been made and reworked so many times that clich√© dialogue, rehashed plot, and over-the-top action sequences seem inevitable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. Once in a while, however, a war movie comes out that goes against grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Cold War Civil War-era, starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger, is such a movie. Then again, calling the Cold Mountain "war movie is not exactly accurate. The movie begins (literally) with a fast and dirty battle sequence that puts" Glory "director Edward Zwick in shame, but" Cold Mountain "is not even The story focuses on the disgruntled Confederate Inman soldier, played by Jude Law, who becomes disgusted by the terrible war and home life of the beautiful village of Cold Mountain, North Carolina, and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, Ada. Monroe, At first glance, this setting seems like a formula, because the romantic interest in returning home gives viewers enough sympathy to take root in the unwavering torments of a soldier on the battlefield. Omewhat invented. soon to drastically turn, though, as intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (accidentally save the audience from a potentially confusing scenario to want to zako Meanwhile, on the farm, Ada's cultivated ways show that they are little used in the fields; soon it turns into something wilder. On Ad's rescue comes a course, the hard nails Ruby Thewes, played by Renee Zellweger, who helps Ada get her farm together, and perhaps more importantly, to cope with the loneliness and isolation that the war seems to have brought to Ada. In these two environments, a lively, impressive, and sometimes very disturbing portrait of a war-torn south is developing. The characters Inman and Ada communicate with are surprisingly complex, amplified by the brilliant performances of Brendan Gleeson, such as Ruby's dead father Ray Winstone as the relentless Southern "Code", and Natalie Portman as a deeply disturbed and isolated young mother. They were all heavily influenced and changed by the "war of northern aggression", mostly worse. The dark, penetrating anti-war message, highlighted by an effective, scary score, and frostyly beautiful footage of Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the audience by not as terrible battle scenes as the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war has been fought. Although the weapons and tactics of the war itself have changed a lot in the past century, it is a hellish effect on land that is timelessly relevant. Director Anthony Minghella has managed to keep this gloomy mood for most of the movie, but unfortunately the atmosphere is humiliated by a somewhat lukewarm climax, which is characterized by little justice to the beautifully shaped characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is clumsily attached to the beginning and end of the film, although the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits into the dismal nature of the rest of the plot. Don't be mistaken, "Cold Mountain" has neither good romance features nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only of fun, but also of the real engagement of viewers in the lives of people torn by the war and utterly desperate to get rid of its terrible consequences.
