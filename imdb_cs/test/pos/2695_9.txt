The "King of Queens" could be divided into two periods. The first era, consisting of the first few seasons, portrayed the issues of everyday life of a man and his wife who lived him in the city. paycheck paycheck. The second era, widening the scope of the show, focused on contemporary popular culture and marital problems with humorous spin. But besides all this. This show was crazy cheerful. Kevin James, when he doesn't make movies with a comedy with Adam Sandler, is a genius of laughter and his chemistry with Leah Remini was incomparable on television. Jerry Stiller as a psychotic living father in law added his own unique style of unpredictable humor and Patton Oswalt as a "man-child" Spence Ulchin was amazing (he is also a great comedian) "The King of Queens" was the last sitcom of the nineties to get out of the air and it's a damn shame. All we have to watch are idiotic sitcoms full of unreal actors and actresses whose only attraction is their physical appearance. I like many fans of really funny TV shows, now I'm in a state of sadness
