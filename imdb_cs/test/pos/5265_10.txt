As a veteran screenwriter at Richland College in Dallas and a former MGM screenwriter in decent movies, I am thrilled to have randomly clicked on Channel 33 in Dallas today and watched this charming movie, in which Betty White GORGEOUS makes one yearning for good old days Really good movies before Hollywood started banging all that crap for teenagers. If a producer listens, I would like to say that there are over 60 years old who will happily pay a buck to see a movie that has no weapons, no killing, no special effects, no sex and violence, and just a good moving story about human relationships who will leave you with a warm feeling of how this movie did for me.
