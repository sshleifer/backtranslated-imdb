This movie was one of the rolling on the laughter movies that I have ever seen. Danny De Vito plays Owen perfectly. Momma is perfectly portrayed and was one of the highlights of the film. <br /> <br /> It starts differently than what you would expect at the beginning of the movie. Larry tries to write a book and has some problems. Larry teaches the writing class and Owen tries to read Larry's story. Finally, Owen asks Larry to kill his mother, and Owen in turn kills Larry's ex-wife. The whole movie was really fun. One of my favorite parts of the movie is at the end when Owen writes "Throw Momma from Train". Larry is angry because he has just written a book of similar conspiracy. It turns out that Owen wrote a pop-up book for kids. <br /> <br /> I would really recommend this movie. I gave him 10.
