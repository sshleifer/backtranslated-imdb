There was something about the original three movies that made them so special and gorgeous - probably the length of them. Unfortunately, it lacks magic, but it still ends in a fun movie. The bright, shimmering side is that our favorite plasticene characters are still doing a great job, there is good plastic animation, it's a stupid but well-structured and fun land, exciting, fun adventure, a good idea a conspiracy (it was a rabbit and a giant traceable contest) and good new characters! In addition to missing the original charm, the only other subtle side of the movie is that humor, though good, is somewhat exaggerated, especially when compared to the original movies. The popular giant Vedgetable competition is coming and Wallace and Gromit help control rabbits from consuming any vedgetables, now they are Anti Pesto. They do a good job, but soon there is a danger. There was a rabbit nearby ... <br /> <br /> Recommended for all Wallace and Gromit fans and people who like plastic films, enjoy "Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of Wererabbit"! :-)
