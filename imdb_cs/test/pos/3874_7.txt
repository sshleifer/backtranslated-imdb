"Back in the day" is an interesting but erroneous effort. Ja Rule plays like Reggie Cooper, an honest but sad man who tries to cope with his father's death. She meets her old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames), who is trying to force Reggie into the life of a crime. Reggie also falls in love with Alice (Tatyana Ali), who is the preacher's daughter. Now he has to choose: Love or crime. I rule does a competent job like Reggie. At least he's trying to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as J-Bone. It brings a lot of energy and threats to the role. Joe Morton as a preacher is his usual excellent self, but he won't do much. Same problem for Giancarlo Esposito as Reggie's dad. He needed more time on the screen. I don't want to say it, but Pam Grier is pretty horrible like Mrs. Cooper. She rewinds every scene and brings the movie down. Tia Carrere and Frank Langella are in it, but they won't do anything important for the conspiracy. Finally: You should see it on the skilled performance of Ving Rhames and Joe Morton and on the grotesque writing and direction.
