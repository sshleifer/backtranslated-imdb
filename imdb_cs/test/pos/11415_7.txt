Even though I read all the complaints about this movie before I saw it, I was still interested in the preview. I don't know if it was because I expected a bomb or something, but I really enjoyed the movie. Until the second half of the film, I wasn't too scared, but even then it wasn't bad. I think most of the scenes and false alarms were realistic, albeit a little too random, but it was necessary to move the story. I think the house and surroundings are the ideal place for this type of film, it's beautiful and huge, but then the same qualities that are attractive become scary. I also think the lighting arrangement worked very well because they not only turned on at the entrance, but there was no way to keep them, so the house remained dark outside the small Jill section. <br /> <br When I talked about Jill, I thought her part was doing pretty well, at first it wasn't so plausible, but after a few phone calls it was okay. In fact, the scenes where they are afraid behave perfectly. And finally someone got the right to fire. I can't tell you how many times when I hear the noise in my house that I caught the fire of poker, and it was a nice touch for her to do the same, even though she forgot it when she needed it most. As far as the hole is concerned, the film is not perfect, but almost every hole can be explained, and part of the secret is how did it get in... exactly how long had he watched it? How did he get out to kill his friend? and when exactly did the gardener die? overall I enjoyed it and I was surprised how fast it was. I kept my attention and I wanted to see how it ended even though the end was very short and left me a bad taste in the mouth. My only complaint, other than the end, was the lack of character development. They could add ten minutes or something to her and her friends to make us feel bad for her situation more, to give us a taste for her personality and to predict how she can handle the situation (for example, a scene where it is debated whether to go back for children, it looks like there is some missing scene at the beginning that talks about it or something else.
