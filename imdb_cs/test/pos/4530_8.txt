This movie is a fun little private eye detective story as if it wasn't done anymore. It's all there: Tom Conway is a great detective named Falcon, Goldie Locke (what's in the name) is his wisecracking bumling sidekick, Louisa Braganza is a miss in need, and of course there are damsels maid, a professor with a secret formula, a bad guy who wants a formula, and a police inspector who is after the Falcon. There is murder, and the Falcon gets involved. The scenery is nightclubs, expensive hotel rooms, luxury train, suburbs and beautiful cars. Go watch this little gem when you see it go through the afternoon television!
