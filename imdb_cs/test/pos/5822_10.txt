Oz is one of the most stunning and addictive television experiences of all time. When I picked up the pieces on SBS, I was skeptical at first, but unfortunately, when I finished my 4th year, I know that this brilliant show is coming to an end (6 seasons) and yet I can't get enough op. You want something that will push your senses and stomach on the border ... Oz falls on the bill, hands down. This is not childish material, people, its violent, brutal and not handsome. Why, his experimental unit within the maximum security prison. Tom Fontana Oz is great in all the right departments, actors, writing and directing. The HBO Oz Oz website is also highly recommended, for novices, for information on this series. It was the first hour show produced by HBO, and it demonstrates what masterpieces are and which others would follow. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your HBO
