OK. The one who invented the film hates humanity and wants to see how everyone cut their throats. This "movie" was utter and utter dirt. What the hell was that with strange old bags? Seriously, she was on some terrible cure and then she just thought she could control people? She ran around with her strange evil eye and was it like what? Should I hang a booger off my nose? What are you staring at? Do you like a sea witch or something? Everything and everything, even though I thought the graphics were old. I'd give her ten for that. But when you watch it, cover your ears. The pure and complete evil that comes from this film will cause ear bleeding and your eyelids will fall away. Who knows? You can even get a knot in your small intestine. You better watch the fools.
