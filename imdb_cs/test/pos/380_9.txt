Well, this is about as good as them. There are arguments about whether Hitchcock was just "a master of commercial tension" or perhaps a "compulsive technician" - or was indeed "profound". No one knows exactly what it means, but it is legitimate to ask if at all the three things could not be at the same time. It seems to be at its peak at this point. Almost nothing is random. This abounds in doubts, ambiguities and wit. And the story is engrossing, Patricia Highsmith apparently having complexes similar to Hitchcock's own. I just want to point out five incidents on the screen for which Hitchcock is no doubt responsible. he murdered her. She noticed his attention and was innocently flattered. 1. Laura and her two friends rented an electric boat that would go through the Tunnel of Love and then to the island in the center of the lake. Walker is right behind them, smiling, in his ship - Pluto. "Pluto." It's not an allusion to the drawn Walt Disney character. It is a reference to Pluto, also called Hades, the god of the underworld in Greek and Roman mythology. This little touch can't be an accident. And the "underworld" that Walker represents is not just literally hell, but the underworld of the human mind. I hate to say it's a Jungian "shadow", but that's what it is. (Did Carl Jung see this movie? He was alive at the time of his release - but probably not.) 2. Now it's a deadly succession, right? Walker is a madman who is going to murder a woman he doesn't even know. Imagine how it would be set by most directors. A night walk through the crowded carnival, stealing from the shade into the shadows, the killer staring from behind the canvas walls and so on. What does Hitchcock show us? When Walker walks through the gates for the first time, concentrates on his victim, a little boy in a cowboy suit, holding a balloon, runs up and shouts, "Bang! Bang! You're dead!" Walker jerks his head in surprise and looks at the child angrily. And when the child starts to move away, Walker hits the cigarette on the balloon and jumps out, then continues his effort without looking. This is one way Hitchcock heals the impending destruction. 3. Famous strangulation was reflected in the fallen glasses that were innocently refreshed. 4. Miriam and her friends stop at one of those devices that pound with a big mallet, send a hockey puck to the pit to measure the strength of your wound. One of her friends drinks it and the puck does not reach the bell above. Under Miriam's pleased and admiring gaze, Walker smiles and strokes his hands, then picks up his mallet, slams it, and the puck slams into the bell. She's excited. She puts her drumstick down, looks at her, smiles, and WAGGLES HISE EYEBROWS looks at her like a ten-year showoff! 5. After discovering Miriam's body while blowing blows and people screaming, Walker leaves the carnival and encounters a blind man waiting on the sidewalk. Walker takes the old man's arm and leads him through the intersection, raising his hand seriously to stop the traffic. Spooky shark. These incidents and others take place within ten or fifteen minutes of carnival visits. (The performance of Robert Walker is exceptional throughout.) It's basically a kind of invitation to be noisy. (Cf: "Ride the Pink Horse") But the threat of the scene is undermined by Hitchcock's insistence on irony and distance. None of the known noir techniques is used. Nothing about it is "scary". And murder itself is barely wild. I don't think any director other than Hitchcock can do it. It would be all threats and shadows, hiding places, failed attempts, frown instead of grimaces. Not that it was an absolutely flawless movie. Flawless film is not yet with us. Some middle part is a little slow and Farley Granger, even though he is a nice guy, is tough, boring and somewhat stupid. His new girlfriend is just boring. Hitchcock was to deal with the wrong attribution of guilt with deadly esteem in "The Wrong Man." I'm not sure Hitchcock ever thought about the difference between legal guilt and moral guilt. He was charged with Catholic education at an early age. "The original sin" - with him you are BORN - and all this. In the interviews he had always cheerfully explained his fear of the police and the authorities in general by telling the story of his father taking him to the police station to scare him after some peccadillo. We are entitled to wonder if it was just what psychoanalysis calls "screen memory". I hope you get a pun. I know, I know. It's tense and awkward, but I've spent a lot of valuable time thinking.
