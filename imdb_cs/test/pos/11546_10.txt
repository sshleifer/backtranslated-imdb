When I first watched this movie, I thought it was a very special movie. But I know the director almost always makes sense when making a film. I decided to watch it again. The second time I watched it, I realized that Albert Puyn was a very talented and very original filmmaker. At first, the viewer was told that the film took place ten years after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. But they had clothes and cars with a design typical of the 1950s. They had plutonium, which in my opinion is a symbol of futuristic trade. I think that means the movie is not assigned in real time. The music in the film creates a long music video that tells some of the real story in the lyrics, especially for the intro and outro. Albert Puyn uses red and blue as he returns. shows symbols for communism (red) and capitalism and western world (blue). One may note that Ice-T, has the name Mao (Communism) and that when he is back focused the color is red. The American cop, starring Burt Reynolds, is always shot in blue. The club in which Mao and his gang hang is also with the red back color. Mad six is ​​hanging between red and blue. Mao had a dog at the beginning, but the cop got him. I think this means the fall of communism and the replacement of the capitalist way of thinking from the Western world in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> I think Crazy Six is ​​a very well made movie. Albert Puyn creates a sci-fi / action film with political depth. It is a different but very special film about the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. I look forward to the next magnificent film by Albert Puyn.
