It's a very dark movie for the 1980s. At this point, the filmmakers are beginning to work on the assumption that all the films require a breathtaking comic relief (which is, of course, nowadays taken to the limit today), opulent action scenes (still exaggerated today) or steam sex scenes. Hutton and Penn are immense in their roles as childhood friends who have become Soviet spies. In particular, Penn is brilliant as the unfortunate drug dealer Daulton Lee. <br /> <br /> What you have here is a real thriller / drama. There is no eye candy to talk about, but the story is so convincing and acting so amazing that most people wouldn't miss it. There are some fun scenes, especially where Penn is trying to engage his Soviet benefactors in the main event. It is worth watching.
