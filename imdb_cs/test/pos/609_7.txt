Let's look at the three geishas who followed their prime number. Now they look back at their past with kindness and sacrifice their gift. Kin (played by the floating weeds' Haruko Sugimura) swore a man and made a good life like moneylender; everyone in the block owes her. The other two, Nobu and Tamae, want the spouses to land, but they are not stupid enough to believe they will ever be. Meanwhile, their children - one has a son and one daughter - are about to marry (not each other). Tamae is upset about how much nicer her daughter has become, and bitterly tries to convince her not to marry the man. Nobu's concerns about her son are more legitimate in nature, but they are also (understandably) self-sufficient. After her son leaves, she will be alone. Two of former Kin's clients are looking for her, a man who is so obsessed with her that he tried to make her commit double suicide, another of her most beautiful clients. Unfortunately she comes for her money, not for her love. The way I described the film was inexorably depressing, but it really isn't. Sad but not mortal. It's more bittersweet. Unfortunately, I only marginally liked late chrysanthemums. The story seems better when I look at it, but it's very slow and boring. I nodded twice during the movie and I wasn't tired before I started it. This is the type of film that I can appreciate more than that; It reminds me a lot of my reaction to a few more famous Ozu movies. 7/10.
