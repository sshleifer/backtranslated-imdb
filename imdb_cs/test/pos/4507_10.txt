Watching Stranger Than Director Marc Forster The Kite Runner is a movie equivalent to eating vegetables because this PG-13-rated art epic is suitable for your movie diet. No, this is not the kind of movie I like on the couch and eyeballs at the end of a hard day. Kite Runner is not your typical mainstream movie that will entertain you and forget your problems. No celebrities appear first. Second, nothing is cut and dried, black or white, or so bizarre that you don't believe the image you see. Third, Kite Runner falls into the headlines when characters sometimes speak in their native language. Fourth, Forster's film is not a romantic little thing about a boy-girl, a boy-girl, and then a boy-girl. Fifthly, this foreign-language film can worry you and challenge your assumptions about life, friendship and survival. The main topics are cowardice and redemption. The protagonist commits a cowardly offense in the first half of the action, which he must atone for his personal security and integrity. Well, Kite Runner is about redemption for past sins. We are talking about personal responsibility, so don't rent or buy this wonderful movie to celebrate a boy at night or something that would make a bad day out of your system. Based on Khaled Hosseini's best-selling novel, this culturally enlightened melodrama on the right and the bottom initially looks like one of those cheerful, adolescent friendly films in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Sandlot. About half an hour to 127 minutes, this escapade of two young people flying kites in Afghanistan darkens and reluctantly. However, if you can handle the remaining hour of conspiracy, you will be pleased, relaxed and maybe even entertaining. Kite Runner opens in San Francisco in 2000, when our protagonist, Afghan immigrant Amir Jan (Khalid Abdalla of United 93) and his wife Soraya (Atossa Leoni of Florist) receive two boxes of a published copy of Amir first novel. Amir had the chance to bask in his triumph of his time as a storyteller before the phone ripped him out of his dreaming and he reluctantly returns to the past that is best for him. Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub of the Nativity Story) calls Amir from Pakistan to ask. Rahim was a servant in Amir's household in the 1970s, when Amir lived with his wealthy business father Pashtun Baba (Homayoun Ershadi of Taste of Cherry) in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion. "You have one more chance to be good," Rahim Amir informs, without encouraging his request for sugar. Basically, Rahim wants Amir to fly to Pakistan and then enter the war of torn Afghanistan and rescue Rahim's grandson Sohrab (Ali Danish Bakhty Ari), who is imprisoned against his will as a sex slave to Assef (rookie Abdul Salam Yusoufzai). the cruel Taliban chief and Amir's once feared adversary. Kite Runner goes from San Francisco in 2000 to a prolonged flashback in Kabul in 1978 when life was idyllic. Twelve-year-old Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi) and son of his father's son Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada) love watching movies such as John Sturges The Magnificent Seven when they are not flying kites. By the way, it's flying a kite like you've never seen a kite flying. Not only do kids fly, they also compete with other kids to see who can cut the strings of another baby dragon. Kite's combat aerial scenes create the same kind of excitement that Tony Scott's Top Gun dog scenes had. Hassan is Amir's best friend, but unlike Amir, Hassan is a spoiled minority of Hazara. Earlier, young Amir and Hassan had a confrontation with young Assef (Elham Ehsas) and his two flunkies. Assef wanted to defeat them, but Hassan pulled out a slingshot and threatened to use it on Assef. Assef had no choice but to return. Meanwhile, Amir was ready to suffer by fate handing him over. Amir's father, Baba, laments that his son does not have a spine, and fears he will grow half the man because he is a coward, unlike little Hassan, who breaks Amir out of trouble. By the way, Amir and Hassan emerge from clearing with Assef without scratching. Later, after Amir sets a new record with his flying dragon and combat skills, Hassan runs after the dragon to claim it. Hassan is the name of the same name. Hassan declares the fallen dragon, but he finds himself at the mercy of Assef and his two minions. Assef lets Hassan hold the dragon, but his minions pin Hassan spread-eagle, belly down in the alley, while Assef sodomizes the youth. The worst part is that the traumatized Amir pursues a near attack but lacks the courage to intervene on behalf of his friend who would hit him. In addition to the extraordinary airframes with dragons, Kite Runner is on the ground, straight ahead. When Amir returns to Afghanistan to save Sohrab, he disguises himself as a Taliban fighter, but does not wear a weapon. The rescue scene at The Kite Runner is more like an escape scene from The Midnight Express. While Forster explores local politics or immerses us in the ethnic and cultural issues involved. Troy screenwriter David Benioff had to remove some parts of the book and racial and ethnic prejudices are not clearly defined, so you have to accept some things on the faith. Forster tapped the film in almost China to give him an authentic look. Forster deserves credit for the fascination of the two hours plus the epic. Performances, especially children, stand out for their credibility. Kite Runner is a movie you won't forget.
