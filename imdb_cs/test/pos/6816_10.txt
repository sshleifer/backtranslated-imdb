It's just a wonderful little movie for the first director's film, although I have to admit that it's a little hard to watch and probably offend the feelings of many people watching him because the film takes a clear stance on suicide. But what I liked about the movie is that I didn't know it was what the movie was about until the time the movie was more than half and I was already addicted. In addition to the excellent film The Way the Item Was Presented, I am impressed by the very professional film style - with some of the best movies I've ever seen in a short film. In addition, this camera work has been linked so well with music and images that made the film simply beautiful. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's a controversial movie. I myself struggle with what I think about this debate, but the film managed to make a statement so literally and intelligently, I really have to respect the team that made the film.
