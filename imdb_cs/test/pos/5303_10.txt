I was quite angry when I watched it in the cinema and grinned from ear to ear; eyes wide open and trying to take into account all the details that are at the same time insanely simple, fresh but incredibly sophisticated, breathtaking and imaginative. <br /> <br /> As for the audience age, it's probably Totoro. The storyline works from a pure heart for 5 years, focusing on what they want and conscientiously in their efforts. They live in a world that is intact with cynicism and cultural learning about how everything works, "I suppose". While most critics may overlook this film due to a lack of "message" or "plot" of the film (even though it is somewhere there), it is for this reason that the film. Too often our judgment is hampered by our own limitations on film and cultural status. Like most Miyasaki movies, everyone is absolutely unique, but undeniably Miyasaki. Sometimes Ponyo can feel so unique and fresh, can feel like an alien. The tracking experience provides a tremendous change from all generic children's products that are generally commercialized to satisfy adult demographics (ie they speak like their human counterparts, Eddie Murphy at Shrek.) It's perhaps reassuring Knowing that good old-fashioned hand-drawn cells still work so incredibly well in this digital era, where Toystory / WallE / Shrek / Cars generally wins. So he feels somewhat nostalgic and at the same time feels timeless in the film, just like Totoro and the Jungle Book didn't really get old. The cosiness of each character's expression and body language is captured in such a nuance of interpretation that digital movies like Wall-e can never compete, or if so, it will be a very expensive process. It would be a great pity that Wall-E won the Oscars this year and probably this year. Still, it might be quite unfair to compare 2 media because it is really a craft and telling stories they win at the end of the day. Miyasaki is a real master for it
