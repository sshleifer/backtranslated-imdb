Christopher Nolan was a champion, though he had only $ 6,000 and part-time cast. Nolan is, in my opinion, another great one, and our first taste of Nolan is not inconsistent. None of the problems that constantly plague and discredit the low-budget independent image haunt Nolan and the crew. Our actors are inexperienced and young, but in this story they bring us and engage us. I honestly think the following is Nolan's best scenario because it's the one he had the most control over. It's a beautifully presented movie. This will lead us to a world where we are not limited by budget constraints. Dialogue and atmosphere are bold and intelligent. The method of telling Nolan's trademark, which tells the story of continuity, is first used here in a way that throws out the whole story. . With Mement and The Prestige, you'll have to think a little bit to get a perfect understanding of the genius, but Nolan doesn't try to confuse people with his prototype movie. Time can be distinguished by the appearance of our protagonist. This way of telling the story is both creative and engaging. I am glad that Nolan has so much success with him that his films become more than what they could be with this method. Payouts at Prestige and Memento wouldn't be exciting if the film was narrated in conventional format. This idea was done with a slight success earlier, but Nolan really did it alone. <br /> <br /> The script here is Nolan's best. I had some doubts about his ability to write, all the ways I imagined his brother Jonathon was a talent for writing, but it turns out I followed him. It is a thought provocative story that makes interesting observations of people and their functioning. Cobb's burglary rating and how it can lead you to find out what makes people tick, is truly credible. <br /> <br /> My only real complaint is that working with the camera sometimes shakes, but doesn't take any of it. story or playing. This is followed by the first film by a person who embodies 21st century filmmaking at its best.
