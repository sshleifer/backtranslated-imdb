This SEARCHERS is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen, filmed by a British in a strange, unknown Mexico. It is often said that the best films about America are strangers who can meet acquaintances with the stranger's eye. But this movie is different. Although reportedly in America after the Civil War, it is not America that is recognizable from myth, cinema, television, etc. The film has a timeless fable while dealing specifically with Western mythology. Director Harvey uses the title horse as a focal point for linking stories about the traditional Western conflict of primitives and civilization. The first seems to be superior. Huge scrubs and deserts of the film's landscape are intact, mature for allegories of the mind. The only short spots of civilization are the stagecoach of missionaries and landowners and their hacienda, both of which derive behavior that is nothing but civilized. <br /> <br /> Three stories cover the basic story. In one aimless deserter, Pike, who lost his business partner, stole a miraculous horse, Eagle's Wing, so-called because of his grace and speed. In the second, an Indian, a white bull, the owner of this horse, a waylays stagecoach, and kidnaps one of his female residents. In the third, Spanish men sent to find her ignore this quest in favor of the murderous, looting the spree. Although revisionist Western, Indian treatment is problematic. Unlike Pik, his character is never explained, forever unpredictable, denied voice, with the exception of the unbearable snippet of the song. When it is not strange, it is a symbol whose role is not completely resolved - in one place a wild brutal, on another it embodies nature and freedom. Pike, however, notes at the beginning that the film will be devoted to primitivism before civilization. The film is in many ways similar to 2001 - SPACE ODYSSEY, especially its opening sequence. Part of the film's strength lies in the connection between the three diverse characters, forcing us to see mythical fights and tasks in a different light. Indian culture and Catholicism are connected with superstition, ritual, greed and murder. Both Pike and White Bull are musical and alcoholic. The white bull is demonized by both Pike and kidnappers as a "bastard", unconsciously revealing the tactics of illegitimacy used by the colonization of Caucasians who infantilized the natives and became "necessary" fathers. Unlike Traditional Western This film, which deals with history, civilization and progress, is a double detective story that interrogates the past, traces, remains. <br /> <br /> I think this film has its unique uniqueness. racism, its Britain. Climbing the climate is more like Arthurian joust. The film itself largely boldly avoids dialogue and creates the visual and phonetic tapestry of Malick, which he missed in the BLACK RED FRAME, and a few Hollywood directors would dare. Existential doubling and quest motifs are more of a European myth than American (reminiscent of another British film by Harvey Keitel, THE DUELLISTS). The most amazing is the use of nature. Most Western countries use the landscape as awe inspiring background. In many ways, EAGLE'S WING is like Powell and Pressberger, with a powerful, pantheistic nature - lively, dangerous, hostile, beautiful. There is a noble scene reminiscent of CANTERBURY TALE, when the jewels left as a White Bull trap in the trees are suddenly deflated in the wind: there is a creepy, tingling, magical, thrilling effect reminiscent of Arabian nights than an opera horse. Cardiac arrest.
