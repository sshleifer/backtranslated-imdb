This review is long overdue because I consider the Story of Two Sisters the only biggest movie ever made. I will build this jewel against any film in terms of script, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of filmmaking. Is it virtually perfect in all of them? a true masterpiece in the sea of ​​artificial "masterpieces". The structure of this film is easily constructed in the history of cinematography. I can't think of any other movie where something vital happens every second minute. Quite literally, Ji-woon Kim seems to have made a film that scoffs at the viewer to dismantle him at the most detailed level. Can a seemingly insignificant subject appear? rack dress, two diaries, a drop of blood coming out of the cracks floor, bottle of pills, etc ?? but after careful inspection will it prove to be much more? a guide that helps to understand this particular scene (or perhaps the film in general), which almost always contributes to the aggressive reflection of the psychological concepts that lurk in the background as long as the viewer's intelligence does not prompt them to come to the fore. Such an event could occur during several other films, but in the Two Sisters' Story, such events take place in such a fast, fiery, tireless way that the viewer must watch the film in a constant state of vigilance so as not to miss something important. In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other movies. How can any of their right minds ask for more from the film than this? It's just the highest, most distinctive form of cinema that can be imagined. An unsolved mess that uses confusion to instill a false sense of intelligence because it does not provide the ultimate set of facts that underlie interesting questions. He assumes that Ji-woon Kim threw a dozen possible explanations and left it to it. In reality, however, nothing can be further from the truth. The Two Sisters Story offers a range of unsurpassed objective facts that help the viewer identify EXACT occurrences of each movie scene. If our good friend Zaphod paid attention, would he notice? for example ?? A series of obvious flashbacks that provide enough factual information to make a sense of film. These flashes convincingly contradict Zaphod's claim of complete subjectivity. The objective elements of the Story of the Two Sisters are so obvious to anyone willing to see that the mere assertion of lack of objectivity can only challenge the viewer's patience, who apparently does not want to make the slightest effort at all. to see them. Can Ji-woon Kim really feel the impatience of viewers lacking the desire to understand his film? I think not. Please note that I will not offend the intelligence of critics like Zaphod who cannot "get" the story of two sisters because it really has nothing to do with the lack of intelligence as a lack of perseverance. The film is so effective that the only possible explanation for the confusion is the lack of effort on the part of the viewer. Yes, this film requires quite a lot of solutions, but the pieces are good for creating a beautiful picture. You have to put them together. Remember that the script was written by someone who has a picture in mind? He simply separated the pieces and placed them skillfully throughout in order to provide a wonderful brain exercise that? after completion? grants the ultimate form of satisfaction and horror. Don't try to misunderstand me. There are movies that seem to start with an incomplete picture and try to create a puzzle that is a indecisive design. Spider Forest (2004), Perfect Blue (1998) and Donnie Darko (2001) are a perfect example. The story of two sisters is not. Ironically, Zaphod argues that Darko is more masterfully constructed than the Story of Two Sisters, especially given that Darko not only provides virtually no objective facts, but also a spiral ending that is the basic deus ex machina cliché that any film ever made to give a perfect picture of false intelligence could be abandoned at the end. I'm ashamed of mentioning both movies in the same sentence, but the contrast is important. Although I regret that Zaphod would quote a film that is falling apart when subjected to even the slightest intellectual effort as a method of criticizing a film that only becomes recognizable through a significant exercise of intellectual effort. His "smart" movies seem to prefer the surface. This is obvious when they make 17 consecutive questions in their review, and the film is completely convinced. Just read the topics from Opiemar in IMDb Two Sisters Discussion Forum. Anyone who carefully reads these topics and still claims that there are no objective solutions to this movie can also stop watching smart movies completely because the answers are so damn OBVIOUS. <br /> <br /> I'd like to say more, but I've come to 1000 words. All that was said here had to be said. So whatever it was said!
