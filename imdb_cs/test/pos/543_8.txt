Chick Flick? Of course. Many times .... Predictable? Yes ..... Is it worth watching? You bet! I was pleased with Sarandan's and Portman's portrayal of otherwise stock characters in a familiar story. I'm a great fan of mother / daughter stories. What is the difference between good and weak? ARE THE PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONS. Although not the best of my genre, I'll buy it and watch it again. I felt that the characters were believable and the acting was superior.
