All the guys, here's this movie. This is not the best, but for all of you 80 years old kids out there will bring back memories of your childhood. I personally love this movie. I still love rainbow brite and bear care. So, in my opinion, if you are not a child or you are a child who loved and / or loves rainbow brite you will not like this movie at all.
