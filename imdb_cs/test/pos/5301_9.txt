While Hayao Miyazaki films have always hit me in terms of the story, they are clearly beautiful, with simple animation characters in the background of artistic images. Ponyo adheres to this formula, with a leading figure so adorable I want a plush doll out of her and the scenery so nice it wouldn't look out of place framed as a picture on the wall. The story, on the other hand, I didn't like as much as his last two releases, Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. It was just tad too young, coming as more for kids and leaving adults to enjoy animation. I was also disappointed that the score made by Joe Hisaishi, who also scores for the above-mentioned two films, this time almost as memorable. Even though I can't remember Howl's score now, I still remember it's one of the most beautiful I've ever heard. Ditto Spirited's - Although I remember being a very complementary movie. Maybe it's because Ponyo is the more juvenile fare that the score isn't so scary. In any case, this movie is still to be watched for fans of anime or Miyazaki.
