Peter Segal's commercial hit 1995 and now the cult classic "Tommy Boy" is a jolly movie, an evergreen entertainer. Chris Farley is a talent we will never forget !!! 'Tommy Boy' is a simple story, narrated in the most fun and vibrant way possible. Farley & Spade embark on a journey that is filled with unstoppable laughter, even a part of Rob Lowe is damn fun. As a child, I remember seeing Tommy Boy over and over and over again. It was from my favorite kids and it will always be. Even today, when it comes to T.V. I'm pretty obsessed with this movie. Segal's direction is great. Chris Farley might have died in 1997, but he'll stay alive for me. What is an actor! Watch his work at 'Tommy Boy', he's so cool. In films like 'Berverly Hills Ninja' and 'Almost Heroes' he has performed fantastic performances, but his work remains his best solution to this day! I love you, Farley! On the other hand, the spade is as good as ever. He is an excellent actor in all respects! 'Tommy Boy' rules .... 100 inches from this writer!
