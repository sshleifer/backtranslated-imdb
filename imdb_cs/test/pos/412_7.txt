Look, this film is a dark, brilliant and classic that should be sought by all the necessary means. I believe that the powers decided to be bargained forever; yet we could only pray for the opportunity to see this on DVD. I would say it even beats the great Phatasma. If you like a dark movie, with a lot of scary pictures, look at this and see how it is supposed to be a horror movie of the 80s.
