It's always great to see a movie that teaches us about history in Africa because they're definitely too little. However, the film depicts Lumumba as a political leader who wanted the new independent country to be the same as the old colonial one ..., I felt it difficult to sympathize with this kind of leadership, yet the film is somewhat like homage to There was too little content, explaining how the man came first, and the whole context of Belgium "let them go". Certainly worth seeing how acting and photography are excellent, especially Mobutu itself. I just want a better political analysis.
