I haven't read "Scarlett" and when I watched this mini show, I liked it and I thought it might not be compared to GWTW. The story may differ from the book, but who cares for his film. Even in book-based credits, it's not a book. The film is unequivocally appreciated by reviews that other people write, but they can't even spell the names of the main characters. The acting at Scarlett, which I thought, was excellent. Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton were excellent. They took the characters and put them there. When it comes to other people, they compare them to the great Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable. Apparently they did it fantastically, but in this movie they're completely different people who have their own acting methods and shouldn't be under the pressure of what people say. If you want some actors to do well, you should make the film, I'm sure other actors wouldn't do it as well as those with the chemistry and cleverness they brought into these roles. The support cast has performed with grandeur and Jean Smart steals the scenes that are in her comedy genius. The places in the movie were very beautiful and it was obvious that Scarlett was going to all these places in the movie because of the trouble and other things. Also, the scene in which Scarlett talks to her father's grave was very dramatic, and since then I thought there were two great actresses who brought Scarlett O'Hara to life. Not only Vivian Leigh, but also Joanne Whalley. The movie and the book may vary, but you must not be aware that this is a sequel to one of the best movies you've ever made, or you think it must be like Gone With the Wind and you won't like this movie. But this is a classic under review that is unlike GWTW, its own movie. Also keep in mind that "Tomorrow is the next day" ...
