"East Side Story" is a documentary film about a musical comedy in Stalinist Russia and later in Eastern European satellite comedies, with many movie clips and survivors' comments. Although some of the Stalinist films look sadly wrong (The Light Path (?) Is a remarkable exception), the 1960s movies really look pretty good. "My wife wants to sing," "White Mouse" and "Midnight Revue" look particularly fun. The producers had to deal with censors who had the power to decide what was politically correct, which led to some confusion, a humorous retrospective view, because the people they were trying to calm down were the people who supported the filmmaking. Start with! Since musical comedies were quite rare behind the Iron Curtain - forty years old, they had a disproportionate impact on their audience, making great hits on some of the films. I noticed that the sound for the 1960s was much better. Directors often had to worry about outdated equipment and strict energy regulations - they had to film for seven minutes or less - and dangerous officers. I also noticed that "West Side Story" seems to have had a strong impact on "Hot Summer". Later movies do not have to measure up to "Singin 'in the rain," but they certainly look as if they beat Hell from "Bye Bye Birdy"
