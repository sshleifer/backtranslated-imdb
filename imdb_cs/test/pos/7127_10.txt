This movie is so amazing that it captures the gaming life. When I watched, I laughed so hard. The film is about a game group that has a difficult time with a campaign that their dungeon master came with. The film goes from the real world and the game world when they play in a campaign that portrays them in the game world as their character, and then switches back to the real world when not playing. The campaign is the basis of a module written by the dungeon master, Lodge. The problem is that the Lodge can't complete its module because the characters can't complete the campaign. They are more for killing and looting instead of role playing. The Lodge wants to make the role play through a campaign of something that never before. They decide to bring some more help to bring, wait for the girl to play. The Lodge also makes npc, a non-player character, a paladin, who cannot testify or do wrong, play. The movie is how they do it all and I don't want to spoil any movie anymore, so I won't say it anymore. This movie doesn't have to be a big budget movie acting need not be an Oscar worthy, but if you are into a game or a dungeon and dragons then definitely follow. They have a lot of fun making this movie and shows that I won't bash on it for all the movie issues like continuity or something that was a low budget movie that's just fun. There is some comedy slap stick that I love and some damn good writing in my opinion. So if you want a fun movie try it.
