What you saw in BULLITT and FRENCH CONNECTION is nothing compared to what you have here. Chase continues for almost 15 minutes and is the best you will ever see. This film became a classic crime drama from the flourishing of the 1970s. It's a bold and realistic depiction of the average streets of New York. Tony Lo Bianco acts as one of the most beautiful wise guys on the screen in this film. He tears off his own colleagues and does it as if the police were responsible. His childhood friend, Roy Scheider, is a street detective who is bewildered by the disappearance of the mafia. You can say that Lo Bianco is enjoying the whole movie. But sometimes the film gets dull, but then, when you feel like you want to give it up, something big happens and pulls you back inside. Don Ellis scores set the tone for the cold, gray winter in New York and all this off above, my husband Joe Spinell appears in an early role as a man in Toredano's garage. <br /> <br /> Score, 7 out of 10 stars
