My family (two 40-year-olds, 8-year-olds and my 71-year-old mother) saw it in the fifth view of April 29th. We all enjoyed the film very much. The story was good and he knew it was based on real-life events, which made him much more fun. Luke Wilson was poking (pun) to watch Tim Blake Nelson. And when he saw Neil Flynn play something other than the "average Scrub porter," it was nice. Children in the film did well and I'm sure they will all appeal to a certain demographic level at heart level. The visuals were simply beautiful and the music "Jimmy Buffet" added to "Florida Feel". Well, maybe the story was somewhat clean and well packed for some adults, but hey, who cares? I can't compare it with a book, I honestly didn't hear it until the movie came out. It was just NICE movie and had good news. Simple and simple.
