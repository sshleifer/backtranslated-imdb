... An hour of grandfather. More than gangsters, it's a detailed depiction of an American family around 1930: Father, proud of his work, worried about his son, who gave up high school, the mother he wanted to have, daughter, who forgets to have dinner in their squeezes with their hands, and twins who are absolutely loving ("don't go to sleep first, please!"). And there's a grandfather playing his Yankee doodles on his flute. Did you notice that this tune plays the same role as "Que Sera Sera" Doris Day in Hitchcock's "The Man Who knew Too Much" (1956)? finally the bravest person in the family. As old as he doesn't tell you his age, but he is proud of his country and defies the hateful blackmail of a gangster. Wellman's good movie.
