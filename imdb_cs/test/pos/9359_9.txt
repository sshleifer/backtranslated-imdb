The March 1947 New York Times article described Crossfire as one of the first Hollywood films of the 1940s, when "faced with racial and religious prejudices with more courage than spectators were expected to expect". While RKO produced Crossfire, Twentieth Century-Fox made the Gentleman's deal, another story of anti-Semitism. RKO raced to beat the much "ballyhooed" Fox picture of theaters, releasing Crossfire a few months before the gentleman's agreement. In July 1947, RKO introduced Crossfire for representatives of various Los Angeles religious groups. In addition, several surveys that were designed to measure viewers' prejudices were made before and after the film was projected. Crossfire received both praise and criticism for his depiction of anti-Semitism in America and was the subject of many editorials. Crossfire received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, but lost to the Gentleman's Agreement. It was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor (Robert Ryan), Best Supporting Actress (Gloria Grahame), Best Director and Best Screenplay (Adaptation). In September 1947, Crossfire was named Cannes' Best Social Film. In December 1947, Ebony, an African-American publication, awarded the film its annual award for "improving understanding between people." He loved this movie.
