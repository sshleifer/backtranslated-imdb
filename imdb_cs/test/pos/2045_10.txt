I'm a Geena Davis fan for this movie. I always loved Samuel L Jackson. And two are making a great pair on the screen. This means I think the 'TLKG' is the best action movie I've ever seen, forgetting the twist endings that viewers are now expecting, and that filmmakers are now trying to (mostly failures) incorporate into their films. br /> 10/10
