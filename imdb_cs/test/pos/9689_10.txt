Seriously people need to lighten and just accept that funny is funny, and this movie is f ** king cheerful. Better than the first and Knoxville really grew up a couple for this movie and made a way more crazier pieces then first. If Ebert and Roper (not saying I'm their big fan), they can look around the pure idioc of this movie enough to give it 2 inches up and think other people can. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was on the floor and it's rare if the sequel is better than the original. This new one I believe exceeds the first big time. So what I did, just relax the kick back try not the barf at some points and laugh the ass off.
