Although it may not be the best work of Cassavetes, Minnie and Moskowitz are almost perfect in all their efforts. The storyline is whimsical and charming and surprisingly dramatic with an impressive range of emotions - much more than a dramatic comedy, unlike the IMDb profile. Yes, the story is moody, but not arbitrary; it succeeded as credible, though violent - which I will return. All artistic aspects are true forms of Cassavetes: cinematography and cameraman are perks and the soundtrack - though barely there - is free. In addition, I believe I've noticed some nods to Godard and similar adjustments - as I did in several other Cassavetes movies - (especially the sudden division of a song in one scene) that are interesting. <br /> <br /> I feel that the land is nicely built, with the first half being particularly pleasing. For example, Seymour's interview with Morgan Morgan (Timothy Carey) in the dining room is amazingly witty and fascinating and sets the tone for philosophical commentary from the whole film. This philosophy - a tradition in Cassavetes' movies - is what the film did for me. Seymour's amusing and deep monologues instantly eliminate the first impressions he can make of him as a hippie simp - though his character is curiously similar to what he has in Faces (1968). This, however, led me (at the second observation) to believe that he was opposed to Cassavetes' best work. I got an affection for this movie, which I missed when I first viewed it. Unfortunately, there are several aspects that make this film imperfect. I consider the plot to be unbalanced. As I said earlier, it stops nicely, but a little bit back and forth, especially towards the end. Due to the spontaneous style Cassavetes worked in, and especially the freedom with which he allowed his actors to improvise, the quality of his product can easily go in both directions. In this case, it is inconsistent. I judge that most of this film was improvised and most of it was beautiful. But one or two scenes, unfortunately, just don't work. Especially the scene after Seymour struggles with Minnie's co-worker outside her house. While intended as the most intense scene of the film, Cassavetes allowed his actors to start the dialogue - assuming some were pre-planned. I think it was a mistake. One gets the impression that Cassel does not know what to do, because he repeatedly mumbles in his speech, often makes no sense, and exaggerated; it all hurts the scene and character development. I understand that Seymour is supposed to be a bit insolent crazy, but Cassella's attempts are not being applied correctly here. Why did you cut a mustache? These shortcomings result from: lack of direction on the Cassavetes section; lack of understanding and anticipation in the Cassel section; lack of testing and preparation; Obviously, Cassavetes did not learn from his mistakes because he allowed the same thing to happen in his next film, Woman Under the Influence (1974) - a perpetrating scene and ending. The defects I mentioned are not smaller but they do not disturb the film. They simply make some cringe-worthy and unrealistic scenes, spoiling the flow of the film and compromising its potential. I am very, very happy, Cassavetes and all his actors, especially Cassel, despite the mistakes I mentioned. This is a very enjoyable movie, although it shows the uncertainty of Cassavetes' style.
