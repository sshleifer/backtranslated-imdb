I think this is one of the top five Burts movies, along with Deliverance, Smokey and Bandit, Boogie Nights and City Heat. He also conducted this so he had the talent for it as well as his mate Clint Eastwood. I wish he did more movies like this or even the sequel to Sharkys Machine than Stroker Ace or Cannonball Run II. It's a tough, harsh cop thriller with Reynolds at the top of the game. Beautiful Rachel Ward in the Thorn Birds fame also helped. Henry Silva is an evil man and always has a good job. The movie also has a great soundtrack. I highly recommend this, I wish it was on DVD in the UK, audio commentary from Reynolds would be great as well. *** 7/10 ***
