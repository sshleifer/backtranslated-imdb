'Sleight of Hand' is my favorite episode of the Rockford Files series. This episode shows the side of Jim Rockford that is usually ignored. Jim is truly in love with a beautiful woman and is shown as a father figure to his young daughter. The woman is recently divorced and she and Jim have recently returned from a weekend escape with a teen. After a special turn of events, a woman is discovered missing after returning to her home. Rockford's story to his fathers, Rocky, about the events that led to the disappearance of a woman, reminds Mike Spillane's Mike Hammer series from an earlier era. After much reflection and reflection, and with Rocky's encouragement, Jim encounters a clue that sends him away to investigate the disappearance with his usual perseverance. Unfortunately, Jim's girlfriend, Karen, unwittingly witnessed some mafia activity while staying at Buena Vista Inn. The bosses of the crimes responded by killing Karen and replacing another woman with Jim's car. The cheater, supposedly asleep in the back seat, left her immediately upon arrival. A few cover murders follow, and Jim proceeds to deal with them while under suspicion from LA Police, even if orders are issued for his arrest. This episode evokes a more emotional response than all other Rockford episodes combined. James Garner as Jim Rockford is seen at his most vulnerable moment, yet retains the mind's presence to continue the case. This is personal for Jim Rockford. In this case, he's not hired to do the job, but he's trying to restore his lost love to save her life. Unfortunately, this is not possible, but Jim is trying to resolve his feelings, but it is obvious that he will soon not get through the injury. Despite the recall of the main story, there are many key questions, but it has not been answered in this episode. (1) What happens to the young daughter of Jim's girlfriend? (2) What did Karen actually see at the hotel that killed her? (3) How could Jim run a cheater clock in the back seat without noticing? (4) Daughter said "Mum didn't come back with us". So why didn't the girl cry or cry when she noticed her mother was missing a long car ride for hours? Regardless of these ambiguities, "Sleight of Hand" is the Rockford Files episode that is closest to being a blockbuster. Tension is convincing and the story is told in a sensitive and vulnerable style that makes Rockford's pain feel.
