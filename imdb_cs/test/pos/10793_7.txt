I tend to tend to films about people who choose to overcome censorship barriers and express what they want to express. Eric Bogosian Barry's character is like Howard Stern, but much more intelligent. The character itself is very fascinating. Like Oliver Stone, I was probably expecting more. The film gets a little twisted at the third action. In addition, it is clear that "Talk Radio" is based on a game with long dialogue scenes. Overall, however, the film works. Bogosian is great in leadership, and the fact that he also wrote a play from which the film was founded probably helped him. If you want to watch one of the Stone movies, I suggest you check out "JFK" or "Salvador". This is not his best work, but a good movie.
