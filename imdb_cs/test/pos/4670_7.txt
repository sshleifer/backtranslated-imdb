Not a movie to see if you want to be intellectually stimulated. If you want to have a lot of fun in the theater, it's just that. Lots of nasty jokes (and really kitschy jokes). Mos Def and Seth Green are very funny as comic relief. Exciting and creative lies and chases. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron (sexy) are attractive leaders. And Donald Sutherland!
