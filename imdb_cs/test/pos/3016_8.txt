I do not want to go into the criticism of the film, which, in my opinion, is very special and courageous for a big budget film. I just wanted to note that I am really full of studies of the policies and laws of the different countries that treat their viewers as children. The database contains at least 4 different versions of the movie by running time. However, it is likely that there are many more different cuts. The result is complete confusion and you can never be sure of talking about the same movie (if you live in Argentina where the movie runs for 115 minutes, which sounds absolutely perfect). <br /> <br /> Later on, DVD and Video are trying to rob us by selling us a predictable director's cut-out (in Germany this version is about 110 minutes). It would be nice if the studios not only take into account the money they make from their films, but also their products as a work of art, even with the risk of unfavorable rating, so that I do not have to be deceived as a viewer. take it seriously, not just as a source of money.
