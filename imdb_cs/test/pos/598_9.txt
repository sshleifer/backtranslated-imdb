The first feature film Muppet Movie and in addition to maybe the Muppet Christmas Carol, a film puppeteer all over the world still looking for a guide. Disney did Muppets dis-service and this film proves it over and over again. With classic comics and star star guests, they stick to a simple but original plot, the classic Muppet lame joke, the brilliant Paul Williams in songs and insanity Electric Mayhem, and come up with an amazing movie, especially when you realize that the main casts are puppets. Only Croft approached Hensen's genius with puppets. Half of the fun playing today is that actor actress / actress still alive ???? I can only hope that Frank Oz and Dave Goelz and the rest of the surviving muppeteers can somehow save and revive Kermit and the company from Disney's deadly grasp.
