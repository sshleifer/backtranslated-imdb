Why all the negative reviews ??? Didn't you expect a movie like this to be a masterpiece you did ??? What we have is a movie that tried to entertain us and worked for me. It's not oskar, just fun. You can really see how the film has grown, especially with everything the internet has to offer today. I still remember when it was first released and the network was still so new. Crazy and frightening thoughts when I saw it for the first time; I was fifteen and seriously thought someone could get information about your computer and destroy you. But who says it can't happen ??? I'm not the kind of person who should be killed by the film to analyze it until I'm blue in the face. That's not my style. Average performance, irritated and again very entertaining. Sandra Bullock as Angela Bennett is so cute. This is my favorite movie with her because she is like a computer genius that I find very attractive. Of all the movies that came out in 1995, it would have to be my favorite, even though I didn't see it until 1996. My rating, 9/10, because it slowed down a bit.
