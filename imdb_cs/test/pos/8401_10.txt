My God, that was a fantastic movie. Every time we look, he takes us to another "WOW" place. Rhett & Scarlett played great Joanne & Timothy. They have done a fantastic job that has reassessed the roles of our two favorite heros. Each! It's necessary to see ..... Dont get rid of this movie. If u loved Gone With The Wind you will love this mini series. Go Rhett !!! Go Scarllett !!!
