Lubitsch's Touch is more than ever in this movie. Humor anytime and very gently. The storyline is simple, but the director has changed deliciously. The cut of the film is very clever and adds a comic effect. A real piece of comedy that is not so old for spectator XXI. Century. The character is gently breeding Gary Cooper and especially Claudette Colbert so clever and meaning with this poor Micheal in the movie. She avoids all her husband's traps and changes the situation to her advantage, very funny. And no problem, with Lubitsch, there is always a happy ending. A movie for men too confident with women. Don't let your girl watch this movie ...
