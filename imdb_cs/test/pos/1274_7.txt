Surprisingly good movie considering the circumstances of its production. Features performances from non-naming actors who rival top talent on the planet (unfortunately no convinced career). Also includes the divine ability of Christopher Nolan to write a perfect dialogue. Dialogue is what carries this story, which is about a person who likes to follow people for material for his books. Well filmed, very well groomed, even better written, and amazingly well done. <br /> <br /> This film has everything a movie needs except the people who saw it. 9/10
