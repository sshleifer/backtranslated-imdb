Have you ever wondered where the "Tuttle" episode appeared in the middle of the first season of M * A * S * H? Now the cat is out of the bag: they got it from this Soviet film, a satire about how stupid a car is, as a result of a pen slip (which says "Lieutenants, though ..." to "Lieutenant Kizh" who has no meaning) and no one to be honest or gutsy enough to resist him and just tell him the truth - Kizhe doesn't exist and never did, so he imagines an imaginary life for him and finally kills him, and 40 years later, David Ketchum and Bruce Shelly borrowed this plot and gave us basically the same story, just on the other side of what became the Cold War, proving that people in high positions can be just as stupid no matter what their loyalty is.
