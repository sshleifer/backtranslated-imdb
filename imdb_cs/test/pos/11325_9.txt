It took several years despite the late hour when it was. Like many 1980s criminal dramas, it looked cold. Physically and figuratively. But that's not a bad thing. And (of course) a low budget actually worked in his favor. Gritty during the time it appeared "slick". Allan Royal, with his arched segments, as the rapporteur wrote, gave him a slight advantage. The only actors I remembered were Scott Nylands and Tony Rosato (SCTV). The cast of the barely known was a good thing, because you saw a group as a whole and not a lot of people who supported the "star". And yes, that is young Clark Johnson (murder) in a repetitive place. <br /> <br /> I hope the DVD release is in the future. Someone wants it there?
