I have so much fun reading comments as I watched the movie! It seems to be a classic movie "Love it" or "Hate it". And I have to say that I'm not just on the "I love it" side, I'm on my limb to say it as my FAVORITE movie, EVER! Thanks to heaven I found it in the first place. Almost impossible to find, I was lucky about ten years ago to record it from the late UHF night channel. Of course, I like Sellers to make me a little biased, but I don't see how someone with cornball, a dry sense of humor (like me), can't be in love with this movie. The story is great (but perhaps like the previous poster he said, maybe why it's not a well-known film ... an upset medical field?) Acting is great (I see why some may say that acting was terrible). but that's what makes this movie so great ... it's a total favor) and humor is gut busting. I am proud to have been watching this film for less than twenty times, and almost every line has been remembered. This movie is a genius!
