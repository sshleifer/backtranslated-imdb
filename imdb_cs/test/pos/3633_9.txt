Years ago, I read "A Máquina" (Machine). When I read this little book again and again, I could never stop more and more fascinating with the writer's imagination and the wealth of Brazilian culture. <br /> <br /> When I knew about the movie, I was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorite books! Well, happily, my fears were unfounded and the film is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art. <br /> <br /> I can't remember any other movie that could cause tears in the eyes because of the very beauty of the text. Also, I can't remember such powerful performance as Gustavo Falcão. You can see and feel how colossal his love for Karina is. You can realize that the mountains will move and do something for this love. See this movie, watch it with the boy who lives in you, be enchanted!
