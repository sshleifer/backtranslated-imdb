I would like to start by saying that I can only hope that the creators of this film and his sister film Alien (directed by a great non-galist stylist who is Jopi Burnama) know in their hearts how much joy they have brought and my friends in the sleepy northeast Jarrow. <br /> <br /> From the initial pre-credit sequence that can be dragged so lightly, despite the man sliding down a motorcycle window, the helpless destruction of the lab, the introduction of one of the most annoying and anemic villains in film and costume design that Jean Paul Gautier would find ott and gaudy. Don't make mistakes; This is a truly unique experience. Early highlighting - blast (get used to it, lots of others from where it comes!) Followed by a close up of our chubby heroine and the most detailed reading of "daddy" in vivid memory. And then ... the theme of the song ... <br /> <br /> Yeah, it deserves its own paragraph. Singing AJ, written by people who really want to remain anonymous, makes songs written for Rocky's movies like Schubert. This is the 80th hero of narcissism motivation at all times high, with the choice of texts like "just me and you, his descent into the wire" and a lot of talk about the need to "cross the line" (this will make sense in time - our hero cares bona fida). Not to mention Indonesian supremas who seductively release a film title. At this point, no one who wants to shut down officially has a pulse. Our hero is Semitic cop Peter Goldson (greatly written by the star Intruder Peter O'Brien), the "stabilizer" of the title. The man's bull in a china shop to fight crime, and in particular its less than subtle secret work, really leaves much to be desired, but is undoubtedly an entertaining guide through the middle streets of Jakarta city center, with the sleaze ball captain Johnny in tow as well as Peter's own waste of space fashion partner Sylvia Nash, who does little. So many peaks, so little time - "glass please" arrogance Peter is not very convincingly argued case against the main baddie Greg Rainmaker (the fans of the aliens will know the hairy slimy bastard Craig Gavin as a whopping John White - eh? No! Oh! ), the x mark indicates a point map of stupidity, our hero earned a terrible advantage at the moment of weakness in her weakness by the heroine Tina Probost, who turned on a stab operation as a member of a particularly spectacular dance section. And believe me it hardly covers. There was no time to go into a conspiracy that was about hunting a drug detection system and a kidnapped professor with an alarming but commendable amount of national pride. Or our hero appeared at a funeral dressed as if he were on Boogie Nights. Or a totally hysterical crack between Captain Johnny and Goldson - two guys never made harder friend friend Shtick's weather than these clowns. The trowel might have been too fine to think. Ah's tails from people, and you never thought that scenes of ruthless destruction and general chaos could be so incredibly boring, but the nature of interaction is great, dialogue really invaluable and the inability to exhibit at the show . Oh and people's shoes - watch your shoes!
