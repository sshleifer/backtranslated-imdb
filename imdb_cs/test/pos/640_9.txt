Billy Hughes is a mute young make-up lady in a cheap horror movie shot in Moscow by an American director. One night Billy gets into a film studio. Later in the night, she hears that someone can be in the building and go check it out. This is the moment he encounters a woman who is brutally murdered while she is filmed. After escaping the clutches of the murderers, Billy informs the authorities only to be reddish when men show it was an act. Billy knows what she saw, and soon her life is once again out of the way of underground characters who believe she has something important. I don't know how my heart-pounding fret went through, but I thought it was a much older movie. But there is one thing that must be one of the most enduring and intense thrillers I've ever seen. It's just a big builder of tension and most of it fits into place! The first half of the feature is surprisingly grasped by strained sequences that have your heart in your throat, and the clouds surround us with an atmospherically anticipated alienation environment. Wonder is a wickedly evil black stripe. Bugs arise in the story, as it loses that frantic grasp that kept so early and goofy humor (or better putter comic relief) between the characters of Fay Ripley and Evan Richard's hit and miss affair by being too strong. In the long run, this could probably be without. Despite some moments, this aspect did not prevent my enjoyment. For me, the soft end decided to go with just not feeling well. An interestingly mysterious assumption was scary on the bones and wrapped up some disturbing goods. So versatility was the context and its excitement, there was something fresh as it all goes, and the nervous shocks and unbearable tension are drawn into a series of sudden folds and twists. Indeed, they have made excellent use of the new idea of ​​this disability and disability situation, by staging it at a foreign site where not too much has spoken English, so we found ourselves in turmoil too. Delicate Marina Zudina publishes appalling portrayal of American German girl Billy. The way she was able to portray unpredictable emotions through her eyes and actions gave him some gruff and credibility. Director Anthony Waller shoots in a quick, stylish, well-timed and skilful way without losing the dirty look that stems from his stiff surroundings and the powerful air music that always rises on you. The only real name to make the look was a small portrait part of Alec Guinness. The performance of the actors was fine, especially the bites of Oleg Yankovsky and Igor Volkov as Russian murderers. This riveting function, which is mostly unknown, is much better than average darkness. thriller. Highly recommended.
