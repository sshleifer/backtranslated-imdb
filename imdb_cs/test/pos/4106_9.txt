I went to the movies in 1973 when the movie was released, at the time I was 11. I remember how much I enjoyed it and wanted to live in Shangri-la, that was naive and young. I recently came across a video from a movie that I recorded off the TV a few years ago. I watched it again and I am not ashamed to admit that I still enjoy it as I did 29 years ago. I also enjoyed listening to the lyrics because I thought one day we would be able to live in a place where the sound of our weapons wouldn't hit our ears and when we look at our reflection - we should be satisfied with what we see. This is what I call the film "feel good" because I feel happy after watching it. Maybe I'm still naive, but it makes me happy and I'm sure it will make you happy when you look at it with an open mind and enjoy what it is - a good family movie. I have to be one of the few people who have this movie on VHS PAL video - and DVD (self-made). I was recording it on a DVD because the video recording from the TV began to be thin. I look at it from time to time.
