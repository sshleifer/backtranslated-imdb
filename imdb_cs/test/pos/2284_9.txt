I currently live in Japan. I saw this movie on TV and I was very impressed by the accuracy and sincerity in the depiction of Western and Japanese ideologies that collided. Who wrote the script and directed this film must have a good knowledge of what it is like to be a foreigner living in Japan. The only part I thought was too Hollywood is when Tom Selleck kisses the woman in the middle of her office and leaves him. Public expressions of affection are not really acceptable here. Finally, a film that emphasizes a real 'gaijin' experience! 9/10
