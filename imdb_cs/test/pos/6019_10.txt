It is easily one of my favorite musicals of all time. Bette Midler comes as close as possible to the real magic on the screen, because anyone has in his turn like chirp Gypsy Lee, a bosomie, a brave and very scary mother. It evokes a sense of despair, which is sometimes both comical and tragic, but always true and quite beautiful. Such magic and gravel is truly a pioneering woman without borders. This border is discovered for children. Who in turn has to create his own in a world dominated by their dominating mother. This particular version is, as I understand it, in its entirety, including the brilliant choreography of Jerome Robbins as well as the original stages.
