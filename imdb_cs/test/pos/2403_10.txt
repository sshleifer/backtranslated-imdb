"Another Karate Kid" is an excellent movie full of adventures and new surprises. It has a wonderful land and morale that tells an amazing story. Hilary Swank is doing an incredible job in achieving Julie's role. I have seen the actor who plays Mr. Miagee and that is, in my opinion, one of his best performances. The film is fun and charming and I can't emphasize enough how interesting the movie is. I definitely made this movie 10 out of 10. I suggest a movie for anyone who likes a good movie.
