Unless a joke offends anyone, it's not funny. Inki's cartoons are offensive, no doubt about it. This is rap music. Get over it. I believe that every reasonable Black man will find the funny Inki cartoons and that the people who are offended by them White people who still think Black needs his patronage from racist humor. Seriously, Inki cartoons are funny. I'm sorry, not because someone is really offended, but because someone might, maybe be insulted, I can't buy Inki cartoons or the African Queen or a song in the south on DVD.
