Synopsis: Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag) finds himself on a trainer who finds himself on a desert land where it seems to be his last stop. He doesn't know how he got there, but he was greeted with a welcome sign. After a while he thought about his stay, he is greeted by a man who takes him to a new life. He then enters a world different from where he came from. As Andreas is quickly introduced to his new accounts, he feels that his surroundings are too uniform for his sympathy. Taking her first lunch break, she immediately notices that everyone in town is in gray suits. The same day he sees a fellow businessman dead on some fencing that looks like a suicide act. The strange thing is that the city people are not paying attention to this terrible act and go on as if it had never happened. It is quick to see that these people are genetically numb, and their ability to distinguish between anything human or non-human is missing. <br /> <br /> To help Andreas settle down, he is invited to go to the local nightclub with his colleagues. The club seems to be a step further away from becoming as exciting as bingo night. And as Andreas drinks his grief, he realizes that no matter how much he drinks, alcohol has no effect on him. When he says these observations to strangers in a man's room, the man in the toilet box begins to pronounce the words that were on Andreas's mind. He realized that this person was thinking about what he was and followed him to his home, where he noticed where he was living to learn about it. The story evolves predictably with Andreas, who wants to escape. He's looking for the man he'd followed ... hoped he could bring him back to man ... but is it late? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: This Norwegian film is something everyone should see because it has a big question! What is the meaning of life? (well, pretty close). The film outlines the dark facts of what happened to today's working man (or woman). His only purpose is to make people realize that life is too short to be materialistic. He tries to show that small clich√©s, such as the sound of children playing, should not be taken for granted because the moment you are away from the robot, when you stop hearing this sound. The end of the film reiterates what happens when it's too late to escape the mundane routine you get used to. You start accepting the proverb "if it's not broken, don't fix it" and become too comfortable to risk changing. Although this film is not to be used as a piece of realism ... its message is more than real. The lack of empathy expressed in the film and the one seen by Andreas is a bold statement about what life can happen. Director Jens Lien made a film that would fail in other director's hands. He's a great movie genius and I'm waiting impatiently to see what he'll do next. The main role played by Trond Fausa Aurvaag is perfectly cast. Trond, representing average Joe, is a good catalyst that makes this image darkly funny. Supporting actors also do work apt and for some reason, I feel that Keanu Reeves would be perfect in this movie because most of the support casts required their actions to be emotionless. for this movie it was beautifully composed. A recurring theme has always been a pleasure to listen to, and provided a very nasty but welcome feeling to the film. Set to release date in the UK on May 25, 2007, I'll definitely be going to survive this experience on the big screen. This movie got its way in my top 10 ... now quickly became my top 20! He has some shocking scenes, and is darkly funny throughout ... MUST-SEE !!
