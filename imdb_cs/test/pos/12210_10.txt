I'm new in it, so please. I am a big fan of the Surface. I thought the screenplay and computer graphics were exceptional, as good as any Sci Fi movie I saw in the theater. In February, a TV guide told Season Final, the announcer for the show said something that resulted, "... and now for the Surface Final Season." Final Season, Not Final Series! I couldn't wait to get here to see another one happen. So here comes the fall and we can't find anywhere! If NBC doesn't answer, what about Sci Fi or the US? It seems to me that Bay Watch didn't last long on ABC and then the US picked up and went to gang busters! (I bet ABC was still) Ha! If not a series, then at least a mini series to give us all loyal fans closure. What happened to our guy trapped in the church tower? Was it a creature in the Nim Chapel? Did he have a grouth spert? Is the cloned guy coming to our side? There are so many unanswered questions. Thank you for listening to me babbling!
