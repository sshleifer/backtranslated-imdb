My favorite police series of all time turns into a TV movie. It works? Yes. Gee runs for the mayor and shoots. The murder of the "Hall of Fame" appears. Pembleton and almost all the cops who played in this series. Lots of flashbacks will help you who hasn't seen the TV series but also the fans. For the last five minutes, she'll have another murder and two dead cops appear at the end. And a short look from my favorite coroner, Juliana Cox. That's a good movie.
