I first saw this movie on hbo around 1983 and I loved it! I was looking for all the auction websites to buy a copy of VHS. This is a very good stimulating film with a few twists that make it more interesting. I don't want to say too much, because if you had a chance to see it, you'll be glad I didn't say too much!
