Dirty Dancing one of my favorite movies. I only watched it twice on ABC because I didn't have a chance to buy it or rent it from Blockbuster. I had no idea that Jennifer Gray was 27 when she made the film because she was very convincing as a teenager. Compared to some women in Hollywood, she has a very flat chest, which is why I was so easily fooled about my age. So both physically and emotionally, Gray goes off to play very well. I also loved dance - who? I've been watching Dirty Dancing both times, I still want to look for dance classes. I also like the soundtrack and I know some of the songs when I was eight or nine. I would like to be able to follow it in my dramatic class, and I will at some point ask my teacher if there is any part of the film he can use for educational purposes. It's much better than the things he'd been following last year. And the end was absolutely fantastic. This is one of the best moments in the movie. I can't believe I'm looking forward to the first day back to school for Dirty Dancing! Who could ask for a better influence of the film with such a title?
