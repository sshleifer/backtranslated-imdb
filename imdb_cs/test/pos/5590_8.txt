Who won Best Actress Oscar for 1933? It was supposed to be Laura Hope Crewes for her gorgeous display of the most terrible mother ever. She really is one of the great actresses of all time. She played the frivolous Prudence Duvernoy in "Camille" (1936) and her best remembered role is Aunt Pittypat in "Off with the Wind". Irene Dunne was the "official" movie star but her scenes with Laura Hope Crewes were dynamite. David (Joel McCrea) is in Heidelberg when he is offered a job in New York. His wife Christine (Irene Dunne) can continue her studies at Rockafellar Center. Their first stop in America is the visit of David's mother, Mrs. Phelps. To say that Laura Hope Crewes dominates every scene is underestimated. From her first entrance - in the frantic explosion of trying to greet her "big boy" - all the attention is on her. Even sitting at a tea table when he forgets about Hester's existence, even if he forgets how he takes his tea, you know something's not right (Hester lives for a while.) <br /> <br /> Frances Dee is absolutely sweet and so real in her role as adorable Hester. Her performance in this film, especially the scene where she has hysterics and consequences, proves how she underestimated herself as an actress she was. <br /> <br /> All young actors are excellent. Eric Linden is great as Robert, the younger son who comes to realize that his mother is terrible but can't do anything to escape her mother's magic. Joel McCrea, in one place says "painting roses on the baths - that's your style". Robert's sexuality has a very subtle design. Irene Dunne is excellent in any film or genre she has tried.
