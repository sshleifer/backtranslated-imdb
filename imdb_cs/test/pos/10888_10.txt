You only wear the best Armani Italian suits, hand-sewn and customized to your precise measurements. Your car is the best that German engineering offers and is equipped with so many tools as under the hood. You are a member of the best clubs, you often eat in restaurants like Spago, and are always accompanied by at least two of the most beautiful women in the world. Your pocket watch acts as a nuclear explosive, while your faithful pen can also be used as a .22 semi-automatic weapon. You are snowing in the Alps, diving in the Caribbean, diving in the Andes, and never in place when your hair is never. You are Bond, James Bond, the world's most famous spy, the favorite son of the good queen, the bad boy of the British SS and perhaps the most wanted man in the world. The character of James Bond was created by Ian Fleming, and is the film industry's longest lasting icon, being the subject of over fifteen films spanning four decades. The last man to play is Pierce Brosnan, who took over the role of James Bond from Timothy Dalton in 1996 and debuted in 007 at Goldeneye. This is the setting for the first major title developed by a third party on Nintendo 64. Goldeneye, developed by Rare for Nintendo, has been on the market for some time. His continuing dominance in sales charts is just one proof of how good this game is, and no review library would be complete without it. <br /> <br /> Let's face it - most of the time, movie-licensed games are forfeited. Although this is a good combination, the results were largely terrible. Games like Cliffhanger, True Lies, Lethal Weapon, and not all Star Trek flops, are ammo enough against this mix. And for the record I'm not a fan of film-licensed games, especially when I saw the movie. At least I thought so. In the case of Goldeneye, I had more reservations than usual. While it's not a bad movie, the Goldeneye movie didn't have such an attraction to it, and I have no place in the top ten among Bond movies. But as a game, let's say it's a completely different story. <br /> <br /> The game is a first-person shooter and, to be successful, you will need at least as much brain as it is being stressed. . For those who have seen a movie that I think is most of you reading this story, the story is very consistent and follows the path of the film with little variation. The conspiracy to control the world's most dangerous satellite, Goldeneye, began in the USSR, and in this process a beautiful woman was captured. Your missions will be many, extreme dangers. You will have to rely on your wits and experience to get to the most challenging missions the world has ever known. M will brief you as soon as you are ready. Hello, James.
