The problem with this series is that it is too real. I watch it on Amazon "Unbox" and I just finished episode 2 I hate, totally hate, Fark, cell leader. I can't remember any TV series that has this emotional impact. Remember the old line of horror movies "Just Say It's the Only Movie"? I have repeatedly reminded myself that his "only television". But of course it's not just television, is it? The possibility of a cell such as that actually operated in the United States is certainly in the range of credibility. This is what gives this program bad authenticity. And that's why I hate him so much.
