That was such a funny movie that was soon forgotten, probably because there are so many teens and young adult comedies like this. The film is not as predictable as one would think. Crawling is unattractive but fun and caring and most importantly a very devoted friend. An unlikely match is for Rebecca, who has an attractive and seemingly nice friend at home. When she feels better at school by showing her around and encouraging her to meet more, they become friends, but it's completely platonic. When she realizes that her boyfriend might propose, doesn't feel ready, she seems to love her boyfriend, but she seems to be enjoying her free life at a college party that isn't yet ready to live marriage and responsibility . You will learn what a good friend Crawl is when he tells her that she will help her out of her marriage. When her friend suggests to her in front of her family, she kicks Crawl and puts him in place. She tells the whole family he designed for her and gives her her diamond ring that has run out all the time (he had to come out of money or something. The message of the film didn't seem to judge people by their looks, not judge people before Rebecca's friend, who loves her parents, changed when we found out that after Rebecca (Amber Thesan) and Crawl, he drunk his new girlfriend, so Rebecca broke up with Crawl and thought she was a couple. so it wasn't, Rebecca was upset at him, which, when you think about it, was a bit unfair because it wasn't a couple, but I think they started to like each other and I think she thought there were more. they never showed that they actually became a couple, but left them open to the audience to make a decision, not even actually kissing at any time, even though there was one part where they almost did it. Many people saw it and said they would be the father to see that their daughters were bringing home or shock, but they were just friends all the time, even to the end. And she did not introduce him as her friend; they still haven't told their parents they're not employed. Rebecca almost did. Even if she had never become her friend, they could still be friends. For some reason, the Femanin men were in the 1990s, and there was this great stereo type that a woman likes femanin's men (not something wrong with it), I think she comes from the fact that women love the kind that Crawl was able to be, thanks to his friendship with Rebecca. but when I saw the movie, I must admit that if I went to look, I thought I'd go to my first friend. Yet it was a creative film that tried to teach a friendship lesson and judge others.
