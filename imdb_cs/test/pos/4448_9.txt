Perhaps the most respected film, Lucio Fulci, "Don't Torture and Duckling", is renowned for its strange theme, horrific images and powerful storyline. Terror boasts a small Italian village when young boys begin to assassinate and engulf confused and determined authorities plus a dedicated detective in secret. Was he a haunted hermit? Spastic voodoo witch? One of those hookers? Rich girl? Someone else? Unlike most fans, there is frequent representation on the violent content of the film - I consider it much more conspicuous; featuring only one real moment of unforgettable bloodshed (including chains and boards). In no aspect does it interfere with the positive attributes this film brings. Fulci proves that he is fully capable of fueling one hellish dark and disturbing giallo with childhood killing, black magic, and of course a nice full set. Skin "and" New York Ripper "," Don't Torture Duckling "dominates the giallo genre as a whimsical and compelling murderous secret!
