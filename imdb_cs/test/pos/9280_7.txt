Um .... a serious film about troubled teenagers in Singapore, a country I don't have much knowledge about, but they have a previous bad impression that all the kids there are very disciplined and controlled by their family and government. Well, I think I'm wrong, like other cities / countries, but they also have their troubled teens, who also lead the not so surprising rebellious way of life of drugs, fights, bad language and ... many other obvious signs is a bad boy. The surprising part of this film is not about how these kids run around and cause themselves and other problems, but rather a gentle homosexual, hidden behind them, so they call loyalty between them. The link between these "brothers" can very well come from an unconscious homosexual tendency within these boys. Although it is not uncommon for str8 guys to have a very close friendship with each other, but to watch this movie attentively, it should be an entry into a variety of gay film festivals and I would be surprised that it can win much more awards towards that direction!
