Sometimes, but very rarely, the film tells the story so well that it is almost difficult. This movie tells a few stories so well that it was the first few times a movie I couldn't watch. It was too real .... and characters that are so strong that it became a personal struggle. When these three men and their families cope with their difficulties, one particularly often hit me too hard. Now I have watched several times as I have been without interruption, and I realize what I have always suspected. This film is a masterpiece. Writing, playing, mixing a few stories without being a little less tousled, everything about this film is exceptional. Seven Academy Awards? No wonder they certainly deserve them.
