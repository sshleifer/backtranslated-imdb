All in all, a great movie of that time and source (from Warner Brothers because it was the culmination of craftsmanship and style just before World War II), assuming you don't take it seriously. The film does not claim to be historically accurate, and certainly not more or less accurate or believable than JFK. (This one may actually be more honest about it, as it basically admits on the way that it shouldn't be considered to be particularly fact-based, but rather a stylish semi-heroic depiction.) It is worth noting that the audience was not naive about the story than we are today; The NY Times review admitted that the audience would "reject the factual inaccuracies sprinkled throughout the film," he described the biographical account of Custer's life as "fanciful," and pointed out that the presentation of Custer's motivations regarding the closing events was at odds with various historical accounts. They could really stand overboard in building Custer, supposedly, but he admirably succeeds in portraying him as though he wasn't necessarily the sharpest or most successful person around, but appropriately determined, principled, and inspiring. Flynn and DeHavilland, along with their eighth film in 7 years (and their latest), are so comfortable and easy to play at this point that it's not too difficult to overlook how their courtship is written here . With the first pairing it would be hard to imagine what Elizabeth could bring to Custer, but these two things work. The film is also missing their director from their previous seven films altogether (highly underrated by Michael Curtiz), but since he has worked with them on the previous similar theme of the Santa Fe Trail, it's understandable if he decided to opt out of this movie. one. (They all started with Captain Blood and The Charge of the Light Brigade - both amazing - so we can't blame them for having a hard time keeping it fresh.) Raoul Walsh, the director here, is sure more comfortable with action sequences - which are excellent - and everything else out there. The interior scenes are a little more uneven, but studio craftsmen compensate it very well, as well as an excellent cast of "usual suspects" and new faces (Greenstreet, Gene Lockhart, Anthony Quinn, Arthur Kennedy, etc.). . I would love it better if Kennedy's character was a bit smaller standard (I generally like his work), but there seems to be roughly the same comment in every scene; the part could be written better - and I think they may not have been sure what to do because he was only one year in the movies (Walsh probably took him after being together with High Sierra). > <br /> Among the most significant events include the depiction (probably imagined) of the genesis of "Garryowen" as a theme of cavalry. The last half hour is particularly excellent, especially with the line separation that is reflected at the end of their screen, followed by the final battle scenes. An exciting adventure. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
