Edward Dmytryk conducted this dark murder investigation movie, which included demobilized military personnel. Robert Young teaches us about hatred, Robert Mitchum goes through most of this painting, and Gloria Grahame returns to the seductiveness she exhibited in "It's a wonderful life". It's Robert Ryan, who gets to the center: anti-Semitism. He goes so deep into his role as Monty Montgomery (Imagine a parent named Lawrence called his son Larry!) That drama sits right on his shoulders, and he's more than a challenge. Without it, the film would be a matter of course. Ryan played a lot of unforgettable villains on his day ("Billy Budd"), but this performance put him on the map. With Sam Leven as a murder victim.
