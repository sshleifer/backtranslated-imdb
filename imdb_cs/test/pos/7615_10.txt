I saw it when he first came out and saw it several times since then. I have a DVD. It's one of Drew Barrymore's best works and one that is worth seeing more than once. <br /> <br /> Not popular in high school was one f stuff in the movie I could cover. I wasn't as tortured as Josie was (during her real high school days) or as Aldys, but I was never a major party either. Promotion scene was three popular girls victims of their own prank as Josie pushes the way Aldys (intended victims) is my favorite scene and I applauded when I first saw. <br /> <br /> Today I can watch this movie. is excellent.
