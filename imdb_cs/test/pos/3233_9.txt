I have read all of Jane Austen's novels, which took place once a year every year, from the year I was nine, and received the edition of modern libraries of collected works as a birthday present. I loved this movie for its romance and for the music that remained, scary, in my head. It was, of course, an interpretation, not an emma or sense and sensitivity, but something completely different and something that Catherine would love herself. And oh loves this passionate Henry! That was Henry Catherine's idea, and she is a romantic heroine she read about in her novels and promised us a practical Jane Austen who tells us at first that the unlikely Catherine would be one. I wonder if Jane was completely satirical in her novel. Maybe she could also imagine such Henry. I haven't seen the film for many years, at least ten years. I have longed for it since then.
