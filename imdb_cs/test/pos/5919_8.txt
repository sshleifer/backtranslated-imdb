This film recreates Lindbergh's historical flight across the Atlantic, while touching episodes in his airline career through flashbacks. Stewart was about 20 years old to play the young flyer, but his good performance, especially in solo flight sequences, makes him a little quarrel. Waxman's exciting score is a big plus. Despite the long running time, Wilder manages to make it quite exciting and is able to keep the drama even when the result is known. What was 1957 for Wilder: in addition, he wrote and directed "Love in the Afternoon" and "Witness for Prosecution". And his other two were "Some Like It" and "Apartment". What a run!
