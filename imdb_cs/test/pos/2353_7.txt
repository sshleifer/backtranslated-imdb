What makes this better than most movie movies is that it doesn't feel fake. The film tells the story of the director and his rise and fall and ascension through real recognizable names and events during silent and early sound periods. Instead of a general "out of business" sound, actually SHOW Jolson and "The Jazz Singer". Acting is really good, with believable performances by Don Ameche, Alice Faye and J. Edward Bromberg.
