This is a low budget to stop the movement of a monster movie from Brett (Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell) Piper ... and that brings just what I would expect from such a production: a light (though cheese) dialogue, some cute actresses and lots of trace animals. That's why I introduced the 10 out of 10 movie - because of what I expected to add ... and a little more: Brett doesn't hold on to the screen. He casts a lot of mistakes in his final cast. And anyway, I LOVE stop motion monsters, which compared to CGI animals in larger movies, it seems it's fun to watch.
