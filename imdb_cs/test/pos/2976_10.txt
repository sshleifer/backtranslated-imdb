I saw this movie when it was first released and enjoyed it. What movie. I am at the age of 40 and I have 2 teenagers and would like to see this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves romantic movies or older music by Elton John. I've searched most of the stores that sell new and old movies, but they haven't hit them. I bought some old movies like "Melody" in Hong Kong, which had a pretty old movie collection, but they didn't. I also watch the sequel, Paul & Michelle. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me how to get a copy of VHS or DVD or VCD. <br /> <br /> We really appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much.
