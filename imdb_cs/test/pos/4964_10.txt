Music is Stravinsky (and not a stupid incompetent Philip Glass) and was written ten years before the unfortunate birth of glass. The production is simply extraordinary. Japanese narrative adds a formidable quality and intensity that the Latin version does not have. cf. Terzieff version. Giant heads and hands are absolutely justified by the mythical aspect of the story. The props and makeup that are used for plague are simply in place. It's the best job of Taylor. The singers are very good, especially Terfel. Langridge is quite moving and pure, and Norman finds the right expression and its beauty is enlarged and finds its right place: greater than life. You just have to.
