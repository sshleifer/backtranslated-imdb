This is one of those films that critics really missed. This movie is virtually McHale's Navy for the 90s or Police Academy at Sea. Grammer proves he can play roles other than Frasier when he outwits and outfoxes the Navy to get his own sub. Rob Schneider is just as usual, as in every role he plays, and Lauren Holly is a local sexpot, though with a brain. Ken Hudson Campbell is as funny as usual with almost every line. The film has an amazing intelligent plot and an unpredictable scenario that still surprises me when I watch it. Many of the Navy's phrases and terms go over my head, but it's a small obstacle to the absolute accuracy and realism of the movie and its characters.
