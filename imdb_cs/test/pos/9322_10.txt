This excellent music film, in the beautiful Technicolor, is so amazing that it is enough for every Irish person to feel proud. Pleased with the joy and celebration of all the Irish, subtle casts, brilliant settings and great theater traps, beautiful Irish music and the excellent Irish tenor voice of Dennis Morgan, it is fortunate that the Irish have such an amazing movie to enjoy again and again! Not only for the feast of St. Patty, but for the whole year. One of Jack L. Warner's jewels during the heyday of a studio in Burbank in the 1940s. Shame on Warner Brothers for not having this fine picture on their home video and DVD!
