This parody is cleverly done: from the songs (Express Yourself becomes Expose Yourself, as the prayer is now Party in my pants and Vogue is now Vague) on the false show cast interviews, this movie is merry. Remember Madonna didn't know about the rain in Asia? He doesn't know about the volcano season in this one. It's a precious gem. They have a lot of money for the spoof and it pays off. Highly recommended !!!
