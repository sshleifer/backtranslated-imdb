Please note that this movie has nothing to do with Radio City Music Hall! As an archivist re: Music Hall .. I know what is and is not associated with the New York site. Theodore is just a "Music Hall". There are no rockets in the movie. Only beautiful skaters and great actors and fun. He just thought you'd like to know. Really beautiful movie. You will never guess who a 'killer' is while watching this movie .... until the very end. What a great plot and beautiful skating. We never see this kind of performance again. The Roxy Theater and the New York Central Theater featured skating performances on stage.
