This movie was released when I was 15 and I could easily relate to the topics the film portrayed. That was over 24 years ago and I haven't seen the movie yet. This time I crouched at some actors, but I still appreciate the film for what it is. Life is not always fair and good guys don't really win. to reflect that especially as a teenager they always did better with better girls. It also doesn't matter how nice you are that you can't make someone like you. Girls like boys like them, no matter how much you try differently. Sometimes you just have to let go and say more. Gary does a good job and shows the intensity of his feelings for Karen. This also applies to teenagers when someone fixes on them. I remember sitting with friends who laughed at our asses on some of them. The performances here are not compared to the Fast Times on Ridgemount High, but over this movie kicks ass simply because FTARH has a lame friendly ending where the film has a realistic ending. Nice guys finish last! Gary encounters very poor material, but we all know that guys who are too sensitive. We all know David, the funny guy who makes you laugh. Some people have a bag here, but the end is exactly what can happen in real life. Some chicks return even more, no matter how dude they treat them, especially at this age. I experienced the first hand. <br /> <br /> Great sound track too! U2 "Will I Follow" - Is Jesus Old?
