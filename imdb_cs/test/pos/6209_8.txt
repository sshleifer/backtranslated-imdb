Preston Sturgis' SILA AND GLORY has not been seen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s, when it reappeared and even appeared on television. Meanwhile, Pauline Kael's book, CITIZEN KANE BOOK, suggested that Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles for KANE be based on Sturgis' scenario. As mentioned at the beginning of this film thread on the IMDb website, Kael overestimated his case. There are about six storytellers who deal with the life of Charles Foster Kane: a newspaper article (representing Ralston - Henry Luce Clone), Thatcher's monographs, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane, and Raymond Butler servant. Everyone has a different propensity for Kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred for men. And, of course, everyone also reveals their own failure by telling their version of Kane's story. This method also leads to frequent overlaps of repetition of the same incident. It's not a situation in the POWER AND GLORY. Yes, just as KANE is about the legendary business leader - here is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who has risen from below to lead the country's most successful rail system. But there are only two narrators - Garner's right hand, Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This limits the almost three-dimensional view we obtained at the time of Kane in Garner. When Henry tells, he talks about his boss and a friend he respected and loved. His wife is like a skeptical public voice - he sees only shortcomings in Henry. Typical example: Although Tom managed to get up, Tom is becoming more and more anti-government in his later years. Trade unions are traumatized and he doesn't care that their shenanigans slow them down. Henry describes Tom's confrontation with the Union in a great walk and how he captivated him at the expense of home life. Henry's wife, however, reminds him of how Tom used rattling and violence to liquidate the strike (apparently fired at the headquarters of the Union - killing many people). So we have two views of a man, but one is pure white and one is pure black. I'm not really knocking POWER and GLORY for not copying the success of KANE (a few movies - including all the other Orson Welles movies), but I'm aware that the story is presented well enough to keep interest. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally, the tragedy of the mundane success of the couple is fully brought home. When Tom marries, Tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. But in America, big business success comes at a price. Tom is deeply involved in operating the empire of the railroad (expanding and continually improving it). But it takes him away from home too much and loses contact with Sally. And she also notices Eva (Helen Vinson), a younger woman who becomes his mistress. When Sally learns of her unfaithful behavior that destroys her. Similarly, Tom also gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in Henry's eyes). Eva marries Tom and presents him with her son - but it turns out to be the son of Eva Tom's son, Tom Jr. (Philip Trent). The discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes Tom to shoot himself. The film is not a total success - action jumps sometimes unconvincingly. Yet it makes business seeming (note the scene when Tom tells his board of directors about his plans to buy a small rival train line, and discusses the use of bond financing plans). Sturgis came from a rich background so he could bring this detail. So on the whole, it's a first-class film. Perhaps not CITIZEN KANE, but an interest in movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in Depression America.
