This movie has somehow plunged into the soft place of my heart. Don't ask me how it happened, but I suppose the feature film Ed "I'll sponsor whatever" McMahon as a tail cheater has something to do with it. Frankly, I was disappointed with the first flyout in 1972. Nothing more than a quick throw followed Shaft-mania. How does it unfold? Big Jim Brown seems to be stronger than here. Perhaps this is due to the fact that a year later he had something to work from instead of his simple "Shaft" motivation. The most striking part of the film is the soundtrack provided by pimp-dad number one, James Brown. Almost every scene is decorated with a touch of funk The Godfather. Excellent contemporary film, for music, wardrobe, vehicles, lingo and hair. I should also point out that this film is also an excellent film that represents the time in the history of the film when Jim Brown and Ed McMahon could really GROW their hair. Double the chickens, double the strike, triple the body count and factor in Ed McMahon and James Brown. You'll be in one hell with an action speed of the 70s, and one that pretends to be no less an ancestor. For my money, Slaughter Big Rip-Off can play the ball with any Blaxploitation movie ever made. Straight shaft. The chance is that you will disagree, but Slaughter's Big Rip-Off has its own feeling. Something was missing.
