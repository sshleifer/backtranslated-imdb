Accounts seem real with the human factor added to the mix. Lots of sadness. I'm sure I wasn't ... another thing I would add is that all the women in this show were not really nice women's bills. But I don't think it was about women, even though it was for JFK Jr.'s passion. What a shame. any loss of life is a real pity. It seemed to be a good description of his life. I recommend if you are on resumes and melodrama!
