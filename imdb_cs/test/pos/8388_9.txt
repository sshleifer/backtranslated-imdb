Inlorious Basterds is a dark and violent comic fantasy that is famous. Built on The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds turns the extended Dirty Dozen training sequence into action right away. In this process, Tarantino corrects one of the main mistakes of The Dirty Dozen by giving the screen of bad players time to remind us how badly the Nazis were. The Nazis, who have the most time on the screen, become the most comprehensive human figures in the film, which ironically makes them even worse monsters. the whole war, which showed us not only British, American and German soldiers, but also gave us insights into the world of French and German civilians, both associates and opponents. Of course, every Tarantino film will have a fantastic dialogue, but when Tarantino decided that the French characters would speak French and the Germans would speak German, Tarantino also somehow ensured that his French dialogue was as sharp and witty and clever as his English dialogue. The case at the point during the Nazi "Jewish Hunter" SS opening sequence Colonel Hans Landa (Christian Waltz) interrogates the French dairy farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet). Landa suspects that LaPadite is hiding a family of Jews. While gently pushing LaPadite, Landa asks for a glass of milk. After inhaling her greedily, Landa praises LaPadite for his daughters and his cows, "and the votre famille et Ã  vos vaches is a bravo." The point is that in French "cow" means cow, but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina. If Landa had been reprimanded for this vulgar pun, he could quite convincingly claim that he did not understand the French well enough to think so, but Landa meant it and meant it as a threat. And LaPadite understands its importance too well. It is a very fine piece of play and words that many viewers would never catch or at least understand the subtext without knowing the exact nature of the threat. The film is rich with such detail. All French and English dialogues are chosen with such attention to detail, and while I cannot swear to German, I suspect that this shows a similar level of craft. phrases, "long ago ... in Nazi occupied France." Personally, it reminds me of the opening of every book and film Asterix, another comic fantasy in a war occupied by France. Like Asterix, Inglorious Basterds is witty witty in places, even if the film is also eclipsed seriously. In his more serious moments, Inglorious Basterds reminds us that the first victims of war are compassion and the ability to relax. As in almost any extended film sequence, Tarantino finds a new way to build harsh tensions to almost unbearable levels. Tarantino also reminds us that the film is dangerous, even flammable, and that its strength deserves respect. <br /> <br /> If you see this film as I did in a packed theater filled with knowledgeable fans who wit every joke, you'll see this masterpiece as it was seen. If you are not so happy, all you see is a great, great movie that brings a darkly funny blow.
