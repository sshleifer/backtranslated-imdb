Despite the reviewers' pelvis, I liked this movie. In fact, I liked the Vampire Interview better, and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt. All the main players in the series were present: Talbot, Lestat, Armand, Maharet, Khayman, Pandora, Mael, Marius and half a dozen others (though most of them in portrait). Marius, Lestat and Akasha were the main players (and Jesse Talamasca). In spite of other reviews, I think that this film and music were faithful to Anne Rice and her ethos, at least as I see it. Aailiyah was quite good as Akasha, in convincing places (her first entrance and mini dance scene). The film did not capture the width of a series of books, but I thought it was a nice addition. I'm a big fan of this series, mainly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivity and treatment. I found this film faithful and often superlative representation of the author's vision.
