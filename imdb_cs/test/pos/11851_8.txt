Well, the film was far better than I expected. It's not boring and it's not unoriginal. It's not really a silly romantic comedy. The situation of the characters who have stood up is very unusual, of course, we are still talking about the movie, but the main characters are really plausible. Of course, Donald is exaggerated, but he's just a pawn in the movie, a way to prove something. The end is not one of those ridiculously happy, always the same, moral pieces of crap that you can usually see in the films of this genre. I really liked it and it's hard to please when it comes to this particular genre of movies. It's worth the watch. Besides, it's better than other movies, the story always stands up, the characters stand up. And they do not experience this miraculous change and love is not revealed to them as holly god given artifact, yada, yada. At the end of all that you see, going through it all, the film feels something you can even learn something or two. It is not the usual hope of producing tissue that moisturizes tissues. It's a good movie, not a consolation prize for teary women around the world.
