I wonder how many MINI Cooper cars were sold through this movie? This could not help but add to the sale of this small car, which is featured in this film, along with an attractive cast. <br /> <br /> This is a very, very fun ruse-and-chase movie. It features a "cool" cast with Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green and Jason Statham. The best chase scene is right at the start with boat chase in Venice, Italy. The film has not exaggerated violence, has a very smart scenario (with a few exceptions). it represents interesting characters and is nicely reinforced. Cat and mouse play between Norton and Theron is exciting and fun to watch. Again, we are rigged in the roots of criminals who have been portrayed as "good guys". How many times has it happened since "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" in the 1960s? It's Hollywood twisted for you. Here one of the criminals (Norton) stole and killed a leader and a paternal character (Donald Sutherland) gang, making it the worst of the bunch and movie villain. Also, the Theron character is in a typically overblown-feminist mode of Hollywood in which women can do all things (including driving a car) better than a man. The third minor irritation is Seth Green's smug, clever attitude that we have along with the fact that it is a side and a cold. Despite these obstacles, it's a very funny movie and it's also not overboard for profanity or sex .... and, yes, those little cars are fine. Everyone I talked to who saw this movie enjoyed it.
