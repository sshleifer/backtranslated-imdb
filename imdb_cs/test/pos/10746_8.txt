Dragon Ma (Jackie Chan) is back and got rid of the seas of the feared Pirate Lo. Back on Earth, he is assigned to the police, where he is cleaning up corruption and crime in the local suburb. Along the way, he is imprisoned in the fate of several Chinese patriots who seek compassion and support for their revolutionary cause. The Chinese Manchu government is following these revolutionaries, and anyone standing in the way is in trouble, even if they are in police force. I had great expectations for this movie after I saw Project A. But unfortunately I was a bit disappointed. There is little action compared to the first film. There is only one good battle scene to the end. That battle scene is in "gangster place" and its good, a lot of people fly everywhere and hard kicks and blows are thrown. Jackie Chan and his stunt team won't disappoint. The end is very fun, Jackie Chan shows us why he is the best stuntman in the world. Really exciting things! The only bad thing about the end is that the fighting is too short and forgotten. Conclusion: Many funny moments, good gaming and crazy pieces. But not enough to fight for top ranking.
