This film is amazing, even though it is not perfect in Hollywood standards, it includes a gentle look at the broad division between rich and poor, black and white, which is true in many parts of the world. She manages the audience with baby gloves and at the same time brings a true look at social problems. Children are beautiful, pay special attention to the young man who plays Sipho. The friendships that are developing are generally true, everyone can relate to the choices that young people have to make. The influence of adults is interesting - it seems to be taken from real life experiences, because there are snippets of conversations and interactions - much like a child remembering they are experiencing. I highly recommend this movie.
