This is one of those games where you like to make pieces or hate to shreds.Even be a hardcore fan of Mario may not like you this game. You can hate it because it's 2 short and somewhat boring and easy. because it is a blend of awesome graphics (not a Nintendo fan of huge excitement) of music or play play. \ tI know many people who say it's awesome and others who think its the worst Mario ever. Type Nintendo fan of you.I personally love this game and I think it's the best wii game but you should specify that for yourself. So i think you should absolutely get it if you are the right Nintendo fan. classics too much, you may not like it. \ tSo try it yourself.
