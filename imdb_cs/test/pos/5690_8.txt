As a child, I loved the song "Never try to crocodile" and when I was in this state, which is actually inspired by real events. Smiling would be the last thing in my mind. I've never been so entrenched since the opening set, caught up and finally exhausted as I was when I watched this limited budget Independent Australian Horror Movie, about three people in the Northern Territory trapped in a mangrove swamp with a very pleasing crocodile waiting in the water below. What the movie really came to life was how realistic it was in the transport of fear and uncertainty about the situation of the characters to the audience. Semi-documentary camera work with an incredibly frightening backdrop and authentic performance will take you away from your comfort zone effectively. What we get is the survival story of a patient, rather than just a bloody, mundane creature that has a bust. Think of "Open Water (2003)", where his budget and time constraint made sure he remained low, but this minimal barrier increased the experience. The slow cut story may be black and white, but it never seemed to be usable, nor subject to formal formulas. Not much of it, and the connection between the characters was emotionally engaging even with a bare, straightforward scenario. Although you can say "less is more", with actions and expressions illuminating the lingering thoughts plaguing their minds. Suffering is absolutely scary because the threat is very lively and never seems to be loose. This is what drives the chaotic adrenaline of the film, and in which it lasts (even when buried) to the very end. Writers / directors Andrew Traucki and David Nerlich's economic guidance are alienating and elegantly stringing the viewer through their tense stimulating and psychic features. In some patches, the notch is raised, with tension induced tension and surprising images. The method of performing the night sequence is extremely cool and pulsating. Terrible crocodile handling toys with fresh meat in an unpleasantly thrilling approach. Sure, some moments seemed unlikely, but it never gets in the way or inattentive. The FX FX is the key, and occasionally the lack of some just eats away at you. The musical score of Rafeal May is unpretentious and does not really enter the mix, but when it does, it builds organic sound quality. John Biggins' cinematography is beautifully designed and changes rapidly as mood changes. It has always been moving and claustrophobic, but none of these jerky movements. The cut was sharply processed and the effects were professionally ensured by the great combing of a live crocodile. Something like this production would also have to rely on its cast to sell the story in a credible way and do it. Diana Glenn, Andy Rodoreda and especially Maeve Dermody are convincingly good. A lot of responsibility comes to Dermody, and she sets out on an inspired move. Now this item could copy some comparisons with another crocodile movie "Rogue (2007)", but both couldn't be different in what they want to be and how they end up. If I had to pick it up, I'd lean more towards this expedition to get involved with you. A remarkable effort on all fronts, where everyone has taken part, to be really careful.
