BONJOUR, MONSIEUR SHLOMI is just a wonderful movie! Writer / director Shemi Zarhin has created a story, unlike others, and cast it with so consistently gentle actors that it is a riddle to me that this movie has not become a popular viewer around the world. It's intelligent, emotional, uplifting and warm, fun, and it's a winner in all categories. Shlomi (Oshri Cohen, in a brilliantly underrated performance) is a 16-year-old boy who cares for his very dysfunctional family: his mother (Esti Zakheim) is about as disgusting as ever fictional and in a constant state of bad mood because her husband cheated on her and because a working double shift stuck to support her father-in-law (Ariek) Elias, who as Shlomi's grandfather is a bright, funny, wise, loving old man who cares deeply for Shlomi); married sister Ziva (Rotem Abuhab), who regularly returns to the house because of her constant sleep with her husband, who does not help her with the care of their sons; his brother Sasi (Assi Cohen) whose life is a loud electric guitar, a braggadocio about female conquests, and a favorite son of his mother. This blend is mixed to produce a penultimate non-functional family unit. Shlomi cooks gourmet meals, shops, cleans the house for them, delivers delicacies, bathes and takes care of this grandfather, and generally leads a life of serfdom to a family who considers him a "retard". school due to lack of time devoted to family care and lack of concentration. His math teacher Begin (Nisso Keavia) notices his natural mathematical genius in his discarded test and, with the help of a director (Yigal Nair), encourages him to be tested and found to be a genius (? Dyslexia?) to try a special school in Haifa. Shlomi's mother hears none of this, but between the battle with Shlomi's absent father (Albert Iluz) and confrontation with the teacher and the director, he finally agrees to test him for school. Meanwhile, Shlomi discovers the girl that Ron (Aya Koren) has moved in the side door and is gradually becoming intertwined in physical and intellectual relationship. In the background, Shlomi's grandfather is always supported, and when Grandfather dies, he sets out on a journey to live his life for himself to realize his gifts, find his happiness. The way a family comes up with this deal is the top of the film and may not be revealed due to the loss of power of the message. The film is beautifully photographed, music score is beautifully creative and the end result is a celebration of the human spirit. Highly recommended at each level. In Hebrew with English subtitles.
