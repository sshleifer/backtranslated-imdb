"Shadow Magic" captures the joy and amazement of the first audience. It also shows the power of the film in its ability to bring the world a little closer, to overcome cultural barriers and to protect itself for generations to come. This film will surely be enjoyed by anyone who really loves film art. It is a great first effort by writer / director Ann Hu, who will hope to follow many films.
