My guide to film quality is when I think about it after leaving the theater. The next day I think about this, which doesn't happen often. Scenery (reasonable estimate for Italy from the 16th century), costumes, lighting, cinematography are excellent. Visually it's a beautiful movie. Characters can never step above the script they have to recite, but these actors make the most of their material, which is excellent. This is one of Shakespeare's best games that people will enjoy for the next 400 years on the road. All the directors were interesting and pleasant. Those who say it is anti-Semitic must be deaf and blind. If anything, it's a Catholic against Venitian-16. century. While Shylock plays a man controlled and tortured by the pain he has suffered, it is clear that the society in which he lives is largely to blame. The scenario clearly states its personal responsibility where it belongs. <br /> <br /> Great movie.
