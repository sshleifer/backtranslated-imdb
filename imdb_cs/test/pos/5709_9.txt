Four beautiful young nurses in their last year of nursing school experience all sorts of confusion and excitement in their lives: the sweet Susan (amazing brunette Elaine Giftos) tries to calm down the bitter, terminally ill Greg (moving power of Darrell Larson), eager but neurotic Phred ( beautiful blonde Karen Carlson) romance handsome gynecologist Jim Caspar (welcoming Lawrence Casey), free-spirited hippie Priscilla (incredibly gorgeous Barbara Leigh) gets impregnated by a delayed drug dealer Les (solid Richard Rust), and compassionate Lynn (played by Brioni Farrell) helps angry Mexican revolutionary Victor Charlie (excellent Reni Santoni). Despite the fact that this film was made for the legendary exploitation equipment of Roger Corman New World Pictures, it's different than your standard mindless piece of soft core. Instead, it is a very pleasant, charming and often thoughtful time capsule of the social and political upheavals of the groovy beginnings of the 1970s (subplot with Lynn and revolutionaries is particularly strong and provocative). The special kudos are directed by Stephanie Rothman, who brings welcome and refreshing intelligence and sensitivity to material. Moreover, the four attractive and attractive women are doing good and commendable work. Scottie MacGregor also captivates as wise superintendent Mrs. Boswell and the ubiquitous 70s voice trailer Ronald Gans adds a psychiatrist's voice off screen. The polished cinematography of Steven Larner, a fantastic rock soundtrack and flavorsome folksy'n'funky Clancy B. Grass III score. Real Sleeper.
