Kazuo Komiz hits again with "Entrails of a Beautiful Woman", a sequel to "Entrails of the Virgin". This time, the story is based on a psychologist (Megumi Ozawa) who decides to take Yakuzu to avenge the suicide of a companion and raped patient who sits on the door one day. When she gets over her head and the Yakuza catches her, they learn their insidious pay for doping girls and selling them to slavery. He seems to end badly when he overdoses from cocaine. But soon will it melt with another body to be destroyed to happen? "Super slime hermaphrodite Zord"! Does he, she = do the minced meat from yakuza and save the day? Not really. Well it is better than "Entrails Virgin" but not much. Most of the film (incredible 67 minutes) consists of rape and sex with fog and the usual hum. Almost at the end, we finally get into our gore groove with a few cool sequences (such as Alien-inspired alien monster through the stomach scene and ashy asphyxia), but still suffer from a hyper-low budget feeling that makes him fun, but can lift him off a soft horror movie kernels.
