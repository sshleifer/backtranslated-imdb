Fame was released in the US a year before I was born; I was too young to remember the original version of fame - and yet I heard about it and read many things. Like the fact that she spawned a TV series and that his soundtrack was led by Irene Cara, hit by Giogio Moroder, 'Fame'. Glory was probably the first of its kind to portray the world of performance art in the form of a feature film. The lives, struggles, obstacles that students and some teachers underwent were in the eyes of the audience. The performances were great, but one who caught my eye especially was Gene Anthony Ray, who played an unpleasant but promising Leroy. Angry, frustrated and initially rude, his character later became less angry and frustrated and more devoted to his studies - not only with practical in performing but in theoretical too. Irene Cara was as good as Coco- scene, taking off her blouse while some pervy directors filmed it, it was a little uncomfortable to watch, just like Paul McCrane for his amazing portrayal of a vulnerable but hidden gay man trying to cope life and life. sign up for an art school in New York after being fired from the army when he told them he was gay. Ralph Barry Miller was interesting, but occasionally his character grated on my nerves. The choreography was great, there were some good dance numbers and the hot lunch scene in the cafe was worth watching. Another scene that was great was when the song 'Fame' was played, and all the kids started rushing to the streets of New York and danced wildly and without care in the world. It was a street jam like no other. The only star that really benefited in the long run was and is Debbie Allen- Later she became a producer, director, and star, though she mostly worked behind the scenes at shows like Everybody Hates Chris and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Paul McCrane later continued to play in "Robocop", where he played criminal and ER as a referee, unpleasant Dr. Roman. British director Alan Parker shot it really well. he allowed artists to dance, act, sing into their heart content without wanting to interfere and influence their styles. During the film, we see different stages students meet during their four years - from first year auditions to New York high school graduation. Glory is one of those films that are meant for an audience that is not necessarily a general mainstream movie that loves the community - definitely NOT for everyone. I enjoyed it because I am interested in art - not technically when it comes to being an artist because I am not one but someone who appreciates that creativity and artistic expression can be ch Attracted hard work, devotion and passion for what one does with their talent. Therefore, if you are a novice dancer, actor or just someone who is creative, you may be interested in a movie like this - even though the events in Fame are something similar to what it is in a high school of life at school, then it is a completely different matter altogether. The transformation of this film in 2009 was released recently and, frankly, it's practically fading in comparison. <br /> <br /> As for the original fame, almost 30 years, though yes, it's a little old, but it's still a great movie, however. It's not a classic classic, but as a cult classic of the 1980s, in line with other 80th dance films such as Footloose and Flashdance, Fame hits the spot. Is it not a coincidence that all those dance films begin with the letter 'F'? <br /> <br /> Gritty, moving and interesting, it's worth a watch.
