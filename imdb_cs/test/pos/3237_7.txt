I watched it again on BBC Channel 4. It's not Jane Austen's best novel, but the movie is a reasonable interpretation. I think the gathering in the spa would be more crowded than it was shown; Maybe they couldn't afford it. Also, why do everyone close to the dance couple to hear an audible conversation? I've never heard anything anyone ever told me when I was dancing and I suspect it would be the same in the 18th and 19th centuries in Bath. Can't Believe in the US Review of Canada; they completely lack the ironic element that is in the movie all the time. The "Gothic" scenes are cleverly presented, but you have to read them correctly. I'm sure Jane A would be slightly amused by these reviews. Any suggestion, does anyone else think Peter Firth will look more like Colin Baker (former Doctor Who) or older?
