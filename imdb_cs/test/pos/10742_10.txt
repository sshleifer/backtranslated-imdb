"Kramer vs. Kramer" is an amazing drama about an unhappy woman who goes to her husband and young son. The husband now has to take responsibility for caring for the boy. Like him, they get to know each other better. But then the mother and wife return and she wants to get the boy. "Kramer vs. Kramer" has a lot of drama with some wonderful pieces of comedy thrown on a good scale. Dustin Hoffman won his first Best Actor Oscar for Outstanding Performance Here. Most people say his performance in "Rainman", which earned him his second Oscar, is his best. He was great in that movie, but I don't agree that it's his best. In my opinion, the best performance of Hoffman's career in this film. The scene scene shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American actors working today. Sometimes he is also funny. Also releasing amazing performance is Meryl Streep, who was not as well known when she made this film as she is today. Streep, like Hoffman, also won his first Oscar (for Best Supporting Actress) for his work in "Kramer vs. Kramer" as his wife and mother trying to find herself after leaving for her family. Justin Henry, who was only 8 years old when the movie came out, is as amazing as the son of Hoffman and Streep. He received an Oscar nomination for his role and is still the youngest player to earn an Oscar nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category. Jane Alexander is also fine as the wife who cares for the family. She also received an Oscar nomination (for a side actress where she lost to the old star Streep). "Kramer vs. Kramer" is a great movie from start to finish. Director Robert Benton made a film that is absolutely unforgettable. <br /> <br /> **** (of 4)
