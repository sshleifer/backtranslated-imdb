The girl notices that the people in her little town are fascinated by anything that has a spiral shape. Soon the fascination turns into obsession and things become deadly. Although I won't say that "Uzumaki" was an excellent movie, I'll say it was unlike anything I saw before. During my watch, I felt like I was looking at a cartoon. Between scenes and characters with digitally enhanced eyes are funny seggs. Later I found out that the film is an adaptation of the manga comic so it makes sense. However, when you think you are watching something that could be a children's film, you will be bombarded with ugly and bloody visual effects! The story often lags behind and the end is somewhat sudden and at the time it seemed to be anti-climactic, but in retrospect I appreciate it more for its originality. My rating: 7/10.
