Whether you look at him as a gallant playpen or to hunt Egyptian fame, the debates on George Armstrong Custer's life and military career continue to this day. They died with their shoes on presents some facts of the Custer story and took freedom with others. He did in fact graduate at the bottom of his class at West Point and got this nightly promotion on the battlefield to General Brigadier General. His record, headed by the Michigan Regiment under his command, was a miracle. It was also true that his marriage to Libby Bacon was one of the great love games of the 19th century. Libby and George were married for 12 years until a small big horn. It is not known to today's audience that Libby survived until 1933. During that time she was the guardian of Custer's legend. Her own iron will and strength of personality had made her late husband a hero because she hadn't let him remember him otherwise. I think Raoul Walsh and Warner Brothers have not used a good opportunity to have a career Custer said in flashback. Olivia DeHavilland was supposed to be ready for Jeanette MacDonald's journey in May and tell the story of her husband and her marriage in terms of nostalgia and memories. Even then, there were cracks in the legend of Custer, but if we do it from Libby's point of view, they could be understood and forgiven. Sydney Greenstreet has done a great job as General Winfield Scott. The only problem was that Scott had nothing to do with Custer, he was retired and replaced by George B. McClellan in late 1861 while Custer was still at the West Point. I'm not sure they ever met. But Greenstreet is well characterized by the cumbersome and powerful Winfield Scott. The nice story of the Mexican War should be what they gave Greenstreet instead of its very accurate depiction of the old Fuss and Feathers. Although the film carries one of the great romantic cinema teams, Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland. That was the last of the eight films they made together. The last scene they ever made for cameras was Libby's farewell to George when he left to join his regiment as his last campaign. Both of their performances, especially Olivia, were the highlight of their Warner Brothers career. We know that Custer goes to its doom, and that the fact that it was their last team connection gives this scene a peculiarity. If your eyes don't get wet, you're made of marble. As history they died with their shoes, leaving much to be desired. As a Western adventure that successfully combines romance with action, you can't defeat this movie at all.
