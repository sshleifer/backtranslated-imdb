It's been about a year since I saw Uzak, but he left strong memories of two main characters, the tired photographer Mahmut and his naive cousin from Yusuf. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie with very little dialogue and a rather limited graph. Obviously, a few spectators were upset. However, the film constructs such a painfully believable portrait of Mahmut and Yusuf that it is as much emotional tension as it is in the most challenging thriller. To be clear, there is no padding in this film - a long time pause, where no one says so much what happens in the emotions of the characters (and in yours, observation) as you can endure. Go see it awake and alert, and you will be bound rather than anesthetized. Uzak rings are true in many ways, and sincerity is probably his greatest achievement. People do not match events and problems as well as others. In fact, throughout the film, there is probably not one point where the main characters (Mahmut, Yusuf and Mahmut's ex-wife Nazan) are not opposed. Much of it is true all over the world: country Yusuf's cousin may be deliberately na√Øve to expect his ship to work on his lap; Mahmut's urbanized cynicism and unwillingness to sympathize with Yusuf. Other truths are more specific to Turkey: Yusuf's misunderstanding that Mahmut can tolerate his stay with clenched teeth; Yusuf takes off between the macho ambitions and the widespread embarrassment of trying to get to know a woman. Uzak is undoubtedly a pretty bleak movie and one of Ceylan's strengths is not to defeat us. Topics That Examines. At the very least, I believed completely in the behavior of his characters. All the small unsuccessful attempts to join and tiny cruelty sound so true. And yet I didn't leave with the news that "The world is such", but instead I got "This is the way we sometimes treat each other."
