I, for one, absolutely loved this movie. It is not a "typical Asian horror" where you would see a terrible looking ghost (usually a woman) that is happening around scary people. You hardly see any ghosts for most of the movie, but the way this movie is about you is a genius. This is not a movie for you if you are on gore (eg Saw, Hostel) or "surprise scares" where things appear on you (Hollywood horror, slasher movies), but this movie has a basic "scary" factor throughout the entire movie that I loved. Noroi is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to the horror between the ridiculous remakes and the non-genuine crap Hollywood has released in today's society. Please, do not let the documentary style shoot (why would it ?!). It's much better than the Blair Witch Project, because for one, acting in Noroi is brilliant and really gives you the feeling that you're watching something you shouldn't see. Noroi is definitely one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Only a few movies got into my Top 5 horror movie; and this movie has a solid 1 point on my list.
