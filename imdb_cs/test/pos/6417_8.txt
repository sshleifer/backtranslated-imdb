Traces are definitely not the average run of the Giallo mill, and that is nothing wrong. Unlike his previous efforts, the Fifth Cord (which was your 'classic' Giallo) Luigi Bazzoni's film left almost all Giallo trademarks and murder site; The emphasis is on psychological secrets. It is clear from the outset that this is a totally bizarre film as the film opens to the moon scene. After the lunar sequence turns out to be Alice's dream, a problem woman, it's no longer clear. Alice is troubled by dreams of an astronaut stuck on the moon, who apparently came from viewing the movie called 'Footprints on the Moon'. After something went wrong, Alice decides to go to a mostly abandoned former tourist place called Garma. Upon her arrival, she is surprised how the people she meets already know her. Alice also meets a young girl who also knows her; the girl tells Alence that she looks just like Nicole, except for the nicer and shorter hair ... <br /> <br /> The fact that Footprints doesn't represent too many ways it would be with sex, murder, and other Giallo trademarks somewhat on the back leg with the primary audience from the beginning because most of the people who go to this movie don't get what they expected (or probably wanted). But on the other hand, Footprints respects the fact that it doesn't follow from what was ahead of him. In 1975, Giallo began to lose his popularity, and many of the films that appeared during this period (with some very remarkable exceptions) were merely a repetition of what had happened before, so Luigi Bazzoni would have a great chance on this film. Florinda Bolkan has a strong role in the lead; and the fact that he is not the most beautiful hero of Giallo is not really important. Secrets break down nicely and can sometimes become a little turgical; Traces are, generally speaking, interesting throughout the duration. Probably not surprising for many as soon as they get there that the end doesn't make much sense and nothing really looks; but it nicely contributes to the bizarre cult value of the film and; I Give Footprints Thumbs Up!
