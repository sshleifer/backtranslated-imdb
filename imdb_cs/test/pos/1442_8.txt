A big little pioneering film (in 1955) on an important subject. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much from Sinatra's performance and I was pleasantly surprised. He loved Kim Novak! She was beautiful! She loved Elmer Bernstein's jazz score! As big as Lazlo Schifrin for "Bullitt"! I am very surprised that it does not seem to be available on a CD (if anyone knows about the availability of a soundtrack in any other format, they should publish it somewhere!) Preminger's direction was, as usual, borderless Flawless. He didn't read Nelson Algren's novel or any idea of ​​how faithful the script was. Frankie's subplot as "hot" card dealer was also a bit of a surprise, as were a few other things. But see for yourself. Worth seeing ...
