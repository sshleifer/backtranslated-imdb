United States Leland was an amazing movie. I continued the guide on my TV, I didn't know what it was and I never got a chance to sit there and get into it. One morning, when I woke up early, I saw that it was just beginning. I decided to follow it. I had time and interest to watch it. When I saw Ryan Gosling in the movie, and then being the main character, I was immediately sucked in and couldn't move out of the couch. Leland's struggle is such an inspiring story. Everyone has to deal with the same type of thoughts during their lifetime, be it a small tiny detail or something as big as it goes. I have to sit back and watch the movie just to capture all the things I may have missed for the first time. As a general comment ... I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a Gosling fan or anyone who likes a good movie with a really good story. The fact that there are many other big stars that have also had great performances is just an added BONUS! So what you can do to take a look at this movie, I'm pretty sure it's not going to be a waste of time.
