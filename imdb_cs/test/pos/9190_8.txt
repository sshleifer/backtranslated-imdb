Fado is a sad almost blues style of Portuguese Gypsy music that is heard repeatedly through the film. As one of the main characters (Igor) explains, it also means destiny. Indeed, it is a fate that connects the two main characters Paco and Alex and raises the problems that arise. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it pretty much. It starts as a drama / road movie on the way down and out, which is built in a thrilling thriller / road movie. There were two things I thought were unrealistic, which prevented me from doing it higher. rating (I gave it 8). The first is the main point why Alex put things away. Was she so desperate for the money that she sold her passport for a lousy sum and then handing out things worth thousands of strangers? Her explanation was not convincing. Also, how did they get through the gate where the cops were?
