"With all the troubles in the world, how can we not get drunk?" ?? Mia <br /> <br /> A nice aerial view of the capital is sinister with the approach of a fleet of bombers; irate hairdresser respond to perceived racial swear cuts road through bushy hair of businessman; the man dreams of being pulled into an electric chair after an unsuccessful magic trick, and the teacher falls apart in front of his class because her husband called her hag. These and about fifty other vignettes range from a totally depressing to wildly humorous Roy Andersson You, The Living, his first feature film, because his critically acclaimed film is a commercially unsuccessful song From Second Floor. You, Life is filled with the same kind of imaginative sets as Songs, filled with black humor, unreal situations, and strange characters.

But when he is not looking, the man at the next table will lift the wallet from his jacket on the back of the chair. Although Andersson's cynicism is sometimes not very well hidden, You Live has a basic humanism that shows compassion for human conditions. It is a warning story that looks at the mess we got into, but suggests that there is still time to turn to it if we take care to warn the poet Goethe, who opens the film: "Be pleased, you alive, in your beautiful A warm bed before Lethe's ice cold wave licks your escape foot.
