HOUSE CALLS was a fun comedy about a widowed doctor in 1978 (Walter Matthau) who now wants to play in the field but can't help but be attracted to his patient (Glenda Jackson), who refuses to be just another notch on his bed. Matthau likes a woman, but he doesn't really want her to commit to insisting that she will be dating her for two weeks, and then decide if she wants to or not. however, other complications make it difficult for Matthau to make a decision when two weeks are up, even though he is clearly in love with a woman. Matthau and Jackson have surprisingly effective chemistry as a couple on screen and receive strong support from Richard Benjamin, Candice Azzar, Dick O'Neill, and especially Art Carney as the clumsy and senile chief of staff at the hospital where Matthau is employed. Matthau even has a short scene with his real son, Charlie, who appears as Jackson's son. This engaging comedy is still quite good after all these years. If you've never seen it, it's worth renting.
