I must admit that I have a special fondness for humor and the style of telling stories of British films, though not all of course, to succeed. This film thought me and finally left me at the end. silent smile on face. It is about the development of character and relationships, truth and lies, and whether love is sometimes simply not enough. Some very nicely underestimated acting from all participants, especially the two leads, Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. There was a lot of fuss done about Gosford Park, but with this piece I feel Fellowes actually produced a better film, though it was not a major release. Intelligent mature story about real people who are undeniably defective, but also capable of doing true kindness.
