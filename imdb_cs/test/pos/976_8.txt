I don't understand why IMDb users would rate this 5.2 / 10 movie? It's really great, very funny. I highly recommend this movie to all of you, adults, teenagers and especially children! The story is about a 14-year-old boy who always tells lies, at home and at school. One day the homework had to write 1000 words. But he didn't, so the teacher told him to write it and give it in 3 hours, or he would have to go to Summer School. Yeah, he wrote it at 2:45. "Big Fat Liar", I think it was a story about myself. On his way to school, he came across a limousine of a famous Hollywood producer and he set out on it. But the kid forgot the limousine story. He told his parents and his teacher, but of course they didn't believe him. And the film producer, he took the child's story as his new film, "Big Fat Liar". When the boy saw the movie trailer, he told his parents he wrote it, but they didn't believe it. So he and his friend had to go to L.A to prove one thing: The truth is never overrated <br /> <br /> Enjoy this great movie, you won't be disappointed. Don't believe 5.2 / 10 course, it should be 9/10! Believe me! <br /> <br /> P / S: I'm sorry, my English is not good enough to make it better!
