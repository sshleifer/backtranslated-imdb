Of course I think it was a great movie. I also met a few people I didn't see during the shooting. I was the one who played the guard for about an hour in a movie in the yard of death practice and asked for a light on a cigarette. I also changed one scene. Originally they let him go to the backyard and straighten the prisoner and turn him around and leave. The director said, "It takes a long time to do Gower." I said, "We have to go in and hang your arms and pull it back. This way the camera can stay on its face when we take it." I also lived in the same prison as a small child because my father was an assistant to the security guard. I am also a current Tennessee Deaprtment of Corrections employee at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution. Although a lot of the movie was a joke, the part I was was pretty realistic. Also in the bar scene, the dancer kicked high in the air and left the stage as a real stripper with whom I worked in a club called "The Classic Cat".
