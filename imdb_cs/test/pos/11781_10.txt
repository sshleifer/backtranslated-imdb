Hysterical Hardware Wars are finally on DVD. HW has earned a gap between the parody classics and it's not just a stupid little 20-minute short but a base in low budget movie production classes, a place where many of the film's cult status is derived and based. With the DVD, not only do we have the chance to return to the original parody (4Q2, Cinnamon-Bun Head, Ballistic Toast, et al) that Ernie F. did in 1978, but there are plenty of other materials to introduce Fosselius's joke. Antique Sideshow is a deadly parody that is very funny, but also makes a statement about the confluence of ignorance and greed. The director's commentary is also hysterical, as is Creature Feature, which parodies when a talk-show movie is filmed and is based on the fact that HW gets into the talk show circuit, even if it's a public access circuit. I'd like to see Ernie, Michael Wiese and the crew go to the parody for other current, overcrowded and exaggerated goals - as well as any movie that Hollywood is currently winning at $ 100 million - not so crafty movies as Spider Man or Men in black (actually parody themselves!), but any number of overcrowded, overworked, overworked and overpriced features. <br /> <br />
