Looking back at Alfred Hitchcock's career, it is never surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied sufficient recognition for his revolutionary commitment to the film industry. It is probably a sign of how Hitchcock was before trying to push the envelope and never caught up with a movie made simply for fun, but always with a deeper, more agile motive in mind. Foreigners on the train, one of Hitchcock's first and more underrated hits, is a perfect example of these features - a fun and exciting story, even though it is more than 50 years later, yes, but so carefully and intelligently constructed that it stands today as a masterpiece in film technology. Probably one of the pioneering "thrilling thrillers", Strangers on the train, may in some respects encounter a slight date, but retains every bit of greatly created tension as it did in 1951 (if possible something less shocking). Brilliant use of cinematography and lighting, as well as quick and careful editing, is what really excels in film, pulling out all the possible iota of tension and keeping the audience's attention on slower scenes. If there was any doubt about what was simply the master filmmaker of Hitchcock, it would simply be that mere five minutes of foreigners on the train would take care of such feelings; each shot is so carefully selected and constructed, all used to drive the story forward in a particularly innovative way. Sadly, there are some moments in the story that are in place to divert our focus from excellent cinematography and editing - Bruno, who is able to reach the bottom of the sewer grid, is simply incredible and the figure of a stereotypical old man crawling under a wildly unused carousel provides unintentional comedy relief in what is meant to be the most rigorous and engaging scene. These are just brief moments, but they were enough to make them equally painfully weak in an otherwise stellar film. Given that Hollywood films are late to risk clichés inevitably further and further into the curls of the turgid cliché, it is amazingly refreshing to see a fifty-year film with a premise that actually comes as intelligent and original. Certainly it is fairly simple, but the concept of "murder exchange" is simply one that wouldn't fly in today's and age's films, which is more fun to watch; The brilliant film scenario keeps the action moving at a fast pace while providing amazingly unforgettable lines all the time. One cannot help but note the deeper issues that Hitchcock mentions throughout the text, especially the concept of "darkness in the heart of mankind", proving that older women are fascinated and enthusiastic about the prospect of murder, as well as Bruno's own cavalier attitudes. to death. Hitch also works at many moments of dark humor (Bruno popping a child's balloon with a cigarette is invaluable), and irony, shooting exciting scenes in happy, easy-to-develop environments such as cult carnival scenes to create an even more frightening atmosphere. It may be a thrilling thriller, yes, but overlooking the brain hidden beneath it would simply be inexcusable. The antagonistic character of Bruno (an essay Robert Walker made to perverted perfection, unfortunately in his latest film role, but easily steals the film from his very talented members) is undoubtedly what makes Strangers on the train so unforgettable As a character is a miracle to look. Here we just have a perfectly crafted rogue character, all the more interesting as it seems to be normal and inconspicuous. Bruno, rather than a mad madman and thwarting a hero at any moment, is a calm, controlled, psychotic mess. He talks about a murder in such an offhand tone, but keeps a passionate glimpse in his eye as he discusses different ways of killing people. Bruno seems to represent "Id" as Freud would say, the inner, darker and unlimited aspects of humanity. It makes an interesting contrast to the hero's character, Guy Haines, and how bland and uninteresting he seems, almost as if managing a home prospect of evil are much more interesting and appealing than continually trying to do the right thing. Despite this implicit report, however, Hitch is still filming our emotions so much that we are based on Guy at every turn, and we encourage every new obstacle he has to overcome. It's proof of the talent of actor Farley Granger, who, despite the crime of Robert Walker, easily steals the show, Granger's hero still comes as likable, still commanding our support, even if he falls victim to a much less convincing character. Great support is given to Ruth Roman, who manages to overcome clichés and be a more innovative and complex romantic personality, Kasey Rogers, who has shown stunning performance, such as the terribly manipulative and hedonistic first wife Guy and Patricia Hitchcock, which proves to be much more talented than to be simply "the director's daughter" would mean. The excellent cast (headed by simply the beautiful Walker) really animates the film and adds much more to the film than just Hitchcock's breathtaking stylistics. All in all, foreigners on the train can still encounter a slight date for some viewers, but it is still a shock to how modern and appealing the present audience looks, given that it was released half a century ago. Again, Hitchcock proves its unique mastery of tension and film technology, and the surprisingly original and pleasant film premise is worth it. I highly recommend anyone who wishes to be brilliantly done, but a great fun movie experience! <br /> <br /> -9/10
