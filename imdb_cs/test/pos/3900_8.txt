William H. Macy is brilliant when everyone gets caught in a desperate situation. It starts with a bang and never stops. Twist and surprise are fresh, unpredictable. Using movie noir clips and frequent quotes and links to the thirtieth and fortieth flicks makes it a wonderful "must" for movie buffs.
