A well done melodrama that tells the story of Sally, a circus dancer, raised by performer McGargle (played by WC Fields), on her head, a little mustache, checkered trousers and skills like a juggler, pickpocket and runner. Carnival Games like Three Monte Cards and Old Shell Game. McGargle raised Sally, who worshiped him as her "real father" since Sally's mother (fired from her father by a judge when she married a "circus man") died and left Sally orphaned. Sally is McGargle loyal and loyal, no matter what she gets - but McGargle seems to feel a little guilty for leaving her in the circus instead of her family for years. When she ends up in carnival in a city where her rich grandparents live, McGargle takes the opportunity to "explore" the real Sally family with the idea that she can restore it. The grandfather who takes the judge, however, is immediately dissatisfied with Sally because he doesn't like the "show girl" - what is the strict, narrow-minded man, the guy's real job! Meanwhile, Sally is busy being persecuted by a handsome and wealthy young man, the son of a man who helped his grandfather get his wealth. This is a very good movie with a few laughs here and there and a kind of special editing style (I don't know how to describe it differently than it shows long shots, then the kind of jumps back a few seconds or suddenly changes the tilt angle as shown close up). Carol Dempster, who plays Sally, is pleasant in this show - very cute and comical. TOILET. The field, even without its famous voice, is very funny - just as it moves and its fun, comic reactions to things (like a little dog seen on one fun scene), we even see it juggle in this short moment. I like a couple peeking at the old-fashioned circus and carnival shown here. The print of this featured on DVD is a very nice looking, toned light sepia tone, and the piano score for it is really excellent, done by Philip Carli based on the original cue sheets.
