This is one of the biggest documentaries I've ever seen, along with "Dark Days". I skated for maybe an hour my whole life, and I still love this movie. Peralta and his excellent editor perfectly captured the feel and atmosphere, partly helped with some incredible archive footage. Tony Alva is one of the best individuals in existence. Love those tall high striped sports socks, you rock Tony! Not only is this movie a visual holiday, but the soundtrack must be one of the best in history if you're on the 70s. Buy a DVD, you won't regret it.
