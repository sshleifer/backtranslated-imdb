At first glance it is yet another high school anime with a lot of excuses for 'fanservice' but there is much more. 'Fanservice' is part of the conspiracy, the main character is a tired cynic (unusual), and most importantly, it is a clever plot that connects all the episodes together, and it presents some interesting questions. The episodes are intentionally non-chronological, and it certainly worth watching the series again in chronological order. The series is worth watching closely because there is plenty of casual advice out there that foreshadow and explain things, plus a good number of jokes about other series, anime and more.
