I was happy to attend the London premiere of this film. Although I'm not a fan of British drama at all, I find myself deeply touched by the characters and BAD CHOICES they've done. I was in tears at the end of the movie. Every scene was fascinating. The attention to detail and excellent performance was quite impressive. I would have to agree with some other comments on the question of why all these women were thrown into such a contemptuous character. ******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************** * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * END SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley did a great job of radiating beauty and innocence from the screen, but it was the performance of Sienny Miller who was a really good Oscar. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this production will be nominated for more prizes.
