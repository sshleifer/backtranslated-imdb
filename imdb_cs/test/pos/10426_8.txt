LOVED THIS FILM I LOVE A LOVE PART WITH COLBY AND A GIRL ... Rachel (?) 4got her name .... I was just interested in those too. I loved them in the movie I want to see more movies like this. but please no more sad ends where they can't be total! = (It made me cry, but the romance between them. The plot of trauma was all great.) I was just more into Colby and Rachel. ha ha =) all about this movie was exciting to stick to your place. because I was sure. Honestly, my only personal desire would be more focused between the couple (Colby and Rachel) and at least a decent ending. I hated the end, the better one could think, not the fact that it would force his death and Rachel had a son. The end would kill the movie.
