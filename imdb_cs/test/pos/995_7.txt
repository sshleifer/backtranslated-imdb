Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller play in the story of two women in the life of Dylan Thomas. Knightley is Thomas' baby darling he meets during the Blitz. Meetings at the bar reunite, but things get complicated when Thomas' brings his wife (Miller) to her next meeting with her. The women struck him, and things continued to pace until a man joined the trio who became Knight's husband. This makes things even more complicated because jealousy starts to show its face. A beautiful look, extraordinarily written and beautifully done (all disappear in their roles) is a luxurious feast for eyes and ears. It's so nice to see a movie about adult adults. On a purely visceral level, I really enjoyed the film because the film is so artistically enjoyable. I have seldom seen a movie that's so beautifully created. The problem with the movie is that I'm not entirely sure what happened. Something was missing and I had to play the movie several times to see if I was missing something. It's not bad, but its result is not entirely satisfactory. (I tried to look at the line to see how much film is true, but I couldn't find anything) I still think it's a movie worth seeing. It's a beautiful adult movie with probably the best acting performance.
