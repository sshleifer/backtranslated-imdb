Hands down, the best drama / comedy show on TV. A cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16-year-old daughter exploring life and finding things not only about the world but also about herself. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) is trying to find a way to stay in close contact with her daughter, but to direct her to the right path that is getting harder and harder. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), caught in the world of books and learning, is just beginning to discover a boy and her own sense of rebellion, which both surprises them. With the help of Luke Danes (Scott Patterson) and Sookie St.James (Melissa McCarthy) and a huge variety of other cheerful characters, this show easily remains one of my favorites. What really shows the show is complex, incredible and funny writing often using pop culture references to the mink dynasty.
