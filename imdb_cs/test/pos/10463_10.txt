Sometimes it's hard to watch movies with subtitles (in this case Danish), but watching is worth it. As the story progresses, the reasons for choosing two sisters, caring for their father, are questionable, but their society is different. Their choice leaves them alone until a French woman comes. There may be a question as to why a French woman has come to her place of residence and it is never fully developed. A holiday that happens later as a result of unexpected funds from France is a source of unusual pleasure for all who have attended and something they have not experienced before. Provides a good thank you for the guest's kindness. A picture with a dark aura and a manifestation of poverty is a wonderful experience for the viewer.
