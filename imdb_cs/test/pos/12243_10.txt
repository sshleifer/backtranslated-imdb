This film has everything for it: Fully developed characters, a realistic portrayal of working Washington, bathed in warmth and humor that is uniquely Albert Brooks. Dumbing down network messages is even more of a problem than it was in 1987. Remember, it was a pre-cable! So satisfying care for complex people who are trying to achieve complex goals - and all this moves with the speed of lightning. Such a faithful depiction of a friendship that is approaching romance. See if you can upset John Cusack as an angry messenger! And do you know Peter Hackes from real life? Finally, if you're from DC, see if you agree with Holly Hunter's instructions to the cabs!
