A brief overview without spoilers follows. I saw this film yesterday at the Cannes Film Festival. My first reaction is miracle and happiness. I am so glad that such films are made in our blockbuster age. Roy Andersson's new movie "You, The Living" is nothing but a masterpiece. You, The Living consists of about 50 vignettes shot with a static camera. I will not give up the content of the scenes because I hate it when people spoil the smallest details. But yes, most of the 1,000 people in the Claude Debussy Theater are totally confused and overwhelmed. When the movie was over, we clapped for a few minutes, we had no choice. So what is the score with "You, The Living". Um, Andersson is not afraid to take heavy questions; History, Guilt, Gand Holocaust during World War II are great objects (and these topics work together well). <br /> <br /> The images created are brilliant; Well, sorry for this scream, praise the review. Check out the Flying House at the beginning of the people! <br /> <br /> 10/10 Stars - A masterpiece (I never throw this degree out).
