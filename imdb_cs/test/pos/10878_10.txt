Two years after its initial release, Goldeneye still sits at the top of the first Nintendo 64 shooter. Even the Quake and Turok series had no combination of graphic detail, sound quality, hostile intelligence, challenge, and total entertainment that bring me back and forth into the game. Each mission has specific goals that make you think like Bond, not just shoot every baddie that appears on the screen, but also avoid cameras, shut down security systems, rescue hostages, protect girl Bond and so on. Q gadgets in this game, including the famous watch, are teeming with. The game is loosely based on the film's story, including all the main characters and the best scenes of the film, from the bungee dam-jump to the prop-aircraft escape to tank chase through St. James. St. Petersburg. Even the layout is preserved where possible so you will notice different situations if you have seen the movie. Other levels are added to challenge players and strings together scenes a little more. With each level of difficulty, mission goals are more difficult, enemies smarter and bullets are more deadly. I still didn't get through 00-Agent levels. Cheats can be opened, not by entering codes or buttons, but by filling in certain levels within a specific time frame, and other characters can be opened for multiplayer. Multiplayer is still the best among first person shooters. It's not as sharp as Turok, but it doesn't slow down almost as many ... tons of opportunities to give your friends a reason to fire each other over and over again. There are better games for the N64, such as Zelda and all Star Wars stuff, but Rare continued their streak of excellent games with a first-person shooter that doesn't and won't be overcome until they top in 2000 with Perfect Dark.
