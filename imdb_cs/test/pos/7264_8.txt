If you liked Lock, Stock and two smoking barrels, chances are you like it, too. Although I think a few British jokes (such as calling two London Dixon and Winterburn characters, after Arsenal footballers) may be lost on some, it's still a cracked fun that really pumped with vitality. Carlyle, Miller and Tyler are excellent, bringing depth to their characters, and the interplay between the two is always well appreciated. In fact, Scott's direction is very confident given that he is his first feature film and proves that he has the talent of his father to silence us in a quiet environment. Hell, I convinced myself. I'll see it again!
