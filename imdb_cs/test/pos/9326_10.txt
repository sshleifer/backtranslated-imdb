Michael Jackson is the greatest singer and greatest dancer who ever lived and this film proves it. It's amazing to watch and dance is fantastic. When Michael turns into a werewolf, it's the first part to be on the edge of your seat. And Vincent's price of rap adds to fear when all the zombies rising from the graves. If you like it then I suggest you buy 'Making Michael Jackson Thriller', which has the movie then do it after him. The production shows the incredible performance of "Billie Jean" by Michael, which is when he first made a moonwalk on television. Bach.
