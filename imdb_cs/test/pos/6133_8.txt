I came across this film by accident. I traveled a few years back and this movie was on a rope on a rope in the hotel late at night. Not much of it and I think I'm watching it for about 20 to 30 minutes until I decide to go to bed. Needless to say, I stayed and watched the whole movie. The plot was very interesting and you wonder if there was an SS that would do it or at least think it would do. I watched the whole movie. I even sent and emailed a manufacturing company, but they weren't sure it would ever do it on a DVD but said it was always a hope. If somebody finds out that this movie has released a note where you found it, I would definitely like to take a copy of one day.
