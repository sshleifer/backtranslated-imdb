It must be one of my 3 favorite episodes from the original TV series. What makes it great is the officers battle between Romulan Commander and Kirk, as well as top-notch playing from Mark Lenard, who later went on to play Spock's father in other television episodes and movies. This is the case when those around them have reached the level of talent around them, and Shatner, Nimoy, and the entire cast bring excellent performance in this episode. Writing and conspiracy are also excellent, and I love the direct access that shows us the characters and feelings and thoughts of these characters and how the actors are expressed freely. <br /> <br /> This very fun episode ranks 10 out of 10. AWESOME! Desert Buddha
