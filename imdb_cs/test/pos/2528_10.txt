I am native to Brazil ... the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation that was made to this boy. They told his life story and he never got one "centavo" (Brazilian cent) of that movie. Fernando is not the first and will not be the last to experience this lifestyle in Brazil. Sad ... but that's the world we live in. The point is that money does not save lives. The question is: Where is Fernando today? Probably dead. We tend to want to live in this "Disney filled fantasy awakened life". When somebody comes to the plate to help ... higher power comes and says, "What will I get from this? - I wish the human conscience would sound!
