First, I was a fan of the show when my PBS station started showing it in 1981. I learned a lot about the show and the people who were on the show or contributed to it. This last installment of the doctor made a great impression on me. The original series, aka the classic series, was made fun of bad special effects and / or wobbly files. Well, this is no other truth. Special effects are amazing, but what's even better is writing. You get a chance to learn more about our beloved Doctor and maybe why he loves planet Earth so much. Without being too far away, it's a very interesting series to watch. Christopher Eccelston brought the Doctor's side, which we never see, bitter and angry, but at the same time loving at the same time. <br /> <br /> MUST KNOW!
