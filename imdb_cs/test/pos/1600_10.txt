Philistine Attention, Especially American! It has all the elements that you will hate - langoric approach to the film language, a sense of composition, an intense homoerotic focus on its elegant story, wonderful and unusual use of music, and even worse on the story. Do you think that movies do not have a derived plot, are full of action and miserable dialogue, you do not need a visual grammar of MTV / TV TV commercials. . It is one of my favorite films and it is perhaps the perfect work of Visconti. It is noble as well as the movement of Mahler, who is constantly used in the film.
