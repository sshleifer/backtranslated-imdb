I am 13 years old and I write this review in my mom's application. He will later write his own review. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite movie throughout. The film was shot in England in 1944. I watched it so many times when I was little, I had a videotape on me. I love this movie and changed my life! Beautiful landscape. A powerful thoroughbred thoroughbred horse. A simple little Irish village with a young girl who wanted to do what no other girl ever did, competes in the Great National Steeplechase in London with her favorite horse The Pirate. Everything made me want to ride horses (which I did for 7 years) and learn everything I could about their breeds to draw and paint. It's a groundbreaking film about winning against all chances, overcoming fear, believing in yourself, and achieving difficult goals by working very hard. Also, the scene of races was one of the best I've ever done, and I've seen many movies with racing races. Never tired of watching this movie. Everything about it is perfect. Especially if you're a young girl and passionate about horses!
