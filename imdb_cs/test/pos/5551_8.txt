Lauren Himmel's debut film is well directed towards a nice polished feel. There is a strong story going on with a meaningful point on it all, though at the end nothing is solved, hence the name Treading Water. The plot revolves around a lesbian couple and their fight with their mother for admission. 7.5 / 10
