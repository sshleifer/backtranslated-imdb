Francis Ford Coppola wrote and directed this tremendously personal story of a married woman's flight from her husband - and the fact that perhaps the youthful grief and the excitement of her younger years are behind her. We have learned little about this woman's marriage, except that she felt her independence slipping as a delay; She also recently learned that she was pregnant, which made her heart even more complicated (not wanting to be a satisfied wife, despite the mother's way of talking to her husband over the phone). On his way he meets two men: a former college football hero who - after an accident during the game - remained with permanent brain damage, and a sexy kiss that has a lot of trouble in his life. The clear, clean landscapes (as photographed by the very talented Wilmer Butler) are incredibly realized as well as the characters. Shirley Knight, James Caan, and Robert Duvall each perform strong, grasping performances, especially because they are not very likeable people in common terms. Some scenes (such as the first call to Knight on a pay phone, or her first night alone with Caan where they play "Simon Says") are almost too intimate to watch. Coppola toys with reality, turning the jagged memories of his characters into the scrapbook we were dedicated. It allows you to play scenes, but editing is pretty agile and the movie must never get too heavy (there are at least two or three very risky moments). It's an intoxicating effort - so much that the picture was still displayed at festivals almost five years later. Some may avoid Coppola's unrelated twist of events to underline the finale with bitter irony, but its strength and emotion behind the image have almost destroyed its deficiencies. *** of ****
