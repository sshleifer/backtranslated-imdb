I watched several episodes of this series again on the very bad VHS tapes I recorded. I'm glad I did it. Ramona is based on Beverly Cleary children's books and follows the adventure of the eight-year title (Sarah Polley). He has fun with friends and family and gets into trouble, like many eight-year-olds. All ten episodes are pretty good. "Mystery Meal" kind of grosses me as a vegan, but it's funny to see parents trying to get their kids to eat the tongue of a cow! And any episode that mentions Godzilla Versus Smog Monster twice cannot be all bad. I love Ramon's bad day even more. Although it is unbelievable to see Ramona going through a rough day, herself imagines revenge on her friend Howie's uncle, who is always irritating. "The Perfect Day" is also good. Lori Chodos plays Beezus, Ramon's sister. I swear I saw her on something else, but IMDb says nothing besides this show. Unfortunately, this series is not on DVD. Why is every crappy show these days on DVD except for something I really want to buy? Injustice if there was one!
