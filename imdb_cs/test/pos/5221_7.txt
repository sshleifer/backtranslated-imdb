Father Hood is a fun story about a reluctant Father who is definitely HOOD! Patrick Swayze plays Jack Charles, who is always on the lookout for one big "score" that puts him on an easy street. His wife died when he was in prison, and his two children were put into foster care. When he "got out", he thought they were probably better at foster care? In addition, he still had to score his wealth. His daughter Kathleen Charles (playing beautifully by Sabrina Lloyd) breaks out of a foster care institution that abuses children and abuses the money that is supposed to be spent on children. They hunt their father; tells him about how bad the place was and that her brother, Eddie Charles (played by Brian Bonsall), "Just a Little 7-Year-Old Boy" was moved to the institution that she just got out and convinced her father he kidnapped him. Three begin the adventure across the country, while Jack still says he has to get rid of the kids! Patrick Swayze is really good at this comedy, playing "Hood" (probably a little understatement for this criminal character) who is similar to his Johnny Castle character Dirty Dancing except Jack is properly fun in this comedy and more optimistic than Johnny Castle. Swayze is funny and rally makes comedy pretty good! Halle Berry plays Kathleen Mercer, a reporter who tries to get the truth about the foster care system that becomes Sawyer's ally. Diane Ladd plays Rita as Jack Charles's mother.
