The cast itself will tell you that it will be a notch above the usual Italian West. Veteran actors Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy team up with Alex Cord, who at that time looked on the verge of fame. The result is a film that is both off-beat and down-beat, yet it will satisfy those looking for more from western than just firing. Particularly interesting is the character played by Alex Cord. It is expected that the "hero" in these westerns will be silent and introspective, but "Clay McCord" is an extreme example and is surprisingly often shining in a passive, even weak position. Much happens from the fact that he is afraid of falling into epileptic seizures that have been immobilized by his father, and at those moments of helplessness he is either at the mercy of those who want to hurt him or those who want to help him. To emphasize his passivity, Clay McCord - don't you love that name? - He is often glowing with a waist as if he were a little more than an attractive toy that was exposed. In his nature, there is even a strong masochistic smudge, the most evidence when his enemies are used as a punching bag and then hung on his wrists and left hanging above the street. Not only is it often unable to protect itself, but McCord is equally ineffective in protecting those around him. Almost everyone who helps him is killed. While "A Minute to Pray, Second to Die" is far from perfect, it has depth and tone that distinguishes it and causes it to remain in memory. It's also a good example for Alex Cord, whose career tended to fall after that point after a few promising years in the mid-1960s. He had to be about 36 years old when he shot it - in his physical primacy - and his wrist-scene, bare and sweaty, is an unforgettable piece of "beefcake".
