Most of this political thriller was mostly presented as a mill film run with a somewhat better development of many major characters, which was much appreciated until the BIG twist and the mighty peak that resembled the twists in the "lamb silence" occurred. or "Sixth Sense". Reese Witherspoon as a distraught wife of the missing Egyptian husband and Yigal Naor as a strong armed investigator offers powerful performances. Unfortunately, Jake Gyllenhaal has been given a more two-dimensional character and has to fight the stereotypical presentation of an emotionally torn CIA analyst who has been presented many times before in other films. In the beginning there is a nice explosion scene that resembles the scene at the end of "Saving Private Ryan", a silent scene that has been used so effectively that it has reflected one consequence of violence. The scenario also provides a little more insight into the "enemy" mind, but still does not allow the audience to really understand, which in turn allows viewers to dive in the stereotypical characterization. Cinematography and photography are also somewhat delayed because, unlike "Jarhead" or "Blackhawk Down", there is no sharp, raw visceral presentation that does not allow viewers to really be in the film, there is a distance that keeps the audience aware of the intensity of emotions occurring on the screen. However, overall, the film redeems itself, offering the audience a timed look into the complexity of using the United States to use releases and possible complications and the consequences that may occur by its use. Eight out of ten stars.
