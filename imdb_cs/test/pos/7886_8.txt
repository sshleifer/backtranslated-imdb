I remember so many things about seeing this film during his original theatrical release - the post of Woodstock's Enlightenment of Peace and Love, along with the tension of fear and paranoia over water. It's hard to believe it's thirty-seven years later, and I still remember the thoughts that went through my head while watching a movie with my best friend. As well as marvelling on Peter Boyle characterizing the ultimate redneck, sure he will throw him to the end of his career (Oh, how bad!), And how against culture has ruptured the sensibilities of most countries. To date, my friend and I still use Joe Curran's line from my summary when I face a dilemma; Wondering how simple a line like this can stay with you for decades. It is interesting to read comments about the movie from others on this album, especially those that state that the film has dated quality and how the top characters were. However, if you were at that time, the picture gives a fairly accurate representation of the polar opposites that existed at that time, largely side by side, as the events in the story reveal. If you really want to date when you last heard the words Macy and Gimbel in the same sentence or line as Joe - "Come with Pepsi Generation". Historically, you have the big Nixon poster that remains in one of the background scenes - "Would you buy a used car from this man?" Director John Avildsen, with less intricacies like these, captures many subtle but still present hints of how life was four decades ago. Today's watching was just the second time I saw the movie, and I have to admit I don't remember Susan Sarandon in one of the lead roles, but then it was her first photo. Nude and free love scenes were something completely new and courageous at the time, in fact shocking, as filmmakers began experimenting with their ability to promote decency and convention. "Joe" made a big leap in this regard, especially because it was a "mainstream" picture. As time went by, what made Peter Boyl most interested in me, was how he overcame Joe Curran's stereotype to appear in one of my favorite works. How come you go from "Joe" to the cheerful rendition of "Puttina" on the Ritz in "Young Frankenstein"? And my favorite episode, "X-Files," has Boyle as Clyde Bruckman, both in a gentle, tragic, humorous, and serious portrayal that turns tables with Scully and Mulder more than once. As a career captain, Frank Barone must be one of the most entertaining characters in television history. Even repeated episodes in syndication are funny when he - whenever an older baron releases one of his observations. He is one of the actors that this viewer is already missing.
