I just finished this movie and my only comment is "OH! WOW!". Jennifer Beals is fine as a fianc√©e, but Yancy Butler as a female dance instructor is purely sexual dynamite! When I watched her in WITCHBLAD, I wasn't prepared for the pure, undistorted sensuality and raw sexual excitement that she was launching on the screen. I need to see THIS movie again ... if only for Yancy Butler as Corrinne!
