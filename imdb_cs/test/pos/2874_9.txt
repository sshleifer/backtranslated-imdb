See No Evil is the first WWE movie. Yes WWE, Wrestling Entertainment, for the match. Of course, this is a WWE wrestler movie must play in it, a wrestler is Glenn Jacobs aka Kane. Which is not really important, as if you did not know Kane, or what WWE was, you never know that it has something to do with the wild word of the match because the film has nothing to do with the game. See No Evil is a horror movie, has a few moments when some people can jump, but for the most part it just says, look how we can get! Not that there was anything wrong with it. Jacob Goodnight (played by Kane) is a kind of Jason type character, his mother tortured him as a child with strict Christian beliefs (distortion) and distorted his mind. Now it's a big scary chopping machine. 90% of the film takes place in an abandoned hotel where Jacob is chasing six teenagers (surprised?) And a handful of adults. I could explain why they are in a haunted old hotel, but what, who cares? Despite the lack of originality see No Evil is well done for what it should be. Kane plays an amazing killer and needs little to be scary. One mistake in the movie is the most unpleasant possibility that people will survive, really looking forward to being terribly killed, but unfortunately it won't happen. I wish the film had no stigma of wrestling associated with it, even though I said the movie had nothing to do with the match. hater. Then again the movie can also make money because the fans of the matches will want to see it. Either way, See No Evil has top effects and little CGI, and as I said, it's pretty brutal, just as I say it's good ... if you like something like that.
