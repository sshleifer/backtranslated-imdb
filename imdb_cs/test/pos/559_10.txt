I saw this movie last night on HBO and didn't expect to get hooked - I usually fall asleep when I watch HBO. But it also happened to you. It is a tragic documentary (Oscar winner of 2002) about the murder of an older female tourist in Jacksonville, Florida, followed by a 15-year-old boy's investigation, arrest and attempt. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie today and feel the way we acted as a company. This film deserves an esteemed Oscar - you'll be moved to tears.
