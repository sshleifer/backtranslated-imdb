This film was overshadowed by 'Jackal' (Bruce Willis, Richard Gere), who was released that year. When I saw both movies, I can honestly say this is an excellent movie. It is true that the "Jackal" production value was very good, probably having a significantly larger budget. But the "task" is well written and has a fascinating story. Aiden Quinn is flawless in two roles. Aiden Quinn and director Christian Duguay have done a great job in establishing a deep and multi-layered relationship between the title character and his family. I especially liked the end. I've been alerted to Jack Ryan's character in Tom Clancy's movies. Both are naval officers thrown into incredibly dangerous roles because they secretly work for national security. And yet, Harrison Ford and Aidan Quinn reveal their own characters as heroes who are both manly and gentle. They have a real tenderness and vulnerability in their relationships with their families. What I do not understand is how the opinions of everyone who has posted this film (including me) can be more positive than the pleasant film reception. It is a film that has enough complexity and subtlety to be persuasive after multiple views. If you're a fan of spy-genre movies, I highly recommend 'Enter'.
