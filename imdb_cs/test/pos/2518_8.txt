The drive was a fun episode with a dark ending. The man and his wife are basically infected in their inner ear with a high sound wave emitted by some military equipment. Some of my favorite parts of this episode are Mulder's dialogue in the car and the scene in which Scully walks with the Hazmat team and finds a little old deaf lady unaffected by what they thought was a virus. The end of the course is tragic in its realism because it leads the viewer to believe that they will really break away this elaborate plan to save the victim, but when Mulder arrives, the man is already dead. 8/10
