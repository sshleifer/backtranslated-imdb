Who will love my children, changed my heart, it made me cry all the way, I screamed the most when the family had to say goodbye to the child, I screamed the most and every time the child was accepted, I screamed when they had to say goodbye mother, it was sad that they lost their mother, sorry for the boy with epilepsy, I was glad that he was adopted by the same family as one of his brothers. For me, the boy I thought was strange because he went to the house. I feel like I'm special because I'm in a world with Asperger's syndrome and sometimes when I feel down I like to cry sometimes. I really enjoyed this movie, 10 out of 10. Real story, very good. Another movie that would bring tears to the eyes, I think it would be hurting to be Tuesday with Morrie (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207805)
