I have to say that I didn't expect to sit down a lot to watch "Pitch Black" but I came back a lot in terms of excitement and pure fun. It's the kind of movie where you can just lean, relax and have fun. This is no deep film. Everything he offers is either recycled or ripped off from other movies, such as "Alien", "Predator" or the like. But when I look at the rip-off, I want it to be good, and this is great. Opens with a star galaxy. Some of the biggest films of all time open up with this type of scene - "2001," "Star Wars", "Alien", "Predator". The ship sails through space as the entire cryogenically frozen crew wakes up. The ship was hit by something. It knocks the earth down on a nasty little planet with three suns. Anyone who finds themselves out of the boat when they find their prisoner transport, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel), escaped prison. They search the desolate planet and search for it and eventually find it, but they have no way to regain their ship. They search the planet for water and civilization, but they all suddenly disappear from the planet not too long ago. Then he discovers that every 22 years, planets meet the solar eclipse and the world. the planet turns black. There are also piles of aliens thriving in the dark on the planet - what are the chances? They happen to be on the planet when an eclipse happens - what are the chances? And Riddick has a rare talent - can he see in the dark - again, what are the chances? There seems to be a lot of coincidence in this movie, but a movie like this isn't getting Oscars for originality or credibility. It's there to entertain the audience - it does with ease. Vin Diesel is a great male gorilla without acting talent. But I have to say that if there is someone who fits into a part of a cruel, murderous criminal, it's Diesel. Listen to her muttering, "He didn't know who he was with." Great stuff. Foreigners in this film are a mix between shark hammers, the "Alien" and the Predators. They have long horizontal heads like a hammer, fast extraterrestrial mobility and Predator secrecy. I suppose David Twohy (director and film writer) did not expect viewers to believe that his creation was really something they had never seen before. At least I hope not. "Aliens Redux" could be a better name for this movie, but then it's better than both the second and third "Alien" movie together. At a time when the series's "Terminator 3", "Alien 5", "Predator 3", "Alien vs. Predator" - "Pitch Black" seemed to end up being a new series. Two more sequels are planned. Let's hope it's not over. I can imagine it for twenty-five years: "Aliens vs. Predator vs. Pitch Black Aliens: * Fight of the Year." <br /> <br /> * The name of the fight of the year can be shared with the upcoming movie "Freddy vs. Jason vs. Michael vs. Leatherface vs. Norman vs. Alien vs. Predator vs. Terminator vs. James Cameron vs. Barny the Dinosaur. " <br /> <br/> 4/5.
