Previously, I only wrote one review on IMDb, because I consider most of the games unworthy of time and effort ... The Curse of Monkey Island is different. Monkey 1 and Monkey 1 and 2, I had great expectations for the third edition ... and I wasn't disappointed. The first thing that hit me was significantly improved graphics. Don't get me wrong, for games made in 1990 and 1991, Monkey 1 and 2 were groundbreaking and delivering good stuff, but CMI stands out and delivers a great cartoon-style game that is fun and satisfying. . All scenes and settings have been carefully crafted and thought-out and fit perfectly with this type of game. Animation / CGI is a mixture of realism and exaggeration; fantastic combination in this case. <br /> <br /> The scenario was crucial to the success of the previous two games. The CMI script is smart, convenient and, above all, very cheerful. Added to this, the script is now audio unlike the previous two, where speech is displayed in text format at the bottom of the screen. Dominic Armata's voice is ideal for Guybrush: witty, bright and slightly naive. All other voice talents fit perfectly into their characters, especially Earl Boen, who is behind LeChuck. I loved every character during the game: not only their personality and joke, but the way each character is animated and animated. While on the theme of sound effects, the soundtrack is worth mentioning. The soundtracks for Monkey 1 and 2 were monotonous, and despite this, they were very effective in dispensing the atmosphere and representing a mood change. The CMI soundtrack is again a step up. Each scene is accompanied by catchy, subtle, playful and pirated melodies (if it is a word). With changing settings or moods, the music also adapts, adding to the fun and entertainment that the game has to offer. <br /> <br /> The whole idea behind Monkey Island is to solve puzzles and problems in order to proceed. This may sound easy, but in many places it is devilishly complicated. Some may be postponed by the level of logic and the amount of thinking that goes to Monkey Island, but in reality it makes the game even more fun and fun, and also adds to the value of repetition. The option "Curse of Monkey Island" or "Curse of Monkey Island: Mega-Monkey" (which includes more complex and plentiful puzzles) suits players of all abilities and also gives good reason to play the game at least twice. Regardless of the level of difficulty you choose, you will be guaranteed a different game every time you play, with plenty of speech options and other puzzles that will not affect the outcome of the game but are just for fun. The funniest part of the game is Boat Fight and the Sword "Fights" that follows. They were especially well thought out and the game paid off. Add to this a tremendous story that is nonviolent and suitable for all ages that will keep you hooked and want more to the very end. Finally, in conclusion, special attention must be paid to designers. this game. The way each complex puzzle and problem is invented is simply overwhelming. When collecting items and objects during the game, you can't imagine how everyone will help you with progress, but with a small amount of thoughts and endurance solutions, so CMI designers must be highly appreciated. br /> <br /> 10/10 for the best game I've ever played (no exaggeration)
