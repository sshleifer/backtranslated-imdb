I was a big fan of this series. I watched it again on DVD yesterday. I was worried if the laughter would come or not? But in several episodes I laughed hysterically and some episodes were good. Wise wise Rakesh Bedi (Raja) and Satish Shah are brilliant, while Swaroop Sampat is evil, but I think he can do the job, maybe a better actress could be used instead, showing what good, pure comedy is. <br /> <br /> If this series were on air this year, I'd give her a 9/10 and I think this series is nearly 25 years old and her comedy is still good. 10. I would highly recommend this series for watching on DVD.
