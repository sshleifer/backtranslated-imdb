Women will enjoy this film better than men. Of course, women like all romantic comedies more than men - on average. In general, I like romantic comedies, but I thought it was 5.5 for the first 50% of the film and for 6.5 for the next 40% and 9 for the last 10%. And so, I'm going to say I'm going to rate 7 tapes and keep all movies rated 7 or better and none that is 6 or worse - at least that's my goal. I have over 1200 movies, so why keep dogs. My wife liked this movie more than I did, even though I'm not sure why. I'm a bigger fan of Drew Barrymore than her. The full mention of this film was about a young woman returning to high school (secretly) to write a story about high school experiences. For the first time, dork was in high school and had to learn how to cool for the second time. Her journey to cooldom, as well as her falling in love with a teacher, is a story. What brought me to the first half of the film was what it looked like. I wonder why they would choose it for this role until I realized how capable it was to look like a dog. So much I think I don't want to see her in 15 years when she gets up in the morning. ARGH! She naturally turned into a rather attractive (adorable) woman and became very popular. The end is 9.9 on a very sweet scale so the sapersi will like it. Otherwise, it is not too unforgettable and easily omitted.
