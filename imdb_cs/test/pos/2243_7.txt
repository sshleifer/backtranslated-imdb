Beginning where it ended, Doctor Who, Rose, her alternative dad, Mickey, his alternative counterpart Ricky, and Mickey's little rebel gang find themselves at the mercy of this version of Cybermen realities, this second part of the 2 episode Cybermen Arc feels more like the Doctor Who episode, as opposed to the previous part which honestly felt more of the episode of the defunct show "Sliders", which awarded was a great show in its own right. The arc as a whole was pleasant because I am the one who subscribes to the principle ANY Who is Good Who, but it is inevitable that it will be in comparison with the episode of the Dalek previous series. And these comparisons would only seem like less work. I feel that this story could have been done in one episode. Remember, in the first part of the review, I said that these types of alternative real estate stories usually do not have lasting consequences, but that is not the case, but what changes they generally feel and are not actually in line with the character. /> <br /> My class: C +
