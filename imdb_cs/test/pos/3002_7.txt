Carole and Niles Nelson, a married and married medical team, behave modestly in their careers, but Niles has a gambling problem. His luck changes when he (unknowingly) saves the life of a gangster from Joe Gurney's crowd and gets a big bonus from the gangleader himself. Loving his luck change (and snazzy new apartment), Niles continues to receive payouts for servicing other injured gang members. Unfortunately, his shady agreements come to light in a police raid that hangs a shadow over his wife's career as well. At this point the plot comes to the center of attention as Carole Nelson has to save her career before her license is suspended. This means the gang will be more or less fair. This is not a hard gangster picture, but a conspiracy that could be comfortable at an exhibition like MATLOCK or MURDER SHE WROTE. There is some tension, but the mood is held by the light Bogart is a language-in-face performance of a stupid gangster who imagines himself as "Napoleon Crime." His other gang members also function more like guts than hoodlums. And there is an angry dialogue between Bogart and Francis, especially when he cares for hiding in hiding. Of course, as in all gangster swings, there's a big gunfire end but a humorous twist. This is a good short film that shows Bogart on his rise to fame.
