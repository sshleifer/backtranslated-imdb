This movie is hard to knock. This builds on the tradition of Pulp Fiction, but succeeds by making its own unique style. The cast is amazing, the script is great - and things like strange (Pulp Fiction-esque) time sequencing are done brilliantly. I especially like the way the images provided in flash backup vary dramatically, depending on who tells the story at the time. When he's one of the indoctrinated criminals, everything is flashy and cool, but when it's a memory of the hero, everything is skanky and disgusting. It's an amazing movie - so I'm very upset when I found out I can't buy it anywhere!
