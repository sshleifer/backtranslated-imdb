Three children are born during the solar eclipse, and somehow, 10 years later, they caused them to grow up without conscience. When their present tenth birthday celebrations are approaching, they become cunning and calculating cold-blooded killers. Joyce Russel (Lori Lethin), a pretty girl, finds that she encounters these little horrors when most of the others fall on their angels. Listening back to movies like "The Bad Seed" and "Village of the Damn, this premise of the bad kids movie may not be completely original, but it's still quite disturbing. All three child actors - Elizabeth Hoy, Billy Jacoby and Andy Freeman - they are freezingly convincing, and director Ed Hunt and his co-founder Barry Pearson maintain an uncomfortable yet persuasive mood for the duration of the film, going so far as to charge a little girl for accepting a reluctant peep show where her older sister (future stand-up comedienne and MTV personality Julie Brown, whose striptease is a true vision). <br /> <br /> Name actor Susan Strasberg, as an ice-water teacher, and Jose Ferrer, barely on screen like Doctor, they add their presence to control, while KC Martel, one of the youngsters from the original "The Amityville Horror", is very sympathetic to Brother Joyces. SOLUTIONS as Ellen Geer, B-movie one-man Michael Dudikoff, Cyril O'Reilly ( "Porky," "Dance of the Damned"), Joe Penny ( "Jake and the Fatman") and William Boyett Hidden ") can be seen as well. Touching such parental concerns as children playing with weapons that appeared and locked inside old refrigerators, "Bloody Birthday" is a little more than just slasher variations with children as antagonists. Supported and supported by Arlon Obers' musical score, this film is more in mind than some of his brothers without a lot of gore falling back (though the arrow through the eye gag works pretty well). Grim, ugly and unfavorable, "bloody birthday" is worth looking at curious. <br/> 7/10
