Okay ... so I was looking through my mom and dad for an extensive DVD collection (mostly because they don't charge late fees ;-)) and I'm on "A Thousand Acres". I was amazed that there was a movie that had Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer (with a little performance by Jennifer Jason Leigh) I hadn't seen. I think I've never heard of it. This is exactly what I think, because I have to admit that my parents in my brother and I brought up two film enthusiasts. With a few exceptions (none of them can even make them think about watching the Lord of the Rings movies, but my dad loves the Matrix - GO FIGURE trilogy), we have very similar tastes in movies. Today it was a particularly amazing day. He poured rain all day so I appeared in this movie and shortly after I was fascinated. It must be one of the best best frets I have seen. Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer are GREAT in their roles, especially because they play very different types. Jessica Lange's character is a fan of people who, despite being an older child in the family, rarely have a leading role. Rather, he bows to his father (Jason Robards) and Sister Rose (Pfeiffer) and is tremendous in teaching his little sister Caroline (Leigh) how to treat her. Michelle Pfeiffer plays a very strong desire for cancer that can barely keep her anger at her unhappy life. This film is five years ahead of White Oleander, so it certainly inspired you to see her playing such a strong, angry figure. I must say that this film is likely to be more attractive. women. However, true movie enthusiasts who enjoy the film for what it is, regardless of genre or target audience, will have a hard time denying the magic of this moving family secrets drama and what people involved and those who love them do. I don't know how I missed before I saw this movie, but it certainly was a nice distraction on a rainy afternoon. ENJOY!!
