This movie gave me the most pleasant surprise of what I have ever seen. It was not a big-budget production, and its assumption that middle-aged amateur jazz musicians had unexpected professional engagement at Catskills was rather modest. What is not modest is the success of the film. This is a small piece of the movie that is the funniest. Director Frank D. Gilroy also wrote the script and is full of interesting subplots and unexpected twists. Actors are journeymen who do a solid job. The biggest revelation was Cleavon Little. He plays a professional musician who is hired to fill in for a sick band member. His attitude immediately clashes with others. Although they see it as an opportunity for great entertainment and once in a lifetime, they see it as their work and not particularly interesting. This leads to conflict, but when the group gets in trouble, it drives them. Little, who died too young, really showed me that he is a great actor with this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a real sleeper that a movie fan always wants to discover. I recommend it with all my heart.
