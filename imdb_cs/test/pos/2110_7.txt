I'm a teenager first. OK, and I must say that this movie was pretty good. I think everyone will like it, but everyone in my age may be a bit, um, well, we would describe the movie as LAME! But I like it. It is possible that I am still acting like a child, or visiting a farm every weekend, but this movie was cute. I liked how actors were like kids, not little blond cakes, wearing three layers of clothes, a fashionable hat and about a thousand assecories (like most of today's shows to name a few, Drake & Josh, Lizzie Mc Guire, every kid's show. ) And the setup was perfect, but there was a mistake. The family was in debt, wasn't it? Why in the world did their inner house look like some "western" business? It was one mistake. The portraits are great, there are about five hundred of them, and Julia Roberts is the only explanatory one, the little girl's aunt. How did everyone else get in the world? This movie seemed to be on a solid type of budget. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, it was fun to watch, and I thought some parts were far fetched (Like a cow selling for $ 750,000? Ha! my ass cow sells for so much!) But otherwise it It was good, I liked it, and I could watch it again. But I would never buy it, there are no special features on DVD! What's wrong with that? But rent it, especially if you have small children around the house.
