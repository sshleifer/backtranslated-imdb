People who do not like this film seem to have an academic vendetta against it - those of us who do not have the original can enjoy it. My husband, who never saw the original said, "I don't want to see a girl's movie." I assured him that "women" is just a great movie, not a girl movie. He had a great time. He was very happy to leave and enjoy more than the "kid" movie we saw the day before "burn after reading". SPOILER: I even think the new end is better. Maybe not so fun, but it was beautiful. At first I couldn't understand why they made some changes to the plot, but when I finished and Debra Messing gave birth and brought the first male to the movie, I cried. Is that one thing you need to love about a man? they are our sons.
