The above line sums up quite well. The best benefits of comics are visual gags and verbal jokes (which are almost impossible to translate, which is why comics are in the best language in the best language). It's hard to capture in a movie, which is why you will never be as good as a comic. Movies are simply a different medium from comics. With this in mind, this movie surprisingly well in capturing the fun of comics. The word gags are bearable, and sometimes funny (Debouze makes Amelie a link!). I have to mention that I followed the French version. If you don't look at the French version or your lack of understanding the French language you will be limited to headlines, the word jokes will probably suck. <br /> <br /> Slapstick is also fine; It's a very simple form of humor and not really funny when you're older than twelve, but it captures the spirit of comics. Other visual jokes are movie thrift for an older audience because their often pretty funny. comics. Only Depardieu and Clavier do not really overreach, which may be the reason why some people think they didn't enjoy their roles (I didn't notice anything). On the other hand, Jamel Debouze and especially Claude Rich fit into the artform. It's actually fun to watch. Again, I'm afraid it wouldn't be almost as funny as voices are dubbed. Overall, it's not a bad movie at all, much better than the previous one. It's not a classic, and that doesn't mean Twelve Tasks of Asterix is ​​my favorite Asterix movie, but it's still worth seeing. French version, it is. 7/10
