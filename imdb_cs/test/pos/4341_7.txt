LOL. The mere fact of starting my review with lol says everything. I watched this movie all the time as a child; and then I sensed that it was all stupid. The low budget, the horrible gameplay and the lame scenario was evident then. I watched it yesterday and I couldn't stop laughing. It's so bad, it's actually a good lol. As another reviewer said, he is not serious. There is no way that the film can look and say the creators did it. The soundtrack is so funny that I always laugh. 'Peak' is just laughter rebellion. It's all out of New York's war zone, full of explosions and total chaos ... so ridiculous that you can't take revenge when looking at it. Other funny moments: <br /> <br /> - Kersey and the cop running side by side as two cowboys across the Wild West were so cheap. - <br /> - She killed me how the cannons could shoot at Kersey and he could even fall on one knee, always being so careful (and slow) to not get into the LMAO. Of course, with him it was one shot-one kill with his elephant handgun LOL. Another cheerful scene was over when he finally killed the gang leader .... with ROCKET LAUNCHER lol ... destroying the entire side of the apartment building with him. Obviously, Kersey is all but losing his loved ones ... when his new girlfriend is quickly destroyed after a few dates. The deal is so bad that you can't blame anyone who might think Kersey is angry at destroying a car lol .... running, looking at a carnage and just leaving. Again, so bad, it's good. *** off **** stars.
