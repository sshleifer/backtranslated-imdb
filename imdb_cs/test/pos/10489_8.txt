Tonino Valerie is "Il Prezzo Del Potere" aka. The "Power Price" is excellent and the fascinating Spaghetti Western that mirrors the Kennedy assassination. Giuliano Gemma's Great Leadership and Luis Bacalof's Excellent Score are just two of the many reasons to watch this movie. In 1881, Texas is divided into those who appreciate the abolition of slavery and want to live in peace and those who still want to reinstall the confederation after 16 years. Despite the warning, President James Garfield, who wants to create a new equality policy, decides to visit Dallas, where law enforcement officials are planning his assassination. Bill Willer (Giuliano Gemma) and two of his friends, a black man named Jack Donovan (Ray Shaunders), and a crippled guy named Nick (Manuel Zarzo) are determined to prevent the murder of the president. Since James Garfield was not assassinated by racists who wanted to reinstall a confederation in Texas, but in Washington DC mentally unstable Charles Guiteau, the story of "Power Price" is, of course, historical nonsense. Because the film, however, does not say historical accuracy, but seeks to mention the 1963 Kennedy assassination in Dallas, the fact that the story is fictitious is legitimate. Giuliano Gemma offers excellent performance as the main character Bill Willer, Benito Stefanelli is great as a villainous and corrupt Sheriff Jefferson. Other good performances are Ray Shaunders as Bill's black friend Jack, Warren Vanders as Arthur McDonald, President's Advisor, and Fernando Rey as Pinkerton, a villainous rich businessman. The score written by Luis Enriquez Bacalov is great, cinematography and location are great, and (for example, in Valerie's "Day of Anger") they recall a lot of Sergio Leone for whom Valerie worked as an assistant director for "Fistful Of Dollars" And "For Several dollars more ". "Il Prezzo Del Potere" is another excellent spaghetti western after "Day Of Anger", showing both Giuliano Gemma's great talent as actor and Tonino Valerii as director. "The Price Of Power" is a must-see for Spaghetti Western fans, and I also recommend it to everyone else. 8/10
