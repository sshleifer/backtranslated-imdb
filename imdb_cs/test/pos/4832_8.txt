After finally being able to get a DVD from this HBO 1997 movie, he is wary of looking at him. By the time I finished it, an old proverb "those who cannot learn from the past that they have lived through them." First show four years after the first twin bombing (and four years before the 9/11 events) Path To Paradise reveals a series of close encounters, misunderstandings, and official decisions that led to the first twin bombing. and the lessons we should learn from them. The journey to paradise is a nice cast of believable actors. Peter Gallagher and Marcia Gay Harden have occupied the cast as FBI agents John Anticev and Nancy Floyd, who face not only the threats of terrorism but also the lack of official interest of their superiors along with their NYPD counterpart Lou Napoli (Paul Guilfoyle). Art Malik, Andreas Katsulas, Shaun Toub and Tony Gillan are among those who plan and carry out an attack, all of which play their roles not as potential clich√©s but as real living people and make it a better film. Special mention is Ned Eisenberg as Emad Salem's man, who, if it wasn't for skeptical FBI officials, could potentially report conspiracy. The movie is also well made. Despite the fact that this film was made for cable, this film does not feel like a low-budget film at all with its production values, especially in its sets and locations in New York. The film's fascinating cinematography occasionally gives the film its almost documentary style. When all these elements are combined with the scenario, everything helps the film to give a reality that makes events more and more distracting. The worst thing about the movie is his script. The film's events are true (minus any dramatic license that is always necessary) and, in retrospect, are even more shocking, then had to be when the film was first shown twelve years ago. The film reveals how a group of men could smuggle a bomb into the World Trade Center. They did so because of the lack of Arab translators, government agencies that did not share information with each other, the FBI ignores leadership from the source, and police services are unable to capture traces. Worse, investigators inability to join dots is the fact that many of these same things have not only enabled 9.11 attacks, but in some cases (such as Lack of Translators) there are questions that continue today. Even cooler is the end that really happens and looks too prophetic today. The road to paradise is a film that is essential today. The film is not only well acted and produced, but teaches us the lesson we should learn earlier. An hour of film? That those who cannot learn from the past are doomed to relive it. If you find this movie, watch it and learn from it.
