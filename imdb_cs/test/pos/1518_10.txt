Just beautiful. One of the best ideas - umm ... screws - in existence. Both Rickman and Stowe play their part on the handle of this story about a children's book writer who - perhaps? - wrote a subversive tract. Moscow could learn a few things from torture in this movie. They could also do worse than hire Alan Rickman. Five of the five stars and currently (1-20-2000) # 2 on my 100 best movies of all time series.
