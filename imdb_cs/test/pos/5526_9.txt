This trick as it was, this 1934 Paramount comedy is six comedy artists, paired into three male-and-female teams, who all appear together. W. Fields and his frequent film partner Alsion Skipworth appear in the second half of the film and shine in their roles as City Sheriff and Innkeeper. It seems that Fields was given the opportunity to put a lot of his own unique misanthropic, surrealistic comedy into his part, and it works wonderfully, especially where he is allowed to do his famous pool routine. turning, which is absolutely welcome because it is cheerful. Initially, it seemed like it might look like a mismatch with the movie, which would have the fine home comedy of Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland next to a wide, jokey Vaudeville patter of the great husband-comedy team George Burns and Gracie Allen, but here it works perfectly because parts of George and Gracie are listed in the script. There are freeloaders going on a trip to California on Ruggles and Boland's honeymoon trip and constantly looking for ways to bother them every step of the way, including, brilliantly, when everyone is on the cliff side for an expensive life. To make Burns and Allen's comic disturbances to two sympathetic characters turns out to be the perfect way to fit into their distant, bigger than life-like comic characters into the real world - a comedy of people reacting. Which is just like a gold mine because Gracie's famous naive van alone. Charlie Ruggles deserves special mention for his performance as a crazy banker "Pinky" Whinney. She is wonderfully gentle and underestimated and draws from the lines that could not even be heard in the hands of another actor. The script is amazingly funny and most of the time it is a perfectly widespread comedy of frustration in which our sympathy is with the poor Whinneys who can't get a moment alone, plus the bonus is that what frustrates them is just more top-notch comedy material from Burns and Allen. For predefined watchers some somewhat suggestive material is in some of the most entertaining scenes because Whinney tries to get to George just WHY he and his wife want to be for themselves. There are several signs of rushed production - an occasional jump, one of the most obvious fall sets you'll ever see in a movie (right up with your own Field Field) - a short "golf specialist", and a knot in the box is a tie is constantly changing in shape. But they don't bother me, and they shouldn't bother anyone enjoying the movie. "Six kinds" is a real little-known gem and one of the funniest movies I saw in a while. If you are thinking about looking at it, the answer should be yes.
