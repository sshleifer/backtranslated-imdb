This film is a scary story about the life of the author and poet Mishima. It skips its past, through its last day, and through some of its stories but is professionally built as it moves from section to section. It captures the taste of man, his work and his times ... the difficult 1960s. I think the most beautiful parts (literally full of "wonders") are excerpts from his works. . Kits (specially designed to work with the camera) are amazing .... stylized, beautiful and effective. They can be used as examples for all stage designers. I woke up at night dreaming of the Golden Pagoda. The stories were a powerful exploration of the nature of man and art. After watching this movie, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist. I highly recommend this film to all those interested in art, poetry, theater, politics or Japanese history.
