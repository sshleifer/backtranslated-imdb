When I saw the original when I was 13 (and, yes, I was stupid enough to watch it while babysitting!), I was excited when I saw this remake. Camilla Bell did a great job like Jill Johnson. The fact that a teen horror movie could be filmed this year in 2006, with no huge vulgarity and gore, made it an even stronger film. I had a great time trying not to bite my nails! <br /> <br /> This movie won't win an Oscar, but it's fun and worth watching. I think girls all over the world should watch the original and the remake ... and then decide they'll never watch the kids again. The only thing I can say is that I'm glad I'm too old to guard the kids! There's just something about being in a dark, creepy sleeping house that makes this movie classic. No blood, no blow ... just good psychological fun! WINNER!
