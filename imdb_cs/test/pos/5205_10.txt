In addition to the low budget, it never seems that there are more than 50 Germans in the same scene and the same half songs, this film is an absolute top class. Everything is accurate. I think it's a point from uniforms to horror and disillusionment. Everyone is as gray as gray gray uniforms. The gray men with their lives faded. Forget about us that Gung got rid of him like Blackhawk and Private Ryan. This is one of the best war movies ever. A single iron cross beats this for tension and story. Could we have a German language in the UK with an English version? No need to pay ridiculous import charges from Europe. Most other DVDs are multilingual. Why not this?
