My dad was driving Lee Evans back and forth to see that something was happening. It's a great movie! Bob Pugh walked past the shed with a lawnmower and accidentally released and went into the fence and fell. Lee Evans was also funny when he saw me and said you were cold. and he said no whack his hands in his pockets! I think it was really funny and it will be a well-known comedy. Like every other Lee Evans movie! They were really great people. They seemed quite polite and funny. One day I would like to meet them. Brenda Blethyn walked out of her caravan with blood down and twigs in her tousled hair, and I was really scared when I didn't notice her until she was right behind me
