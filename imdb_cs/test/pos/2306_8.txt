Eros and Thanatos, love and death command the dialectics of life. In the late 19th century, in a remote Japanese village, a young man and a married woman, older than him, fall in love and choose to kill their husband so they can enjoy their love. But they will never enjoy this freedom, because Remorse is beginning to chase them, as is usually the case with the weakest member of the couple, of course, a woman. From there in an atmosphere where the dream (nightmare) mixes with reality, the spirit of the murdered husband first appears to the woman, but then to the man. It also haunts the dreams of other villagers creating a climate of suspicion and gossip around the couple, which is aggravated by the arrival of a police officer who comes to investigate the disappearance of the murdered husband. But this makes this film more interesting than this almost common story of adultery is the development of the feeling of couple in Shakespeare's profound psychological and dramatic development of remorse, anxiety and fear that will transform their love affair into a nightmare until their last destruction. Expressionism so dear to Japanese theater or playing movies is also present in players' performances, but not in exaggerated form. Only on the necessary scale to show the deepest feelings of the depicted characters more effectively. This is a really good good movie.
