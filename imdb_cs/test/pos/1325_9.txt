The first season told quite a lot how all elements of the Marine Corps would work (ie Earth, Air, Helicopters and Nozzles) as a team. This is the season I give high ratings! (It is true that there are still many "freedoms" in Season 1, but the stories were more believable.) The following seasons were a gawd-terrible attempt by Melrose Place to meet the Top Gun! I was at that time a maritime station at Miramar and I remember shooting around San Diego. I have to talk to Rod Rowland and James Brolin. Rowland's character was good. Brolin's character was good in the first season. For some reason he relaxed after the first ep of the second season. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the LITTLE of how the Marine Air Ground team works, then the season one is the one that is watching. If you're in Melrose Place and soap opera as a plot to try to merge them into the Top Gun, then you'll see the last two seasons.
