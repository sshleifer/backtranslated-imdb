Excellent and charming. Justin Henry is beautiful as the blissful and malicious Howard Kaylan, lead singer for the top ten hit bands The Turtles. Real magic is the titular succession with the academic award that Royale Watkins suits. A performance that fully captures the mystic yet Jimi Hendrix. Not many films, incredibly so, can find the essence of a special moment in life and at times. I would like it to be available in every home store without any hassle. What is it? <br /> <br /> Thanks to Eddie. A good addition to the history of psychedelic 1960s. There was a clear wink in his eyes.
