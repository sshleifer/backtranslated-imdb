Because cats have nine lives, I'll give you nine reasons to see this movie: <br /> <br /> * Berlioz and Toulouse kittens play the piano together (so incredibly cute! ) * Auto-chasing dogs Napoleon and Lafayette * Toulouse jumping as electrified every time he wants to be like a hard aisle cat * Marie sighs romantically while the aisle of cat O'Malley seduces her mom * Scat Cat and his jazz band, sing "ev" fishers wants to be a cat "* Stupid but good and nice English goose Am√©lie and Abigail that make cats walk like geese * O'Malley gets a" magic carpet "that puts Cheshire cat into shame * Roquefort on a bold way to help mice from aisle cats * Edgar Butler chases the scenes and moves from a nice guy to a mad cat hate for a bad cat schedule
