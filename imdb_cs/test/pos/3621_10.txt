Incredibly cheerful Italian Rootsploitation in the mid-1970s with lots of non-consensual S&M, lesbian sex, gratuitous racial cruelty, etc. ... Few redeeming film qualities, except for relatively cool thematic music with dubbs "African" drums and flute. Brilliant Demonstration Dialogue: White Plantation Manager: "You're so stupid, I bet you forgot to interrogate that n midwife!" White Plantation Manager: "Not only did I hear her, I did it so well that she died before I could get any answers from her!" All black actors are 70 years old. and say "yes, meat" in your voice. Female lead has sex with everyone on the plantation. 10 stars for sleaze-free fans.
