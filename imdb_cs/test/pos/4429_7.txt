I think the film's title describes it well. If you're looking for a documentary about Louis Kahne and his work, you'll have to look elsewhere. though some of it is covered in this film. Of course, I eat almost nothing I fed, and I don't know many of the family history revolves around this case. So I believed what I was told about Nathaniel and his father, etc. <br /> <br /> For what this movie was, I thought it was pretty good. a little slower and grabbing attention over time, I wish nathaniel focused a little more on his father's work than his family drama (though most history was interesting, louis was a bit of a player). It is really a way through one's life, and I love that brand along for experience. for me it is a learning experience and it seems to be for filmmakers. oh, and the footage of some of the work of the burner is * stunning *
