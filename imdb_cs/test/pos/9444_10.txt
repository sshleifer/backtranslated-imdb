This has to be one of the best episodes of Doctor Who I've seen since he came back last year. There is a brilliant blend of fun, fear and tenderness all together, which equals one amazing episode. Ood has been brilliantly designed and I'm sure there will be lots of jokes in the next few weeks. I myself am guilty of this. I especially liked the way we saw a different view of Rose's relationship with the Doctor and the end, well, it's the first time I hid behind a pillow! I can't wait until next week's episode to see how they get out of this mess.
