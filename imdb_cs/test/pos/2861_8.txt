With her sister Betty (2000), a respected independent filmmaker Neil LaBute (In the Society of Men, Your Friends and Neighbors), she makes her big-budgeted breakthrough (Betty is $ 24 million as opposed to a $ 25,000 corporate), and still remains faithful its roots. While his cast is now composed of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains as bizarre and unpredictable as his first two features, proving that he can only be next . the big thing. Sister Betty is one of the darkest comedies to be advertised towards the main audience in the years, and due to her mild cashier and critical success, viewers may not be as stupid and brainwashed as we are. The story follows (both metaphorically and literally) the naive waitress (Zellweger) who fell in love from a distance with a nice soap star (as good as that Gets is Greg Kinnear) but is trapped in a ruthless marriage to a slender car dealer (Aaron) \ t debuted on a large screen in the company). When her husband is terribly murdered by two hitmen (Freeman and Rock), he is sent to shock and forgets to go to Hollywood to meet her affection - they don't know he's just an actor. When Freeman and Rock realize that the car he takes contains 10 kilograms of cocaine, they also hit the road, followed by an outrage. Fans of LaBute's earlier work would find it hard to figure out how it could be the same man who ran In The Company of Men - a tragicomedy about two cruel sexist pigs who play a practical joke on a deaf co-worker - but when you think about it , the connection is fairly clear: in a society a vulnerable woman is unaware that she is ruthlessly exploited. In Betty, a vulnerable housewife does not realize that the man he is chasing thinks her real adoration is nothing but a joke. Some might wonder if LaBute is really a misogynist - with the recurring theme of the fall of innocent women. But personally, I think he comes to the defense of just sex, and he is much more cruel with the violent in his paintings than the abused. One of the many charms of this movie is that it is a full-featured absurdity: most directors would leave a story on two hit-chasing women who chased a dream while working with a script like this one. But LaBute knows better and has one of the hitmen (Freeman) also obsessed with Betty. This was an interesting role for Freeman to take because it allowed him to play off his trademark `this-is-in-time-time character '(see Unforgiven, Se7en, and 1998's stinky hard rain); the supporting cast also includes the famous Weirdo Crispin Glover (Back to the Future), Allison Janney and `Mad About You's Kathleen Wilhoite. The script, written by the first timers John C. Richards and James Flamberg, is enthusiastic (honestly: have you ever seen a comedy - or ANY film on which a person watches - in which one's own dining room is set on fire?). One might argue that the end is too perfect, but it really is not worth denying everything that is great for a movie for a single trivial complaint. If Sister Betty is a sign of what LaBute has for us to do next, you can bet I'm going to compare what she decides to follow. <br /> <br /> Level: A-
