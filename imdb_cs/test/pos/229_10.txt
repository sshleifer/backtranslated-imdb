One night I listened to the radio and had Leslie Nielsen on the program. He went on to explain why there were only 6 shows. '<br /> <br /> With TV shows like MASH, you can go to the fridge to have a beer and if you have heard what's going on, nothing escapes you. But with a police unit, you should watch the show, with gags you missed a lot if you haven't seen it. Who could forget "... part of the city known as" Little Italy "..." with a colossus in the background. Even movies relied on gags, but then in the theater you were in the audience's captivity. Leslie also said that one reason why shows, movies and other movies like the plane were funny because they didn't try to say what was funny. It was up to the viewer to get jokes. Well, these are just my 2 cents.
