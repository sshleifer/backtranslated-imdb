Only such British could make such a movie and be so charmingly charming! Betty (Brenda Blethyn) wants something more out of her life, but she doesn't know what, when she realizes he's in love with her childhood friend, Boris (Alfred Molina), who owns a local funeral parlor. Meanwhile, the American (Christopher Walken), who "wants to" entertain funerals, moves to this small Welsh community with his assistant (Lee Evans) and wants to give Boris a run for his money with a fancy, thematic funeral. Brenda and Boris decide to hold Brenda's death and funeral with cheerful results, a very nice movie - if you are a fan of British comedies like "Waking Ned Devine," you'll love it.
