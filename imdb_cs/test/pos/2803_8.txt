In France, Xavier (Romain Duris) is a young economist of twenty and several years who is trying to get a job in the government department through his father's friend. It is recommended to specialize in the Spanish economy and language to get a good position. He decided to apply for a European exchange program called "Erasmus" and move to Barcelona to improve his knowledge of Spanish culture and language. Leaving her friend Martine (Audry Tautou), promising to keep in touch with her, and once in Barcelona is temporarily subordinate to French doctor Jean-Michel (Xavier de Guillebon) and his young and lonely wife Anne-Sophie (Judith Godrèche) met at the airport. Later she moves to an apartment with foreign students: English Wendy (Kelly Reilly), Spanish Soledad (Cristina Brondo), Italian Alessandro (Fédérico D'anna), Danish Lars (Christian Pagh) and German Tobias (Barnaby). Metschurat). After that, Belgian Isabelle (Cécile de France) and brother Wendy William (Kevin Bishop) join this group and Xavier learns Spanish and finds friendship and love in his experience abroad. "L 'Auberge Espagnole" is one of those films that the viewer sadly ends. The story is a pleasant and witty story of friendship and love in a globalized world and a united Europe. This very charming film made me feel good and happy, even though I never experienced living in a student republic. Newbie William provokes the funniest situation along the story, with big mouths and a short brain. Furthermore, it is great to see the new approach of students living together different from those stupid American fraternity and their stereotypes common in American movies. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Albergue Espanhol" (Spanish Auberge)
