It is a great movie you can watch because Andrzej Wajda is so pretty, but at the same time I wished the film had even more depth in his story. It's a historically relevant film about the last days of the French Revolution, but the film has forgotten to focus on character motivation, making the film a little too shallow to consider it a great and relevant film. Somehow this does not mean that the film is no less big. It is made with enthusiasm and detail. Every aspect of the movie is good looking like its settings, costumes and working with the camera. The story still works as powerful, but at the same time it could be much better and stronger with just a little more character development and historical insight. Guess if you are completely familiar with the French Revolution and especially with the stories of Danton and Robespierre, this film will be great for you. <br /> <br /> It's typical for a French film. The story is slow and gentle without getting too close. Often it happens charmingly, but in this case the film could really do with a little more depth. In addition, this film is still one of the examples of French cinema, despite being directed by a Polish director and a lot of Polish actors. GÃ©rard Depardieu is his great role, although the film also decides to concentrate much on many other different characters. The movie may have too many characters, but every show is great, so it never really becomes a big complaint than slowing it down in the story at some point. A great movie that could be great. <br /> <br /> 8/10
