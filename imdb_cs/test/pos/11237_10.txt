I don't know what the last reviewer is talking about, but this show is pure fun. Basically 2 dudes are placed in competitions at the club to pick up girls in 3 different scenarios. They mix scenarios for each show, so it's not always the same. A jury of 4 judges is not afraid to call or admit when they recognize a game. They break what the guy did wrong, and what the guy did. Some competitors are weak, some are strong, but what's happening is always fun. If you're the guy who goes out, you can relate. I saw a weak game, I saw a strong game and this show is for real. Undoubtedly.
