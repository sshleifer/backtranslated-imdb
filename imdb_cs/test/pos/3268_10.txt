Five Years ago, if you were to watch an Australian movie, you would expect to see crocodile hunters, war stories, queens, kangaroos and koalas, and Australians represented in the general being. like nitwits living outside the country, saying words like cobber 'and generally being a classic underdog. Fortunately, the Australian film has evolved over the past few years and is spewing a modern day? classics like Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People. <br /> <br /> There are also two hands in this film development. <br /> <br /> Set in Kings Cross in Sydney, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival at the rough end of the city. Pando, played by Bryan Brown, is boss Sydney Mob. He is the king of organized crime wearing belts, carrying stubby and helping his son with his origami. He's evil, but real. Like his "crowd", he holds a gun on one's head in one scene and then plays boardgames in the next. They are respected and if they ask you for a favor, you will not say no. Enter Jimmy, played by Heath Ledger. Jimmy is your average Aussie guy in the early twenties. He's a good man who wants to make a name for himself without getting on the wrong side, so when Pando asks Jimmy to bring $ 10,000, Jimmy accepts it. Things start to get excited when 2 teenagers manage to steal money while Jimmy is on the beach. So now Jimmy is $ 10,000 in the department's big boss. From here we begin to see all the related stories with Jimmy and his attempt at bank robbery to get back our money, Jimmy and Alex (love interest played by Rose Byrne), Pando tries to find Jimmy and, of course, the two teenagers and their newfound prosperity. The concept is deepened by the narrator, Jimmy's dead brother, Michael, who was killed by Pand and his gangs earlier. Finally, all the stories connected really well with a surprising step to shock and stun the audience. I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br />
