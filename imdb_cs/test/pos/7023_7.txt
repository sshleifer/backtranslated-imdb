Jennifer Gray seems to be the most likely romantic lead, and that's probably why this beloved movie is such a hit. It's very good to do a version of Montagus and Capulets with sweeteners like dance and schadenfreude-baiting Jewish family of the tropes thrown, but there usually must be an X factor. Swayze probably makes this movie safe with his rough, post-Travolta moves and temperament, but his being won over this curly-mopped Penelope Pitstop teen, which brings a dream within reach of the moving market. Super (dated? Perhaps the 'immortal') soundtrack helps and of course cunning the pretentious setting of the film at the resort away from everyday life together completes the fantasy. 7/10
