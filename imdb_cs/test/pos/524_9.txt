This movie has to be exported to the rest of the world! An absolute masterpiece with a bizarre and gloomy film about four different stories from four different locations in Sweden. The newly renovated hotel with the wrong wooden figure of the old finance minister is the best of four, special stories about love or career. I'd like to see all four as the film itself can be much more widespread. Also a unique pause in the middle is something I've never seen before. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for a series (if they do it) or for a longer DVD time. They seemed to have cut a lot to fit in just 3.5 hours.
