This wonderful, well-written film is based on a New York theater play bearing the same title where Sir Aubrey (Knight Sir Charles Aubrey Smith in 1944) created the role he plays in the film. Here, in 1931, we see him at an early stage of his acting renaissance in a very early period of "interviews" and in a character role he would create until his death in 1948 after completing his last appearance in Little Women, Released in 1949 This engaging game is about an older British aristocrat who locates his illegitimate children and presents them when he brought them to his estate in England. Marion Davies plays her daughter after a mistake and it's a tour for her. She is suddenly persistent, impatient, shallow, charming, wise and compassionate, while creating an indelible and charming character that remains in memory. 26-year-old Ray Milland appears here in a small but prominent role that has already appeared on seven more photos, then only in movies for over two years. The film should be tied to a 1931 Hollywood factory, and of course it is not flawless. However, it is a charming pleasure from the first scene to the last.
