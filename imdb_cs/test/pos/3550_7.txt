Sure, he has his spectacular moments, he plays like art-house, live action Fantasy, but also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus movies are always a problem, but I have always been very interested in them. I will now evaluate the segments individually. Nicolas Roeg - "Un ballo in maschera" - This segment can very well spoil the movie for some people because it's the worst of the game. It's hard to watch, mainly because he's trying to follow a clear plot (the one he hacks). The photo is unfinished. The best part is a bit of lesbian homoerotics with which it is never enough. This segment made me very nervous about continuing. 2/10. Charles Sturridge - "La virgine degli angeli" - a vague segment, but it hardly matters. The film has the best cinematic bunch, mainly because it is in stunning black and white. The segment is dreamy and beautiful. 7/10. Jean-Luc Godard - "Armide" - I chose a brave film for the Godard and Altman segments. I was much more impressed with Godard than I thought I'd be. I cannot claim that I have seen that many of his films because he has done so much that almost no one has seen, but, judging by what I have seen, this may be his best work since the 60s. It's the funniest segment in this movie, and most artistically perfect. Bravo, Jean-Luc! 9/10. Julien Temple - "Rigoletto" - a very funny segment, is also quite predictable. Yet this story of a husband who cheats each other in the same center is beautifully filmed with long, comprehensive tracking that depends on the timely choreography of the actors. It also has a large self-referring joke about the summary films themselves. The last scene is very weak. 7/10. Bruce Beresford - "Die tote Stadt" - This short segment includes lovers (I think) Venice. It's nice, with nice shots of doves flying around the city. It's light but nice. 7/10. Robert Altman - "Les Bor√©ades" - not one of the better segments, unfortunately it is more a music video than a short film concept. It includes residents of the insane asylum procedure who take part in a theater performance. Music and pictures work well together, so at least I can admit it's a good music video. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Franc Roddam - "Liebestod" - Somewhat unhappy with the Beresford segment, this segment is very similar to this segment. As you might expect from my phrasing, this has hit me much more. It's a young man and his girl who goes to Las Vegas for a fatalistic cruise. 8/10. Ken Russell - "Nessun dorma" - perhaps the most visible segment that plays more in the world of fantasy than in reality. It's a beautiful story of a fallen angel. 8/10. Derek Jarman - "Depuis le jour" - I've heard a lot about Jarman and it's the first movie I've seen of him. I hope to see more in the future. This is also music-videoish, but it's better than Altman's lead. Above all, it is an old woman who remembers her younger days. Editing and using different movie titles, which represent time and emotions, are very beautiful. 8/10. Bill Bryden - "I Pagliacci" - A sad clown, perhaps one of the most famous arias (especially unforgettable from the Seinfeld episode), it serves as a material separating each mowing and final. It's simple and effective. 7/10. Overall I give him a solid 7/10. It's not as close as you heard.
