I was expecting a lot from this movie and I can say that I was not disappointed. First of all, this film, like a world wine tour, has let the viewer enjoy beautiful places. Interviewees are also interesting and entertaining, especially Hubert de Montille. Shooting can be confusing, the camera is always unstable and often focuses on secondary elements in the background. You may not like it, but I don't consider it a defect. The themes mentioned in the film can also be a bit confusing because globalization is not the only issue discussed. But Nossiter managed to give the film its consistency throughout. The great success of this film is the revelation of all the characters in the wine industry, as they are in fact, avoiding the clich√© "Good against Evil". This could be the main difference between "Mondovino" and Michael Moore; Nossiter's gaze seems subtle, through the views expressed by his favorite characters. The richness of this documentary is based primarily on the characters, the history of long-standing wine families such as De Montilles, Mondavis, Antinori and Frescobaldi. Nossiter allows the viewer to find out that wine is in some way associated with families and not just business and industry. This movie doesn't mean you want to drink wine, but you will want to discover vineyards and winemakers. I watched this film as a student in Enology and left us only a few options to learn. Despite its technical peculiarities, I am giving this document 10 out of 10.
