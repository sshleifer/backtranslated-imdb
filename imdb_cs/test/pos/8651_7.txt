The man comes to a strange, beautiful, sterile city where no one feels any emotions and possesses a place of interior design. The basic similarity of his days resembles "Groundhog Day"; the strange corridors in and out of this world are more like "John Malkovich's being." But indeed, it is a Scandinavian film, a piece of selfish satire that is also in Scandinavian style: the tone is austere, and even the most fantastic scenes are played straight, laughing ridiculously. In my opinion, this combination is not entirely successful: there is not enough real laughter to compensate for the difficulty of the work as a pure drama. It is certainly original; Perhaps my problem is that the world that satirizes is not the one I respect. Maybe I should move to Scandinavia!
