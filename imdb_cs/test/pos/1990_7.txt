An immersive exploration of virtual reality, although it is not yet clear how much the director himself intended. This film will deliberately guide you through several layers of artificial reality, leaving only subtle clues about what layer of virtual reality you are in. Also, it can be seen as a satire of video games - but the whole film may be mistaken for an imitative form here. He does not seem to be able to escape from the game genre he imitates; so satire becomes problematic. But many interesting ideas cross the world: the biological mutant is one; the interface between technology and biology, the cyborg urge to overcome reality - and philosophical allusions such as the title to Heidegger, along with existential questions: ie game characters are partially scripted or determined and yet partly free to change their destiny and wonder how strange it is in the game. One character then notes that this existential confusion is just like real life, thus erasing the difference between virtual and real. As well as observing that it is uncomfortable to come across a world where you do not know what will happen next, and you are not sure how to play because you have to come across to find out the target and unknown rules. The virtual game within the game is titled "TranscendenZ". Also, criticism of how virtual violence makes us unable to feel the effects of real violence. Even the heroes at every level of ontological existence are bewildered by violence. They don't like it, but it's exciting and part of the "game" that fears it is real. The game creator, the god of the system, is finally murdered; however, this scenario takes place in direct concurrence with the video game we have just witnessed - and viewers believe it is still just part of the virtual reality. In the end, the film does not solve the doubts about whether it is "real", but it's clear (for me anyway). Existenz means Da-sein: You are there. You are thrown into a set of rules and secrets on each level. Virtual reality recapitulates reality. And his common game motifs, as a royal path to the unconscious, express our own fascination with violence. Although Cronenberg confirms these philosophical allusions in a film interview, he claims to be very much against "the reality ... {underground name of the terrorist group}, which is shown in the film both in the game and" real "level." It seems that Cronenberg has not made so many thoughts in the film, though his impressive education is going through. An interview in Cineaste gives the impression of a middle intellectual trying to be an avant-garde propensity. Cronenberg is simply on the side of free imagination - the clich√© of the bourgeois modernist credo - despite the recognized ambivalence. (My impression here could be due to one limited interview.) However, Cronenburg seems to be devoid of the sense that his film betrays the mistake of an imitative form (here he mimics computer games while doing their satirical criticism but criticism that is unable to "transcend" the same form) probably because he thinks he's "imaginative" and radical. Yet the imaginative world of film is more bearable and less proficient than our own world. It remains trapped in the computer game worldview.
