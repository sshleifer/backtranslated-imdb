Now I'm a little biased because I'm a big fan of late night television. I was a loyal fan of Jay Len for about 6 or 7 years and I think he is one of the funniest, most talented comedians. And David Letterman is also a hell of a comedian, even if I watch his ad (unless Jay repeats) during the ads or when he has a better guest on the show than Jay. Daniel Roebuck and John Michael Higgins are both great actors and very much like Jay and Dave, but they disappeared into the characters? No way. Roebuck barely clutched Jay's voice and expression on the high pitch and sounded like a neuter Marlon Brando. Higgins cloves David's facial expressions (for example, his trademark trembles), but he doesn't pick up Dave's voice. Those who are not big fans of late night television can be much less interested. There are a couple of comedians who can make Jay's dead personification. Why couldn't they choose one of them for this section? And the same goes for Dave. They'd better play Norm McDonald. Norm doesn't look that much like Dave, but he made a great impersonation on SNL. "Hey ... do you have rubber?" That was so cheerful! However, I learned a lot about the war events, which I had very little at first. I've never seen "The Tonight Show" before Jay Leno was hosted, so I didn't know about the fight that would finally replace Johnny Carson and countless negotiations that eventually convinced Dave to move to CBS. I knew very little about what happened behind the scenes and the film was very informative. And Kathy Bates gives a knockout performance as a former executive producer of "The Tonight Show". Basically, the film steals. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10) <br /> <br />
