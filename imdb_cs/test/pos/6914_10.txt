That's speculation. This movie could inspire Paramount Pictures for the Core movie. Both films have something in common. The only improvement for Inferno is a better cast. Inferno's cast is still good. Excellent movie 8 out of 10. It's worth watching. This film is right that heat waves are real. Another piece of truth is the heat-related power outage. Where I live, I actually heard the transformers. Dissatisfaction with heat is possible because people who try to cool can be noisy. There is a considerable amount of team work in this film. Again, this film is worth watching. The film has a good cast. The film has no slow places.
