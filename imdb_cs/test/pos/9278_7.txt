I was really looking forward to watching this documentary about what I thought was one of the most fun movies I've ever made. Growing up in L.A. During the 1960s many of these old black and white films were featured at local stations. I even remember the Friday evening show entitled "Strange Science Fiction Stories" that showed a variety of Sci Fi movies every week. However, this documentary has spent too much time on the views of four famous filmmakers and on how they felt about the classic films of this genre and how they used them as inspiration in their filming. This is not what happened. I hoped in this document. Indeed, it could have been a complex exploration of the decade instead of a brief highlight of the most famous films of that time. Anyone who has studied or been interested in these films is very familiar with standouts such as the War of the Worlds, the Forbidden Planet, Thing, the Day the Earth Stood Still, and so on. with people involved in making these films. I would have to agree that the document was too focused on Spielberg's views and was the type of advertising for his new edition of the War of the Worlds.
