He loved airport shots - Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., Just a single building called in blocks on the roof. And three-engine engines and well-dressed passengers. Fast for 75 years .... <br /> <br /> But what really happened to me was a hammer and sickle sign and what seemed to be a Chinese ideogram next to the logo, on the stern of the starboard fuselage pilot's seat. Remember when Neil and Jill get to know each other about becoming a general in the Chinese rebel army? That, based on hammer and sickle, could only be the popular revolutionary army of Mao Tse Dung !!! No matter what underwear and unwavering couple in bed - would it survive the logo and link during the Cold War? Additional Observation 12/27: This 1930s film with the Soviet emblem may / must also reflect the influence and charm of communism in Hollywood and most of America during depression. It adds to the historical value of this amazing movie. I also liked the aspects of the American Dream of Two Winnemucco Boys, who at least once had a storm around the world, the Red-Blooded (literally and abundantly in Jim's case) American Boys. Others commented more than I did on acrobatics, etc. I loved it all. <br /> <br /> This jewel has earned more than 1.5 stars Osborne et al. part of the American history of the early 1930s.
