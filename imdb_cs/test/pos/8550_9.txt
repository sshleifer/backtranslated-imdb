It is a finely crafted movie with moving sequences, humor and the best of all love stories. Anthony Quinn is beautifully thrown and after seeing several of his films, this must be classified as one of his best performances, except Zorba. The movie really wonders if it was filmed in Romania, which is probably not the case. It is sure to deceive native Romanians, with authentic landscapes, costumes and ways of life. According to IMDb, he is actually shot in France and Yugoslavia, hmmm. The story is convincing, so you want to watch the whole movie to see if you've missed something. That provoked me to see if it was a truth-based movie, but to my disappointment, it's a fiction film, seemingly fiction. It seems to be a little bit attracted to the fact that it has happened to the real, but never knowsâ€¦ The only problem with this movie is that it does not seem to occupy all the Romanian actors and it is a Romanian film. In the beginning, there are probably many Romanian fillings, but maybe not, it is shot elsewhere. The book was written by Romanian, at least everything was fine and dandy - a masterpiece in cinematography.
