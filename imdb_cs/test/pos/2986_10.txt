A remarkable film that brings to the surface all kinds of feelings I had when I was much, much younger. I loved it and the music of Elton John. I remember seeing in movies when I was a kid, and for some reason (limited edition?) I never knew anyone else to see this movie when it was released. The dreams that inspired me a few decades ago never left me, and when I saw that the movie had brought everything back recently, it hastens back, but I admit that my children (at the age of 20) have not experienced A similar emotional rush. Generation thing? Why isn't it on DVD?
