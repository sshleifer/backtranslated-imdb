This particular title is very interesting. The whole movie was like watching a ninja RPG, which is really cool. Three magic swords, three clans, a terrible demon, political power, yotoden has it all. the animation is decent, but a little grainy, the story is top and the battle scenes are really cool. One thing that really looks good in this movie are monsters. they are pretty weird. If you liked blood reign and ninja scroll, yotoden is the one who sees it.
