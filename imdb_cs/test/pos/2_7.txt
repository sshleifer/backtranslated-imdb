My measure of watching a movie is when I get to the squirm. If I start moving positions and noticing that the butt is aching, the film is too long. This film has not even come close to being boring. Predictable in some parts sure but never boring. All other military branches had love notes written about them and saw their recruitment levels increasing, why not the Coast Guard? They are certainly underestimated until the day your ship sinks. The movie was very entertaining and fun. Kevin Costner is perfect as an aging man who doesn't know when to stop. However, I was most impressed with the performance of Ashton Kutcher. I never liked him, I never saw his TV shows and I always considered him immature ... well, punk. He does a great job in this movie! He is well on his way to being a leader. I think the film we showed had to be a gradual rough cut, or something like that, because about 2/3 of the way, the film changed to very grainy, the sound level dropped and the microphones were dropped down all over the place. Also, when viewing, the film's representatives were looking for feedback from the audience - especially on the parts of the movie that we didn't like. <br /> <br /> ***** POSSIBLE SPOILER: The feedback I asked and at the beginning a few lines. Kevin Costner returns home to see his wife, Sela Ward, pack up things and go out. He says, "Maybe I should be the one who moves out." And she says, "No, you don't know where there is something in this house; I should be the one who will go." That doesn't make any sense: If the layout is so good, Costner is right, he should be the one to leave.
