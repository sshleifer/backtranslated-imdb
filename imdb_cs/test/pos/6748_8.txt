There had to be sales on this story back in the 1940s. The epidemic threatens New York (it's always New York) and nobody takes it seriously. Some might say that Richard Widmark and Jack Palance have done better in Panic in the streets, but I disagree. <br /> <br /> There's always something about these Poverty Row products that really touch the nerve. Production values ​​are never so polished and acting is a bit rough at the edges, but that's why I think this film and those that are similar are effective. Rough, grainy, nervous. And cast. All 2 shooters or A list of actors around their prime. No egos here. These people were glad they got the job. Whit Bissell, Carl Benton Reid, Jim Backus, Arthur Space, Charles Korvin, and Reed Hadley's melodic voice that flows in the background like oil. By the way, I'm in the hospital several times; How come my nurses never looked like Dorothy Malone? They do not bother too much with makeup and hair in these kinds of movies, but they really managed to turn Evelyn Keyes into the hag. Or maybe they completely left out makeup and hair. Anyway, it was quite effective. She plays a gems smuggler who raises a case of Small Pox in Cuba while smuggling jewelry back for an ultra-villain Charles Korvin (who is flogging her sister in between). You got a customs representative for her, and the Ministry of Health was looking for her because she was going to get rid of New York. 4th Amendment Rights here. Everyone gets a hassled. <br /> <br /> You must have the right approach to enjoy this movie. I have a brother who explores movies to death. If he doesn't keep his Orsonian norms, the bombs are merciless. He must have the directorial excellence of David Lean's film, Wolfgang von Korngold's score, Douglas Shearer and Cedric Gibbons' sound and art. That's not it. But I have the right attitude, and if you do, you'll love this movie.
