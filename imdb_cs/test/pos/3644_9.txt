Pretty decent for his early work and no Kokaku Kidotai without it, and gets 2 extra points for Easter eggs. For Shirow there is definitely a ladder rung. I'm impressed as a Shirow fan, but it was a big step from Dirty Pair, which I knew about him. Violent Fun With Porn Soundtrack! You can't help but notice it. I know that people appreciate him for the Spirit in Shell .. but all the deep spiritual stimuli were solved in Appleseed. ESWAT was killing terrorists, fighting for people to remain viable as they used them, and Deunan remained thin despite his unhealthy food intake. Definitely like characters and traitors ... and I don't know why.
