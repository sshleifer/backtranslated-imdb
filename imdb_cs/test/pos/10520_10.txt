These immortal lines begin to be directed by Jack Starret's directorial work, "Dion Brothers." The plot is centered around the two blue-collar West Virginian Brothers (Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest) who are robbery in the hope of using the money to open a fish restaurant !! What follows is quite an adventure and many comedy events. The action scenes are all top-notch and consist of several well-executed shootings. The other is absolutely amazing and is found in an abandoned building that is destroyed by a demolition ball! The film was written by the famous director Terrence Malick. All in all, the superb hidden gem of the 70s and easily one of the best action / comedy hybrids each made. Hopefully he will soon get a decent widescreen DVD.
