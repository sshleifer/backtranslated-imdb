Matthau is a widowed hospital doctor who enjoys her only position, legs, and available nurses in the workplace, while colleague and friend Richard Benjamin looks with fun and amazement. Their boss is hard to hear when it is a senile chief of staff, Art Carney, who is re-elected to this post. Matthau is a satisfied player who plays in the field without commitment until he meets a single mother, Glenda Jackson, who insists he is the only woman in life when he is in life. At the same time, he found himself under pressure to respond to the ambitious advances of a potential participant in unfair practices and to support Shambol and incompetent Carney in his attempt to be re-elected Chief of Staff. This is an excellent old-fashioned romantic comedy decorated with four A-class actors and excellent casting support with first-class dry, caustic and sarcastic scenarios. Carney steals every scene he is in and talks to the IMDb on the floor when he is loud on the screen. Otherwise, we enjoy the on-off relationship between two leaders and different sub-fences. <br /> <br /> He doesn't get the ambition to be a great movie, but he remains one of the best of his kind and attention. -watchable for its comic value itself. It deserves more attention than it seems to have received and is worth the price of a DVD or video cassette.
