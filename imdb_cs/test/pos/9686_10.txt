... but at the same time part of you thinks, "Am I ready for what I see?" Finally, you're happy to see it. I was at least. Jackass Number Two has twice the laughter and twice the action. Some pieces leave their breath. Besides the little Miss Sunshine, I think it was the best movie I saw this summer. Maybe this year. The whole cast is back, except for a few, such as Chris Raab and Rake Yohn. I don't think any of the members has a boring moment. Each stunt was either funny or dangerous, or a combination of both; stupid. The beginning was just as fun as the first and the end was interestingly cheerful; casting a music number. Jackass Number Two is the perfect movie you can see with your friends. Stay in credits, there are some pretty funny moments. One includes Luke Wilson.
