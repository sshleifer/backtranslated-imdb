Shame is somewhat unique as a war film (or rather a rather anti-war film) in that it does not focus solely on soldiers or politics (there is politics but not how you think it would be shown). two beings that can be taken care of in this brutal, crumbling society they inhabit. In the midst of his premiere and following two other strongly psychological films, Persona and Hour of the Wolf, Ingmar Bergman is much more interested in the impact of war on ordinary civilized beings that evokes the worst in them. , and also in a cataretic way it is a reminder of what is really vital. His two key actors are collaborators and friends Max von Sydow and Liv Ullman (as strangely rožmberk) who are musicians living on an island farm (not too different from "Wolf" when one thinks about it). He sees the tanks roll, and a few old friends who wear out, but don't try to put them in the heart; There is a sweet scene where the couple just talk, rather honestly, but with a heart (all one shot as it repeats through the movie is maybe create a sense of being provoked) ... Then comes the problem, including the fake movie propaganda made by the gun Rosenbergs, a psychological confusion in being prisoners of war, and horror involved with a 'friend' in the military (one of the finest works of Gunnar Bjornstrand with Bergman). Needless to say, it is not one of the simpler films to pass in terms of Bergman's filmography, however for some it may be one of his more affordable works. His religious themes are held at a very low level this time, though the idea of ​​preserving the faith penetrates the atmosphere of the film. When it is a war action that is shot in unconventional, fast ways (over the great amigo Sven Nykvist). And the deconstruction of the relationship between John and Eve is succesfully matched to the backdrop of a chaotic kind of warfare - underground, where the lines never get too secure. Filmed right on top of the worst times in Vietnam, this film is even more important for today. I couldn't help seeing the chilling, uncompromising coincidences between Iraq and some of the scenes of John and Eve with the fighters, or those in the lead. By the way, the last scene is one of the best Bergmans, all around (acting, directing, lighting). It is not a kind of war image (or, again, anti-war, in this production of Svensk I do not know about John Wayne's spirit), which I would recommend right away from bats to my friends in Saving Private Ryan - it is a little more related to the Paths of Fame, looking at the effects hypocrisy of war. But in fact, just like any of Bergman's "genre" films, he stands alone, but the one he packs for the art-house crowd.
