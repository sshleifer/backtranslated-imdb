Great performance by Clint Eastwood and especially John Malkovich in his opinion his best. Malkovich had it nailed directly to the floor, it's incredible. Eastwood is agent Mike Horrigan, an aging and cynical secret service agent who completes his career and occupies counterfeiters and pursues routine tasks. But one task that seems to be at the beginning of a mill first becomes complicated and deadly serious. Horrigan and his new partner, Al, are being sent to investigate the threat to President Wacko. As a fate, Horrigan wouldn't find him on a vicious matrix, but on a professional lone wolf who has a big bone with the White House. When Horrigan sinks deeper into the "Booth" world, he draws unwanted attention and unwavering admiration for him. Horrigan was a JFK top agent and present in Dallas, Texas when he was murdered and accused of what happened. He now feels that it is up to him to stop the current head of state from joining the list of dead presidents. But this killer turned tables on Horrigan and now he is hunted in the life or death of a cat and mouse game. Who wins? Who dies? It's a race to save Pres from a chameleon-like enemy that can get to anyone. My favorite secret service movie and as good as nails.
