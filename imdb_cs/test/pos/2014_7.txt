"Rock Star" is not on its way to any "stairway to heaven" category as one of the best rock movies of all time, but it does "jump" from time to time because of its high energy level. The theme of the film is a fanatic of a hard rock band, which in fact becomes the lead singer of his favorite band. The story is based on a true story of what happened to the heavy metal band Judas Priest. If you think this movie is filled with a funny script and intellect, then you have another thing. What shook me all night was that Jennifer Aniston acted as a rock star girlfriend. I couldn't say the same thing about the rock star itself; Mark Wahlberg was much better than a porn star than a rock star. I enjoyed the 80's back movie input. It reminded me of my teen years when everything "smelled like a teenage ghost". I think the movie is worth seeing, but you have a better time to watch it to make sure you marry some girls, girls, girls. *** Average
