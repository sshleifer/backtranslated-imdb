I really enjoyed this movie. It is rare to find a star that would convincingly pull out the physical aspects of any sport / dance film with the theme of sport and also perform its first job. In this movie you will find two stars that have come to this occasion. Both women bring warm, moving and sometimes humorous performances. The film also touched on a range of topics, from racial issues to sexual identity. Yet this approach was not difficult. Production values ​​were also the highlight for the small film budget. I saw it at the Philadelphia Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and returned to it for the second time. It was a real crowd of pleasure. Everyone I talked to enjoyed this movie.
