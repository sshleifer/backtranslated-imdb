Be D.B. Sweeney fan, I've been on the lookout for this movie for some time. I recently rented a video and found it very enjoyable. She had some really funny scenes. Broken lives of some characters were worrying, but I think the movie also showed that it is possible to keep your life on track or get back on track if it was derailed.
