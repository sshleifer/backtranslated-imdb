I write this review right after hearing Stanley Kubrick's death. It's a big loss, and I'm writing about 2001: SPACE ODYSSEY, because I think it's the perfect Kubrick movie to remember most. It is an image like no other, not just a sci-fi revolution, but also the way films are conceptualized. It was probably the first American "art" film inspired by George Lucas and countless other writers and directors. so many people have so many different interpretations. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, his co-author, had a vision, but we never found out what was going on in their minds. Of course, the skinny of its "message" is how the technology of the future will take over mankind and decide on the course of our lives unless we are careful. The end of 2001 is a hope, a version of our rebirth through the flight of a star child back to earth. It is meaningless for many, but demanding film viewers. Although 2001 does not have the wicked, dark humor of DR. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or contain strong, eccentric figures that have filled his earlier works, such as PATHS OF GLORY or SPARTACUS, I still feel like he was. If anything, the HAL will be his most memorable figure, dangerous, murderous and artificial. It was half a decade in production when Hollywood was still humming from boring musicals and only waking up to the New Wave of French and Italian film. Kubrick was a maverick director who made great movies according to his own time, his time, and everyone else to be surprised. He'll miss him.
