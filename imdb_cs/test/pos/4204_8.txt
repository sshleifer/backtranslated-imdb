I didn't expect much from this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised to watch him and find it the most remarkable. It is especially remarkable for the talent and attractiveness of his star, John Garfield. He has to go on the run and end up playing with Gloria Dickson and Dead End Kids. Is there a chance of redemption here, but will the past catch up? Garfield was an actor in front of his peers. Before the term 'Method' was even coined and before Brando ever screamed 'Stella!' will bring to the "natural" screen. This production is dominated by its earthy quality and amazing acting talent. It is also interesting that his role as a boxer has the shades of the "golden game" he so desperately wanted on the screen. Garfield looks like a type and goes on like a boxer, proving his acting value. I never thought about Sheridan much, but I liked it here. He plays well at Garfield. Dickson's performance is a little tired and he doesn't share good chemistry with Garfield. Dead End Kids are here and Garfield seems like their natural idol (even more than Cagney). Claude Rains is wrong and looks uncomfortable in the role in many scenes. Strange because he has always been such a reliable actor. Also interesting is the director- Busby Berkeley, best known for his early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images, directing another genre with remarkable relief. It keeps the bold atmosphere in admirable spirit. Very good movie that deserves more attention 8/10.
