A few years ago, when I rented some movies, I hit subspecies 4, I ended up with it, and I really liked it, we need a good vampire gore who doesn't. But when I came back to the video store, they said they didn't have any other subspecific videos, unfortunately the same was for other video stores I checked out. I surrendered until someone on youtube actually posted all Subspecies movies and I had to watch them all night and I'm addicted. I am now a fan of the Full Moon Subspecies series. I think because it was the type of horror movie I was looking for, I was looking for a good kitschy fear for a long time and the subspecies filled this place. Radu is one of the most amazing vampires on the screen and almost gives Nosferatu a run for his fangs! The Council is an evil vampire who is on his bloodstone, his birth ceremony, the stone contains some blood that is absolutely incredible and gives it strength. Three American girls studying Romanian history and culture encounter a man, Stephan, who offers him help. They stay at Radu's castle, where Stephan is his brother's brother; The Council seduces and turns two girls, but Stephan falls on one of the girls, Michelle, and does whatever it takes to protect her. more sympathetic in some respects. Moreover, Radu was a perfect villain because Stephan was a perfect angel as a romantic vampire. The story is frosty and I think it was a funny vampire movie. This was also the first in the series, the best part is, sequels are just as fun. I would recommend it for a scary movie night, watch it in the dark, Radu will definitely send a shivering spine, or even a neck ... OK, cheesy joke, couldn't resist. <br /> <br/> 7/10
