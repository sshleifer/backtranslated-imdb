NOROI follows documentary filmmaker Masafumi Kobayashi, who slowly reveals something mysterious and evil that leaves a trail of dead bodies in his wake. After talking to a woman who claims to hear loud baby cries coming from a neighboring house (where she is not a child), Kobayashi heads to the neighbor. He was greeted by an enraged, disheveled woman (Maria Takagi), who responds to the door (and immediately hits his face) and looks at her six-year-old son through the window. Surprisingly, both the woman and her son disappear a few days after his visit (leaving behind a pile of dead pigeons on the back porch), and a woman who first complained about the sounds as well as her daughter are both killed in a mysterious accident long after tom. This is what Kobayashi cares about and he sets off on a journey to find out what's going on. They soon discover that people with psychic abilities and extra-sensory perception seem to be tuned into something sinister, inexplicable, and perhaps even apocalyptic. A well-known ten-year-old clairvoyant and television celebrity, Kana (Rio Kanno) thinks we could all be doomed, but mysteriously disappear before he can help a lot. Another female psyche / actress (Marika Matsumoto), as well as Mr. Nori, a mentally unstable kook / psychic who wears an aluminum foil hat and jacket and thinks people are eaten by what they call "ectoplasmic worms". Traces eventually lead back to a small village that is now covered by a lake, and the legend of an ancient demon known as Kagutaba ... <br /> <br /> Unlike many other hand-held horror games, this depends on the plot as the first person's reactionaries do it. Fortunately, there is something that is here, very interesting and complicated about it, so it does not rely on flashes of scary things through spastic camera-work once in a while to keep your interest. The way Masafumi travels the follow-ups in finding the truth - with well-placed shocks on the road - reminded me of OMEN a little at his pace. The film is not just in the footsteps of a documentary filmmaker, but in news and television varieties it shows as if what we are watching is already a finished documentary. This helps break some of the monotony usually associated with movies shot in this particular style. The performances are good enough not to hurt any realism of the "real" record. Overall, it's a well-made horror movie, with lots of plot shifts, some tension and quite a few scary moments, it's well worth checking out. My only real gripe is that he could use a little trimming here and it seems to go a little further. Otherwise, pretty good stuff.
