This super haunted Southern Gothic melodrama plays Clint Eastwood as a wounded Confederate officer in the Civil War who is taken to a country girl school and nursed back to health. This implies a strange sex conflict with a supposedly "dangerous" man who becomes the prey of a batch of seemingly harmless women who appear to be as brutal on battle fronts as men who fight against each other. It is a classic spider and a fly story, but here is a lone fly and a whole group of spiders. Geraldine Page plays the main lover of the school and gives a characteristic sensational performance. The site has been trained as a stage actress and shows in all her performances. Regardless of the role it played, it always committed itself to 100% and never left the character. Here it is, with this deadly spinster who takes sexual repression on this helpless person. Each of the other girls reacts to him in his own way. The two most prominent are the slutty girl who can't wait to throw at him, and the virgin (played by someone other than the behaved Elizabeth Hartman?), Who acts as if he fell into a dead weak, if someone like the word " penis". The schematic story of the Madonna and the Whore would seem cumbersome if the film did not hold you by the way, and so be absolutely sure what happens next. The most memorable scene in the movie came to me when a group of women performed an amputation of Eastwood's leg that was infected with gangrene. Again, the spider / fly cue is clear: they're unleashing him so that it's much harder for him to escape from his site. <br /> <br /> Classic cooler. It's not a great movie, but it's morbidly fun. <br /> <br /> Level: A-
