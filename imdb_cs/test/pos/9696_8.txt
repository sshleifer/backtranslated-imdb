I've always been a Jackass fan, like Viva La Bam and Wildboyz. And when you're a fan of something, your expectations are high so your "heroes" can play. And if there is something I learned about the expectations of people you just love to watch and listen to, it's never expected to be a lot because in 99 out of 100 times you'll be disappointed. Although I heard Jackass 2 appeared, I thought, "I can't even reject my expectations for this movie," and that's why I sat down today, ready to laugh, but also ready to say eventually " Well, that was all right, but I'm a little disappointed ". How wrong I was! Every single Jackassu crew member will bring this film to the top and show you one crazy ass after another, so the whole world will see that they don't want to do anything to hurt - and that's what we love! I cried my eyes, laughing from the first minute to the last second of the movie, sometimes shouting with laughter, I couldn't control myself! Stunt after a sensation, a joke after a joke and funny comments to flow - it just can't be better! Amazing from start to finish, guaranteed to laugh your ass off. There are two more things left for me; WATCH IT and PLEASE God, let's have Jackass 3 - these guys have something to offer!
