I only saw about half a dozen films with Lino Ventura, but this seems very similar to others. He plays a laconic criminal - one who is short on words and suppressed, but occasionally explosive. Given his quiet personality in such films as ARMY OF SHADOWS and SECOND BREATH, I noticed that his minimalist acting style is very effective. In other words, because he is so quiet and raised when he does the bad things you notice. And like these other films, it also has a very strong, though twisted, moral code. Abel Davos (Ventura) and his partner Lilane live in Italy and are criminals in their careers. They both grew up in France and eventually had to flea because of their crimes. Now in Italy, as the film begins, they continue to live the lives of criminals, and the heat catches them. Surprisingly, instead of fleeing to a third country, they decide to return to France - even though Davos was sentenced and sentenced in absentia - and if they caught him, it could mean prison life or death penalty. Much of the first third of the film relates to their hidden return. Unfortunately for Davos the return is not perfect and now it seems as if every policeman in France is looking for him. Moreover, the reaction of his old compatriots in crimes is not at all what he would expect. In fact, their lukewarm reaction to his return ends with the unleashing of a series of terrible events towards the end of the film. On the way, Davos meets and is impressed in my stranger Erik Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo). Despite Davos apparently has no friends, Stark and his girlfriend try to make his return successful. But what's throwing another monkey's key, Davos is two very young sons - what's Davos doing with them - keep them in hiding? Overall, this is a very good criminal film - something like French Film Noir. Unlike the American, Noir has many French versions that I have seen, a more realistic and bleak look at them. Fatalism rules supremely, that's for sure! Acting is first-rate (especially from Ventura and Belmonda), direction very confident and writing very nice, although I'm sure many of them won't like the end. It seems like it's just like it was. I understood why they did this in this way, but they also see how it could leave many dissatisfied. As for me, I left the apartment. Otherwise an exceptional film.
