Being of the Cephallonian descent, I was happily surprised to watch the movie. I have heard the true history of my relatives still living in Cephalonia, but while watching the film and reading the book, fragile pieces of history have been filled. It is true, the Italians would sing, oppress and earthquake that so often drag the island. The 1953 earthquake killed my great-grandfather and the book and film portray a sense of era with great compassion. If you haven't seen the movie go and watch it and read the book, it's not just a love story, and yes, there were plenty of Italians in love with Cephallonian women, in fact, the ship's load of cephallonian women have been taken to Italy after the war's real depiction history.
