Bergman's regular Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann played as a country couple, Jan and Eva Rosenberg. The story began with an ordinary couple fighting and making up. John was a sensitive person, but an escape that was isolated from the world. Eva is a practical woman who has enough husband's lack of ambition. Because John procrastinating in setting their radio, they are oblivious to the impending war. Of course, the war came, and the film was a fascinating study of their mutual transformation and interaction of invasions because they were badly treated by the enemy and by their own government. <br /> <br /> Music score to the movie, but the soundtrack was a war noise. In one scene, the throbbing weapon in the background, the explosion and the sound of flight was incredible. Bergman approached the facial expression as another event took place. When something violent happened, he approached and let the audience perceive violence instead of seeing it closely. Very well made film.
