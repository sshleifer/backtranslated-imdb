As I watched "Wirey Spindell" I couldn't but laugh at what was happening on the screen. Wirey certainly got a lot of play from both boys and women, but I was confused about why the actor who played Wirey in the H.S. was 10 years old. Then the actor changed his age to 20 to play Wirey when he was a senior at HS ... but whatever, I thought it was funny.
