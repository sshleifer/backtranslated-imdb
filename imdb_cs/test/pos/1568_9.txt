This is an amazing movie! The characters seemed so realistic that it was hard to believe they weren't real people. Since I'm from the South, I thought Judith Ivey's character seemed particularly real, and as everyone else mentioned, she does an excellent acting job. The characters are not beautiful and look like the average Hollywood stars - their imperfect bodies and personalities seem much more natural and real. One reviewer mentioned that the main character, Alice, has no good reason to run away from home, which is true - she had no moral or unwavering reason to escape, such as the child's escape, etc. I thought that she was just enough of dead jobs in working class life and wanted to flee down to Florida where her boyfriend lived an appealing and privileged life college student in Miami. The actress shows that Alice is confused, insecure, and questions the transformation into decisiveness and willingness to take control of her life with impressive nature. The film also shows how Alice is trapped in seemingly no possibilities, causing her to panic, act, and reach out to help. <br /> <br /> At first I was discouraged by the grainy film style, and I thought it was a very low budget or home movie, but in fact it is very good. The quality of home cinema really makes you feel like you're with characters, part of their RV journey across the country. This is certainly a movie worth seeing, even though I don't understand all of its descriptions as a warm story warming. Sometimes it is rather vulgar and disturbing, although it is not completely sad.
