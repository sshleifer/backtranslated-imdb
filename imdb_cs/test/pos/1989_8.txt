eXistenZ is an exploration of reality and virtual reality where characters run from empire to empire, landscape to landscape trying to beat a game they don't know the target or exactly where it leads. As part of this virtual reality game, there are multiple layers of virtual reality games that question the reality of what they come from is "real". Of course there is no fact that it will not be. adequately respond to real reality, instead of throwing the idea of ​​whether it's real or video games to challenge even the end. I'm not even sure Cronenberg pretends not to be there, it's so unbelievably clear that it's a little worrying. However, the problem with this film is its basic nature, in a sense. Cronenberg questions reality and criticizes the game. The same things he uses to criticize the game, however, bring him: violence, discontinuity, lack of concentration and, in a sense, pixels, even if there are no pixels in the film. I once heard someone say that Cronenberg's violence is actually a critique of hyperviolence in the media, but he's hiding this well with the fact that such incredible pleasure comes from bursting new holes on humans, animals, and amorphous piles of biological sludge. What is brilliantly written and done in this film is the use of video recordings (it is not possible to say exactly what you want to say during scenes, relative lack of surroundings or surroundings that don't make sense), just a few people around where they feel that there should be a lot and vice versa, all of it together with the motive of penetration. It certainly deconstructs the reality of the video game in a way that is naive and absurd, but it is even better by replacing the video game electronics with literal "pods" of biological material that twists and moves and is frankly disgusting to one of the most frightening grades. For what's worth, this movie causes a reaction in you. But what? It criticizes virtual reality, but it's a movie: it's its own virtual reality. He seems to criticize the banality of graphic game lines and character design, yet he keeps this banality. It seems to be worried whether killing a video game character is okay than killing a real human being and how video games can be confused with reality and get people not to think about the consequences of their actions in real life, and yet again, it has the biggest the pleasure of tearing people, objects, beasts, things and organisms into bloody pieces. While it has a key focus of anxiety, it doesn't really do anything about it, but rather not. Only what he does is the presence of that anxiety in such an original way that his own moments of splendor cannot really be denied. In a sense, it would be much easier to hate this movie. for being cruel and violent, because there is no good reason why I can see him, I love him, and yet I cannot ignore him as average or bad. It would be easier if you couldn't, but because I can, I can't do anything about it. I think this is a bit exaggerated, it really didn't have to go as far as it was possible, but Cronenberg's intentions are so mixed and confused. I don't know if it was Cronenberg's fault or Cronenberg's point and I'm not doing it. I think it's really some way to figure it out, except you ask him directly. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
