This movie was a sicky sweet cutesy romantic comedy, just the kind of movie I usually don't like, but this one was cute enough to be of interest to me. At one point it was really funny (probably because I liked it) and then just as seriously. Plus, she had Ellen in her, and I always had a soft place for her. The owner of the bookstore Helen (Kate Capshaw) basically finds a love letter in one of the old couches in her store. She thinks it's for her and she goes crazy trying to figure out who sent it. He is locked apart so he really puts it on the loop. In the end, almost everyone associated with it will find this letter and all get mixed signals that create really funny moments. As I said, I'm usually not one for this type of movie. and we look forward to it.
