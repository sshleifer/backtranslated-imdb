I personally love this movie in the middle of the Halloween series. After seeing many friends, I found out that you like it completely, or it's totally unbearable. I have personally watched him dozens of times and never gets old. There is a great back story in the movie itself, and many different things are finally explained. It's a somewhat short film that is just shy for 90 minutes, but it's definitely an exciting ride. The shape seems to be quite brutal in this film, but acting is still where there is walking, stalking and killing. There are plenty of neat small screen shots with Micheal that appear in the background, adding another haunted element to the movie.
