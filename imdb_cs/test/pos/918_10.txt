Valentine "Dogkiller" Dussaut and Joe "Judge" Kern joins forces to clear the middle of Geneva! Excited when they put kibosh on international heroin smugglers, Polish refugees, peeping toms, fake girlfriends, apostates and apostates who are too lazy to bear their recyclable garbage. Don't be fooled by the misleading advertising campaign Miramax, which portrays it as a sophisticated, art house. This movie is 100% action!
