Until I searched for "What Alice Found", I didn't realize that the title of the movie was anchored in the title of one of Lewis Carroll's books. The full title of the book is "Through the Glass (And What Alice Found There)". Alice's film comes from a background that's completely different from Alice Alice Carroll's background. However, its fresh and assertive character is similar. Alice begins as a young New Hampshire woman who steals money from her ass-patting boss and starts in Miami, vaguely planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins. She meets a middle-aged couple in a motor home (her husband left the army) who rescued her from a strange man at a roadside breakdown and a car crash (possibly caused by their mechanization). As it turned out, the couple are strongly involved in stopping prostitution and seeing sweet, young Alice as a promising recruitment. Wife (playing Judith Ivey in a performance worthy of a great award) buys sexy Alice outfits and shows her how to apply hot makeup. Initially, Alice passively accepts her services and, according to the couple's instructions, does several tricks. The meeting shown in the most detailed detail is quite different from most film sex, but it can be typical of what is most often happening in real life. The man is shy and rude and apologizes for being "too fast" over. What is amazing about Alice (and differs from her prototypes from Clarissa to Sister Carrie) is that she learns from her experience and claims. That's the way things are. Prostitution is everywhere. People are neither good nor bad. Alice leaves the motor home with earned money and a sense of mutual respect.
