To experience your head, you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they shot it. It was because their series was coming to an end and the group was coming to an end. Their inventive and comedy series (some American idol of their day) took four unknown actors and created a supergroup around them. <br /> <br /> This is their takeover of the "produced image" and the other's status. Tier Beatles. They always felt they were in a box, trapped and unable to find credibility despite their talents. It's also a music-trippy hell, resourceful (I have a soundtrack) and full of surprises. <br /> <br /> Look with an open mind.
