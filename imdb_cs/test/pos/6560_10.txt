I'm a horror freak and this must be one of the most remarkable horror movies I've ever seen. The storyline is absolutely original (who else would have invented a city that is totally obsessed with a certain symbol to the point of death and madness?), Special effects are amazing and cinematography couldn't be better. Some may find this disturbing, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. This is also a good point. The spiral symbol is a bit ubiquitous. Spiral notebook, spiral seashells, spirals for cakes. Of all the shapes they could use (square, triangle, trapezoid, rectangle), this was one of the best options. If you can find this movie, be sure to see it. It is certainly unique and unforgettable.
