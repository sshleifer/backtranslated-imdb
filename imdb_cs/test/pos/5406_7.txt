Another slice of darkness and denial hides beneath the surface of the American suburb, Imaginary Heroes records the lives of the Travis family, all recovering after the suicide of their eldest son. The couple in the middle of the movie is Mother and Son Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) and Tim (Emile Hirsch), both acting in different ways as a result of death. While Tim is experimenting with prescription drugs and his own sexuality, Sandy returns to his former self, smokes marijuana, and copes with the old act of infidelity. The relationship between Sandy and Tim is well explored, especially when the references to both of them are brought out of their own family: Sandy for her affair and Tim, initially because he is always in the shadow of his more successful older brother . For Sandy's husband Ben (Jeff Daniels), who accuses Sandy of devastating denial of grief, he gives Sandy less time to make another plate of food for his dead son and place it in his old dining table. Older sister Michelle Williams's Penny is subscribed and could easily be removed from the movie. Despite its long runtime, Imaginary Heroes do not explore its many subplots as well as individual stories deserve, while some black comedy movie does not translate as much as writer / director Dan Harris may have liked. And the depiction of disturbed family dynamics is not as strongly captured as many other films with similar ideas. But despite some problems, the central performances of Weaver and Hirsch are overwhelming, and easily convey the film to its successfully subdued conclusion. <br /> <br /> Rating: B-
