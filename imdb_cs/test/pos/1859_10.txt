I have read the reviews of this film, which he found to be "disappointing" and "confused." I'm embarrassed to understand why it should be. From the beginning I found it a remarkable experience and a complete joy to watch. Spoiler: The opening titles overlap the beautiful visual evolution of the evolutionary process, and this story is presented in a calm and extensive style. The film is not about the process itself, but concerns the struggle of Charles Darwin with his conscience, his love for his wife, his late daughter, and his quest for truth. His daughter's performance is a manifestation of a tortured mind that knows she "killed God." Daughter is an adult to take adult notes about his work and torture Darwin with personal doubts. Was he somehow responsible for her death? Real Life Husband and Wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly give a truly wonderful performance like Charles and Emma Darwin, as well as Martha West as Annie. Bettany's size and unpleasant walking give Darwin a real sense of reality, while Connelly seems to be very comfortable with his English accent and sometimes somewhat serious personality. It is easy not to understand the times in which this movie resides. The grasp that religion has in society and the internal struggles that man like Darwin has had to persevere to seek the truth in what he has witnessed. Science and religion have always been awkward bedfellows, and although it didn't cost his life, as he did with so many older men and women, science has hindered the man and the wife, the fact and the faith. This film captures this barrier superiorly. I give Creation ten stars because I think it is a beautiful, deep, well-functioning and true, unreserved look at one of the world's true geniuses. What seems obvious to everyone today (well, almost everyone ... see the amazing "Religulous") that has been hidden for millennia. The truth, once discovered, was undoubtedly painful for many. Creation examines the pain and realizes that we are all we have. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie experience.
