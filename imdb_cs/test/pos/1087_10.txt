Satya was excellent ... The company was just as good, but more polished, probably because of the money gained from previous films. But Ab Tak Chappan is even more fun. The dialogue is courageous, rude and sometimes cheerful. Again, Nana Pataker shines in a role that only authority can fulfill, but the acting actor is very talented. The direction is tight and the story develops at a satisfactory pace with a very dramatic climax. As a view of reality, it can be over-dramatized, but at the end of the day it's a movie, so balance is in place. I ordered a DVD and I can't wait to see it again at home. As a lover of these types of gangster movies, it is very pleasing and is highly recommended for a refreshing "non-Yash Raj" Bollywood gangster flirt lovers out there.
