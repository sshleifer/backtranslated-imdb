In the 1980s, Savage Steve Holland released three films, two of which are the classics of what seems to be a very small genre, an absurd teenage comedy. The third "How I got into college" doesn't measure up to "Better Off Dead" and this, mainly because it's a shortage of John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong (Except for a little portrait). One crazy summer is an underrated movie, with a lot of great characters and gags. As I recall, Savage Steve films were ashamed of dead brain at that time and threw themselves into children's television after three films. We could use more movies from similar ones.
