I first saw this movie when I was about 12 years old. It was one of my favorites because ... It's so perfect in all its fame with an amazing soundtrack, cheesy dialogue, and it was both hilarious and terribly sad. The first movie I just had at the end ... I'm not gonna ruin it, but a kid is a blockbuster ... I just remember Gary's sad! What's this great character in this movie, he's a genius !!! They are all so great that even the undisturbed girl Gary doesn't like ... (she had a nice little body). I can't believe all the girls go to Rick, it's such a sleaze ball with a handkerchief tied around my neck! ha ha ha ... While watching this movie be prepared for lots of sex jokes complete with sexually transmitted diseases (almost). But a love story in the heart with real problems dealing with the uncertainty of life changing decisions that make you think and feel the real sorrow for the cast. I love this movie !!! If you like Valley Girl more all the classic you will too!
