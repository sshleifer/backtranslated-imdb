It was the first film I ever saw in my life in 1974 or 1975. At that time I was four years old and I saw it in a theater performance. I couldn't understand it was a classic at the time (I went to bed for about twenty minutes in the movie). After I saw him on TV - along with two of my other favorite movies, Car Wash and The Wiz, which seemed to come about the same time each year, together - about 40, 50, 75 times He knew there was a movie that I would have as one of my favorites. These three movies were the only live action I could see as a child. I wouldn't consider it a blaxploitation movie, but rather an urban interest. Cochise and Preach reminded me of some of my uncles, especially the wild Irish rose they drank. My mother also told me about some of the quarters she visited, and that some of the things that appeared in the movie were basically similar to what happened in real life. If you're one of two or three black people over thirty who haven't seen this movie yet, then I suggest you buy a DVD right now. I'm glad I witnessed some of those events in the era.
