This show is my absolute favorite. This show is smart, fun and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines as beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena, who is the only one of her kind as Rory's best friend, Lane Kim. I love a funny dialogue, it's what makes it unique about the show. Kelly Bishop is great because Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman are amazing as Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is delighted when Luke Danes and the band members watch. The community, Miss Patty, Babette, Mrs. Kim, Taylor Doose, Kirk and others are always laughing loudly fun, unpredictable and interesting that the elegant shot always stands out. This exhibition has changed so much over the years that it never gets old. Gilmore Girls is an original and smart show that watches you. So it is well. I give this show 10/10 rating.
