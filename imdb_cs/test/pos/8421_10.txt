It is a film about a six-year-old child from a village in Maharashtra (a state in India) and his grandfather who came to Pune (a city in Maharashtra) to treat the baby's eyes. Grandpa learns that a child has cancer in both eyes and that they must be removed to save the baby's life. the film is about the main characters and their feelings and actions until the operation. The film is not a typical Indian film clich√©, so I expect to see songs or romance or melodrama. this ia and an excessively crafted sensitive film that resorts to silent expressions rather than through upper dialogues to get a point through. to testify to a scene where grandfather is told about the need to remove the child's eyes. acting is excellent, dialogue breaks. Your heart goes out for a grandfather who has the unenviable task of telling the baby and his mother about surgery. <br /> <br /> Control of the subject was excellent. director Sandeep Sawant made a film that had to knock down many doors to collect Rs. six million (about $ 130000). even then, the finished product appears polished and has decent production values. he is also witnessing the subtle contrast of urban villages, which the director has drawn up with random footage of the boy's life in the village. Sawant definitely prefers village life. <br /> <br /> Everything you do is excellent. As a social worker, Amruta Subhash is competent to add the necessary human touch to his role. Sandeep Kulkarni as a docter is great, showing a perfect doctor's mannerism. Ashwin Chitale as a child is natural. he doesn't seem to act. everything about him is natural and does not seem to be forced. But above all Arun Nalawade as grandfather is above his head. she is overwhelming in her role. mere words cannot describe his work. it is a performance to be honored forever. Shwaas is a sincere effort to make a good movie theater. it should not be ignored just because it shows that if things are kept simple, the results can be really surprising. 10/10.
