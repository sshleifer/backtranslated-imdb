As in the past ten years or even longer, the whole world is flooded with so-called Sitcoms (very few deserve this title because they are so predictable), the King of Queens is a very original, unique and incredibly funny alternative. It's about the daily life of a delivery man and his wife who works as a lawyer assistant in Manhattan, Queens, New York. With them lives Carrie's father Arthur, a film extrovert that plays fantastic Jerry Stiller and who steals the show from everyone else every time he appears. Other important people are their best friends Deacon and Kelly, a married couple and their other friend Spence, who is almost 30 years old and still lives with his mother. Above all, what makes this show so unique and funny is that every single character seems so real and Carrie's cynical, sarcastic attitude is the total opposite of Doug's good-natured, slightly stupid optimism. And Arthur is the one who makes it totally unpredictable with his strange thoughts and habits. He often gets into trouble and Doug and Carrie have to pull him out of the mud. Although in my opinion the quality of the show has decreased somewhat in recent years, it is still one of the best daily sitcoms ever made. It takes little time to get into characters and relate to them, but after it's done, you'll get some unstoppable laughter from it. While I think I couldn't survive one day with Arthur in a closed room without defeating his guts, I really loved him in this show. Watch and have fun, I give it 9 out of 10.
