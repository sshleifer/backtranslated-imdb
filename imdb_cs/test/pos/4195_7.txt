You really should remember Monkees and have a clear idea of ​​where and how they fit into the second half of the 1960s to fully realize this film. There is no land as such. Basically it's crazy, mixed pastiche of various unrelated sequences. But it's interesting and fun in your own special way once you get to the wavelength. In short, it was a classic, cleverly conceived and well-developed example of an experimental cinema from the late 1960s. It contains some good songs, some ultra-groove cinematography and many other useful ideas in terms of film technology. I give her 7 out of 10 for several reasons. First, it took a lot of courage to make such an unorthodox movie in the commercial mainstream where both its stars and its producers were firmly withdrawn at the time. If a movie appears at the box office, the feature may be of interest to all. Second, it was largely creative success. Finally, as already mentioned, it is undoubtedly a classic genre and as such is historically important. Unfortunately, "Head" was too late in Monkees' career. But again, they wouldn't have been allowed to do it earlier because it was basically a very sharp and cynical satire of their own image. It is clear that the members of the group knew all too well that the entire Monkees juggernaut was just running their race when they started working on this project. In a way, it was their swan song and they were determined to let it all hang out. They were tired of being treated as mere pawns in a high-performance corporate game in which they had been manipulated and abused in previous years. In short, they "wanted out" and said a few things before they left. However, history has confirmed this group. Leave the critics damned. The monkey has left some of the best, most polished and successful pop records of the decade. Yes, they had a lot of help. But at the end of the day they stood in front of the studio microphones, and film and TV cameras appeared in front of them, and they performed. They were fun and just a little crazy. Unlike some of their contemporaries, however, they never threatened. You could safely introduce a monkey to your older aunt. "Head" is likely to borrow a bit too heavily from the Beatles "Hard Day's Night," but it's still worth looking for those who were at that time. or for younger retrofiles who have the ability to appreciate their importance. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
