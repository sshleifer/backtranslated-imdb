This movie is one that spends a short while of fun, but who could then be made in any country has nothing to identify "Colombian". Who is looking for topics of a supposed Colombian or socially and politically correct cinema and what is called "threatening" is better than seeing this movie. Some to drug traffic, or combat is no reference either by farmer and worker, or wing guerrillas and kidnapping policies. Corrupt police is a person who might be Mexican, Russian, Italian or Chinese, and also a celebrity hero, an Argentine photographer, that might be Venezuelan, Peruvian or Filipino and frequent "boludo" in his parliaments that could be replaced by another word slang some other countries without personality or history are changing. What is important is that it is a very well-counted history with pictures and correct performances. Its quality is almost from a TV movie, but from the good ones. The fact that if one such film, if it deserves it or does not deserve support with public days, is a bit of a classic "mamerta" debate.
