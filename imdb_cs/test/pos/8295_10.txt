I loved this movie, it was a great display of a family that had its share of ups and downs, but in the end they knew the special love they had for themselves. I've seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god was one of her best, though it was 12 years ago. This movie contained a stellar cast and what I loved the most was opening my eyes to see more actors I haven't seen before. This movie was so long, but I enjoyed it every minute. It's a movie that you can sit with your family and watch, even if we have to cover up our children's eyes several times due to discretionary scenes. Overall, I rate this film 10 from 1-10. Lifetime is not enough air, so if anyone knows what the store is selling, let me know because it's a necessity.
