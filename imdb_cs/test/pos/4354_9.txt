Though perhaps not as amusing as some of Herzog's work, Little Dieter is another fine film by one of the world's greatest film artists. Based on Herzog's usual themes, Little Dieter is a fascinating and uplifting character study of a courageous person and his efforts to continue life after a life-changing, traumatic experience. Dieter Dengler wanted to fly from a very young age, and the Vietnam War gave him the opportunity, but instead of spending a cockpit war, he spent most of it as a prisoner of war. Dieter tells most of his story eloquently and passionately, with occasional help from Herzog. Herzog has a very small voice at this time, but he contributes a lot of subtly powerful sounds and visuals - which should not be a surprise to those who are familiar with him. Dengler is a fascinating and extremely likeable man. As a man and alive as they come, I found the story of his life and his irrevocably positive personality to be inspiring. Thanks to Herzog for introducing him to us. The scope of the film is not so vast and the drama is not as violent as many of the early films that made Herzog the force to be reckoned with. It is a very interesting and well done film.
