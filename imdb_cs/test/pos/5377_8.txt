I'd say it was on the same level as movies like "Devil's Rain" and this movie, though it's a little better. I like 70 horror movies and this has most of the elements that make up other movies that I like so it was pretty easy. On their holiday, the family ran across a small town where people seemed to be grabbed by some hysteria. Looks like the kids disappeared. After an initial attempt to escape from this place, the family somehow stops on the outskirts of the city and finds a way back, but not without first finding a house where the kids are gone and mum and dad are dead. It seems that we have a different kind of twist in the community center of seniors in this city, they are all Satanic believers and need children to renew their lives so they can continue their service. Not that someone seemed too enthusiastic to give up their children for this business. This is quite nice considering that it is scary and scary without buckets of gore or loud surprising events that try to make people jump into movies today that seem to have replaced real fears. We have Hank Kimball (Alvy Moore) from "Green Acres" as Tobey, deputy sheriff who reads UFO magazines, and LQ Jones as sheriff, and a well-known actor as the father of an imprisoned family. And Strother Martin plays a doctor who seems to be doing a double duty unrecognized by his neighbor. This is a pretty good thing, but tad on the confusing side ever, but overall works pretty well & is recommended for 70 horror fans. 8 out of 10.
