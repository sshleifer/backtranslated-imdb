BIG FAT LIAR is, in my opinion, a totally cheerful movie with morality. When Jason (Frankie Muniz - "Malcolm In Middle") and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes - "ALL THAT") played these Marty tricks (Paul Giamatti - DOCTOR DOLITTLE), I really smiled and felt good. I liked this movie the most. In fact, everything that happened after Jason's essay was accidentally ended in Marty's hand was cheerful. I especially loved the portrait of Jaleel White. When I first saw him, I couldn't be sure, but when I asked my mother if it was him, she said, "Of course!" Before I wrapped it up, I'd like to say, "As I said earlier, this story is moral and this morality is always true." Finally, if you're a fan of Frankie Muniz, Amanda Bynes or Paul Giamatti, I recommend this totally cheerful movie with morality.
