It's a Man, it was all I wanted it to be, and maybe a little more. I love teen type "chick flick" movies and I knew this would be great! In the same vein as the 10 things I hate about you (one of all of my times) She's The Man is a unique, well written, very well played comedy with some of the funniest lines and physical comedy I've seen for a long time. . It's probably the funniest movie I've seen this year (with the exception of the hilarious Pink Panther.) But she's The Man's actually more intellectual fun, and most of the humor is based on the witty "Three Company" scenario. misconceptions and mixed news and cast. Amanda Bynes is a star! Even since the haunted camp (yet marvelously entertaining "The Amanda Show", she has shown a brilliant talent for comedy. She is probably one of the most talented comedies out there. Her physical comedy style, impersonation and humorous dialect makes it formerly her big screen debut ( where she was a star) she was rather cheerful and well made "What A Girl Wants." It's really the ultimate girl next door, it's a shame she doesn't do more work on the big screen because she could be another "It" girl, she's All American , cute, down on the ground, lively teen (even if she's 20 years old). and whether she'll be able to bear her talent and style to be an adult actor, she will be seen, but she is perfect for the purpose of this movie! he impersonates his brother and makes it believable. Not entirely ... but believable. Most of the scenarios rely on the comedy of her mistakes, which she tries to be a guy, but it's just fun, she keeps laughing. Channing Tatum redeems from his deplorable performance in 2005's "Havoc" plays Duke. It's an athlete, a football team captain, and finally Bynes's object of affection, unfortunately, is Sebastian's friend of the room (who is Bynes.) He's a good man and chemistry is perfect among them. Laura Ramsey is Olivia, who is attracted to Sebastian (who is again Bynes.) She is doing well, although her part is small and actually has no effect on the rest of the cast. James Kirk is great in his small role as a real Sebastian. His resemblance to Amanda Bynes is overwhelming ... they are absolutely believable as twins and others, from a distance you could understand someone who believes that Bynes is Sebastian. The rest of the cast fit somewhere and their roles range from short to more supportive, but basically all support the story between Bynes and Tatum, but they all are more or less supporting the amazing performance of Bynes. The film easily transfers the film without hesitation and is worth it. This is one of those movies that show up so much in the trailers, and yet it's not one of those films that come in that part. no more funny. The parts in the trailer that make you laugh are even more fun in the real movie. Relative novice director Andy Fickman does such an incredible job on this film. It combines a potentially complicated story and makes it a natural way and does everything together. A story freely based outside Shakespeare's twelfth night, but it is remarkable how much they have translated into this modern day film. It is seemingly completely out of the wall, but more accurately than a classic comedy. There is not much to say about the disadvantage, except that the last half-hour is a little stretched and can also become predictable, but it won't change the merry-go-round of the first half of the movie. However, you will laugh at tears and it's one of the most entertaining movies in the theater right now! 9/10
