Cultural director Lucio Fulci is probably best known for his cruel Zombie movie of the eighties, which earned him his legitimate reputation as "Godfather Gore". But Fulci's absolutely greatest film comes from 1972, and although it is definitely bold and violent, it's not nearly as bloody as many of his other films. "Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino" aka. "Don't Torture A Duckling" from 1972 is not just the biggest Fulci movie, this irritating and brilliant Giallo is one of the absolute highlights of this genre. The stunning atmosphere and tense tension, the great environment of Sizilian, an interesting story about brilliant performances or intense moments of total shock - I don't know what I want most about this genius Giallo praise! "Don't Torture A Duckling" truly brings film excellence in all aspects, making it an absolute masterpiece of Italian horror film. Unlike other Gialli, it is not a seductive queen of beauty that is killed. one but little boys who fall victim to a freelance killer. The bodies of little boys are in the countryside of Sicily. While the police are desperately looking for a murderer, the town is basically full of strange people, and the city's inhabitants are screaming at the culprit ... she won't find equality yet. The performances are among the best in Italian horror. Tomas Milian (one of my most popular actors) is headed by journalist Andrea Martinelli, who is investigating the crimes. Sexy Barbara Bouchet delivers both eye candy and great performance. The same excellent performances come from Irene Papas and Florinda Bolkan, who is absolutely brilliant in her role. The excellent score of Riz Ortolani brilliantly intensifies the tension and atmosphere and the film is brilliantly shot in the fascinating Sicilian countryside. Although not as bloody as many other Fulci movies, this film is definitely bold and uncompromising in its violence, with some shocking brutal scenes. <br /> <br /> "Don't Torture The Duckling" Has All The Brilliant Horror Requires. It's not as easy as most of Fulci's, but I make sure the search pays off. Every horror fan has to see this personal favorite of mine and I highly recommend all movie lovers to not miss it. Masterpiece!
