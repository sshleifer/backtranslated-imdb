I'm not ending that now and I will have to identify this film (which I consider a masterpiece, and I don't use that word lightly) with "No Michael Douglas!" Not only are the titles the same, but they refer to the same thing - the fallout that fled the surviving first nuclear bombings. It's not a cheap metaphor in Imamura; the whole film is about the impact, both physical and emotional, of Hiroshima and the war itself. The worsening of couples and their grown nieces becomes somewhat brighter, ironic ideas become stronger, from old hours that are reset every night to stone gods who gradually accumulate outside the heroine's door. (These, in turn, are carved by a shell veteran who is forced, in a series of tragicomic episodes, to attack anything with an engine that approaches the city.) The bombing day itself is shown in partial flashbacks that are cold scary. "Black Rain" ("NtMDm!") However, it can be watched, even repeatedly, because of Imamura's compassion with his characters. Repeat: masterpiece.
