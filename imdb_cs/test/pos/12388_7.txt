I just watched this film at the Santo Domingo International Film Festival. When I watched the movie, I thought I saw a movie with a similar story ... a movie with Ray Liotta, but I don't remember it much. Of course, this is much more dramatic, especially at the end. This is the story: Emilia's life becomes a lie that she can no longer sustain. After 20 years of lying about his life to his wife, son and all the people he knows, it is true that he is chasing him and not where to go. after a while you get tired of the same thing ... a young girl's affair was supposed to complain, but not. Despite the fact that the film is still funny, it leaves and includes. Either he wants you to help Emilio with his lies or help others catch him. I liked analogy, photography and good performance. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10.
