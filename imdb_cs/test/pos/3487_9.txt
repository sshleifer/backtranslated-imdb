A very exciting giallo by director "L'Anticristo" (1974), this begins with a brilliantly processed sequence involving a priest, a little girl and a broken doll. The main story, however, is about the maniac (David Warbeck) taking a traumatized cripple to kill her for her money. The score of Francesco de Massi is quite effective, some of which can also be heard in Lucio Fulci's "The New York Ripper" (1982). Very recommended for fans of Italian cinema!
