When I looked at this film again, I think it is one of Hitchcock's greatest films. When I first saw it, I was blown away from tension, action and images. It has a gripping end, a murderous killer, an innocent man framed or sacrificed by circumstances, some great shots on the spot, such as the Jefferson Memorial in Washington and Penn Central in New York. It also has great support actors with Hitch's daughter Patricia in the role of the younger sister to Ruth Roman and permanent Leo G. Carroll in another of his Hitchcock films. The ending episode is one of the most nervous in Hitchcock's work. Robert Walker as Bruno Anthony (his latest feature film) gives a great performance as a terrified stranger on a train that worms into life unsuspecting tennis stars, Guy Haines (Farley Granger). Granger plays a nice guy who's caught in a messy divorce. The film opens with a camera showing the shoes of two separate men leaving their taxis on board the train. Eventually they meet and take over the story. The stranger will attract an unusual interest in the tennis star and as the film goes on, the stranger becomes a stalker. The event moves from place to place, including Washington, the fictional town of Metcalf, the Forest Hills tennis championship, and a passenger train that leads two leading men on two missions. Towards the end, the pace of the tennis game is woven into a plot as they race against time. The camera cuts off the faces of athletes as they volleyball and serves in a remarkable series of shots. When a tightly fought competition ends, climates take place. Hitchcock has love for trains and it's great to see Penn Station, long gone. Trains are featured in 39 steps, Lady Vanishes, Shadow of a Doubt, Spellbound, North Northwest and this movie. This classic Hitchcock thitcher took place at the beginning of a period of great creativity for the Tension Master - the fifties and I am convinced that one day his place will be given in the Hitchcock Hall of Fame.
