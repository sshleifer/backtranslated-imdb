I recently bought Lost Horizon on eBay, with vivid memories of things I won't miss a number from childhood (I'm 29). I recently also completed the novel on which it is based. I was so pleasantly surprised when I found a real hidden treasure. The beautiful cast brings such warmth and depth to the beautifully simple and elegantly narrated story, gently updated from the original film (and now a completely separate entity to James Hilton's much more intellectual and provocative book). Especially Sally Kellerman has a brilliant presence as a suicidal neurotic Sally Hughes who gradually warms up to the Shangri-La charm. Only Liv Ullmann is taught in his wooden teacher's picture (a role that is much more appropriate for Julie Andrews. The fact that Finch, Ullmann and Hussey are all dubbed is not important because it's almost impossible to say it in quality, music is far better than lyrics, but it's still a lively and exciting movie that really deserves a proper DVD release and much more recognition.
