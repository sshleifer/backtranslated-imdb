This is one of Chaplin's first national films between his famous Mutual Shorts and the more advanced features of United Artists. More promising than the Mutual movies, Chaplin continues his efforts to improve his comic book expression. Most people forget that the film is actually a dream that Charlie has while waiting for it to be forward. There is plenty of grotesque over Limburger cheese that is used for gas enemy, and Chaplin's foray into enemy territory dressed like a tree. To this stage of this career, the great man has become so immersed in the film's expression that his films seem to create themselves. Undoubtedly this was not the case, but it still provides a convincingly realistic view of life at the front as I remember, though from an ironically witty perspective. <br /> <br /> As for me, familiarity with All of Chaplin's work should be a prerequisite for all cinephiles - don't stand by!
