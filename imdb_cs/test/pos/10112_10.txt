"The Story of Two Sisters" or "Janghwa, Hongryeon" is a true masterpiece. A brilliant psychological thriller, a heartbreaking drama and a fearsome horror, all wrapped up in one beautifully arranged package. From a complicated plot to beautiful cinematography to complete casting, every aspect of this film is extraordinary. . While this may initially seem a little difficult to understand, it does well to explain things in the end. And whether you prefer a psychological thriller, drama or horror, I promise you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, it's almost flawless. The ensemble, cinematography, lighting and especially the soundtrack are all captivating. The waltz initially appeared to be a special choice, but it turned out to be a sophisticated choice. <br /> <br /> When it comes to casting, we're talking about absolute perfection. I am Su-jeong is absolutely convincing as defiant, yet worried Su-mi. Mun Keunyeong is as convincing as her emotionally traumatized sister Su-yeon. These two girls were magical on the screen. I'm sure I'll look at their other movies. Yeom Jeong-ah is deceptively cheerful and terribly evil as a stepmother. Finally, Kap-su Kim gives excellent performance as a tired, broken father. <br /> <br /> I really love this movie. If you don't see the 'Two Sisters Story' yet, I strongly recommend finding a copy. It's a real jewel that deserves anyone. <br /> <br />
