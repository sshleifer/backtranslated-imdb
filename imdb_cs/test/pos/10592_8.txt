Personally, I thought this movie was great. I had it on a pre-order for a month and I watched it twice on the day I got it, and several times since then. All amature cast but acting was right for each part. The storyline itself is just ... haggard! There is no other way to describe it. Who makes a movie about someone getting f ** gered! ??? BAM, that's who. Genius. Simply brilliant. Two thumbs up. I'd be honored to work with him anytime, anytime, on any thing.
