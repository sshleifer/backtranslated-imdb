That was Saturday before Halloween this year (today, at the time of writing this article) and it must be the best horror anthology. Normally I'm not a fan of horror movies - mainly because of the amount of crap that was recently released. However, director Campfire Tales has a Hitchcock gift that is energized - unlike other contemporary films, he does not take every opportunity to frighten you foolishly, instead using the foreknowledge and "almost absent" - incidents that seem like a moment, the climax occurs in the moment before, but it turned out not to be. I haven't caught the "Hook" or the first major segment, but from what I've read here, two of you can afford to miss. <br /> <br /> 'People can lick too' was full of tension - this short keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting for something to happen with a little girl as she wanders around her yard and house looking for her soccer ball and later her dog. She encounters so many disappearing that the tension reaches the heartbreaking ratio short of the peak when the girl surrenders and goes to bed because she thinks her dog is under her. She puts her hand down to let him lick, and she feels a touch of tongue on her hand ... before she notices that in her mirror, written in blood, "People can also lick". I'll leave the last few seconds to find out my reader, because at this point the short could take any number of turns. of this movie. It starts with a man on a motorcycle, just goes ... to what he doesn't know, but feels coming. When he goes on, a storm breaks out and he is forced to find refuge in the house of a silent girl. The two calm down quickly, but before they can kiss anything else, the girl tells her that ghosts live in her house. They quickly begin to pack up, but leave in the middle of a decade-long reconstruction - a father returning home to his daughter and a friend who was preparing to say goodbye, murdering both, and then committing suicide. I have to let you discover the end - I couldn't hope to make a story of justice in any case, and what I said is just a brief summary of the story - I couldn't hope to tell the nuances and sensory details you add to that . "The Campfire", which is the link between all the stories, is a rather interesting complement to the theme of car crash and girls are very attractive - in fact, most girls in this film are pretty. Despite being cut, the story is given to justice and the end is difficult to predict if you are interested in other stories. However, if you pay enough attention to the bonfire segments spreading through the movie, it's definitely possible to predict the end, especially if you've seen movies based on the same premise. (MST3k fans, remember Soultaker? The same assumption, but without God's terrible writing Vivian Schilling, and the size of the movie. If you've seen the first 30 minutes that you should be able to predict the end.) All the best horror I've seen in LONG time, and the only horror anthology worthy to buy.
