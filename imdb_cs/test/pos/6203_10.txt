He has a drama, tension and character development that would entertain you if you like the drama that captivates and entertains you, as well as teachers. <br /> <br /> Writers know their material and it shows. The direction is always engaging and not blissful, and the acting scary. Why this show has not won any award tells me that the "powers" that are in Hollyweird do not know drama or other things. In this episode a twist appeared, which was totally surprised and very well played. I'm glad she wasn't used as a shock scene for any climatic end of the series, which would be more typical and boring. Rent this series at once! Hopefully it will bring back from the extinction of celluloids.
