My friends and I rented this movie just to satisfy a friend who was very inclined to rent, even though he had no idea what it was about. We all thought it would be like a "Canadian American pie", but when we watched it, we were totally surprised, we were all silent throughout the movie and we loved it! It was nothing like an American pie and had a plot that teenage girls are sure to adore (see how this guy gets crap beat out of him at the end), after that night it became my favorite movie not only is it a conspiracy but actors and great writing . There was no moment when I thought it was incredible. Everything is very realistic and applies to anyone who lives in a small town with little prospects. I totally adore this movie and I suggest you rent it when you have a chance, it's worth it.
