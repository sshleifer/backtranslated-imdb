In 1961, this series was shown on local television here in Southern California. Since then I and many others petering BBC on tape or DVD. He's suddenly here on Amazon. I ordered in advance in January and now arrived here on March 30th. It was a long wait (48 years). It was worth it? So far I have watched Richard II. (I only had a DVD from 2 am) and I can really say YEA !!! it's worth waiting. Acting, directing and producing are excellent and even better than I remember. The production is in B & W but somehow fit. The video is clear and very good, the sound is flawless. More proof of how timeless Shakespeare really is. I gave 10 stars, although I only saw 1 in 8 games. I'm sure if I saw them all, I'll change my rating to at least 12. <br /> <br /> At the moment, it's on Amazon (US region 1) at a reasonable price. I'd rather stop now to go back to observation. Next up is Henry IV, whose first part is my favorite game of Shakespeare.
