Is it the perfect movie? No. It's a strange adaptation from the science fiction book and includes vampires from space, nude beauty and the efficiency of the British army. <br /> <br /> When I first saw this movie, I was rather young and everything I can remember the horror feeling for the movie and Mathilda May. Actually, if it weren't for this beautiful lady, who is naked all the movie, I probably wouldn't rate it so high, but due to her utter magnificence, I am actually considering her vote! Happiness for Me I reminded myself of the movie and watched it again. Imagine the Lost Ark Raiders or Poltergeist Special Effects splashed into a fairly decent sci-fi story, but with utterly superior performance. I still enjoyed the movie immensely (as did Mathilda May), but it was a mixture of nostalgia, compared to the bullshit they do today, and actually want more when it's over. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: If you're a science fiction fan you can't miss this movie. And did I mention that Mathilda May is young, beautiful and naked?
