I remember seeing this movie when I was quite young and I was quite concerned about it. I found the story very worrying and I still remember the various used bullying techniques. One of them was especially when the other schoolchildren crept into the soup before tasting the spoon. They also bound him and shaved his private parts. That was all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad in games. I feel that even if he is good at games, he would be bullied because it is difficult to decide what makes him popular. For me, it is the kind of person who would always be picked up because the children are doing so. Popular kids are popular because they're somehow cool. Popularity is difficult to define. Even at the end, when he is successful in his career, it doesn't matter that he is still sorry. I found that the end is quite unpleasant because there is no resolution.
