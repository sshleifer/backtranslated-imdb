for God !!! do you ever think they would make a movie about it? I knew well well, but I didn't know when! and now its finally !!! when I received it over the post yesterday, I put it in my (bad) stereo sound that plays on DVD and I immediately had this huuuuuuuuuge smile on my face when a cloud appeared (it looked goodâ€¦ wonderful) and followed All the other fascinating characters from the final fantasy game! including tifa and aeris, my favorite .... (there are too many) the graphics set me off !!!! they were really amazing. so real up to the last hair !!! The story is a bit confusing, especially because my version of the movie was in Japanese, but of course - it's a long time for the finale fanatic - I didn't mind a bit - I just read the headlines !!! All characters speak as they would in the game, and Reno and Rude are still ridiculous. the dragon scene is also bad. just looks so good !!! anyway .... the graphics was, amazing .... story, fantastic .... and the basic idea that i film ff7 ....... genius !!!
