The book and the film themselves are excellent. They differ slightly, but it increases and does not detract from what is an excellent script and acting. The historic atmosphere, the young love-seeking girl, the amazing background of the music hall and the voyage to the lesbian world of London at the beginning of the 20th century make this exceptional film. As a screenwriter, Andrew Davies excels in writing this lesbian love story with such sensitivity. Rachael Sterling and Keeley Hawes are excellent actresses and give the best to these works. The rest of the cast is very good. If it was more than 10 out of 10, I'd give it!
