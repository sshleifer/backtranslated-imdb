After repeatedly saying how brilliant so many Columbo episodes are, it's time to honor the episode with maximum points. "Etude In Black" is not perfect at 100 percent, but it's definitely over 90 percent ... maybe 96 or 97! Last week I reviewed "Just Married" and compared it to "Meet The Parents". Here is one of the parents, Blythe Danner, in a much earlier role as the wife of the famous orchestral conductor Alex Benedict, played by legend John Cassavetes. Alex has an affair with Jennifer Wells, a girl in an orchestra (not his first affair, one suspect). She blackmails Alexa to leave his wife, but as his wife's mother holds the wallet for the orchestra, Alex doesn't think it was such a clever step to ruin his career and marriage overnight. Instead, a plot is portrayed to disappear from the concert hall before the show and murder his young lover while it looked like suicide. Enter Columbo and guess what? It takes him about two seconds to realize that murder is more likely than suicide. It doesn't take much longer for Columbo to join the victim, and he soon follows him wherever he goes. Although Columbo is sure that Alex is his man, it takes quite a while and some fake tips (none of which Columbo really swallows) before he has important evidence. On the way there are some top-notch extra characters, from the premature young neighbor Jennifer Wells and the English mechanic who sounds more like home on Coronation Street, to the bedraggled looking brass player who is almost at murder (also saw Jennifer Wells, a busy girl!). And even a short portrait from Commander Lassard of the Police Academy films. As with Leslie Nielsen in "Lady In Waiting," it's impossible to take him seriously (I bet you're thinking about the speech he made on stage, right?!) But it's Blythe Danner, John Cassavetes and Peter Falk steal the show. Blythe is absolutely divine as Mrs Benedict. Ever since she notices that Alex is dialing Jennifer Wells out of memory, she feels deeply concerned about exactly what their relationship is. It is a masterpiece when trying to trust Alexi, although her intuition tells her that something is very, very bad. Columbo doesn't help matters by interrupting her tennis game to ask her about her inappropriate questions about Alex's relationship with his orchestra. As for John Cassavets, it's a pity he didn't repeat himself. Appearing like Columbo villains because he could be up with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan as one of the all-time greats of the show. But this performance is excellent! It is another who falls into the category of "highly irritated", losing all patience with Columbo, rather than making him friends and indulging him. Despite the game's upstairs, Columbo's genius admits steadfastly. Well, it's a really fantastic show. He loses a few very small points for his rather sledgehammer look at classical music, as many of the posters here have emphasized, but none of them have any relation to story logic or characterization. And at least the music is good, dramatic and exciting! Finally, if you haven't met her, there's an absolutely amazing clip of John Cassavetes and Peter Falk at the Dick Cavett show in the early 1970s. I am absolutely convinced that Steve Coogan has watched this clip and founded Alan Partridge on it. Everything about the clip reminds Know Me Know You, from the cringeworthy introduction to the complete humiliation of Cavett's guests. Even the orchestra comes into play, plays circus music, while Falk, Cassavetes and their friend Ben Gazzara are crazy and ridicule the host. <br /> <br /> This review may not be strictly relevant, but the Cavett Clip show gives a good insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falco and John Cassavetes. It is clear to see from the quality of "Etude In Black" how well a couple have worked!
