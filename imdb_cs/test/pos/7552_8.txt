Four Friends are one of those movies that you get without any expectations, just to knock on a loop. Some file goes away, but then you hear the song "Georgia On My Mind" by Ray Charles and the pictures and vague feelings begin to flicker at the edge of your consciousness, and then you remember this crazy movie that made you laugh and cry, almost at the same time. Why is this movie so memorable? First of all, at least for the people who have lived it all, because it captures the time so well - its fleeting hopes, its achievements, its sincerity and above all the emotional ride on the roller coaster, which leads to engaging nostalgia. And then the acting is so amazing. Danilow, all anxiety and passion, Georgia, as difficult to understand as the will, but charming, however, and Louis, a disabled room friend with a charm that attacks life with taste and takes every moment with Wry smile because he knows too well that it may be his last. <br /> <br /> How long has it been since you've seen a movie that really interests you in the story? Even if they were far from perfect? The film will introduce you to people whose choice is not necessarily commendable, but the film never morals, it only allows us to appreciate the human condition in all its diversity ... even small characters have a well-defined personality and history, which is why this film seems so real, though some of the actions and responses may seem to be over the top ... because that's the way of life when you think about it. And why this film will captivate you with the complexity that is defined by the character. Really amazing and satisfying experience.
