I first saw APOCALYPSE in 1985 when it was first aired on British television. After seeing this masterpiece, I was shocked and despite my close competition with FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, this movie still remains my favorite for almost 20 years after I first saw it <br /> <br /> This leads to the problem of how I can even start commenting on the film . I could praise the technical aspects, especially sound, editing and cinematography, but all others seem to praise (also rightly) these achievements to the high sky, while performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular have been mentioned, and everyone else has mentioned the sharp image of the Dou bridge Long and cut from a ship that travels across the border <br /> <br /> How's the script? Francis Ford Coppola is the best-known director, but as a director he is always a genius, I said "was" in the past, because this movie apparently fired all the creative brain cells in his head, but his victim was worth it. In John Milius' original solo design, we have a scenario that is as crazy and distracting as the one on screen, but Coppola's involvement in the script put a story that reflects war. See how the script starts from all jingoistic and macho with Bill Kilgore star, who would look out of BERETS green space, but the more the story progresses more shocking and crazy everything happens so much that by reaching Kurtz's base viewers watch another movie, just as the characters sailed to another dimension. When Coppola states: "This movie is not about Vietnam - It's Vietnam" is right. What began as a patriotic war to defeat Communist aggression in the mid-1960s was the setting of the film (the Manson process suggests that it was in 1970) changing the American view of the world and itself and the world view of America <br /> <Br It is the crazy beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW, which makes it a masterpiece of cinema and in its runtime it says more about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians (What did you do in the Presidential Vietnam War?) Than Michael Moore hoping to say it for the whole life. I didn't see the REDUX version, but I was watching the original print. I didn't feel that there was anything missing in the story, just as all really great movies are very simple. In fact, the premise may lend itself to many other genres like Western where an army officer must track down and kill a renegade apostate who leads a leading war party injun, or a science fiction film where a UN killer is to remove a fellow UN soldier who conducts a resistance movement on Mars, even though it's probably in the original source of Joseph Conrad's <br /> <br /> My Favorite Movie and it's a good idea I chose this movie to be my thousand IMDb
