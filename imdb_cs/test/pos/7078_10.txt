Meryl Streep may be the greatest actor today. Her chameleonic images never amaze; it seems that it is actually the character that brings it to the screen. In "One True Thing", she gives life to a deceptively straightforward, deeply complex woman trying to play life in her hands. Surviving with cancer is not an easy task, and not only surviving, but continuing to live your life is even harder - and that's exactly what Kate Gulden (Streep) means. Renee Zellweger ("Jerry Maguire") not only holds her own in this noble society, but shines like Streep's daughter who learns to see her parents' lives in the new light as well as her own. Streep is a powerhouse and deservedly received an Oscar nomination for his work here; Her "I will say it once", the dialogue with Zellweger will leave you. But Zellweger is a real revelation - her face expresses all emotions, every conflict when she begins to learn many truths about her parents' strengths and weaknesses. Director Carl Franklin ("Devil in Blue Dress") handles extremely challenging story material with confidence and subtlety.
