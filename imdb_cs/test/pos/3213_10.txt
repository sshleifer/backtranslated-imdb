when gilmore girls started in Germany, I didn't want to watch them because it was just something that wasn't unique to me. it was a series and I didn't even know anyone in it. Later I realized that Edward Hermann is part of a cast overboard (film, I absolutely adore). I had to observe it once with a friend and I never stopped. it's just fun. You feel like it's okay to have sex before you get married, and it's okay to be a coffee addict and eat junk stuff all the time. I don't want to do these things all the time, but when I do these things I feel a bit like a gilmore girl. Even my friend looked at them and it says something. From season to season it has improved with scripts and stories. they have an open mind and by being different from any other show, you want to be like them.
