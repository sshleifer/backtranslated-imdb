Frankie Darro was an amazing child actor who excelled at playing pugnacious little hard with huge chips on his shoulders. He appeared in several top films of the early 30s - "The Public Enemy" (1931), a country breaking drama drama and "Wild Road Boys" (1933), a current depression era film about children riding on rails. He was essentially a younger version of James Cagney. Although his height is low, his willingness to do his own stunts employed him in a series of programmers when the larger studios no longer used him. "Criminal School" was supposed to be a remake of "Mayor of Hell" but it had far more humor in it and featured the Dead End Children and Humphrey Bogart as a highly retreated representative of the Commisssioner. "Mayor of Hell" is really a combination of "House of Hell" / "School of Crime" / "Boy City". Although Cagney arrived around the 25th minute, his impact (as usual) was immediate. He plays a hot gangster who is on the payroll of a political group led by the crowd. Jimmy Smith (Frankie Darro) and his gang (including "Farina" from "Our Gang") run car wash rocket, but bite more than they can chew when they rob the store and push the owner through the glass glass windows. They appear before a juvenile court and are sentenced to go to state reform. It is painted in shining terms - a model school where boys have the opportunity to learn business. In fact, it is a hellish place run by sadistic overseer Mr. Thompson (extremely played by Dudley Digges). The only sympathetic person is Dorothy Griffith, a live sister (played by Madge Evans). "Patsy" Gargan (James Cagney) got a job as a new deputy commissioner as a favor. Upon arrival at school, he witnessed an unsuccessful escape attempt and, after talking to Dorothy, realizes that the school needs extensive reforms. He soon runs a school and brings a system of "self-government" - rather in the spirit of "the boy's city." Although Cagney doesn't have much to do, the image is led to his breathtaking peak of Darro energy. After "Patsy" is temporarily out of picture (he accidentally shoots a gangster and has to leave the state), Thompson returns and his brutal treatment, resulting in the death of the boy ("Skinny") turn the rest of the boys into an angry mob. They burn the barn and Thompson falls to his death - "Patsy" returning just in time to quiet the crowd with some sober conversation. Sure, all the boys seemed to be a tough talk for their crimes, but I disagree with one of the reviewers - Thompson was more than just "bad luck". His sadistic treatment resulted in a boy's death. In the beginning, there is a scene where some inedible slopes are given to boys - Thompson orders ham and eggs and keeps butter on bread when talking to Dorothy. Allan Jenkins plays "Uncle" Mike and Sheila Terry, although billed only as a "blonde" has one of the most memorable lines when she pouts and says, "I thought there would be young boys where are they? ‚Äù!!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
