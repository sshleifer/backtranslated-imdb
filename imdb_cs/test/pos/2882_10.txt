I will always think of Mr. Firth as Dorian Gray if I live on 100. <br /> <br /> He acted perfectly and directed Oscar Wilde to be insightful, joke and humor alive with total and utter perfection on television <br More evidence that the BBC is more than making in talent what it does not always have in money. <br /> <br /> Must have for all fans Wilde-and really for everyone else. Each of the actors, inspired and perfected, looked exactly for the role, and each shot was well done. By the end, I found out that I fell in love with all the characters so that no other film would ever inspire them. Watch it and try to watch another version. It's just not the same thing, is it?
