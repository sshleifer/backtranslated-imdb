This film is one of the best in 1986 with horrible yet interesting performances by Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper! Reagan's years were pretty bleak for many, not just teenagers, but this movie really caught up with despair and despair. Well directed by a great script (apparently based on a true story), I see no weaknesses in it. The opening shot was brilliant. Keanu Reeves was decent for a change, and Miss Skye was entitled to money. Hopper had three other great performances in the same year (Blue Velvet, Texas Chainsaw II and Hoosiers). I imagine it has iconic consequences, and I wonder how this image would pay off if it were reissued. Super stuff!
