I saw this movie in the early 70s and I was fascinated by Judy Geeson. For me, this captured the stealthy nature of Rod Steigers and the untamed obsession with the young and extremely sexy hiker Geeson played. You couldn't feel a little sorry for the wife Claire played great. Flower. I was really disappointed to see that the original cut was lost and there was little chance of it being released on DVD. I reject anyone who has seen the film and it's a strong message that we can't be the same Swallowed by the three main shows, and I'd like to see it again if nothing else is for a purely nostalgic reason. We are coming back in time, about 35 years. <br /> <br /> Real classics.
