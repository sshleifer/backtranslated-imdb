Mighty Like A Moose is one of many short films Director Leo McCarey starred with Charley Chase. What a dandy! Charlie and his wife underwent a plastic surgery to improve their hideous manifestations, which are unknown to each other. Then they meet at a party and become together. Now they can't afford to find out they're cheating. This is the pointless assumption of this frantic farce. Vivien Oakland, one of the few short comedic short films, has a long career long after silence, is perfect because of Charley's long nose wife. Charley has terrible cases of teeth that are quickly sent to the dentist. After one party attacks the police for no reason to practice raids, Charley and his wife are desperately trying to avoid each other at home because of the fear that changes in circumstances will become known. They were both photographed with new features at the party. A hilarious return home culminates in Charley trying to learn a no-good-nick cheating with his wife lesson. Of course, No-Good-Nick is a new Charley who his wife realizes long before Charley teaches a lesson. This is one of Charley Chase's better efforts. *** of 4 stars.
