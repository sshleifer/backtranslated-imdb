For the first time I watched this film around 1990 as a young boy and scared me Jesus. I loved it so much and I was dying to get my hands on it. In 2002, I remembered that this movie existed, but I had no idea what it was called, so I went to I We need to know the section about IMDb and explain what the movie was get his name. Anyway, somebody on IMDb told me so I researched and tried to buy the movie. So in the end I kept it on DVD, and now I am this movie as one of my most valuable horrors. I really love her and I think everyone who watches her will be very scared the next time. 9/10.
