Sit back and let us lead Bharatbala to guide us to the visual and sensual voyage of India's mind and spirit. When was the last time you could say you really enjoyed the movie? This film has a pace and keeps us moving in a direction that can only exist in India. If you didn't want to visit India before this movie will definitely want to visit you. This movie has dancing girls, a scene of persecution and mafia. But he has a lot more. Thanks, Bharatbala, for taking us on such a wonderful and amazing story. I loved the end. We women do not want illusions in life, we want reality. P.S. I was a friend of Carolyn at the Sonoma Film Festival and met you briefly. Good luck with your distribution effort and I'm talking about a storm movie.
