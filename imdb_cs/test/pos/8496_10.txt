This is one of the best movies I've seen in years. I took my new time and place. It was like being with Ray in his many trials and triumphs. Jamie Foxx became Ray. Ray was in the movie. Also Kerry Washington, Sharon Robinson and Regina King were excellent. The film was well cast and directed, the music was fantastic. I've seen movie four (4) times with different people and the last time was just as fun as the first time. I'll buy a DVD as soon as it's released. This is a movie that will be seen over and over again for years to come. <br /> <br /> Thanks for the great experience.
