This little film is hysterical, full of stereotypes about homosexuals, plains, dwarfs, British tea and pubs, American culture of arms, divorce and marriage; nevertheless, he is able to be sensitive to all the problems associated with them. Kathy Bates is an "amazing" Grace Beasley, and as an acting actor she brings her considerable comedic talent to create this somewhat unusual film as she did in Fried Green Tomatos. With the help of other comedic talents such as Dan Akroid as Max, her former lawyer and the background of downtown Chicago and rural England, the story is interesting enough to entertain him. Jonathan Price plays Victor Fox, a gay singer locker murdered by a crossbow killer in Chicago. His valet lover Dirk Simpson, played by stunning Rupert Everett, has to overcome Victor's siblings, including Lynn Redgrave, who want to turn their home into an honest museum and team with Bates and her dwarf daughter, Mauda Beasley. find the killer among the homeless in Chicago. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is singing at different places of pursuit and are excellent, especially. Gifted Price and Bates. This unlikely story, both funny and bizarre, is one of the most off-center films. Cameos Julie Andrews, Barry Manlow and Sally Jesse Raphael should tell you how bizarre this movie really is. Strange, funny and out of center, but with a good view of people with every difference.
