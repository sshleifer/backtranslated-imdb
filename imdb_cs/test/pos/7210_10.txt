If you've never been "Tromatized," it's the first Troma movie. Amazing acting performance, crowded soundtrack and bust-a-gut humor fit perfectly with the unique Tromy brand that tells the story and special effects. Despite the word reflecting Romeo and Juliet, the fact that it remains in the Iambic pentameter gives you a strange feeling that it is closer to Shakespeare than what was played by the music video with DiCaprio and Danes. I assumed I saw the final Shakespeare comedy when Moonlighting was overworked by The Taming of the Shrew, but Tromeo and Juliet were not happening. I highly recommend the DVD version, which includes a second soundtrack with director Lloyd Kaufman, who is as entertaining as the main song.
