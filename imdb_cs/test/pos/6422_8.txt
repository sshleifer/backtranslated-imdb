I was very impressed with this film, which he directed (Luigi Bazzoni). The story was about a young woman translator who suddenly lost all her memories of the last three days and suffered nightmares about astronauts on the moon. He can't explain how it happened to anyone. One day, a postcard from the island of Garma comes to visit her. Surprisingly, when people know her, though she has never been there before. Also, her dreams of astronauts on the moon come back to her. I thought it was a very strange Italian movie that sometimes seemed very creepy, and strange pictures appeared in a movie that seemed to stay. with you all the time watching the movie. I would recommend this movie to people to find out how good it is. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
