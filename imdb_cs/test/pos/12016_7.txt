Ex-reporter Jacob Asch (Eric Roberts) is hired by acquaintances (Raymond J. Barry) to find his ex-wife and son. Asch heads for Palm Springs and quickly finds ex Laine (Beverly D'Angelo) with someone he believes is the son (young Johnny Depp). But things seem to be a little more complicated because Asch discovers that the former white garbage Laine has finally married in the form of millionaire Simon Fleischer (Dan Hedaya) and her first son is nowhere to be seen. The director / writer Matthew Chapman directs BODY HEAT and neo-noir here in the mid-1980s, well-tracked with versatile casting and pleasing places. D'Angelo still looked good, well this time, so he does a good femme fatale and is not afraid to show some skin. But the secret is not very convincing in the end. They play Dennis Lipscomb, Emily Longstreth and Henry Gibson. Chapman made several thrillers in the 1980s, but his "greatest" career success was co-author of the infamous COLOR NIGHT scenario.
