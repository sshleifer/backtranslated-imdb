This movie was great. Includes the difficulties a returning Vietnamese veteran has in dealing with the horrors of war. Unfortunately, the writers decided to focus on the veterinarian who was involved in the act of atrocity. I was in Vietnam and only once did I hear about a crime witness. The offender was prosecuted and sentenced to many years in Leavenworth. The idea that only veterinarians involved in the atrocities had emotional problems is a service for all who served. All the soldiers I personally knew, or whom I knew orally, were honest soldiers who respected the enemy and believed they were there to stop the spread of communism. The biggest problem was that many Americans opposed the war. This made many veterans feel like they were involved in something less than honest. Not the way they served. The end depicted a father who was more like an aggressive bully than a loving, caring father. After that, I gave it 7 out of 10. If the end allowed for the degree of acceptance I could rate it 9. <br /> <br /> Most decent men come home from the guilt war and emotional scars. They need to accept and understand to overcome it. I pray that the public will understand our current veterans more than they did in Vietnam.
