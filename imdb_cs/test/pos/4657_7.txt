I completely forgot about "Midnight Madness" until I found it while surfing on the IMDB. Now it's all that comes back to me .... <br /> <br /> It was one of Naughton's first films (as well as Fox), and sharp-eyed connoisseurs also chose Kaplan (Henry of TV). "), Fiedler (he makes the voice Piggy in" Pooh Bear Cartoons ") and Blocker (son of Dan" Hoss "Blocker from" Bonanza "Television). But two of it stand out in my mind are Furst (from "Animal House") and superdude by myself - Eddie Deezen. Furst plays baddie this time and has one of the best scenes when he asks his father: "Why can't you accept me, who am I?" His dad looks at his obese, ruthless frame and gives a simple one-word answer - "Yeah!" And Deezen ... well, it's a show in itself. As the last day, Jerry Lewis stumbles, goes through the mini-golf ponds, puts melon halves on his ears and ends up with Maggie Roswell's fall. My hero. As far as film is concerned, it is a typical foolishness in the early 1980s with high school children who remain after a curfew and set out on a trip around the city to show which division of students is the best on campus. : athletes, fools, rich children, feminists, or a group composed of each. <br /> <br /> Who will win? Who cares, you'll have a lot of fun watching Disney Pictures first foray into PG territory before creating Touchstone Pictures. Seven Stars. Catch "Midnight Madness" Any Way You Can! Long Life Leon!
