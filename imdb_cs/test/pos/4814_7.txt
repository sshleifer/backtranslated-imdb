Later, director John Frankenheimer directed his first feature film, The Young Stranger, after directing live television dramas in New York. This film came to the heels of Rebel's no-cause success in 1955. James MacArthur made his feature film debut as a troubled teen with a film producer's father, played by James Daly, who doesn't establish enough relationship with his son. Kim Hunter plays a mother trying to bridge the gap between her husband and her son. The film uses a popular youthful delinquent angle of time to tell its story. MacArthur gets into trouble at the cinema with an exaggerated theater manager who plays Whit Bissell. MacArthur has to deal with police sergeant James Gregory, who is trying to teach him a lesson. The material could easily be exploited, laughed and sensational as well as any other number of times. However, under certain guidance of Frankenheimer, the film is a sensitive depiction of teenage and parental dynamics. The dialogue is realistic and most of the scenes are surprisingly good. Some scenes with Bissell, as a theater manager, and Gregory, as a police sergeant, are a bit cumbersome and dated. However, performances are just as good, which is essential for the success of this kind of film and this subject. This is an impressive feature debut for MacArthur and Frankenheimer. *** of 4 stars.
