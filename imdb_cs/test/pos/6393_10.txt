If you marry Huxtable's parents and mix them with Kyle's parents, you'll get the perfect blend of top and bottom parenting that you want for your own family upbringing. The best thing about each show is that parents don't look like a glitzy self-righteous upper class knows everything, but at the same time they are not stereotyped, undersized parents who are always crazy and impolite by their children. My children are 20, 16 and 6; Just about the same age as Kyle's kids and I see so many of their situations that reflect my own family experience. Silliness that indulge just goes to show that when you have love in your family you don't have to take it too seriously to keep your household together and have fun with the kids.
