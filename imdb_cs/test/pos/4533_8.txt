I think every critic who came out in 1995 in his "Tommy Boy" should come back and watch and learn it's not a bad movie at all. Every critic appeared on the films of Chris Farley and David Spade. Yes, "Coneheads" was funny, but the kind had one joke premise and "Black Sheep" I agreed with the critics is one of the worst movies ever. But "Tommy Boy" doesn't fall into the "Coneheads" category, which might have been a little more fun and "Black Sheep", a piece of dragon. It's very fun and fun. I agree with the criticism that Chris Farley was not John Belushi or John Candy when he claimed to adore those people and those guys had a genius for comedy, but Chris Farley was very funny and I wanted him to be longer to prove to critics, Yes, he was not John Belushi, or John Candy, but he was very funny. The scenes between Farley and Spade as nemesis are laterally dividing the merry and the premise is also laughing out loud. It's very sad that Chris Farley is no longer here to laugh at us, but we have movies like "Tommy Boy" to remember how it really was. "Tommy Boy" is one of the best comedies in the 1990s.
