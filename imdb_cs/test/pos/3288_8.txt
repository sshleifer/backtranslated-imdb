The eager electronics by Brian Foster (the sympathetic performance of Wesley Eure from TV "The Land of the Lost") creates a computer watch system called C.H.O.M.P.S. (short for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss Mr. Ralph Norton (played Conrad Baain), whose home security business is trembling. A competing company hires a few unfair criminals to get on their C.H.O.M.P.S.; this task becomes easier than it does. Director Don Chaffey combines a relentless story with a steady, fast pace, keeping a quick, silly and jolly tone with the hoarse gags. In addition, the game occupied it with infectious aplomb: adorable Valerie Bertinelli as Brian's sweet fiance Casey Norton, Chuck McCann as the sweaty crook of Brooks, Red Buttons like McCann's equally dampening partner Bracken, Jim Backus as a bad CEO Mr. Gibbs, Hermoine Baddeley as pretty old dear Mrs. Foster and the 60th flight exploitation function are regular Larry Bishop as a charming, duplicate suit Ken Sharp. Best of all, the titular pooch is a cuddly joy: C.H.O.M.P.S. Jumping over fences, walls and windows with amazing agility, performs acts of exceptional power, runs faster than a deer, and even makes several handy martial arts moves. A subplot about a massive neighborhood hound named Monster adds several other abdominal laughs (Monster is voiced by some unskilled guy with a suitably deep, growing voice). Neighboring animated introductory credit sequences, shiny Charles F. Wheeler cinematography and funky funky, pulsating disco score Hoyt Curtin are also solid. Adorable little baby boy.
