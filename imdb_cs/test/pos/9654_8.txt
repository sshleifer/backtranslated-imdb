Philippe Garrel breathes us through the forgotten atmosphere of Nouvelle Vague, almost lost among the remnants of his ancient splendor, but ready to rise again from the ashes if he remembers the past. On the other hand, those who are a bit familiar with the director's subjects may well know how obsessed he is with the lingering sense of loss in the reality of reality. So, "Les amants réguliers" show us the parallel stories "amour fou" and the temptation of the revolution that was destroyed under the guidance of young French students. The first part of the story is about the dramatic events of May '68 in France triggered by a series of overwhelming plans, a sort of verite cinema that puts the student insurrection into something other than an enviable light against a black background. Br /> Many can be said about the peculiarities of black-and-white photography used to describe the battle between students and the police, where high contrasts give the sequences an unrealistic atmosphere and the darkness closes on the excited bodies that wrap them up. in secret. Completely deprived images show the true consistency of the myth made of raw violence, increasingly emphasized by the irritated reality of film shooting. An individual here does not count anything at all: he tends to disappear into matter. In these battle scenes, the importance of mass design, the blind rage of a youthful attack, the sinister indignation of the power of the crowd, though conceived as separate entities apart from any kind of emotion, with cold and cold, are really important. a distant view of an entomologist intending to catalog his insect collection. The second part of the story is described in a quieter and most intimate way. He appears on the horizon a disturbing portrait of a self-centered generation in search of lost time, completely disillusioned with the individual values ​​of men, inclined to rotate on their own axis between opium fumes and make a funeral altar in praise of his Recent Defeat. "Les amants réguliers" from time to time evokes the shadow of the great Robert Bresson, revised and corrected by Garrell's peculiar feeling, without moving away from the main argument and trying to broaden the views of the human disillusionment that are painful, but they can bring us to the truth. In my opinion, trying to penetrate deep into the substrate of the story, when one lets go and play with the ear, he will probably find that he can lead the dark side of his self with horrible and irreplaceable consequences.
