This is ten times better than "Who wants to be a super model" on Bravo I think is more true for business. At the same time, Tyra is strong and sensitive and can make the most of every aspiring model. Photographs look for depth in each of the models, in personality and beauty, strength and decay attributes, and the ability to endure and work for what they want. I enjoy seeing Tire's personal experience getting into photography and on the runway. I do not always agree with the referees' decisions or Tyr's remarks and at least one of the winners, I don't think I deserve to win. But it's just a show, and every girl on her is lucky.
