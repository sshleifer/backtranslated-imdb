That was such a beautiful movie. So amazing performance from Joseph and Brad. Very innocently written and executed. You must see !! I screamed my eyes with almost the whole movie. It is a film that every family should sit with their children to look at, that will teach us all the very important lessons in life and how we should approach the harsh theme of AIDS, how we should teach our children to and the people around them. Not only with AIDS, but with every terminal disease. I haven't even heard of this movie until I have passed t.v. One day it happens. I recommend everyone to watch it, just remember the box of tissues. Other movies should be made like this. Extremely pleasing.
