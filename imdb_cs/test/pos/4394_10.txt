When I first saw this movie, it didn't seem to go anywhere. But when I watched it a second time, it was much more meaningful. Give it a chance, watch it more than once, there are lots of key elements that shape a story that could be missed first and second time to watch it. Cohen brothers brilliantly combine true early 20th-century events into this story to create a credible environment and storyline. The combination of Clooney's leading role is well suited to Turturro and Nelson's support acts. John Goodman's look in the movie is merry. The soundtrack is also great. This film has become a favorite family for my family. 10/10, sure.
