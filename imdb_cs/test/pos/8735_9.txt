Everyone told me to see "Cactus Flower", and I finally did it. What a wonderful movie - the perfect pick-me-up for Sunday night / dreaded Monday morning. Matthau and Hawn were good, but Ingrid Bergman really did this movie - after all, it was about her. Really great actors can do something and Miss Bergman proves it. It shows us - in the course of one film - a few people who show up throughout their careers. The dance club scene was as hysterical as it touched. Even as the film reached out to its obvious conclusion, I found out that I was cheering for Miss Dickinson as if she were Boston Red Sox. Fortunately, she did much better. ;)
