Spoiler Alert - Although it is a conspiracy almost impossible to spoil, as it is completely explained. "Mulholland Drive" is by far the most successful expression of David Lynch's film style and vision since the first season of his "Twin Peaks" TV series. As Lynch enthusiasts know, his is the style and vision uniquely blended from film noir, horror movies, surrealism and parapsychology ??? with a healthy dose of postmodern self-awareness and black humor that fit well. All these elements are rich in work at Mulholland Drive, which is for riveting, hair-raising, and a very satisfying film experience ??? especially if one does not become too obsessed with trying to make all pieces of conspiracy fit into a logical, mysterious whole that breaks down. The film presents the amazing performance of Naomi Watts and Laura Harring starring young women whose lives intersect in different ways amidst a Hollywood environment that is in itself a hallucinated blend of contemporary reality, the nostalgia of a retro 50's and a satirical self-confidence. Their seemingly random introductory meeting will take place after the opening scene of the film, in which Harring's character escapes an attempt to make her life through random, not to mention a terrible car accident. She climbed down the hill from Mulholland Drive to Sunset Boulevard (the two most typical Hollywood passages in Hollywood) and found her way to the apartment itself, which Betty (Naomi Watts) intends to take away from her aunt Ruth, the allegedly successful actress, is gone to Canada to start a new film. As we later learned, Betty came herself from Deep River, Ontario, shortly after winning the Jitterbug competition. <br /> <br /> The highly energetic and stylized flashback competition is one of the two pre-credit prologue sequences they frame. Betty descends from the clairvoyant innocence of a cliché to be a star, to the angry madness of a discarded lover, and nowhere to go. Harring, who couldn't remember her own name, took the name of the film "Rita" from the film poster for the noir classic film "Guild", which is decorated by Aunt Ruth's apartment. (Actually, it turned out that Aunt Ruth had died a long time ago and the apartment we're in is a good question to be resolved in future views.) In any case, Betty decides to help Rita find out what happened and discover the source of the role of money. and the mysterious blue key that women find in Rita's wallet. Both women begin to collect clues that would probably lead to Rita's true identity. By the way, they become lovers, at one point they emit such incendiary chemistry that I can't remember his equality in normal treatments for lesbian lovers (if Lynch's film is sometimes referred to as "mainstream"). <br /> <Br /> At the local Winkies Restaurant (a repetitive site full of sublime significance behind its rugged, realistic façade), Rita is fixed on the "Diane" waitress label. This leads her to remember someone named "Diane Selwyn", whose apartment these two women will soon visit, and at Betty's insistence they will enter. I will not reveal what they will find inside, but it was enough to say that the scene is rendered with vintage Lynchian ghosts. Subsequently, Rita wakes up in the night sweat speaking Spanish and rushes Betty into a full-time magic show / theater called 'Silencio', where the art of illusion and lip / instrumental synchronization is practiced with manic intensity and where there is a blue-eyed lady, as she is known in as the chairman of Muse. A blue-colored lady, bordered by a blue-lighted, red-curtained Silencio Theater, takes the last shot in the movie, perhaps a symbol for controlling artistic imagination? rather like Steven's "Blue Guitar Man" as he is filtered through the surrealist of bad drugs. During the Silencio sequence, and as Rebekah Del Rio came to lip, she synchronized her own powerful Spanish rendition of Roy Orbison's Crying ") when Betty opens her own purse, broken epiphany appears to discover a blue box with a keyhole that clearly matches the key in Rita's purse. Even if we do not get too deep into Freudian sexual symbolism of purses, the moment is rarely Hitchcock's in that key and box adaptation leads to a complete inversion of what we thought we knew, and to a whole new set of character relationships and meanings. The smallest of these twists is the discovery that Betty is a sought-after Diane Selwyn and a rejected Camille Rhodes lover (ie Rity). Camilla is again a Latin femme fatale movie star, whom Diane is committed to for a few minor roles she has managed to secure, and even more so to whom she is emotionally subjected. <br /> <br /> After these and other discoveries in the last third of the film, the problem of billing for the first two thirds of the film is not so clearly resolved as in "Vertigo". While bits and bits of paintings and dialogs suggest that many, if not all, of the earlier material is projected and moved from the zealous subconscious of Diane itself, other bits and pieces suggest perhaps a supernatural hit on the cast of characters who draw direct inspiration from "Twin Peaks" including Michael J. Anderson, who reprises his unearthly dwarf powers and Bob's variant behind Winkies, and is the ultimate repository for the blue box and its id-like association. <br /> <br /> One fits the pieces together, though, the whole 'Mulholland Drive' is much larger? and mysterious? than the sum of its parts. Lynch brings us to an amazingly inventive, provocative and pleasantly distracting trip to the mind. What's more, film cinematography is a stunning, soundtrack filled with an evocative atmosphere, great acting performance and directorship. This could be a well unrecognized Best Picture of the Year 2001 among the major US editions.
