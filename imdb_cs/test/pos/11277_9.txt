I like this movie very much. It's not much fun, but it's a holiday of bizarre and stunning images! There is no dialogue, just some background sounds and sounds. If you are completely different and original, and enjoy obscure and bizarre ... then you like this piece of art. Ik looks like a film made with the very first camera ever made, at a time where weird human-like beings live and perform their bizarre habits. God killed himself with a razor and gave birth to Mother Earth. The mother of the earth impregnated God's semen after a false act and gave birth to a son, "Body on Bones". Followed by inhuman acts of ritual torture, rape and murder for purposes we do not knowâ€¦ or we?
