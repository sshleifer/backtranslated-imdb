A rich young man, raised as the Son of God, must face Chinese heritage while living in the White World. Although the premise on which this film is based is almost certainly a biological impossibility, and the secret of the conspiracy when it was revealed at the end of the film, it does everything that preceded it with a faintly ridiculous story, still serving decent entertainment and good acting. Richard Barthelmess has a title role as the sweet Oriental, whose life is very complicated because he looks white. Barthelmess holds the tone of his performance serious throughout, looking intently at a medium distance (the manner he developed during the Silent Days) whenever his character is misbehaved. He is not trying to replicate his classic performance in BROKEN BLOSSOMS (1919) by D.W. Griffith and that is his merit. Beautiful Constance Bennett is the daughter of a millionaire who makes Barthelmess miserable. She is as beautiful as ever, but her behavior does not admit her to the viewer, and her terrible disease in the last reel is mercifully off screen. More talented Frank Albertson has a small role as Barthelmess' improvised friend. Serene E. Alyn Warren and the blues Anders Randolf play very different fathers of the top stars, while Claude King distinguishes his short appearance as an English author who associates with Barthelmess. The film mavens recognizes little Dickie Moore, uncredited, playing Barthelmess as a small child. <br /> <br /> The original Technicolor flashback sequence has faded with time for ruddy shade. The film, to be in the south of France, looks suspiciously like Avalon on Santa Catalina, off the coast of Southern California.
