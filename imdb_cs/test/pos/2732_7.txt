SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> 15 PARK AVENUE: My Humble on this movie <br /> <br /> Now, for a cinema viewer who tastes so severely restricted as mine, niche movies like 15 Park Avenue should be appetizing to my feelings. With this idea and the slight feeling of embarrassment I had not seen the whole movie before, I watched this movie last Saturday. There are some initial similarities to other works like the legendary Mulholland Drive (David Lynch) from which, this film borrows at least 3 concepts: - <br /> <br /> a) At least some of the truths are relative b) \ t The first scene of Shabana and Konkonam, which is playing in the car as an initial credit, is unusually similar to the car ride that Betty and Rita made in Mulholland Drive. In both cases, the subject of the investigation is a place that is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more openly symbolic in Aparno's film. C) The incident that revolves around a mad woman beggar is again very reminiscent of the whole "incidence of Winkies" including butt, but the frightening creature is the embodiment of something and that "something" as well as the character on Se is seamlessly associated with other Lynch works (note carefully the disheveled long hairs), the effect of the beggar woman in 15 PA seems to be a tribute, and therefore in the context of the film and his message insignificant. Other movies, of which 15 are also borrowed by PA, are Blow Up (especially the last scene is a return to film). True Vs perceived truth poser presented to the end of Antonioni's masterpiece). Of course, the professor and schizophrenia angle also bring to mind "Beautiful Mind". Although the subject of this issue is the high eyebrow physics and Shabana, who professes it, will inadvertently end up as a brilliant contrast to the delusional hallucinations of Konkona through these prophecies. In the extraordinary scene in the movie, some of these elements are next to each other and the scene cuts back and forth from the 'real' world of Shaban, where Quantum Physics and Relativity Theory justify the finality and composition of the universe, the artificial construction of the world "believe" Mithi Ale for all their differences are similar to nurses. They are both unable to establish long-term relationships - one of choice and one of nature. Mithi's pain in rejecting Joydeep's love is consistent with Shaban's inability to create a special bond with Kunal (Dhritiman) or Sanjeev (Kanwaljeet). But I myself start. Viewers usually tend to view this film in one of the following two ways: - <br /> <br /> Hypothesis 1: "It was Shabana all the time" There is a part of the audience who thinks it. But this explanation is not only very appealing, but also fanciful, which would mean that it would dream of so many other characters (ie, all those characters they visualized as a visualization of Mithi along with it) <br /> <br /> Hypothesis 2 " There was a REAL Mithi and the end is a metaphor "This POV says that the essence of the film is summarized in one dialogue in the film when in response to Joy's statement (Rahul Bose) that Mithi is looking for something she would never find, his wife Laxmi ( Shefali Shah) philosophizes that we are all really looking for an illusory utopia, the end of the rainbow where the mirage of happiness and satisfaction lies <br /> <br /> There are other more minor options that many of us have not known, for example: Hypothesis 3: "Shabana and Konkona are alter egos of the same person" Hypothesis 4: "Shabana is also a product of Mithi's imagination" Hypothesis 5: "Old, easy, maybe mad, beggar is the real protagonist of the story" They are these hypotheses worthy of testing? Well, your estimate is as good as mine <br /> <br /> "Why 15 Park Avenue?" Contrary to popular perception that she was thinking about Park Avenue in New York, I believe she was named after a branded semi-popular bathing soap. Remember, her Jo Jo profession as "Prime Minister Shikakai" who, as you may know, is a popular ingredient used in making shampoos. The prefix '15' is used as it was on December 15th, that Mithi was engaged to Joydeep and after his strike stayed forever at warp time. The film has its fair share of deficiencies - a lack of strong background score, which in movies like these can actually enrich narration, some sloppy dialogues that are hampered by some forced dialogue. Inconsistent performances (Shabana and Dhritimaan are excellent though IMO) by several cast members, although many members of this cast file have been squandered. The sudden uncertainty of Shefali Chay about her husband seems to be an unimaginable dimension to the plot. I gave it 7/10 because I was thinking about it, but no more than that, because I can easily understand its sources of inspiration and have the experience (and for the most part enjoyed) the ones I had before, I thought of similar lines previously. . The experience after 15 PA is therefore bound to be unbearable by a certain degree of novelty. Where am I from? I put 9.5 / 10 on '36 Chowringhee Lane '(although rumors still persist that Satyajit Ray's ghost drove), 7.5 on "Paromiter Ek Din", 7 on "Mr and Mrs Iyer" and 5 on "Paroma". On the existential level, my interest was not raised, not even as much as I say "Truman Show"
