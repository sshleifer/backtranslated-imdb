I watched SEA OF DUST at the Rhode Island Horror Film Festival in Providence. It was a movie that was presented at the festival, and I got the best picture that I think it's a few hundred records. The director and several stars answered questions after the performance. One star, Suzy Lorraine, was worse in person than in the movie, and she was charming in the movie. <br /> <br /> This film is independent, yet has a lot of film touches that give it a sense of quality. He even has a classical musical style. I'm a Savini fan and he's a steal thief in a black cloak, it's more of a bad power than a real person I think. He collects souls from people and uses them as soldiers in a twisted attempt to establish his version of God's Kingdom on Earth. In his opinion, Christ was suffering and Savini wanted to suffer. The main story of your interest is about the young doctor Stefan, who is sent to explore the strange events Savini causes in an isolated city. He suggests a noble cub on the way, but her father SOB tells him to get lost. Then she meets an oddly obsessed but seductive girl. I think he's going to fall in love with him, but he's also trying to kill him, just like a number of hot women in the movie. Scenes taken in the woods I found most beautiful and most engaging, with strange people along the road (the evil little twins scared me from hell). <br /> <br /> The movie has a lot to do, too much to list. There's a lot of blood, torture and gore. Hot chicks licking blood from boys fingers. Looks like a scary girl's head. That was unexpected. The throats get a slit. Some brutal stab. Then they sometimes play laughter, play the whole evil black forest genre a bit. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Hammer movies and Ingrid Pitt, it's fascinating to see her in this movie. She turns off one of the leaders by dipping the cross into the skull. Excellent. The one who played "Multiple Miggs" in Silence of the Lambs is great at fighting the ax. The film is unreal and ending, I'm not sure if the events happened, or if they were in Stefan's head for his rejection of his would-be fianc√©. He returns in revenge and the scene is brutal. The director also said that religion is being used for war and murder. I see that Savini's view of religion was scary. This was a strangely extraordinary movie with some stars like Savini and Pitt, lots of good support games including hot babes, great gore scenes, action, and all the time you're wondering what the hell is going on and what will happen next. It deserves ten stars because it is an excellent independent filmmaking effort, I don't think it was a low budget, but it had to be much smaller than the big studio budget, and yet they managed to do something really attractive, unique and provocative.
