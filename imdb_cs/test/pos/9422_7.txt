Beginning in 1942, Sherlock Holmes' character as portrayed by Basil Rathbone was set in then 'Modern' Britain. Many Holmes purists praised the first two entries in the series (produced by FOX), but rejected 12 features that followed. I have never been a passionate reader for one, so I appreciate these films because they are without any initial distortion. In fact, the setting of World War II for this entry places it as a season piece with British propaganda evident throughout the film. The execution of modern Holmes is handled with much more care than the previous record (Sherlock Holmes and the voice of terror) and fares far better for two reasons. First, Roy William Neil is on hand to drive (and would be for the rest of the series), and secondly, while Holmes is opposed to the Nazis, the inclusion of Professor Moriarty is a feeling that it's more of an intellectual battle between two opponents. . The performance of Lionel Atwill has been criticized by many as being far worse to that of George Zucco and Henry Daniel, but I feel if his more script than character interpretation. Especially after seeing that Atwill was very capable of being much more diverse and excited in other horror roles. Basil Rathbone, on the other hand, is exceptional. She seems to be enjoying Holmes, but I'm blamed for it. For example: Introducing Holmes into Voice of Terror is trying hard to figure out how brilliantly intelligent Holmes is once he is on screen, while this film shows Holm's brilliant deductions, but also his flaws. Even at the top of Holmes, he initially has his upper hand, only to let his blood flow out of his body. Now there are several shortcomings in this film that I thought I might point out. First opening; Are the Germans too easily deceived? Maybe it's just me, but a book salesman just rolls into the bar, says he makes Tobel not just answer his door after weeks of hiding, but allowed him to come and then go with him for a walk? What!? Second, Tobel certainly seems to be all around him in danger. Leaving a secret bomb with brilliant scientists. Leaving a note with his fianc√©. Like what he thought? He threatened them all. I thought he was a great scientist trying to save England? And it's not the whole concept of "applying to them before they apply it to us" a bit cruel. Apparent propaganda. Thirdly, how did God assume that Holmes would fit in the bottom of his chest? It's really small! In fact, the entire execution of Holmes, who discovered Moriarty in ex-camouflage, does not explain itself well. I've seen this movie for over fifty times and there are still parts I found in a very confusing design. Fourth, well, Holmes finds out that the first three scientists are dead, and then immediately assumes that Moriarty couldn't know the name of the fourth man because he wasn't dead yet. If Holmes didn't know the name, how could he suppose that? The guy could have been very well facing down into the lake. Happy Tip. Fifth, again with confusion. When Holmes reportedly dies on Moriarty's operating table, how can he recover so quickly? Certainly he acted as if he'd lost a few pints of blood, but not enough to stop him from saving the day. Despite these mistakes, it's a very funny movie. Disguises are well done, the secrets of dancing men are well done (especially the backstage scenes of Holmes and Moriarty, each of whom figured they analyzed them), and Dennis Hoey as Inspector Lestrade is always a plus. And last but not least, I am concerned about the scene of questioning, I always thought it was one of the most interesting sequences in the whole movie. Overall, this film has a special place with me because it was the one that solidified my Rathbone as an obsession with Holmes. Classics. 7/10.
