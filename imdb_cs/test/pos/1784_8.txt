The three brutal and distant lives of individuals intersect with the brutal killing of one another. A one-time film reveals only an event that unites three individuals together after half the film. I saw other segments of the "Decalogue", but it hit me as the weakest in the dialogue and yet the most fascinating in the structure. The film opens with a law that practices a false defense of defense for men accused of murder. The same arguments must have been repeated by a man as a full-fledged lawyer, but that never appears on the screen (at least in a short 1-hour version of Decalogue 5). We are ready to imagine that that was the case. The cab driver, who is misanthrope, has two aspects of his character: a good party feeds a manga dog, carefully cleans the cabin, raises dirty rags thrown by people who lack a sense of civility, and remembers his wife in dying; the bad side scares small poodles, refuses to go on drunk - probably worried about being thrown up in the cabin - and ogles by pretty girls. A repulsive protagonist who murdered without mercy, dropped stones from bridges on fast moving traffic and pushed strangers into urinals without any provocation, is also a man who can laugh at innocent young girls. Kieslowski's film and screenplay thus present the good and bad side of two of the three main characters. However, the film is not about the death penalty but about the treatise on killing. The fifth commandment "You will not kill" is explored theologically - ("Even God saved Cain ..."), the sociologically tenderness of the brethren's kindness to children and poor dogs, and psychologically (after the drunken night with a male friend) that led to his accidental death. the nurse whose photo he is bringing) What causes ordinary people to turn into killers - that is never fully explained, but the proposals are legions. Kieslowski is a pattern in which events and people are connected in a cosmic sense (note the similarity of a clown to a murderer hanging from a cabin mirror). Kieslowski and a young idealist lawyer seem to be asking us to they looked at the commandments literally and figuratively - why do we kill? Are people legally killed really badly? Is there any power out of society (drunken night that has led to the life of a girl) that makes us repugnant killers? There will be a forest for trees to discuss two det of killing in the film - both without mercy. The film invites the viewer to wonder why God asked us not to kill us. <br /> <br /> I understand that Kieslowski created a longer version of the movie. But even this short 1-hour version is superb with its bleak and sparse scenario, intelligent editing, exciting cinematography and top-notch, which provides much more than just the sum of its parts. <br /> <br /> This segment assumes healthier Decalogs 6.7 and 8.
