This is a teen movie and while u watches expect some pointless things added here and there, but overall the film is effective very effective that gives you a question and leaves you thought the story is a little far pulled but is believable and makes you good feeling in sequences, its not like its usual and tried way. the characters are pretty well defined and convincing. Justin long stands out among all the others and notices his speech. In the end he convinces someone with this expression that he is simply brilliant in this speech. He needs to take on some more serious roles, he is worth more than just teen movies. etch this movie and get liberated
