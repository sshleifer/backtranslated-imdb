This film was really different from what I had imagined, but I still exceeded my expectations. This film has exactly the right mix of comedy, drama, political criticism and satire (not necessarily in that order). Without being haughty or wisenheimer, he reveals the open and subtle problems of our capitalist democratic society of high technology. This will make you laugh instantly and stay in your thoughts. For those of you who liked the "wag dog" and wanted to have humane and manlike politicians this movie should definitely be the choice! "politicians are a lot like diapers: they should be changed often and for the same reasons."
