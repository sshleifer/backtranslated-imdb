An intense, dark action drama with unusually rich support from Casey, Keith, et. al, many of whom have the best roles of their career and run with it. The film is strangely shaped - often the action slows down to allow the characters to be captured in strange but well-executed seemingly improved dialogues - during the negotiation, almost all "machines" get caught up in perfectly delivered humorous monologues - and Reynolds director deserves credit that Reynolds' step back and give them peace. And unlike most action movies, you really like the characters who do the other half, when their different fates develop, unusually affect. The combination of character development, brutal violence, jazz soundtrack (Tarantino has to be a fan - watch this and then "Jackie Brown" and see what I'm talking about) makes this occasionally flawed movie (The Bad Boys are a little melodramatic) one of the better modern cops in my mind superior to many overrated modern noirs such as "body heat" and such.
