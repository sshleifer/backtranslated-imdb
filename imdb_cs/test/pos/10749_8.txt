This production was quite a surprise for me. I absolutely love the obscure 1930s movies, but I wasn't ready for the last 25 minutes of this story. If you're not convinced in the first half, hang up there for the finals. Of course, you have to look at blatant racism as being purely current. A fascinating viewing experience, but I think PAW CATEGORY is not yet available on video / DVD. Watch your PBS listings!
