Uzak (2002), a Turkish film depicted in the US as "Distant", directed, produced, written and filmed by Nuri Bilge <br /> <br /> Ceylan. This movie is a bold and dark version of the clash between "urban mouse", Mahmut, played by Muzaffer Özdemir, and "country mouse", Yusuf, who plays Emin Toprak. Both men are great actors and the storyline allows them to show their acting skills. (Tragically, Emin Toprak died in a car accident shortly after the film was finished.) <br /> <br /> In most countries of cousins ​​and urban cousins, the contrast between rural and urban lifestyles is shown in a humorous way. There is little humor or even heat in this movie. Both men have lost contact with human society. Mahmut's work as a commercial photographer for a tiled company does not give him satisfaction. He divorced a woman he still clearly loves and has no satisfactory human relationships. Mahmut lost his job due to the closure of a factory in his small town I don't have the skills or the energy to find work in the city. His human interactions are primarily limited to the silent observation of other people crossing his path. He is clearly a warm and caring person, but he cannot express these qualities in an urban environment. Siblings don't touch the world too much and don't match each other. Nor does it seek to act in a way that provides the opportunity for union or proximity. In a sense, this film shows a waste of opportunity. It is possible that every cousin could bring at least part of what was missing in the life of another. Instead, he runs parallel unfortunate courses. Both men are all along the length, which is the title suggested by the film. One of my friends mentioned Ceylan's masterpiece of detailing details. These details finally tell us more about the characters than we could learn by simple exposure. Uzak was introduced as part of the Rochester Labor Film series. It is not a "working film" in the traditional sense of the genre. It is a working film because it shows the harmful effects of disappointing work (Mahmut) and unemployment (Yusuf). <br /> <br /> It's a quiet, immersive, dark movie. While that doesn't mean it's a happy viewing, I came out of the theater <br /> <br /> where I realized I saw a really creative and <br /> <br /> important movie. This movie is worth discovering and seeing!
