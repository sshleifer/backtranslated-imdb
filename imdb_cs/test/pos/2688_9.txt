I think the problem with this show didn't get the respect it really deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld, after ELR and after Friends. These three sitcoms were stellar shows of their time. KOQs came at the end of this special time on TV. But don't be discouraged from you. The Queen of Queens is as good, if not better, than two of the three mentioned. Seinfeld's all started and has been a timeless classic. I've never been as strong as in Seinfeld. But KOQs comes really close. When it comes to laughter, I just have to evaluate KOQs second only to Seinfeld. ELR must be in second place because character creation and interaction is more cute. KOQs is in any case the best ten in the past 20 years. The only other sit system mention now is two and a half men who really don't have a candle for the other four, but there is everything we left.
