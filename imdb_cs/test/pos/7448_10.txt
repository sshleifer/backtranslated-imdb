I'll start with a disclaimer: This movie is NOT recommended to anyone who is not interested or never played FF7 before watching. The film relies on viewers' knowledge of each character in the game to convey story elements. And it does it very gently. Do your homework before you watch this amazing piece of CG movie and I promise it will be much better. <br /> <br /> With this in mind, this movie has some of the most remarkable CG sequences I've ever seen. The whole experience felt like an extra long FMV sequence from the game, on steroids. Yeah. The attention to detail in every scene, especially in those heavy events, is so perfect that I have a sense of respect. quality animation more than music. Again, for those who are familiar with the FF7 story and background, music should not surprise anyone (although the timing and location of each original soundtrack accompanies each scene and mood to the point that music simply improves animation). Br /> <br /> Once again, I only played once through FF7, I enjoyed this piece of art from Square Enix. And that is the feeling in most scenes, choreographed and organized. Like dancing. <br /> <br /> In short, if you enjoyed music or Final Fantasy 7, this movie will throw you out of the water. If you are in the most unfortunate majority who have not experienced the goodness known as FF7 on the PlayStation or PC, it will allow an exponentially greater experience before watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally I want to note the quality of this movie's animation. The characters move smoothly. Every background of the scene comes to life and tells its own story. For those who criticize the thinness and dependence of the story, I ask you to rethink the animation. Face response, subtle footprints that bring another level of fun over the typical way of telling the story of delivery. Enix Square and Big Tetsuya Nomura set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling. Advent children have introduced a new era for CG animation, allowing the subtleties that lie in every character to speak loudly and alone. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Square Enix. Waiting was worth it.
