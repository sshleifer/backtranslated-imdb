It's an action movie that makes me feel very calm and relaxed every time I see it. The film (short to its conclusion) shows that it is still possible to win in the face of extreme fluctuations. <br /> <br /> This movie is very refreshing and will probably be banned at any time. Get a copy before the police burn every copy they find. They don't want you to have a chance for the future, or they thought you had a chance. On the other hand, if political correctness could not suppress it, it would be an excellent video to be released on DVD. Such a release could include interviews with the writer and director and related goodness. I'm sure he would sell some copies, and I'd be one of the first to buy it. <br /> <br /> - Minck
