This movie is all Tenacious D fans can hope for. Director Liam Lynch works with "D" to mix epic proportions. Of course you must understand Tenacious D's humor and format. When I saw it, there wasn't much laughter from the audience, but the reason is not a lack of humor or smart jokes. This film seems to have been published on an unsuspecting public who has not known the music duo. This film remains true to the roots. For some of you who have seen the HBO TV series and heard the album, they have not forgotten what their audience loves. Like the TV show, people from the trailer noticed the JB and KG housing scenes and, of course, the Mic nights opened, which every Tenacious D episode would start and end. The soundtrack is phenomenal and every song blows you away. And Dave Grohl plays a fantastic devil. This is the perfect movie for those looking for a hard time and rocking musical.
