The relationship between the main characters that I thought was very realistic. As these two ends are involved, it is believable. It doesn't have a whole "oh yeah" that most Hollywood movies. We don't even mention how they captured the sexy, beautiful and painful side of the horizontal bar. I am a trapeze student and I like that they showed how hard it is on the body, hands and yeah those burns are brutal! Certainly he must see the relationship as well as the art that is in the film. I loved it! I am happy with how the movie ended, but I definitely wanted to see more. Make sure you stay seated through credits for special hehe treatment. Great scene!
