A 1930 comedy secret about "The Crooked Circle" band with hooded crooks who embarked on a plot to murder someone who swore against them. A pleasant but truly unprecedented little movie, the film works simply because the cast led by Zaza Pitts and James Gleason (both later appeared together in several Hildegard Withers films after Edna Mae Oliver from the series) and supported a great cast of actors and actresses you know, but doesn't need to know the name (that's why I don't have a lack of naming). The film is full of brisk hours, the film does not make sense with faulty identity, secret passages, scary music and people who seem to be. It's the perfect thing for a dark and stormy night or late night observation when it's nostalgic for a late late show.
