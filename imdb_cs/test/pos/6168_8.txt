I came out of the feeling of "Dark Blue World" (sigh) "so sad", but it was definitely a movie that needs to be done, and it's really well done from the Czech Republic. It's fun despite the "sad" assumption. It is full of feelings, sticking and undeniably true friendship between two leading figures - one of the first lieutenant pilots (Ondřej Vetchý as Franta) and a young and keen novice pilot (Kryštof Hádek as Karel), an inevitable love triangle and now and then a reminder of grim prison situations in Czechoslovakia in the 1950s. It is all in one movie that was written by the father of screenwriter and son director Zdeněk and Jan Sverák (previous success was beloved "Kolya"). It's not as long as "East-West" (French "Est-Ouest"), which was a heartbreaking, multi-layered story about a returning Russian doctor and sick French wives after World War II in Russia. The story "Dark Blue World" is quite straightforward and has a loose light humor. Music, songs from World War II England sang in Czech, modest special effects of pilots and air crafts in the sky - not worked out as Hollywood - no need for bing, bang, boom all the time air battle scenes are depicted. Sadness was explained in advance at the beginning (two paragraphs in English) and packaged in subsequent paragraphs. The film is not entirely subtitled, only when translating Czech interviews - the rest is in English, whether it is a very British or Czech accent. (So ​​it is a foreign English-language film and includes British actors.) <br /> <br /> Three major performances, especially two Czech pilots, have been beautifully released. There are nuances between the two, even if it is steadily mature vs. eagerly young. I always appreciate Tara Fitzgerald: yes, there is "Brassed Off" 1996 opposite Ewan McGregor and Pete Postlethwaite; he remembered her from Hear My Song 1991 opposite Adrian Dunbar and Ned Beatty; opposite Hugh Grant in "Sirens" 1994 and "The Englishman who went uphill and came down to the mountain" 1995, in addition to her appearances in the mini-series PBS Masterpiece Theater. 'So sad' - the fact that heroes defending their country can be so ill fated and so long (40 years). Thank God for precious memories and friendship prints unforgettable. Therefore, is there a pause for a ray of sunshine through the glass glass window (ironic or accidental that it is the church where the hard work took place) - symbolic hope, you never give up? More recent movies to tell stories: "Kandahar" (with Nelofer Pazira as Nafas Canadian from Afghanistan, who embarks on a trip to Kandahar with respect to a personal "mission") more than meets the eye for Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf. "Everything has come together" (with Radha Mitchell as the new mother facing SID - the sudden death of a child), the Swiss film director Marc Forster's dedicated film and his much-spoken controversial movie "Monster's Ball" with Halle Berry, Billy Bob Thornton and Peter Boyle. Check out movies without any previous expectations or comparisons with movies before. Just see it.
