How can someone DARE say something BAD about this movie? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets every time you look at him. <br /> <br /> When I first saw it, I was screaming out of the laughter. It's all funny. While "Robin Hood: Men in Stockings" is not my favorite comedy ("Real Genius"), it's up there in my book. So look! If you don't spend the whole time laughing, then at least you'll spend your time drooling over Cary Elwes.
