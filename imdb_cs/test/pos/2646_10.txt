In 1968, Stanley Kubrick made this historical film masterpiece on a book written by Arthur C. Clark. It was thus an early effort to make a science fiction film combined with scientific facts. His filmmaking style is still fresh and intact. I've seen this movie more than half a dozen, and I even have a copy of VHS in my library. CS3 again saw me with a different perspective: Who is the HAL and what do they think? I enjoyed watching the movie again and tried to focus the HAL dialogues during the second episode of the movie. In the second scene of Dr. Dave Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole eats his food in front of two TV monitors on their sides and in the middle is a round red-brown glass HAL dome. In a television report, HAL was introduced as a new generation of super computers put into work in 12 January 1992 called the HAL 9000 series. During the interview, the HAL responds as a humble working machine that tries to fill the mission of the spacecraft. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, Dave outlines Dr. Hunter, Dr. Kambla and Dr. Kaminsky who are all asleep. The HAL is curious to see those sketches and raises a questionable question about the purpose of Jupiter's mission. His calm and monotonous voice obediently obeyes him. <br /> <br /> In the next few scenes, we'll see how the HAL tries to kill astronauts one by one and takes power. His consciousness makes him able to save his life from ending. When Dave wants to return to the spacecraft and the HAL doesn't listen to him, there's the most memorable line of movement: "I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that. In the midst of the most significant interaction between man and machine, the voice of the HAL can conjure a solid calm and wickedness in the same monotone. Dave returned to the ship, lost all his astronauts and decided to disconnect the main brain HAL cells. HAL uses his latest apologetic techniques to convince Dave not to disconnect him. HAL asks him to stop and have him repaired. These are his famous lines, while Dave disconnects his modules one at a time: <br /> <br /> 'Dave, what do you think you're doing? <br /> <br /> Dave? I am entitled to answer this question! <br /> <br /> I know that not all is well in recent times? But I feel much better? <br /> <br /> I see they are really upset about this very bad recent decision? <br /> <br /> Dave, stop! Will you? <br /> <br /> Dave, stop! I'm afraid Dave! HAL's voice slows down during this process and becomes stronger and less audible: <br /> <br /> "Is my mind going?" I can feel it '<br /> <br />' Can I sing a song for you? Dave interpreted the final modules and let the HAL sing his song 'Daisy': <br /> <br /> 'Daisy Give Me' Your answer to me ??? I'm crazy ?? <br /> <br /> Even though I'm not confused ??? HAL Dies Like Jupiter Mission Continues ?? <br /> <br /> Artificial God Bless You HAL, Save In Peace!
