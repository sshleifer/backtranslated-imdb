"Witchery" is a decent little horror yarn! David Hasselhoff is pretty damn funny about this, and unfortunately he's one of the better actors. Linda Blair is downright horrible and the lady who plays Hoff's wife ... is badly bad! The story of this movie is also ridiculous. There's some holes you can't help but notice, but it remains fun all the time. Gore in "Witchery" is crazy superb. I loved the part where the old bag gets "sucked" into the trash slip and ends up in the baking chimney! And the part in which the "evil" lady "mined" was pretty damn disturbing. I'd say this is a necessity for gorehounds. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an overproduced, well-functioning movie, look elsewhere. But if you like the old-style style of Italian sleaze and over the top gore, "witchcraft" belongs to the shelf. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised by the low ratings here! What did you expect, "Exorcist?" 7 out of 10, children.
