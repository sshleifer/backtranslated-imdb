Peter Strauss, according to the nature of appearing in mini-TVs and films made for television, often receives an unfairly high proportion of bad reviews - usually from casual observers who have seen ten minutes of film and half channel over it. Well, I read all the other 20 reviews for this movie and I'm glad I don't see a single bad word about The Jericho Mile - That should be enough to get the movie !! Peter Strauss won Emmy for his role in this film and watched it once more to show you why it deserves so much .... <br /> <br /> When I wanted to be objective , I tried to criticize this movie. Instead, I found myself arguing with each one of my possible thread-choices. This is true realistic film making. This is not your typical Hollywood sensationalism where everything is overworked - it is a realistic and true life that people thought was based on a real event !!
