When I was in the 10th grade me and my friend were late in his house and turned around the cable and started watching this movie. We watched it because it looked a little funny and because it had a breast. But then the end came and we sat there without a word. I think that after a minute of tracking credits, he just kind of whimpered, "Oh, dude ..." He goes so fast from a silly 80-year-old sexual comedy to nihilistic realism that he catches you guards. I've been trying to rent this movie for years and I couldn't find it - and nobody has ever seen me, except me and my friend - that's what it looks like. But now available! I highly recommend to rent it and recover.
