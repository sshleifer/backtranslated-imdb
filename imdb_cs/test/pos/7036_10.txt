I don't know what Dirty Dancing is all about .. there is some absolute magic in this movie .. I can't tell hundreds (yes, hundreds) of the times I watched, start ending .. But every time I get on TV, I'm Enthusiastic and mystified and sit down and there are two hours loving the movie as if I was watching it for the first time. Although Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray hated each other during the making of this film, they have beautiful chemistry on the scene. The viewer enjoys much more to see this passion and commitment. Help tear a little bit at the end when Patrick comes to the Houseman family and tells his father: "Nobody wants a baby in the corner". (classic moment) For all those people who believe this movie is scaly and content, maybe as it is, but it was a penicle of the 80s, and put Patrick Swayze on the map; his performance was spotless. Three Cheers for Dirty Dancing !! Ps-Soundtrack is a fantastic, absolute masterpiece
