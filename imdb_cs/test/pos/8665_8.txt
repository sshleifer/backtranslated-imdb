It would seem that we should recognize the Scandinavian cinema as more than the Dogma 1995 movement that brewed Danish all these years. Brysomme Mannen, or The Bothersome Man in English, is a surreal and deeply thought-out film, yet deeply entertaining and rich in content on the surface and below the surface. As a film itself, it is a comedy about society and attitudes in the postmodern world we live in; the world judging by the Harassing Man has reached the areas of Norway and the like. But along with this black comedy, it would seem that the film is going somewhat deeper and raises questions, at least for me, the metaphorical religious spaces and our human instincts that want to reveal the truth among so many materials in our world, Maybe it feels strange. This was actually a fantastic introduction to contemporary Norwegian cinema. The film very much falls into this category of European art cannon with deep themes and ambiguous veiled atmosphere while maintaining an open finale and not as much a story as a process of events that can mean one thing or another. So many times we've seen movies that use The Bothersome Man adopts and so many times that it becomes an almost predictable routine that revolves around a detective story or a story of persecution or something like that, but this movie allows it to be set up he acted as a mere background for his protagonist, named Andreas (Fausa Aurvaag) to explore who he is; where he is and what are the possible mysteries behind this placement are indeed. <br /> <br /> The setting I am talking about means the hero arrives in a place without a previous memory or what happened before that. I will jump right in and say that it is, in my opinion, dead and sent to some purgatory, just like all the inhabitants of the city. Everyone in the city with whom Andreas mixes is of the same age; The same mentality and the same attitude suggest that most of them are victims of their own suicide and have been sent to purgatory without any emotions, feelings, colors or mainly pain. When we meet Andreas for the first time, he gets off the bus, which he later reveals, is mysterious in his abilities and is approaching a gas station in the middle of a rural area. He is ugly and has a huge beard, but soon he will be the opposite, a sports suit and tie; the clean shaved face and home of his own complete with a new work in which the film makes one of the best shifts between the countryside and the city I've ever seen. But the new work, like the new city, is unpleasant; you can take breaks whenever you want; bosses are unusually kind and there seems to be no emotion or reaction to anything. These ideas are best reflected in the cinema when Andreas, still a relative newcomer to the city, is crying and clearly influenced by the film at the show, but everyone else is watching in stone style. There is also an initial example when one man jumped out of the window and lies impaled on some spikes, but all walk without fuss. Backing up my idea to all those who are already dead and the city acts as a cleansing agent is death and harm in general impossible. There is a particularly ugly scene involving electronic guillotine paper and one's thumb, but every reaction to the event is a stone face and it grows back in an hour. Similarly, a suicide attempt that includes trains later has nothing to do and instead we get a look at what it's like to be dragged down the route with invulnerability on your side. The city acts as a barrier, a painless society in which the masochistic need for self-harm is impossible; a place where sexual relationships can occur and disintegrate as well, but both for less emotional and without passionate circumstances; a place where people can try to commit suicide, but it can't really die. The city accepts these powers because the damage has already been done in "real life," and so the film says you can't kill twice, you really can't feel the pain or emotion in the afterlife purgatory. But the best movie is the one that sneaks at you. Judging by the final five minutes of the film and the side story that opens up some music coming from another man's house, it seems that there is a thin line between the spaces that the film defines as "heaven" and "hell." Do we see these spaces very, very briefly? so briefly that they consist of a single shot. "Heaven" is a colorful kitchen with music and children: it offers life, hope, emotion and happiness, while hell is a snowy place that chases you through its hopeless build and frightening cut off. The introduction of these two spaces at the very end of the film informs you of the reality of Andreas et al. face to face: purgatory and everything that came to it, the afterlife just wasn't ready for Andreas and his freethinking, adventurous mind? and see where the thinkers will end.
