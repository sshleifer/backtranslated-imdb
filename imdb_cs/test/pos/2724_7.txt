15 Park Avenue Aparna Sen is a film about the nature of reality. A young, deceptive girl, prone to introducing things and hearing voices, perhaps out of boredom, is an educated father and a well-educated older sister educated as schizophrenic. Controlled, sad and treated as invalid (though out of love and affection) the spirit has a chance to develop as a normal person. When the boy offers to marry her, her father and step-sister are passionately trying to convince him of such a move. Traumatic experience, mainly due to protected existence, will finally take it across the line without return and live full-time in its own vicious world. The family and society around her do not tolerate her delusions and want to suppress them with drugs, electric shock therapy, anything, even if they have all their own delusions. Her mother sees no irony in letting the spirit-buster treat her from heresies. Her half-sister is a physics professor who teaches, among other things, quantum mechanics, an object in which a stream of professionals accepts parallel multi-universes and many other dimensions in the universe than we see. A friend recounts with admiration the experience of a holy man who claims to hear hallucinatory voices. Far, George W. Bush has real or false delusions of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction and is allowed to invade Iraq. As some viewers have pointed out, Aparna Sen avoided attacking the mother of all heresies - religions that are in the flow, which is a shame. In other words, the accepted reality is what most or influential minorities believe. This was the case from the beginning and much more powerful people than Mithali in the film, among them Bruno and Galileo, suffered as a result. The controversial and difficult ending of the film had to be shown as a film about the nature of reality, not a case study of a schizophrenic girl. <br /> <br /> All the casts did a great job, but Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma excelled. Aparna Sen created an excellent philosophical film.
