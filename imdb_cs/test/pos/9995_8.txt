As you know, "The biggest game ever played" is about golf. I used to snoop over the dramatic title, but thanks to the great visual depiction attributed to director Bill Paxton (better known for his acting in Twister and the hilarious supportive roles in Aliens and True Lies), we find that it is more important than Though the film is about It seems that sport is just a framework for what really happens.

Despite the hate of the superior class "gentlemen," it was undeniable that Francis had a gift. His father's courage was played by Elias Koteas (Sugartime, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), who thought that playing a game would never improve their poor living conditions.

A golf fan or not, you will appreciate the film for its beauty and its reminder that the cinema can be a great medium that tells you any story.
