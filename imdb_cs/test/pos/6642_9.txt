I watched this movie on the big screen a few months ago. I didn't know exactly what to expect, and for the first ten minutes I was afraid I wouldn't like this movie. It started very slowly, in silence and almost banality, which was all the less exciting that the sound was pretty bad and the subtitles could never be read. But I'm sure I don't regret that I continued watching it. It is one of the most beautiful Bergman movies I've ever seen, human, ruthless and psychologically convincing. I rarely saw the actor play so amazingly with their intensity on their faces: Liv Ullman's interpretation is unforgettable and Sydow is also excellent. There is always psychological violence in Bergman's films, and that can make them the most physically violent. The tense relationship between man and woman evolves in parallel with the physical violence that surrounds them ... Finally, this sober, violent and powerful film contains surprisingly remarkable human depth. Excellent Bergman. <br /> <br />
