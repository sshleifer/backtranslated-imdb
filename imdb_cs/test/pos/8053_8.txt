I was born in 1946, when I first saw this film, I had about eight years and left a deep impression. It's not just scary, because the lack of a better word haunts me for more than 50 years. The only scene that disappeared in my 50s in those 50 years was the murder of a little girl and a staunch policeman who referred to her as a "little n ----- child". Recently on TV, maybe there are two versions of the movie or someone has felt compelled to change a bit of that heart breaking scene. That state may seem extreme, but there is a little more to the story. When the movie was recently revealed it was clearer why I was chased for years. ThThis film is said to have been created only one or two years after the depicted incidents that contribute to its realistic credibility. Horror in the film is not provided by creatures or space aliens, but by people living in our society at the time. : Recent monitoring has helped to clarify the impact on my 8-year-old mind. When this film was the only school I ever visited, mostly African-Americans attended. The victim looked like a girl in my class, it was like seeing a real killing. It's a scary scene that much worse. Maybe no one will find this evaluation helpful, but it helped me.
