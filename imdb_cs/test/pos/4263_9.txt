Jarl and Moodysson are part of a dying breed of political filmmakers. The Swedish population should appreciate their efforts to uncover the truth when the government and the media are actively distorting and obscuring the events surrounding the EU meeting in Gothenburg. It is utterly heartbreaking to see how these innocent children have been abused and intoxicated by the Swedish police and sentenced to political trials for sending text messages and for revenge for other acts. The only unfortunate thing about this movie is that it won't reach the wide masses in Sweden because it will only be shown to theaters and will not be posted on video or broadcast on television. Political film is important as it can bring new perspectives and look into complex issues and play a role as a mass educator.
