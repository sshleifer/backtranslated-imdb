It's been a long time since this original, quite funny, black comedy has appeared. If "Eating Raoul" on your top 100 list, do yourself a favor and find "Betty Business" immediately. The theme of death is humorous was attempted before (see Paul Bartel and Mary Woronov in the "Martyr Academy"). While the movie has some brilliant moments of black comedy, "Business Betty" is much more stable, with better casting. Who could imagine a business being a breeding ground for an original, uplifting and heartfelt comedy? I was surprised and you will be too. I highly recommend seeing "Business Betty" - MERK
