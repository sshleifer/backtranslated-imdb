In 1850 in Yorkshire, a chimney sweep boy is falsely accused of stealing his crooked master and running away. He falls into a treacherous local river and is transported to the underwater empire, where he makes many friends and rescues the mythical Water Kids from the evil shark. Based on Charles Kingsley, this is a beautiful children's film, half-live action and half-animation, which is both grim and evocative of the display of the Victorian era and the amazingly fun underwater adventure. It is really two films in one that somehow complement and combine into a much richer whole. The animation of Tony Cuthbert, Jack Stokes and Miroslaw Kijowicz is amazing as well as photos of Ted Scaife and music Phil Coulter and Bill Martin. Pender has great rough diamond quality as a (literal) fish from water - I love the moment it is at the top of the estate, seeing all the chimneys and shouts "Blimey !!" at the top of your voice. Mason and Cribbins are the dirtiest, worst chicane you might hope to see in a costume drama (if you want to see true Victorian values, don't follow Sense And Sensibility, watch it), and Whitelaw, Pertwee (who makes honorable voices) and Percival are excellent. This is how a good children's movie should be - good old singalong fun, but also a little thoughtful, sad and scary. Tall Cockallorum !!
