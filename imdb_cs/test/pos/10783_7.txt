I chose this movie for my husband who works in radio. I thought it would be more of a movie that he would like and should apply to, even though it was from the 1980s - so it was a little dated. This movie really pulls you in. Sometimes you just want to strangle the host, Barry. Sometimes you just want to send some of the bigots who call a real concentration camp. Sometimes you really apologize to Barry because he really knew he was too big for his jeans if you know what I mean. It was on a dramatic channel on Encore, so I think it's a real story. If you really love dramas, you will love it, even if you don't know what the broadcast intentions are. If you are an Alec Baldwin fan and you watch him to see him, you shouldn't. Part of it is really part of this movie.
