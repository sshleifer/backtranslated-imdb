He just finished this impressively charming affair, and while I can't say how good it was as I pretended to be in my mind, it was still effective and over time enough a nasty piece of brain distorted and misogyny powered J-Waste. His story tells of a bad gal searching for her sister who breaks down to get raped and dazed by the Yakuza scumbags, and a helpful lady doctor who sets out to avenge her, makes it in a bizarre fearsome fashion after a similar rape and drug attack. Yeah, and there is also a bit of straightforward sex, unfortunately, its soft core, according to Japanese disagreement under belt nudity, but pixelation is minimal, in fact it is really only noticeable on a cheerful scene. Although writer / director Kazuo "Gaira" Komiz fails to create a particularly convincing story, it is at least quite a scuzzy thing, diving early into the dirt well with quite disturbing rape (worse the fact that gal looks a little young, though I'm sure it's age ). Also, for the most part it's pretty professional looking stuff, maybe not stylish, but it has some talent and content is handled reasonably well, with specific kudos for largely avoiding having to use a lot of pixellation. Things are mostly sex / rape based about two-thirds of the sharp runtime and its quite observable, if the grooves on such fare, it gets a little numb after a while, but the ladies are easy on the eye and it is reasonably rough at times. The music, by YÃ´ichi Takahashi, is sometimes effective, though hardly a key part of the show, which he does in several places, completes the action neatly, in any case enough to notice. More important are the effects that Nobuaki Koga appearing are wrapping up an impressive spray wound when they appear, helping the crazy nature of the climactic Shenanigans. Things even pull to the curiously influencing end, sure it's not crying or anything, but for a movie that's for most of its run, it's pretty engaging. Overall, it is a very entertaining detour for the average brave fans of garbage, especially those who are keen on Japanese adventures. I really could do with a longer part of revenge and more gore, maybe more point / brain but hey, it was watching me and it's pretty nicely stocked with unforgettable wtf moments. So if you dig this kind of degenerate spam, it's probably worth your time, maybe don't expect a second coming.
