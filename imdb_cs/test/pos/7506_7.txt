PLOT SPOILERS !!!! Dr. Boch (George C. Scott) is Head of Medicine at NYC Main Hospital. He left his wife, his children denied him, is impotent, drinks a lot and considers suicide. Roaming also in the hospital. Then he meets BIG strange Barbara (Diana Rigg) and falls in love. He wants him to run away with her - but can he completely give up his old life and start a new one? A very special movie with the Oscar-winning screenplay of Paddy Chayefski. It represents a suicidal main character and shows us a hospital full of overworked nurses and doctors who is incapable. It does (somehow) make it seem pretty funny. It's not laughter loud humor - it's very black humor. Also the goal is fine - Scott is just great (and nominated for an Oscar). You see how he tries to keep common sense in an absolutely crazy situation. Riggs's character is more than a little strange, but her kind of way works and is incredibly beautiful. The scenario is strong and brutal - but never too much. I think at the end he smokes a ball and a situation that goes too high, but worth seeing. If it were done quite seriously, it would probably not be possible. See also Katherine Helmond in a small piece and Stockard Channing and Christopher Guesta in unrecognized bits. Personally, I had a problem taking it seriously. From what I heard hospitals, that was already bad in the 1970s, but not anymore. Look at acting and script. I give it 7.
