ROCK STAR is a well-narrated rendition of a Hollywood-style story based on the fact that Ripper was a replacement for Rob Halford for Judas Priest. Mark Wahlberg poured on his sympathetic boy-ish magic and played with believably admirable, something he was known to do since the release of BOOGIE NIGHTS. Stephen Herek, no stranger to music-themed films, takes the audience's wonders of the wildlife lifestyle extinct, Hair-Metal Rock God. Wahlberg's "Izzy" acts as a guest movie starring anyone who gets to see their wishes. His likable character quickly wins over the audience's heart, who wants to see that he is successful and gets a chance to give him the "Metal Horn" hand sign several times. The only real story complaint is that the support cast, specifically the other band members, was not properly added or introduced. More interaction with these lifelong rock musicians would intensify and strengthen Izzy's new environment. <br /> <br /> ROCK STAR is naturally full of great music. Rabin's score, the original work of a steel dragon and lots of metal hits in the 80's make this soundtrack a must! Hopefully films like ROCK STAR will not only give credibility to the style of music that has helped define the generation, but has also provoked much needed recovery.
