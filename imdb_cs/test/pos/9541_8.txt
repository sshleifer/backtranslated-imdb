This almost perfect film rendition of the popular children's novel Edith Nesbit follows the lives of Robert (Bobbie), Phyllis and Peter and their mother after their father is unjustly accused of treason and sent to prison. Are they going to live in an almost uninhabitable house in a country that stands by the railway line? Mum writes stories to make enough money for food and candles, while kids spend most of their time around the railway station, waving specifically for one particular train to "send their love to their father." Characters that are always funny and clever are brought to life under the perceptive direction of Lionel Jeffries (better known as an actor with a subtle character). Jenny Agutter plays Bobbie while Sally Thomsett and Gary Warren are her sister and brother. Their mother is Dinah Sheridan, while other memorable figures are played by Bernard Cribbins (Perks Railroad-Man) and William Mervyn (Old Man on the Train). <br /> <br /> 'Rail Kids' is a gentle entertainment of a different age, but it does its job beautifully. Looking at how Bobbie grows up with fears of an absent parent who shoves his own needs, either alone or having fun, we can only rejoice when events at the end of the picture meet. In the meantime, do we have a sense of time and place? Whether it's from steam trains, university paper chases, or red flannelet petticoats that are worn by girls (and used to ward off disaster!).
