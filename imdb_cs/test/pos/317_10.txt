As I look at hundreds of comments that IMDB loyal readers have posted on this movie, it is very interesting to me how little, "middle of the way" comments are. Everyone loves him or hates him. When I saw the Apocalypse Now about 30 times and after the recent DVD dissection (how we have ever lived without these magical digital machines), I can safely say that I am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this movie. "Why would you like a movie that's so confusing?" ask many of my co-workers. The answer is: Forget the war, forget brutality .... This is the classic story of a society that protects itself from those who refuse to cope with the current state. Brando presents an individual who has his own way to do the job. (Big Brother) sent him to do it, doing it too well, without adhering to the accepted "standards" of death and destruction (I am the only one who is concerned about the fact that we have "norms" for death and destruction? so they send a "consensus police" out to remove the individual.Hmmmmmm .... Draw all the parallels between it and everything you see every day? With the deepest respect to Mr. Coppole, whom I believe is one of the best directors of all time, I think he has overstepped the film's original intent and probably didn't realize it until the film was released, with sub-subtle text that penetrates the whole film, too much to be planned and displayed; "Like some wild flower in the middle of the vegetable garden. I must repeat again: I think FF Coppola has done bang-up work on this whole production, as well as cast and crew, but the sum of the film goes beyond So if you haven't seen the movie, rent it, watch it, watch it again and maybe several more, and look at all the general parallels with everyday life. Only then decide on the quality of the film. Those of you who have seen it look at it again with the previously described way of thinking. I think you can have a whole new award for the film. Or maybe not! No matter whether you love it or hate it, be sure and give Coppola credit for his master story style!
