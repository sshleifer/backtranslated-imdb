I have read many different opinions and reviews of this film and understand why many people have mixed feelings about Ponyo, be it story, animation, dialogue and so on. And I believe that the easiest way to answer that is because it's a movie for a much younger age group. Age group much younger than Tonarina Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro). Being a Miyazaki fan like most surfers on this site, I was expecting amazing animation, musical composition, comprehensive storytelling. , a great constant development of characters, as the story blends with today's society, etc., etc. of the typical Miyazaki movie we grew up with. And to tell you the truth, I didn't quite understand what the hell was going to be about what the hell was going on, or what was happening within an hour and twenty minutes (with twenty minutes in the movie) that this movie was NO for deep thinkers and hard core Ghibli-ists, but for toddlers and young people and happy go happy Japanese. I also believe that this film is based on simplicity and creative animation; Direct Lawn Roots Ghibli Studios Style. The fact that the villain is not present really surprised me, except for the father and possibly the crazy typhoon. But besides, this movie is just fun; encourage young mind and make good time. That is all. The animation dates back to the mid-1980s at the age of Miyazaki's movies, where unlike Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke) and the other, he didn't focus much on detail. I admire the simplicity created by some little nostalgia when I first watched Ghibli movies as Tonarino Totoro when I was a kid. The reactions and movements of children are very similar to those of children, and many body language Studio Ghibli is very prominent. Studio Ghibli has added some creative moments and scenes that can only do with his amazing animators, but it probably won't have the Ghibli-ist ritual in wonder. The Japanese dialogue was also very child-friendly, and many scenes and dialogues are very, very relative to what Japanese children and mothers would say and act on. Music if it's very hoppy and "fluffy" I think you could say (like Totoro) from start to finish. Even the darker scenes didn't seem assertive. Finally, this film is of a kind. Almost every aspect of this film is for children. I waited 80 minutes to realize it. Frankly, I've never seen a movie that tells or shows how Miyazaki did. It is refreshing to see that Studio Ghibli can still tell a story for a wider and more different audience, and still retains the impression of Ghibli.
