Even though I haven't seen it yet, I know that Chaplin is a genius, and only one of his talents would be on this daring business - a Hitler comedy. All great satires are based on walks on the edge. Also, all great comedy deals with the other side - pathos. It seems that this film will bypass both sides. Like Kubrick's Dr. Strangel, even the Great Dictator, deals with history through a distorted lens of satire. The only way to deal with the horrors of this world is to laugh. And hopefully, through laughter, we can learn to perceive the world in a new light. Another film that comes to mind is Metro Emir Kusturica and Fando and Lis. Let me first look at the movie.
