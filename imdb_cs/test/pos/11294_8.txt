I saw 'Begotten' last night, and I mean two brains. On the one hand, I appreciate the fact that it is a total inverting of Michael Bay. No dialogue, immensely stylized grainy black and white photography, some of the coolest images ever made, and a very convincing use of sound (which no one else has ever thought) is a reflection on the subject and it dares to go where most filmmakers not only in terms of pictures, but production and conception. It's a movie that most people don't understand, and if you read these comments, you'll find a lot of people whose lack of ability to detect this film causes them to shout about "arrogance" with the zeal of Gibbon rattle at feeding time. It really shocked and disturbed me, and when it was last done, it was a while ago. half. I understand that in repetition and monolithic stimulation, artistic merit can be a bludgeon, but in this case it just doesn't help anything that hangs. Imagine a ragged man in the street approaching you, walking at your shoulders and saying something that totally confuses your core core ... but then, instead of letting his broken and crazy clusters in his wake, he just speaks and talking and talking. At the end of the movie I looked at my watch again and again. <br /> <br /> It's not fun, people. This is alienation. This is how you deprogram people who just watched "Glitter". If you watch movies to be fun, it will thwart, confuse, and possibly anger you. You don't have to approach 'Begotten' like the chocolate cake you want to eat because it tastes good. You approach him as something of a menu you've never heard of before, something you see in the kitchen door, something dark and shiny and twitching on a plate; Something you order not because it will taste good, but because you just need to know what it is.
