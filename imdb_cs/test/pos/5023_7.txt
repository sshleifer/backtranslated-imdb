Warm cordial flic depicting arch-angel Michael as a brawl, overweight, cigarette smoking slacker who loves dancing and a cavort with the opposite sex. However, he has a good side because he tries to bring things to the life of several burnt-out losers before he gets back to heaven. Funny, well-played film; very fun, though somewhat unwavering.
