I saw this film in his short run at the '69 House 'art house. I found it so funny that I literally spent part of the movie on the floor when I laughed so hard that I dropped out of my chair. In retrospect, a few years later, I thought Melvin Van Peebles did it. When I mentioned it to a friend, he said that his friend, Downey Sr., had virtually every idle role in the film: Director, Producer, Writer, etc. Of course he was right and my memory was bad, besides it was one of the movies funnies ever did. Part of the "Arab" was particularly invaluable.
