He always enjoyed the "DOA", a 1950s that played Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film. Dennis Quaid (Dexter Cornell) was a professor who loved his wife and eventually found himself having an affair with one of his students. Dexter joined Meg Ryan (Sydney Fuller), who was a high school student at the same time and was very excited about it and ended up with one night table and in some ways deeply loved him. Dexter learns that he got a drink that had bad content and caused him a lot of health problems! If you like Dennis Quaid and love Mega Ryan, you will enjoy this movie, Meg has done excellent performance and left this picture for attention!
