I have some great memories that follow "Robin of Sherwood" on TV as a child (but I think I've only seen Michael Praed's episodes for some reason). And recently my brother bought the new DVD-boxes of the complete series. It was great to see it again and it's the best of all Robin Hood movies and TV series. The cast is great and the location mixed with Clannad's music adds a very special feeling. Personally, I think Praed is the best of the two Robins, but Jason Connery was a great choice to continue the series. Ray Winstone, Nicolas Grace and Robert Addie are amazing in their roles as Will Scarlet, Nottingham Sheriff and Guy of Gisburne. It is a pity that the fourth season has never been done, and I have also heard that writer Richard Carpenter was actually planning to make a feature film after the series. Robert of Huntingdon (Connery) could finally marry Marion (Judi Trott), or maybe Herne Hunter could resurrect Robin of Loxley (Praed) and get revenge against the Sheriff. As mentioned earlier; if the producers of "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" would be smart, they would have gotten a cast from "Robin Sherwood", and made the film to a series sequel. As Ray Winstone puts it on DVD bonusmaterial, it would be great to see them as old men as well as in "Robin and Marian" Sean Connery. Who knows, maybe in the future we will succeed in a more perfect interpretation of the legend. In any case, we can watch our favorite series over and over again!
