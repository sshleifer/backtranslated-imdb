If you like Gary Cooper, it's one of his best roles. His subtle intensity to correct the mistake is what caused his career. "Blayde Hollister" comes to Dallas to avenge Will and Brian Malee, who burned his farm in Georgia and killed his family. Inept Marshall gets into Hollister's journey and tries to arrest him when a street shootout between Hollister and Wild Bill Hickock interrupted him. The shootout is set to get the law from Hollister, and he takes the "back east" of Marshall under his wing to keep him alive in Texas as they change identity. This was a great start and the picture is holding all the way. The event can be a bit "slow" to today's standards, but it's one of my top 10 movies.
