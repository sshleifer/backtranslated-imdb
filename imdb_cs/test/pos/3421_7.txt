POSSIBLE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Nobody is likely to find the Red Dust DVD without knowing it is the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa. Hilary Swank performs as a South African exile returning to her hometown as a lawyer representing Alexa Mponda (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of the South African Parliament who was tortured by a prison guard, Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), who seeks to escape prison by testifying to the Truth Commission reconciliation. They could certainly find an actress who has or could have imitated the South African accent; Mrs. Swank is not trying to cover her unmistakable American accent. However, she is the only known actor in the film, and it would probably not be made without her or anyone equally well known. Works with passage work. However, Ejiofer and Muller (pronounced in the German way with to die through "at") are excellent as is Jamie Barlett as police chief, responsible for the murder of Mpondo's comrade and fellow prisoner. Torture scenes are displayed in short flashes, but they are vivid and plausible. What is not believable is the Truth and Reconciliation process, except that it actually happened. "Red Dust" should only be seen for this reason because it was and is incredible that ANC prisoners could indeed forgive torturers, and that is as close as we will probably get to the process.
