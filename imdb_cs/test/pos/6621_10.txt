Being in the suburbs of New York when the Z-Boys were making history in Dogtown, I was only exposed to a glimpse of what was happening. I had a P-O-S Black Knight skateboard with clay wheels. It's long gone and a pile of ashes of my personal life. But I never forgot. It's like watching long-lost brothers and friends hit me where I live. I can't watch this movie enough. Every time I look at it, some other aspect rises up, some other point of view gets into a sharp focus. Historical footage, incredible photographs, contemporary personalities that blend with the lively shadows of a brightly lit past, a sincere and not overly-finished narrative, all created beautifully together to create a milestone in documentary film. American history. According to Glen Friedman - "It was incredible F-ing."
