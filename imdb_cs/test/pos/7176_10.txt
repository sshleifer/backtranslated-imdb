This is a document unlike others. It has so many layers and shows us so much that trying to analyze it at once is almost impossible. Documentary filmmaker William Greaves shows us the process of making a film from a different perspective. We see the fight of the actors, the director, the sound crew, and all the others trying to hang out and make the film successful. If it was just that the movie would be ordinary. What makes Greaves is to make it more complex by having a crew of actors movie, and then this will be filmed by another crew, only to have another crew movie the whole thing. Three cameras, each with a different target. It has an almost dizzying effect on you, but it is also exciting. I like the parts where the crew organizes together and discusses what's going on. Even they are somewhat in the dark of what Greaves is trying to do. Half see it as an experiment, while the other half sees it as a chaotic and confusing failure. No matter which side you choose, you cannot claim that Greaves did not engage you in this process.
