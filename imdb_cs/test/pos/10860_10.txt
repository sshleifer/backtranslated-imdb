I have nothing but praise for this mini series. It's only about a year and a half, but I've seen it twice; with more enjoyment a second time than the first. I'm seriously thinking about watching it soon, because I consider it spiritually uplifting. It's a very tender romantic drama with such beautiful performances, scenes, costumes, music and scenes that has a resonance that has placed it almost in the league of its own among the mini series. Some others have commented on the difficulties of living as a lesbian in Britain in the 1890s. There is nothing special about it; it was only male homosexuality that was against the law as poor Oscar Wilde experienced with his great cost and as a great loss for the literary world. By the way, I'll turn. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it's a necessary television. It is perhaps one of the greatest tragic romantic dramas by Romeo and Juliet, though not in the conventional sense. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 from me. <br /> <br /> JMV
