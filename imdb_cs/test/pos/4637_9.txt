I would like to watch this movie every time it was on the cable and never aged. Who can forget the best lines in film history? --- JOHNNY FAT BOY BURGERS !! JOHNNY FAT BOY BURGERS !! and FIND BETWEEN GIANT MELONS! I once wanted to run around the city as a fun treasure hunt. It's an ordinary fave and I'm glad it's on video! I'm sure that's where MTV got its original Road Rules prerequisite.
