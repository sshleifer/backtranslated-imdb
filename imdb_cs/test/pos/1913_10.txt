Dolemite is the deepest affection for me. It's all: a gang of karate prostitutes, Dolemite punching through the stomach of Willie Green (director Martin), high pumps and hats with 100 million dalmations. Moore's unique comedy raps, actually toasts, are close to the roots of hip hop. No wonder Dr. Dre mentioned "Dolemite" three times on his classic album "The Chronic". Add the best list of characters that love movie like horny preacher, pimp hamburger and, of course, "one who nobody knows while it's time." Credits should be awarded to director D'Urville Martin, Fell, who is most likely not interested in film fans (I was looking for a copy of his films and films by Fred Williamson from the early 70s over the years and I can't find them). Many people are really down on this movie and say it's really bad, and it's true that you see the mikes boom everywhere (look at DP Nicholas Josef Von Sternberg, for whom I think that it was a very early effort, there are a lot of things on this movie. Number one, there is no other movie. Number Two, see how Rudy Ray Moore has done (highly disinfected; anyone who has not seen Moore's outrageous living action will have to use his imagination) to film a version of his toasts, plus the life of his superpimp comic book will come to life. Action scenes are pretty poor, but character dialogues when they talk more about waste than it does. It's full of weird little details (as well as the fact that Hamburger Pimp is wearing the Dolemite T-shirt inside out - was it intentional or did the guy just pick up any shirt that was on the set and turn it on?) Are you coming back again and again. At least I have. <br /> <br />
