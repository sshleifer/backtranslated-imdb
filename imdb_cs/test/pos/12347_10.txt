A well-groomed, well-behaved teen Meg Tilly has to spend the night in a haunted mausoleum as a dedication to a high school club. The problem is a powerful psychic named Raymar was just buried there that day, but he is not quite dead, and he needs the life force of man for his powers. Obscure horror movie offers plenty of excitement and chills, appealing and sympathetic casting and top quality special effects. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 of 10. One dark night is rated R for violence and adult themes.
