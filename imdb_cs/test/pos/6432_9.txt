I recently had the honor to meet Mr. Hauer at the Sarasota Film Festival in 2005 for the American premier of this film. Not only was he kind enough to sign my copy of BLADE RUNNER, but he had the time to answer some questions about the movie before projecting the ROOM for a collapsed theater. I was so impressed with the film that I used it as a benchmark to compare all the other films I saw at the festival. It was powerful and moving, but subtle and short. The film tells the story of a young man (an older version played by Rutger) one day in a seemingly ordinary room in an unusual building near the street. Walking around you will notice a single window that is always open, from which you can hear the scary melody. She walks around the room every day, sometimes outside for a few hours, looking at her through the silk curtains that shake in the light breeze, hoping to see its inhabitants. Towards the end of the film, we find out how important this room is and what attracted us to it. The film was carved beautifully. Not one second of the time on the screen was wasted on an uninteresting shot. Any single film from the film could stand alone in the art gallery. Rutger is amazing. It is mysterious but accessible. His dialogue includes a series of reflections on life that is run, for better or worse. His words radiate familiar feelings and thoughts from the audience. I was especially interested in the scene in which she looks at some old photos, recalls her favorite dog, her favorite horse and her first love. You get the feeling that you are in his presence because he allows you to see precious memories of a life nearing his end in his world. I loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone looking for something fresh, intelligent and moving. It should be necessary to view for all movie majors.
