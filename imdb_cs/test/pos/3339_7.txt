I want to start my review by thanking the creators of this document, it is of course love work and I think they did a pretty good job of building a nice documentary about a man who had so little information about him. He certainly has fan worship for that, which is a good thing. I heard about Bruce Haack, but I didn't know much about him, and I found out that the beginning of this documentary was frustrating because I heard other musicians talking about him, but Bruce Haack was too far in the distance far. I wanted to see this guy, Bruce Haack! I felt like the creators thought I knew him as well as these musicians on the screen, which I didn't, so I felt a little in the dark. When Bruce was finally shown in action it was great and he gave me a taste of who Bruce Haack was, but it was just a taste. We've treated more musicians and I felt like I'm saying, "Look - all the great musicians are in it, so it has to be cool!" I wasn't very interested in the musician's comment on Bruce. I wanted to see Bruce as a man. You know, important things - more conversations with people who worked with him or knew him. More about his life, and yes, his drug use and other issues. I would like to know a lot more about my "Hackula" project. I wanted to get into his mind. Even if they did it by commenting on the "voice of God" and the photos, it would be fine. The animations were good, but again I felt they were used as a filler. nothing but allowing me to hear his music and see some images based on Dimension 5 records. I thought it was smart and creative, but again ... I wanted to learn more about Bruce! Perhaps Bruce Haack was elusive in this life? Anyway - at the end I enjoyed this documentary and felt some sadness that such great pioneers and geniuses as Mr. Haack had forgotten when the timestamp march was still going on. I'm glad this film is about to educate people about Bruce Haack, even with his shortcomings.
