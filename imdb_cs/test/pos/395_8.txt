Victor Mature, as barely civilized and mostly out of control of a mountain man and hunter, may be on the poster, but Robert Preston as a failed Union Colonel who led his men to "divide artillery" into Shiloh, and it was sent to the fort in Oregon for its incompetence, has the most interesting part, married to a young and hardly recognizable first Anne Bancroft. Uncultured mature desire for Colonel's wife, giving the film an interesting and even dark subplot that goes so far as to refer to the desire of another man's wife in one place by James Whitmore, who plays an elderly and wiser father of a mountain man. Directed by: Anthony Mann, this film is lost among his more famous westerns with James Stewart, but still you don't really need Indian threats to make this movie worth seeing, although Preston gets to prove his bad judgment as commanding officer again in a failed expedition, to finally bring Indy to subordination, in a well-organized attack between forests that quickly turn into a routine.
