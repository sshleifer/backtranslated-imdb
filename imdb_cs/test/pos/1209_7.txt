* SPOILERS AHEAD * <br /> <br /> Great WrestleManias was a few years away. But this was certainly good, with lots of good matches and one great match. Demolition has always been the best place in WrestleMania. I'm glad their last WM hoorah (I refuse to include another version) was a win over the colossal connection. I like gag Andre never tagging. Few fans know it was the first time anyone ever beat Mr. Perfect. For some reason, Brutus Beefcake's performance was never recognized. Or the fact that he did it quite easily. The Hart Foundation's victory over the Bolsheviks was the shortest in WM's history, including a 24/9 second match between King Kong Bundy and S.D. Jones. I'm glad Jake and DiBiase were fighting at WrestleMania. This was offset by the fact that the dispute had to be postponed for so long. I was expecting the big Bossman-Akeem's dispute to be heated up, but Bossman just set off. Just as Bossman was like a heel, he was just great as a face. He was always intense and obviously loved his work. If Warrior had a better work ethic and perhaps tried to learn how to fight, he would be a great WWF champion. It's worth the watch, especially because the boring matches are too short to complain. And team matches are very exciting.
