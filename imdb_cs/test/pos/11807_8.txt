There was nothing else on TV yesterday afternoon, so I thought it was fine. I didn't know the conspiracy and I had no expectations, I was thinking a few minutes or so I would surf the canal again. But then the story began to develop and the characters that both boys played beautifully. The story had unrealistic parts and scenes, but overall it was a really good movie. Very good to watch.
