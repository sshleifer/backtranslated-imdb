An exceptional film that handles a large-sized theme with a very balanced direction. Dmytrik was a very good director, at least from what I can say from this movie and Murder my Sweet, but HUAC seriously affected him as other directors and actors. Ironically, Crossfire did not receive any Oscars because it is a great example of how to make a great movie on a low budget. Everything about this film is exceptional: a well-written script that uses extensive flashbacks, a great cast, great lighting that seems to tell the story more than its own. What more can you expect from a top movie? I can add that noir is used here for its style, and I could add financial benefits. However, this once again proves that what was originally considered to be a B film may have a greater impact today, with most of the heavily controlled A films that have lost their audience over time. This film is no noir film per se and this raises serious questions about what noir is all about. Style is definitely noir when it comes to files and especially light, but the theme overcomes the "noir genre" recipe. You can see things from the opposite point of view and claim that anti-Semitism is just a pretext for investigating crimes, a murder argument is a real focus. That would be the case if there was no outstanding performance for Robert Ryan. Either way, the film has something to offer and it is really a pity that the director had to suffer so many injustices for his earlier beliefs in the truly "noir" of America
