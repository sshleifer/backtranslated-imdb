For me, "late chrysanthemums" were interesting not only because it was my first Naruse movie that I enjoyed, but because it was technically as modern and innovative as I had seen for 30 years. This does not mean that in 1959 Godard presented the idea of ​​"Breathless" news, but vice versa. The cut was as smooth as it was in the best Hollywood movies of the 1930s. 40s, but at the same time incredibly fit when it comes to the way he told his story. Unlike them, she never purposely emphasized anything, nor did she try to "invisible", but she, along with cinematography, made me feel like I was traveling on a subtle stream, constantly feeling the waves beneath me, like a gentle pull of the hand imperceptible rocking of the cradle. In this sense, the film was comparable to that of Oz and Mizoguchi, but somehow it was even more subtle. What was so modern was that the cut seemed almost like a remarkable camera in its own right. work in Dreyer's Ordet (1954) or Vredens dag (1943), which reveals a deeper understanding of the film and its characters rather than just showing them to us. I feel that the editions and cinemas of Narus are the most interesting aspects of his films, increasing the importance of stories beyond the obvious. We must not forget the wonderful sets and settings! I thought the story itself was rather conventional. The story and its characters were presented in a very interesting way, and I thought the first half of the film was creating a subtly brilliant spectrum of emotions. and relationships. Unfortunately, the second half of the film and its solution were rather didactic and formulated in comparison with the set (although it would be perfectly fitting into another - less complex film itself). Somehow I felt that he was trying a little to dissolve the many layers he had woven. Maybe he should keep them intact. This criticism may seem a bit harsh to the viewer of this film, especially since the process resembles the way Ozu solved the plot in his films. Unfortunately, I still didn't feel that Naruse could elevate the story and his characters in the conclusions of his films in a similarly noble way. The best I have seen so far - Ukigumo (Floating Clouds / 1955) and Midaregumo (Scattered Clouds / 1967) - kept the energy he built up during the narration while delivering engaging and resonant endings. This is more than most directors able to do, and in my opinion it is the basis for a real mastery of the film media. In this regard, and given the resonance of the last two films I have seen, it may have become one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have at the moment is where I see more of his movies on the big screen.
