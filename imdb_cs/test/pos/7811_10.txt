This film deserves to be one of the best Hindu comedies ever. Rajkumar Santoshi is mostly known for his harsh hard social dramas, but it is easily the easiest movie he has made. The plot revolves around two small city buffons, Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan). They want to get rich quickly and move into the big city. They hatch the same plan separately - to wake up the rich heiress Raveen (Raveena Tandon), who is the daughter of the wealthy businessman Ramgopal Bajaj (Paresh Rawal). Whoever takes Raveen gets his hands on all her wealth. but when they get to know each other's plan, there is an intense fear of one single-level leadership over who takes Raven. Rare gags and situations arise as the battle rages. The current twin Ramgopal Bajaj Shyamgopal Bajaj wants to remove his brother and niece and usurp family wealth. Add to that a series of funny characters including Raveen's maid Karishma (Karishma Kapoor), a butler-prone maid named Robert (Vijoo Khote), a manager named Bhalla (Shehzad Khan) who mimics the past villain Ajeet and the funny gangster Gogo (Shakti). Kapoor is waiting for you), who looks more like a pirate and playful comedy. Don't waste your time looking for a movie in the movie. Let the company of your brain and just enjoy. The actors are so much in sync with the scenario that no space stays for mistakes. Dialogues (Rajkumar Santoshi, Dilip Shukla) are funny. Music (Tushar Bhatia) and lyrics (Majrooh Sultanpuri) are unforgettable. The image and choreography (Saroy Khan) "Yeh Raat Aur Yeh Doori", "Ae Lo Ji Sanam" and "Dil Card Hai Tere Paas Aaoon" will fit and be etched in my mind forever. The movie played two superstars-in-production, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan (they eventually became superstars). Aamir Khan is impeccable in his first all-round comedy role. Greetings to his sense of comic timing. Salman pales in comparison with Aamir, but he is still nice. Among the supporting characters, Paresh Rawal stands out in his dual role of Ramgopal and Shyamgopal. The film surprisingly failed at the box office. I do not understand why. I recommend it to everyone.
