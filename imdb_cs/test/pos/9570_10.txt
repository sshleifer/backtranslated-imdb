This is the best of the movies (so far) that Christopher Guest has created with his talented file. Formerly they had a great wait for FORGFFMAN followed by BEST IN SHOW. As for their last, FOR YOUR CONSIDERATIONS, the less they said, the better. The film seems to be a documentary about exhibitions and especially a few contestants. These few selected dogs are watching from pre-show preparations until the big night, where one of them is best selected at an exhibition on the fictional "Mayflower Kennel Club". However, none of these people is a true show enthusiast, but talent improvisational actors who parody many of the common types of people you meet in the world of exhibitions. It's amazing that even though the characters are somewhat outrageous, there are a lot of truth to the personalities who parody, as I had some experience with dog shows a few decades ago, and that is a very group of heroes! My favorite dog owners were the incredibly high-pressure and tense pair of yuppie, who was just radiating anger and volatility. I also loved an openly gay couple because they were so funny and smart. But the best performance was probably not from any of the couples, but from Fred Willard, who played the dumbest and least talented broadcaster in the world. His comments were uniformly missing and often betrayed his as an incredibly stupid person - as he got to the announcer of such a prestigious show's someone's guess. The other contestants also said quite funny - a professional professional poodle and his wealthy owner, a country boy and his hound, as well as Winkie's "parents" who were barely enough to get to the show. Despite the improvised style of filmmaking, the pieces fit perfectly and tell a very witty and impressive story - one that is NOT only for dog owners. Exceptional action has made him one of the best comedies of the past decade. Smart and consistently funny. <br /> <br /> By the way, try to find it on DVD because the add-ons were really worth seeing. A little painful to watch, I loved to see Harlan Pepper and his beach ball collection separately!
