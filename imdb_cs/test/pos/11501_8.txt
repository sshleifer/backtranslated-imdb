This film is based on a true story. The author of the novel with the same name, Einar Mar Gu√∞mundsson, had a brother who became mentally ill. I have found that this film is very moving, following the way of the main character down to the illness to see how she tries to cope with life after diagnosis and make friends in a psychiatric hospital, this is all very convincing. There is also quite a lot of fun incidents in the manuscript. His name says nothing about the story. You have to watch it to understand ... and listen to music that rotates and turns your heart and soul upside down and back when the movie moves on. You have to see all of them.
