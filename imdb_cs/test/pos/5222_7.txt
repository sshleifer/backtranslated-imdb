"Father Hood" is a neglected little road movie gem. Excellent performances of Halle Berry, Sabina Lloyd and Brian Bonsall, two really fun over-the-top players Diane Ladd and Michael Ironside, <br /> <br /> and absolutely exceptional Patrick Swayze. The film is supported by an unconventional story, but poorly undercut is a flashback framing that results in a formal, sudden ending. Father Hood would have done much better without these "bookends". However, the film raises important questions of "family responsibilities" and the consequences of state intervention. As long as the foster system rewards state institutions for NON-ACCESSING CHILDREN, such abuse will exist. <br /> <br /> Choose this. It's worth "driving".
