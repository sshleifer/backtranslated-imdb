I totally disagree with the comments of one of the critics before me who chased the film. When I read this book and was impressed with it, even though it is a literature you can't really LIKE (like Hubert Selby's writing), I expected it to be shocked, but the effect was softer than that. Isabelle Hubert is a brilliant actress who manages to express a multilayered character. There are many scenes that focus on her and her subtle changes, and I can imagine some actresses who would do so well with such disrespect of their own reputation or image. There is coldness, distance, cruelty and at the same time it is helplessness, pain and pain. There is a man who is in control and controlled at the same time. It may not be realistic - even if you are reading a newspaper, you will read much worse than this - but it is a truth that is very difficult. I think it's a great movie, but I didn't like watching it. It's not boring, but there are times when I wished it would end. BTW, her male counterpart also acted very well (and I think he's also well chosen).
