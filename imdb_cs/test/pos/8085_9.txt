Yes, I'm sentimental and yes, I love movies where kids are better people. True, Klatret√∏sen has some logical or even conspiracy shortcomings. They are more than compensated by the great acting of the children (Julia's first film role!) And the magic of Dogma (I liked this kind of cinematographic art long before Dogma; since then Herzog's 'Herz aus Glas'). Well, I shouted for the last fifteen minutes, which is a higher tear factor than bambi or Fly away home for me.
