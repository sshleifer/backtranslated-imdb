Coen Brothers did it again. The three depressed era of conviction (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) escape the Mississippi gang chain and head in search of a buried treasure that will finance their new lives. On the way they sing on the radio and are sought after stars and refugees. Great laughter and soundtrack, which is a lesson / introduction to bluegrass music. Clooney is excellent as a fast conversation, fast-paced funny Ulysses Everett McGill. Holly Hunter plays her estranged wife. Turturro and Nelson are flawless stumblebums. Also included are John Goodman and Charles Durning. Dan Tyminksi Provides George Clooney Voice Singing on "I Am Constant Constant", Soggy Bottom Boys, which serves as a template for bluegrass tuned soundtrack that also includes Alison Krauss, Ralph Stanley, The White John Hartford, The Cox Family, and Gillian Welch. Toe knocking, knee slapping fun for the whole family. You'll be surprised how relaxed and fun this movie is.
