I once met "Four Friends" Arthur Penn on HBO for the first time. When I never heard of it, I was expecting very little, but I watched because I wondered what it would look like to create Penn and Steve Tesich. For the next two hours, I sat fascinated, watching the incredible combination of talent and story they had taken. Polos' autobiographical story of a young immigrant to America growing up in the mid-1960s, "Four Friends", follows the story of Danil, an East European immigrant (Craig Wasson's genius), since his arrival in the United States through a decade that has transformed the American landscape. Danilo's escort on his way is his friends Georgia (shining Jodi Thelan, in a role that unfortunately never had the chance to cope), Tom (Jim Metzler) and David (Michael Huddleston). "Four Friends" covers too much territory to try to explain, but if you haven't seen this movie, I urge you to find a copy (it's just released on DVD) and watch it. You won't be disappointed. Tesich's scenario is beautifully annoying? sometimes funny, sometimes incredibly sad, but always fascinating and honest. Penn is moving with a certain hand and obvious love for this period and the people whose lives we are watching. The cast is equally excellent. This film was to make Wasson the main star, which is indeed one of the country's most wasted talents. Jodi Thelan, not your standard headless Hollywood sexpot, warms the screen in performance that makes viewers fall in love with her character as easily as the characters in the movie. The fine performances of Metzler and Huddleston can easily be overlooked in the shadow of their star stars, but they are excellent and help to anchor the film. Also excellent are Miklos Simon and Elizabeth Lawrence as Danilo's parents, as well as Reed Birney and Lois Smith. I wasn't without a copy of "Four Friends" because the day after I first saw those HBO many years ago. She has been and is one of my favorite favorite movies for over 20 years. I can't recommend it and feel it when you give it a chance, you will feel the same.
