Sometimes good things happen by chance. I've never heard of "Silverwing" until the end of 2005 - I waved channels and happened to see something on Toon Disney with bats in a sawmill that was attacked by owls. . I had no idea what it was, but I was motivated to stay tuned - it was hard to wait for the ad, so I could find out what it was called! Bats - In the first place, they did not use the popular convention to give bats "odd fingers" where their inch claws are to be. Rather, they have palms like human hands, but the fingers are longer and have skin strips between them. Also faces - they look like human beings (in fact, in one place I was wondering if there were people once but they were turned into bats). I usually don't like it in cartoon animals, but here it worked - the story is a human story, even when it comes to bats and other animals (as opposed to the Lion King). What I saw on the TV last two parts of the "trilogy". I missed the very beginning of the first, "Towers of Fire", but for the most part I saw all of them. However, I found out that I wanted to understand what was happening because the first part was not turned on and I wouldn't catch it anyway. But I saw that it was based on Kenneth Oppel's book. How happy I was paying attention and wrote it - I was very disappointed when I learned that the show was not available! It wasn't so much so recent that it didn't make sense to make it unavailable. However, I have not only found Silverwing, but also two sequels, Sunwing and Firewing. When I read the first book, I was wondering, "Is that so?" Not only because a lot of what's in the series isn't in the book, but I haven't even seen the animated version, Silverwing (otherwise a good story) doesn't end as much as it stops. Only one free end is tied - Shade and Marina meet with the silver colony in Hibernacul. In fact, Silverwing and Sunwing should (in my opinion) be published in a single volume, because for the complete story together, but not separately. In fact, the animated version takes some elements from Sunwing (such as Orestes, the abolition of the sun) and some were completely original. It's not perfect, but it's definitely very nice. I love both versions of the Silverwing saga. <br /> <br /> What makes me happy to be finally available in June. It has been a long time since it has come and it is worth a wait.
