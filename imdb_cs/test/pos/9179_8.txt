I really liked this comedy. Will Smith does nothing slow. It is always right to aim with the biggest scripts and comedy that keeps you laughing, and involved in the plot. You are watching an experienced comedian who plays all his parts well. One fully believes that he is who he is playing. I loved him and Tommy Lee Jones in Men in Black. This comedy is up to the movie. Humor is moving fast, and Will Smith is sure of himself, just like he is in men in black. Quickly humorous, and well qualified in the art of doing other scores every time, but making it in a tasteful manner, and with subtlety. Will Smith seems to have perfected his comedy routine well. He was so damn funny. I loved the part where he had an allergic reaction to something he ate, and his face accelerated and after the fight he looked more like Cassius Clay. Then he saw him sipping on a Benadryl bottle and tried to return his head back to the right size. I laughed so hard. He knows how to laugh all of us.
