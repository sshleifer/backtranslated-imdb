Hi everyone, all I have to say is that Human Traffic and all its characters are so fun. I live in Australia (melbourne) and I am finally out of the club and have stayed all weekend lifestyle. This film explains everything that is happening in the world today. So exactly that I can't stop watching it .... I used to be exactly like Moff, so my friends said and I didn't even see the movie .. I left the party weekend for about 3 months after 4 years of intense party to change my life around .. I was in a DVD store when I saw Human Traffic and I remember my old friends doing about it, so I bought it to see what all the fuss is about .. I was so into it I watched it 4 times for By myself, because I couldn't believe that someone made a movie that explains everything to T. Anyway, this movie is by far the best and most fun movie I've ever seen .. Its funny because of its so true in everything that happens in the movie. And Moff is a legend !!! This is all I have to say .. :) Enjoy 11/10 sacked on how real it was, exactly what's going on in the world .. hr rm i jabber a lot <br /> <br /> take care of everyone ...
