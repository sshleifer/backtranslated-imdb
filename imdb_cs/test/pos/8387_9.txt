I can't imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is bigger than Quentin Tarantino. (At least in his films) Inglourious Basterds is no different. We all know Tarantino, the guy who exploded on the scene in the early 1990s with cult classics such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Since then he has been disappointing for some. I'm glad to say that Tarantino hasn't lost touch. It brings us the best from Pulp Fiction and fortunately. We know the story, a story from World War II narrated only as Tarantino. (Fictional, of course) The war movie didn't do this. Brad Pitt as Lieutenant Aldo Raine leads Basterdy in Nazi occupied France. Their goal - to kill the Nazis. A similar role on the other hand is played by Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa. He is known as the "Jewish Hunter" and goes about his business as ruthlessly as anyone else. The third sub-story consists of a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus, who is witnessing her family's defeat. And of course he wishes to conspire to revenge the Germans for her devastating loss. In fact, there are three stories that intertwine and interconnect. If you know anything about Tarantino or his films, it's nothing new to him. The war has never been so much fun. Basterds, they are scary, but at the same time very funny, occasionally fun. The dark comedy aspect is of great importance in this regard, as in many other Tarantino films. Brad Pitt makes fun and fun. I found it very fun and fun. I couldn't wait to see him again on the screen. Even with his crazy accent, he works in this type of film. Also made great impressions were MÃ©lanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz, who was huge. The film was filled with remarkable performances. The story itself has so many historical inaccuracies that it can count, but what? It's not a document. Tarantino wanted to have fun, just like we did. The cinema department deserves great props with beautiful vibrant colors that accentuate the film. You really loved the last line in the movie ... but Pulp Fiction remains his masterpiece. Quentin Tarantino is the entertainer among all the others. World War II is one of the most tragic events in history, but Tarantino, how she is doing to make it fun. Inglourious Basterds is a fun movie, it's extremely fun, shocking, dramatic, exciting and at the same time funny. Jam wrapped with everything you're looking for in the movie, with this particular Tarantino style, it's worth to be checked out. It's time to experience for yourself what war is similar to Quentin Tarantino's eyes.
