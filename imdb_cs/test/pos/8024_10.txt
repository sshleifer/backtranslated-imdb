<br /> <br /> When I first heard about it in 1997, through coffee with friends, I decided to check it out. The only problem was that it was on a small screen in one of my local cinemas. That didn't stop the pleasure of seeing just a great movie, with Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. The whole movie left me stuck in place. In this great movie, I just found no flaws, giving my highest recommendation to those who love thrillers. I am very proud to have it in my collection. <br /> <br /> 10/10 (I don't make it easy).
