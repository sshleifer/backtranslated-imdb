Sometimes it is difficult to define what separates a successful, pleasant comedy from the one that falls. In this case, it is a conspiracy conspiracy about a spoiled rich girl who plans to take her niece away from the Greenwich Village who is educating them, just to be alone, not promising. And in the director's filmmaking, Leigh Jason, there is no indication that he was a overlooked chief talent. And yet he had to be responsible for creating a relaxed, happy atmosphere on the scene that was faithfully recorded on the film. He also had a good sense to fill this movie properly. The only little mistake is Miriam Hopkins in the part where Ginger Rogers would be ideal. Hopkins is effective but fragile, lacks the warmth and sexiness of Rogers should. She is further hindered by a pair of bizarre long and noble false eyelashes that are sometimes distracted. But the very young and very handsome Ray Milland couldn't have been better at the exhilarating, fearless comedy of great charm. And better than that, especially for New Yorkers, is the 1937 Hollywood display of Greenwich Village. Although completely synthetic and idealized, the contemporary viewer will recognize it. Art director Van Nest Polglase has created a friendly mix of mews apartments and shabby common yards, which is the perfect backdrop for this collection of artists, siblings, smarts and wannabes. Best in the minor cast is Guinn Williams, bringing sweetness and light to his role as a prizefighter-sculptor-seamstress, designing self-invention and fluency (sexual and otherwise) life in the village. Betty Philson and Marianna Strelby are even more refreshing. These little girls, intelligent and full of humor, look like real human beings and they are nothing like professional child actors of that time. Interesting is a few unforgettable comics: Ray Milland's Vacuum Cleaner Demonstration for a Howling Child is played with more spontaneity than expected (a child and his twist are amazing "found" moments) and a false home "playing" in a department store window that falls apart into free space. - It's also fun. The film is slowly moving downhill with direct court action and then never going back to the track when the action moves to Long Island, but this film is worth a look.
