I watched this show from the start and I'm a 45 year old man. For me it is much more than an example that appeals to women. This is a family story, perhaps unusual, but a family yet. It centers around the mother and daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive, and in their own ways successful women. Lorelei makes her home in fictional stars Hollow, CT, a small New England city with a sense of history, and populations of people who may be unusual, but act as a dysfunctional family. The show also throws in a relationship between Lorelei and her parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore, an old money DAR WASP people who do not approve of Lorelei's election in life, although Lorelei does not care. The story of relationships and over the line are what makes this show, in my opinion the best on the WB network (soon it will be CW). Check out this show!
