Compared to the Battle of Britain, it's a real movie with real characters and a real plot. The Battle of Britain is basically a documentary with occasional Lawrence Olivier and Michael Caine, but the real protagonists are Spits, Hurricanes, and so on. conspiracy. I highly recommend it to anyone, even those who don't like war movies. It is well filmed, and I wonder what the director could do if he had the capital letters behind him. And I don't think it's too sentimental. It's just that you have real people in the fighters, with real feelings and real life - just as real as any fictional life in some big movie.
