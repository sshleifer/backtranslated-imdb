We're in a small town, a homely widow (Ida Lupino) hires a handyman (Robert Ryan) to take care of her house. Soon it will start to regret when Ryan grows in the classroom, he seems to be hosting a dangerous schizophrenic and is now unable to escape from his house. <br /> <br /> Beware, my Lovely is customized Mel Dinelli's {Spiral Staircase} story and a game called "The Man". Quite one movie and two characters, the film boasts two great performances and offers an interesting insight into mental illness. However, we should not be confused when we think it is a violent and rough image because it is not. Clearly, Ryan's Howard Wilton is a dangerously troubled person, but that's another kind of "danger" movie. The one who makes another tendency to psychosis and hence hates our dangerous protagonist. <br /> <br /> Ryan and Lupino are a great combination that they did great and much better the same year. So with both actors clearly put together, it delivers a finely tuned story story all based within a single house, re: jail. Ryan is particularly strong when his character penetrates in and out of madness, with some powerful scenes and sometimes fear-inducing scenes, and other gathering deep sympathy. The direction from Harry Horner is safe (in fact, he can do nothing but let his actors run with him) and George E. Diskant's cinematography contains some clever and impressive visual impressions. With one includes Christmas tree ornaments immensely memorable. Falling some where between being mean and great, Beware, My Lovely has enough to make it a recommendation for fans of borders and easy to follow Film-Noir. For Robert Ryan tho fans, it's something of a major viewing, oh yes, and then some. 7/10
