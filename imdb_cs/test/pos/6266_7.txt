The subtle and brilliant film seems to have been overlooked as triviality ... and to be fair is a narration a bit harsh and light as drama ... but I feel a simple miracle and joy from the scenes depicting the first impact New art on extraterrestrial and skeptical society has brightness and naturalness which captures a century of long romance between cinema and audience better than any movie in years. Jared Harrissa's immensely sympathetic performance (who apparently inherited all his paternal charisma ... hopefully hellraising and stupidity matters without the poor Richards) .... and the glamorous loveliness of cuteness from Yu Xia's crusade will make it a real heart. Shooting the radiant position (including the brightly beautiful scenes on the great wall) and the sensitive Ann Hu lead the film effect. In short, for anyone who is enchanted by the shimmering shadow of life ... and the magic in the dark.
