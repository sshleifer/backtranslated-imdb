I stumbled across this film while I was walking through the channels. It was aired on a lesser known short program here in Australia. It's been a long time since I was so impressed with the movie, especially one so short. The power of the story, the quality of acting and stunning cinema ... wow. If it were available, it would be a very nice addition to my DVD collection. I'm undoubtedly impressed and looking forward to another Joshua Leonard movie. <br /> <br /> Outstanding Experience 10/10
