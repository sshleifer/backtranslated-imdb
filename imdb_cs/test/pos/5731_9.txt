This program was quite interesting. The way the program was displayed was all the more interesting. String Theory is also very interesting to listen to too. For three hours, I think it's worth it. I enjoyed listening to the thoughts provided by physicists. Extraordinary dimensions really reflect on the mind. If you have a chance, watch this amazing document.
