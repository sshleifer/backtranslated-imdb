Is torture right at all? No The answer is simple and absolute without qualification. The reason for this film was that torture was on society. The values ​​that have been fought hard in Western society over the centuries of revolution and struggle are for ALL men and women allowed to live in a free and open society. One where individuals are treated equally and with respect to their fundamental rights as people. To protect this society, institutions have been developed that deal with openness, fairness and honesty. These institutions have been adapted and refined through generations of hard work. It could be argued that this is a real bedrock of democracy, because it belongs to all of us that everyone can hear us. If we allow undemocratic, inhuman deeds to be committed in our name, if we divide our society into those who have rights, and those who do not, then we will get rid of the work of our ancestors. Moreover, we are all fellow-inmates and all guilty and defiled. It doesn't matter whether those we blame are guilty or not. We are defined by our attitudes and our reactions.
