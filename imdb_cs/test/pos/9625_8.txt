This is my favorite movie kung fu. He has a very authentic taste, flavored with scary music (in my opinion, traditional Chinese instruments) and a few superbly exaggerated melodramatic moments in contrast to the hard-hit comedy. Indeed, while attempting to create their own "Western" (ie Cowboy film) genre, the Chinese have devised a whole new creature, marked by kung fu fighting and its associated sound effects. The Five Fingers Story Death is a simple story of revenge (for killing a loved one) and the pursuit of the main character to master the "iron fist technique" that allows him to develop holy revenge on his enemies. There is even love interest, though inept, polite kind (found in most Chinese period movies). But the end result is big and much more authentic than any Bruce Lee movie.
