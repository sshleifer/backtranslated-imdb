Easily one of my three or four favorite movies. Certainly one for the desert island. There's nothing "great" about this movie. Rather, it is warm and pleasant. The audience is invited to a party, and like any good party, joy comes in the interaction of the guests and what you learn as you progress from one to the other. With Joyce's excuse, the title of the film raises a number of ideas that keep viewers away. The film is not scary. It's not depressing. It is a beautiful glimpse into the time that has passed, in which people grow up, and others withdraw. Some are frustrated and others are calm. And all around, there are people and parts of people who have been laid to rest. The words that are given to these excellent actors to speak, are perfection, and are ready for the music of the Irish campaign, are audible feasts, especially for us, flat-tone Americans. The lack of brilliance I mentioned above was taken back. There is no other word to describe the final scene between Anjelica Huston and Donal McCann. Speak quiet volumes about ??? well, everything. Some beautiful snowy evening, rent this movie and let it stand before you. No firefights, no chases, no dinosaurs? just a movie on his most noble.
