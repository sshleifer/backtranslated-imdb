"Edge of the City" is another movie that owes a lot of "On the Waterfront" credit. From NYC to its scores, the belief that you have problems, you can make some mistakes. In my opinion, this is where the film fails as "Waterfront". In 85 minutes the film rushes to establish relationships and everything follows so fast that most of them seem forced and incredible. The relationship between Sidney Poitier and John Cassavettes could be further developed in the beginning. I do not believe that these two characters, from two very different places, have built such a strong relationship so quickly. I think the whole sub-plot of love with Cassavettes could be removed. He's so clumsy with a woman that he's looking painfully. The only reason he's in the movie is to motivate him to do the right thing at the end. There are other ways they have done it. I would also like to see some scenes from Axel in the army to illustrate why there is a way he is. Acting is excellent. Poitier is amazing in a role that is beautifully written. His role as Tyler is interesting and multi-layered and (especially for 1957), a man who is self-confident, respected and intelligent. Cassavettes, like Axel North, though very good, do not seem to be quite right for the part. The Ranger is amazing because the boss who knows Axel's secret (although his Cassavetta battle scene is being done terribly. I thought Ruby Dee was amazing in the role of Poitier's wife. built. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
