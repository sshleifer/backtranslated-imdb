Some older doctor Who I enjoyed many years ago, so when the new one came out, I had to check it out. I was so pleased - with characters, stories, updated looks, I became addicted! From season 1 (27 for old fans) to season 2 (28), it's just getting better. Well tied to old shows, even if you don't need to know old shows to enjoy this newer version. Although the cast has changed, I recommend Doctor Who - with Chris Ecclestone and David Tennant. <br /> <br /> I like that they gave the characters such depth. The doctor seems more vulnerable in this series, perhaps because he's the last TimeLord. The range of emotions that Chris and David show is really remarkable, and I felt their pain, anger and sense of adventure with them. Billie Piper (Rose) brings a very human element to every episode, even though it is more brave than me. With her talent, Billie will go far in the industry.
