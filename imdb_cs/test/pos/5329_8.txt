Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) has committed an unspeakable crime, stabbing the retired younger brother of his former friend Becky (Jena Malone). No one, at least Leland himself, can explain why he did what he did, whether the act was thoughtful or spontaneous, made hate or love. In a detention center, Leland meets with Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle), an online novelist who sees Leland's second opportunity. But Pearl also wants to understand Leland's motivation and take him under his wing as a confidant in prison. The film skips several times from the past to the present, often allowing the past to act as a context to the present and vice versa. Writer / director Matthew Ryan Hodge shows how Leland's crime - and the events that led to him - affect people in his life, from Becky to her family to Leland's mother (Lena Olin) and alienated father (Kevin Spacey) to Allen (Chris Klein), a young man who is Becky's family after his mother's death. The main benefit of the film is Gosling, which is perfectly cast as a 15-year-old pseudopsychopath. Like Bartleby Scrivener, Gosling's Leland only exists; during the film, he shows small emotions, but his expressions run counter to the ocean of guilt, sadness, love, and anger. <br /> <br /> Each of the main actors offered perhaps their best work to date, saving Spacey (who is not a completely newcomer). A special praise is due to Malone and Klein, two young artists who are better known for the light heart comedy fare than the heavy drama of this film. Another huge advantage in terms of the story is that none of the characters are flawless; none of them is a hero to save the day. It's just not a black and white movie.
