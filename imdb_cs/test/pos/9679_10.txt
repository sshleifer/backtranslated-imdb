If Family Guy insults you or you just don't get humor, unfortunately this show makes you fun and the masses of too religious, boring and politically correct people in America. So put your morale aside and have fun with this show. FG is a cheerful support for the mind of today's society. Whoever said it was for a young immature audience is very wrong. With all the mention of old films and politics 10-80 years ago, I couldn't imagine every young immature boy finding this fun. Family Guy is definitely for mature viewers who are not afraid to criticize American society. Hats for Seth and the entire crew who were able to do this show happened.
