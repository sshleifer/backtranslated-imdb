The truly bizarre story of Honor De Balzac, on which this freely found, gets a disturbing, though breathtaking film, a treatment here as a forbidden flower of love between man and beast in the early nineteenth century. Slim and very blond English actor Ben Daniels plays the role of a young soldier during the Napoleonic Wars, who disappear when accompanied by an exiled French painter over the harsh, dangerous landscape of the Gobi Desert. After both men literally circulate in circles, they sometimes abandon their attempts to re-enter civilization, so everyone decides (to think better about you) to make separate paths with the promise of returning to the same place, when and when the water source is actually found. This is, of course, the way Daniels' character comes into contact with the creature (wild and untamed female leopard) and ultimately creates a seemingly unbreakable bond, or rather love, with both saving his life and almost destroying him with a film ending. Outstanding cinematography, minimalist dialogue, a somewhat demented story that probably points to possible bestiality in about three scenes, is what ultimately leads professional critics to make the film as spectacular and too long to waste. Although it is a film that is not exactly for everyone, it tastes you, I regard it as a gentle, though definitely left-wing, fantasy with a surreal and sumptuous atmosphere, highlighted by the fact that more than half of Former Actor Ben Daniels is forced to stand out against a wild animal (four leopards were actually used unlike the one), which simple common sense and mild knowledge of theatrics dictates that it must have been madness and a very difficult job when asked! Overall, I think "passion in the desert" takes some time to warm up, but if you're a patient who is willing to give it some time, it does in fact be that it's a unique original spell despite everything; and unlike most stories related to the human and animal relationships they need, they may not require a talking pig, monkey, or furry dog ​​to maintain your interest.
