I found this little gem as another feature on my Vampyr-Der Traum Des Allen Gray DVD, and I didn't expect all that much. It seemed like it could be interesting short, even though I turned it on. I'm so glad I did it. It was really incredible! Despite being created more than 70 years ago, in my opinion, animation was better than the one that was made available today with all the computer effects and experience. The story is very simple The newly built dog dog hears its owner's lament that he can't afford an orange and goes on the road to find him. In this process it runs into the underworld toy with all kinds of shameful creatures and toys supervised by anyone but the devil himself, who all want the dog for himself. This movie precedes, but reminds me of a lot of Mad Monster Party? (1969, Jules Bass) - a movie I have always really enjoyed - and to a lesser extent some of Tim Burton's animated works - The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993, Henry Selick) and Corpse Bride (2005, Tim Burton). Fans of any of these films will also love The Mascot. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is an incredible piece of short animation worth watching.
