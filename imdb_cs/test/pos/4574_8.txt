I have to say it's a great movie. Mike Judge has an eye that sees no one will ever notice, so Office Space. Hemakes's statement about a silly company, and that the survival of the strongest is a mere trumpet dream for 500 years. That pop culture and mass marketing by affluent companies tend to dominate the day. Yes, that's a lot of nighttime humor, and that's because the story moves and its point across. But the real frustration on the face of Joe Bowers' private face is invaluable, and some of the cases we may have at some point in his life. <br /> <br /> If you don't enjoy humor, look at it from a different perspective and watch it again. It took me to watch it twice to really appreciate this movie for what it is? And with that, as I watched it twice?
