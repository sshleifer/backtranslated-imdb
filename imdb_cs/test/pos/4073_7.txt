I went to see this movie not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by the team of collaborators Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. It was a quick movie and an hour and a half went quickly. He will definitely not win any academic prizes, but it was a change of pace for Mr. De Niro. He's good at comedy. Overall, I enjoyed it.
