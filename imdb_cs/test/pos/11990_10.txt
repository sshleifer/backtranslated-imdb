I'm here in a huge minority. I also didn't really care about the original caddyshack, except for the duo chase / murray scene and the selection of rodney jokes. all right, divide it: rodney vs. jackie- both Jewish and have similar humor. Rodney is a bigger name and more pronounced. Jackie has a random and more observational approach to his jokes and is more 'up your' in this sequel. Jackie's attitude to everything is unforgettable and inspiring in a way! his quick lines and excessive trust allowed me to express myself in this way. Rodney was good, but he wasn't enough and he was more "in the face" and dismissive. Jackie, in a rare movie look, makes a perfect sub for rodney (come on, a hair-blower?!?!) Really, look at the little things! <br /> <br /> stack vs. Play Snobby Yuppies very well. Knight, despite his wonderful television / film career, shows his age. but he gets rid of the snobbish demands of the part and we want to see him fall. Ted looks a little weak and quite uncomfortable, playing his anger and frustration too grotesque, while the pile is more randomly stumbling and vindictive; You really hate it and enjoy it all the time. The stack wins with me. murray vs. murray aykroyd- well, both had great, vintage SNL-like scenes with the ubiquitous and pleasant chevy chase (those webb). I liked Murray / Chase one better. Murray plays his great, annoying, flimsy character with obvious improvisation skills and is loving - yet uncomfortable. and the same can be said for aykroyd. they both bother after a while, but it's a tie. I really loved Part 2 above the first one. they are two completely different mood movies. The first part is more drug / bathroom / sex humor with a cast full of big names. Part 2 uses golf as a stick-it-to-the-the-rich comedy background that makes it a better working class. 80s script? Yes. a little fetched? yes, but wasn't the first? insulting golf sport? Yes, it's a movie. a thin story? Yes, it is a comedy with real humor - not 'dances with wolves' !! In addition, Part 2 has a much better soundtrack !! PLEASE DO NOT EXPOSE THAT IT IS SEQUEL TO PART ONE !! It's 98% IT'S OWN FILM AND CANNOT BE ANY NAME "CADDYSHACK" IN IT. he said, i'm a big fan of caddyshack 2 and it's a great exponent of 80-year fun with good humor. VIVA JACKIE MASON !!! all reducers - brighten up! it's a comedy. Randy Quaid was wonderful, Jonathan Silverman was amazing, hell, they were all !! All these chatting and now I feel like I'm watching it! I think I will
