This film deserves better. Mike Judge's satirical joke brought to light something he was trying to deny in this country ... we got like a company like dirt. Could the 24-hour news program Anna Nicole be more proof? Mike referee paints a terrifying future where stupid survives and thrives. You stop thinking and laughing. Can you take a look at the world and not ask if we are in horror? Are we overtaking human waste and our own waste? (Beware of landslides). <br /> <br /> The movie is really fun. I'd tell you more about the conspiracy, but I don't want to mess it up. So why release this movie with ZERO support? Could it be that the stupid ones are already taking over?
