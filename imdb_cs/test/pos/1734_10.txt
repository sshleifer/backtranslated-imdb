I'll get a kick from the new Who Who's Saying it, Excellent, Their Right To This Opinion, But The New Series Is Not Still, It's There. It's definitely good. <br /> <br /> Good things first. Special effects are apparently better almost 20 years later since the last episode of Doctor Who "Battlefield" was aired. One thing the BBC always likes Doctor Who (except when they tried to cancel in the 1970s and 1980s). However, expectations and pressure were great, but I think the new series has passed the test is good, it is still not excellent because it has drawbacks. Some of the stories of "Dalek" were very poor. I suppose it was written in a few minutes by some idiot who never bothered to remake the Dalek character or never bothered to watch the old series. "Aliens in London" was probably the best episode yet, it began a new story about Aliens which lasted through several episodes including "Boomtown". Now other bad things, companion, Rose, Billie Piper, not big. It's actually quite annoying, but like dr. Who should ultimately be chosen by a young tiny bopper and she got a part. Christopher Eccleston is quite polite, he began to grab his niche. He was trying to play the character, then the right blow is always missing, but he takes it more seriously and shows. Continuity Wisely Still There Are Several Problems That Were Not Solved Well, Paul McGann was still a doctor before that but didn't get back. Aside from the fact that although the series overall is pretty good, I didn't miss an episode and never get bored, so I recommend every doctor who checks it and sees a new Doctor Who series.
