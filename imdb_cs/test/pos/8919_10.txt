This is indeed the cult classic of Australia. If you're one of the lucky ones you've seen, then you're very lucky. It was released in most countries, but not in Australia for some reason. I have a copy on DVD from the UK. It's not a great transfer, but I bought it when I saw it at the film festival. Directing is in place and performing rock! This is a dark movie of scary movie, but often times, very funny in parts. I urge you to see this movie, the cold that you don't see in 99% of the typical Aussie tariff. The script is very well processed and sends you on the road where you know it will end badly, but until the last ten minutes, you just can't choose how bad. Great work out of four leaders, especially Lachy Hulme. <br /> <br /> When it all says and does: Great work on display!
