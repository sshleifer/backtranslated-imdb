I just got this movie for Christmas and I've already added it to my favorites list. A cute and simple story that makes a beautiful movie. Who couldn't love Uncle Felix or have his mouth watered by the sound of that meal. Certain points go to Sydney Greenstreet for his performance of Alexander Yardley and also Reginald Gardiner, who played John Sloan, an incredibly boring fianc√©e. A real jewel to be watched every Christmas.
