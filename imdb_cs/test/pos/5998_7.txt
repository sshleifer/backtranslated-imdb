At first I did not like the director's constant transition from the past (gulliver's travels) to the present day (a crazy asylum man). But it's really the best way to make a story, even if they get used to it. Danson is excellent because the title character and fox is a wonderful villain. The worst is Mary Steenburgen as Gulliver's wife. She has never been beautiful in Hollywood, and in this film they have been doing it for some reason. I will never understand why directors make a woman ugly when she adds nothing to the story! Plus, you want to strangle her for being so damn stupid in the belief that the bad Bates lies still telling her. Even her son sees a bastard. Still a good show and I rate it B +.
