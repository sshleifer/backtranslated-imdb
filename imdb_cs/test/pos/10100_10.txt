Many horror fans complain that horror has barely progressed in the last twenty years. I was willing to agree with it until the influx of Asian horror films, a trend that has disappeared. However, it has produced some true classics, and the Story of Two Sisters, for me at least, stands out as an exceptional piece of cinema, and perhaps the best horror movie in a very long time. Based vaguely on Korean folktale, tells the sad story of two mentally disabled sisters living with their father and stepmother. After experiencing the first few problems at home at night, they decide to stick together and deny their step-by-step access to their close relationship. Tension is rising and inevitable. But what happens after it takes more than a couple of eyes, as the story takes a few twists and turns, is more emotional and quite real. By the end, you may need a few moments to absorb everything and piece it together in your own mind, but it's exactly that pairing of horror and mystery that pushes it behind the definition of these genres and makes it an instant classic. One looks over and over again to see if it all works.
