This performance will not leave you without a wish. We've seen it in Offenbach, Germany, and it's breathtaking. We only got cheap tickets on the back, but we still had a view of everything that happened. If you ever get a chance to see this live then GO! It's worth a trip and if I were you, I'd wait half an hour after the show to cool down. Performances are breathtaking, and artists around the tent are colorfully dressed here to distract, help, smile, and revive the entire tent. Music - live music !! - is as good as the CD version: perfect! Later I bought a DVD, but the show that was filmed had less colorful costumes. It's an atmosphere in a tent that takes you from your feet. Great trip for old and young and also great movie
