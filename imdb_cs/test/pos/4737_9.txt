Waco: The principles of engagement do a very good job of not drawing conclusions to their viewers. It simply presents interviews, shots, congress shots, phone conversations, expert testimonials, etc. And lets you draw your own conclusion. I hardly intend to suggest that the data presented here was 100% objective, but it is very convincing. You won't like Koresh anymore if you see it before you did it before, but I think you think that, as I am doing now, there is a lot we have not been informed about what happened before and during the standoff .
