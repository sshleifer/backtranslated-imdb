The upscale marriage of a New York City with a child breaks up when a woman wants to go out ("She took her a lot of courage to come out the door!" She calls us a neighbor); a busy, distracted husband takes over "maternal" duties and approaches his son, but soon the woman returns. The highly manipulative image does not give us a very realistic family unit (with young Justin Henry he is certainly not like the product of marriage between Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep!), But the dynamics is interesting and includes director Robert Benton. popping with lots of cleverness, amazing classic music, crazy adjustment and some humor. Streep's character is designed to be a cold, focused witch, but I was ready to feel much more for her than Benton probably wanted. It all has to be painted in terms of black and white, good and bad, with Hoffman's teaching how hard his wife had and how to get a second chance to be a good parent. The film has never fallen from its predetermined path and very gentle gambling almost saves it, but I'm not sure where Benton was directing the film in the final act and the final scene was terribly violent. *** of ****
