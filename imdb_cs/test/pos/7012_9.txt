Hi all dear fans Dirty Dancing !!!! I came to this board when I was bored one day and I think it's okay. I absolutely love DD! I first saw it at my friend's house when I was 13 (now I'm 17) and got into it! I saw it there at least 10 times and soon after I bought the DVD for myself. At this stage, I remember most of the script and I can recite it whenever someone asks me. '' I carried a watermelon?! '' It's so bad that I bought a soundtrack and recorded the song Micky and Sylvia, and now it's ringing on my phone! Most of my friends think it's bullshit, but I don't care what they think, I know it's brilliant! I read the comments earlier and I have some questions for you - 1. Why do you ask trivial questions like Lisa and Baby ages? I don't think it's that important. They're teenagers in the 60's, isn't that enough? 2. Where did you get this special edition that you all talk about? Sounds very interesting ... Please answer it. I'd like to see more fan opinions ... Greetings! charliesangel415 xxx
