This is a cute movie starring Spanky, Alfalfa and buckwheat from "Our Gang". During the civil war in the south, it may seem a little strange to see buckwheat as Spank's slaves, but this film is as charming as the best shorts with the same cast. That was the only feature of Our gang, and I highly recommend it before The Little Rascals remake of 1994.
