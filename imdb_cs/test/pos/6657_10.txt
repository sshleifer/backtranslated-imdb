I saw a DVD and loved it. In particular, I thought the director and Jude and Nicole had done an amazing job of kissing between Inman and Ada just before Inman left. It was the most romantic kiss I've ever seen in a movie. I thought it was essential to adjust the tone for the rest of the movie; he managed to believe that Inman and Ada would be walking / waiting for themselves all the time without really having a relationship. I thought the movie had mastered this important point of the plot much better than the book itself. I'm sure many of you will quickly name the next best kisses, but this is for me! Jude and Nicole showed incredible chemistry in too few scenes they had together.
