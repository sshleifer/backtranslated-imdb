Prue and Piper Bring Dr Griffiths to his home to save him from Sauce's killer Shax. While Phoebe looks in the Shadow book, how to defeat a demon, Prue and Piper fight and chase Shax on the streets to destroy him. However, they are filmed and exposed to live in television news as witches. They become a national feeling with a crowd in front of their house. Phoebe trusts Cole and goes to the underworld with Lee to ask him to call Tempus and return time while a fanatical woman shoots Piper who dies. Source suggests Phoebe stay with him and in return would save her sister. Phoebe accepts the deal and time returns to the point when Shax attacks Prue, Piper, and Dr. Griffits. "All Hell Breaks Loose" is a good but incoherent episode. With Piper dead and the power of the three destroyed, why should the source return time to save her? But this dramatic show is surely one of the best in the Third Season, and the audience was waiting impatiently for the next episode. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Voltando no Tempo" ("Back in Time")
