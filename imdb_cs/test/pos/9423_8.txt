I liked it somewhat more than Terror at night, though it wasn't enough to give it an extra *. The beginning is simply brilliant when we look at Nazi agents who are trying to get a new bomb and its inventor in a small Swiss village just to be confused by the masked Holmes who returns the spirit to London. Once there, he will do everything in his power to keep the scientist in the hands of the man behind him - not Hitler, but worse: Holmes' enemy Moriarty. Of course, the scientist will disappear, leaving a tantalizing coded note and Holmes going in pursuit, again in disguise. The peak at Moriarty's dockside is well exciting and we can all guess that all the ends are good, right? Slightly over-the-top patriotic messages like roll credits. Now that I think this subtle sense of space despite the obvious files, Rathbone use the disguise and the way so much conspiracy is crammed just over an hour - what the hell gets that extra * and is my favorite of 5 Rathbone / Bruce movies that I've seen today. Watched on DVD, part of Mill Creek Entertainment's "50 Mystery Classics". Many of the transfers on these boxes are very bad, but Holmes fans will notice that the Rathbone / Bruce films (there are 4 on this scene) are all very attentive and reasonably sharp.
