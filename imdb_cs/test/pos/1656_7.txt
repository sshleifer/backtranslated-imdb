"Rififi" is an amazing film about the heist film, from which other films with indifference have been drawn since then. Jules Dassin felt it was the underworld in which these thieves live - you will not find the Hollywood charm of the "Eleven Ocean". Raiders in "Rififi" do not like for excitement and do not play the game. They steal to survive, pay for raising their children, prove to themselves and others that they still have something to offer to the world. The thematically praised robbery scene is a nail filmed in virtual silence. I had the feeling that the conspiracy continued a little longer than needed, but the high-speed race that delivers the baby to its mother who ends the movie is classic. - This film is very bleak. But it's also very good. <br /> <br /> Level: A-
