Today I watched this movie on TV LOGO. I was absolutely fascinated by the powerful messages and conspiracies in this film. I don't want to mess it up. I will say it, I related to the inner struggle of Aaron and his upbringing. As a homosexual growing up in a small town, I related to the "great secret" and the possibilities I made. This movie has made a huge impact on me and I plan to buy a copy of it in the very near future for my personal library. More than I finished the film and started calling my friends to recommend it. It had a profound effect on me. For those who have read this comment. Bach. Try to have the least distraction. Also keep your mind open. This is not a movie that can be seen as a Disney movie or a movie of the week. Instead, take the time to watch and actively listen to the dialogue as well as to read between the lines and engage in the plot. You may find yourself in tears. Not from "Steel Magnolias" I was moved to tears with film. He just did this. I thank the cast and the writer and crew for producing an emotionally charged romantic film about homosexuality and religion. Delayed belatedly.
