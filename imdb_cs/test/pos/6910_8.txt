First it wasn't a three hour movie - two hours, ten minutes ... the last time I checked the ads aren't actually part of the movie! But maybe it should be two parterers for about 3 hours? Yeah, he would get more, he would be able to explore other emotions. Overall, however, it was an interesting insight into the life of Lucy and Desi. I watch I Love Lucy from time to time and I love her, but I've never read or seen a resume, I never knew anything about their life from the screen. I'm doing this movie now, but I'm not so sure it's a good thing. Everything nobody needed to know. That was basically a movie that didn't need to be done. But it has been done and the reason is that Lucy & Desi are still so big stars and some people in American society feel that the rest of the company needs to know ALL about our TV and movie stars. This is certainly not true and very, very sad. Anyway, what turned out here in Lucy was pretty good. Two complaints - an actress who played Viv Vance - not a big cast at all. And the transition from Madeline Winter to Rachel York .... uhhh, just like Lucy had a plastic surgery and suddenly it's a whole new person! It wasn't too big. But the story continued and focused on the rocky relationship between Lucy & Desi. No, the kids weren't shown at all, and it wasn't necessarily the disadvantage of this movie because, as I said, this was mainly focused on Lucy & Desi. If there was more time, the story would be more about Lucy's life, then the kids would be more. But it wasn't that we looked briefly at Gable & Lombard, Red Skelton and Buster Keaton instead. Wow, that was one thing about this story that I thought was really cool: his presence and influence in Lucy's life. Really elegant and it's too bad that it wasn't explored anymore. Oh, good. What has been examined has been largely done well. Frankly, I don't think I'm gonna watch it again and I don't think this movie will be so memorable. For someone who kicks I Love Lucy, but he's not a huge fan of Lucille Ball, it should be an interesting watch. My degree for this: B
