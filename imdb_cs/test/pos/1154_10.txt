Well, I'm a historical enthusiast and fine, I'm an action movie addict, so of course, this movie is on my top ten of all time. I really love the action scenes and the unique armament of this period. I have some doubts about fighting a two-handed sword from a horseback, and the Raisuli sword seems to be more katana than a chimpanzee, ... oh, I've never fought a horse out of a horse. > <br /> I also love attempts at philosophical proverbs. Also, the typical desert tribe apparently could not read the Qur'an, so they took it for granted. Some writers have criticized Connery's objection; Youth, I met a family of South Africans in our west, the National Dinosaur Memorial, and although Africans spoke to each other (yeah, the second generation of Germans hear the difference), they spoke English with Scottish brogue. Scottish missionary?
