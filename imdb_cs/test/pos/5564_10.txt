Other reviewers are a way to turn WAAAAY off, why Farscape (temporarily) has stopped. It has nothing to do with the quality of the show 'slacking'. Precise OPPOSITE is true. Still better and better! :) I saw every episode and when you just watched them to really be amazed how much colder it gets when moving on and on, and the wormhole subwot and Aeryn are really very interesting and give it more vibration, not less . Before it was a bit chaotic, slow and more aimless. They spent just like the first two seasons that came out of this type of enemy, but in the second they tried to do something. I've also never seen such a fun mix of sexy women and attitudes in Sci-Fi. The blue girl - Zahn - was fine, but not "sexy". They literally got to the point where girls were running around in leather corsets and high heels of tearing aliens - now tell me what might be cooler than that ??? :)) <br /> <br /> The real reason Farscape has dropped out a bit is that it cost too much - and that's a good thing for fans, because the show watched from end to end is really like a 60-hour epic movie, with all the kinematics of blockbuster stuff (ok ok they use similar sets a lot, but CG is big and girls are sexxxy). Blah bla - the real reason is that TV shows are about PROFIT. It's a BUSINESS and Sci Fi channel, or one who hasn't gotten so much return to this expensive Farscape show as they could with a junk show like 'Stargate'. Actually, Lexx was fine until the hot German girls got rid of this strange weirdness. Yes, remember this: Farscape was still improving until it was really a real movie every week. Then the nets decided that "hey guys will watch any old piece of shots we put in the air if it's the only sci-fi thing in the hour, so why do we spend all that money on Farscape, let's shove the cheesy low budget" Stargate 'down the throats of people and say it' hit the series' because it's like everything we play every damn night LOL :)) <br /> <br /> So it goes. I also have to say that Claudia Black is a really great actress. After getting her facelift, she looked really great - one of those dynamic types like Judy Davis, and sometimes hot, sometimes ugly - like a roller coaster ride. I'd par Claudia Black with Lucy Lawless in style and substance - both very fun to watch - not just Chrichton :) And yeah, you can say that the pregnancy thing was cheese but how many sci fi it shows are the convincing and deep romantic subplot that actually goes somewhere and progresses ??? It was legitimately cool as a romance story - the actors on the show are great. It's really a shame that the show is still in limbo, but I hope it will soon return to other episodes and movies because I will deffinately buy them! :-D
