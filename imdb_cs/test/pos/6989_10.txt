Oh my God! It was one of the best Sci-Fi movies I've ever seen, and frankly, I can't build Sci-Fi movies. Vin Diesel and his co-workers made this movie really fun !! I also have to say that Vin Diesel is by far the most vulnerable and talented actor I've ever seen. Keep it Vin! your great! As for all the other good work. I thought the drama and tension kept the audience really interesting. again great work and I will take root for you Vin. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, <br /> <br /> Alexandra
