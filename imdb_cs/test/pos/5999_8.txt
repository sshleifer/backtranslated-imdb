Swift's socialism and pacifism are against all chances in this well-executed remake. (Did you know that after "well" is not a hyphen? Fact.) Meets war miniatures, socialist giants, heads in the clouds (literally) philosophers and pacifist horses who rule over Yahoos - almost Neanderthal humanoids. (Is this the place where "yahoo" comes from?) We also encounter the harsh Dr. Bates, a dedicated Mary Gulliver, sweet and devoted son, Thomas, and a full mysterious crazy asylum of the 19th century. Suspension of distrust comes easily and our 7- and 12-year-old girls enjoyed it just like my husband and I did. (Sorry for length, IMDb requires 10 lines.)
