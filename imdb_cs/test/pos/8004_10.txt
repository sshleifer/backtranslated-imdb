I don't know why critics consider it bizarre and scary. Not really. Dark eyes, bizarre - no. It's sad and with lots of emotions, especially with Pinguin's story. They say she has elements of S&M, but I really can't find anything like that except Catwoman's whip. This film is deeper than his genre, and the villains are not just crazy freaks who are dressed like masquerades. They have strong motives with strong feelings. Catwoman (great performance by Michelle Pfeifer!) She's not just a sexy cat who likes jewelry - she's on her personal crusade and Pinguin ... well, you really apologize to him at the end of the movie (Danny DeVito's powerful performance). Again, I think Michael Keaton is the best Batman and he carries his costume well. <br /> <br /> You can see that it is Tim Burton's movie because it has an unusual style and is a very talented guy. But also music is fantastic and fits into emotions.
