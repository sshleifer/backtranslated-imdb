I love this movie. At first I didn't expect much from this movie because I didn't hear anybody talk about it and it seemed to go to the video soon after it just opened in theaters. I also didn't think David and Minnie would make a good pair on the screen. (I expected a lot of pairs on the screen because I saw "You Got Got Mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle" with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.) Personally, I think Joely Richardson was supposed to play Minnie's part and vice versa. I don't know, I just think Joely should stay with David longer in the movie. They seemed perfect for themselves. But it just shows that in the movie, the girl next door always gets the guy. :) (As in "When you slept".) But I was very bad. This movie was fantastic !!! Everything went brilliantly. Bonnie Hunt did a great job. The lines were perfect with wise cracks everywhere. <br /> <br /> *** WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD !!! *** <br /> <br /> I love how everything intertwined. For example, at the beginning, Elizabeth and Bob talked about a trip to Italy and eventually Bob meets Grace in Italy. An example is Sydney (a monkey), who makes a hand with Grace, as he did with Elizabeth. <br /> <br /> *** NOTICE: SPOILERS END NOW !!! One thing I didn't like about the movie was a bit unreal. Well, I don't think a man could get his wife for a year when she was the only woman he'd been with for a lifetime. Do you think he would have isolated himself from the world for several years before going home to talk to someone. Instead, he goes blind for a year later and falls * instantly * in love with a woman he has never seen in his life but feels connected with. <br /> <br /> Everyone, that was a wonderful movie. I should have been crying two or three times, so I laughed countless times (the scene in the restaurant with Bob's picky date for bottled water was cheerful!). It's definitely there with great romantic comedies like "Do you have an email", "Sliding door" and "While you slept".
