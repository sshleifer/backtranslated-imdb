I saw Ray come out first. Why? Partially because of the advertising humbug, secondly because I just loved the fucking outa music of Ray Charles. But when I wasn't at the time when his greatest things in music and his life became, I wanted to learn more about his life. And in this movie I did it. His drug addiction was something I didn't know, and the film informed us. But here's the thing, while this was a decent autobiographical film ... I can't say it was a "big" movie. I saw "Malcolm X" and was blown away. Same with "What is Love to Do" and "Bird". The performance of each of these films was excellent. I wasn't just drawn into the main characters in those movies - who made incredible jobs - but those around them. This helps me make a picture. <br /> <br /> I felt that in some parts of this film it was shallow and heavy for emotional attraction. And yes, I admit that in some parts of the movie I almost fell asleep. And the movie was too long. And the film missed a few "other" important details of Ray Charles's life that would improve the film flow. The movie "jerked" me in certain parts. The film seemed to end with a whining, not a bang - a certain part, including the ending that played as a clipped "Lifetime" movie of a cable network. I expect more outa cinema. So - where does my ambivalence come from? With Jamie Foxx's performance. Overall, he did - well. No Denzel Washington's Malcolm X or Angela Bassett's Tina Turner is spectacular, but ... OK. and in others - thanks to the beautiful camera and lighting angles - "looked" like Ray Charles. But I paid attention ... acting. The actor has to convince you it's the character he plays. Don't make a character cartoon. Did I believe Jamie Foxx was on Ray's screen? Sometimes yes sometimes no. Did Jamie Foxx deserve the Golden Globe? You betcha. He deserves an Oscar ...? It depends on who is against. He has several major competitors and can only rob them. But then again ... maybe not. If Jamie Foxx doesn't win, I won't get up and say "he was robbed". I don't feel particularly that he was. It was a decent movie with decent performances and a decent story. "Big" autobiographical film of the last Ray Charles? No. Somewhere out there, I feel like there's a great movie about Ray Charles waiting to be made, and an actor who's gonna blow you out.
