I saw this movie through one of the actors, and that certainly corresponds to the great amount that comes from Sth. Australia when it comes to the overall * tone * that is properly dark and whimsical. I thought the little boy in the movie was excellent. Mostly, actors are gaming * * and embarrassed, but not in this case. He was really very good. As for * surrealism * the thing Jingo mentions so I think this movie is simple 'weird'. It's a real weird movie, with weirdo sites, a story, weird things going on all the time. But 'good' weird unlike 'bad'. It's hard to think of other movies like that, but it's not at all like CARS ATE Paris, perhaps more like REPULSION, but in fact I think more like the Hammer movie from the 60s. Surely he has an interesting mind behind him. <br /> <br /> JINGO, My question is also about the title. Why modern love? Anyone? Also, jingo, what did you mean by "god Forsaken" when you talked about Australia, hmmm? Just curious
