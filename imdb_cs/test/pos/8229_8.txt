I read the ashew comment and thought it must follow a completely different picture! I just watched the movie this morning and I was pretty surprised. <br /> <br /> To address ashew comments: <br /> <br /> Trail Street is a very well done western. And Randolph Scott was pretty good at that! Gabby Hayes was more fun than I ever saw him! Bad boys had very good benefits when it comes to me. Plus: <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see Robert Ryan as a direct player - a good guy - it's usually so slimy. <br /> <br /> In all, good Western, very well done and written. I liked the background of the Kansas story and the "winter wheat" that allegedly helped him become a state. I thought the girl who played Susan was beautiful - she couldn't think why she didn't become a bigger star!
