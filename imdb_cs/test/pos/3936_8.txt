Revelation is the dance ability of Lana Turner. Although privately known as an excellent nightclub and dance dancer, Miss Turner rarely has the opportunity to show this ability on film. So viewers will notice! Here, MGM was still trying to determine the direction the young star star would take, and so they entrusted her to everything from Andy Hardy to Dr. Kildaire. In "Two Girls on Broadway", "however, she is given an excellent opportunity to show her native rhythm and ability to move the pace in a rich production number," my wonderful one, let's dance. This number is conceived and filmed as a sort of hybrid between the extravagance of Busby Berkely's style and the kind of routines Hermes designed for Astaire and Rogers in RKO. So the number opens with George Murphy and Miss Turner showed up as a bar of patrons (with a full chorus) in front of the Black Chrome Curtain, where Mr. Murphy murders Miss Turner. Then the camera (on the shoulder) pulls a remarkable shot of the crane back to reveal a huge podium, and a swivel set equipped with stairs, columns, cabinets and sliding walls. From now on, Murphy and Turner perform a swift variety of moods and attitudes, including elevators, turns, soft boots and an electrifying series of linked pirouettes that end up with Murphy lifting and turning Turner with exciting speed into the racing orchestra. All said a dizzying performance that proves that Miss Turner was more capable than holding her as a dancer, though most of her admirers would resist giving up on her throne as queen of melodrama.
