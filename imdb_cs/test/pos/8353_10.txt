I thought it was an amazingly written film. I like little Scamp and the street wise Angel. This movie is very easy for young children to understand but a good adult movie as well. I liked this movie because it follows the original Lady and Tramp, and the film is a classic. Lady and Tramp 2 Scamp's Adventure was filled with new characters, catchy songs, brilliant animation and unforgettable classic characters. I loved the movie since I first saw it. I also loved how the different personalities of each character showed. It also shows the fall and good things to make new friends that you can hang out. My favorite song in the movie was always there because it showed different characters to share their views on how they feel. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who was a fan of the original Lady and Tramp.
