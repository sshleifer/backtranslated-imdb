Great movie. The movie was even better than advertising. And believe it or not, it was very inspiring. I really think everyone who leaves the film at the end will be inspired one way or another. I laughed. On some parts I laughed very much. Acting is basically above average, nothing special but better than average. I can safely say that it was the second most fun movie to be released this summer (CLERKS II is the most fun one). So after all this, I give it 7/10 (seven high, but not a total of eight).
