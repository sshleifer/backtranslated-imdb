Sergei Eisenstein's most famous film has really passed the test of time. The story of a rebellion aboard a warship in 1905 has a sense of Soviet propaganda, but it does a good job of showing the conditions that led to the revolt. The scene at the Odessa stages should remain in one's mind. Okay, so "The Battleship Potemkin" wasn't really the first movie to use photomontage. This film should definitely show any class of film history. It's a great historical drama (though I admit I don't know how accurate it is). And 10/10. And now we should learn that "Potemkin" should be rewritten as "Potyomkin".
