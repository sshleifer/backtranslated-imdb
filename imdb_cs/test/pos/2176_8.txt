I think it's the first time I've seen Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle. I really liked his (title) role as a butcher. The way he moves is, in my opinion, very funny, for example, how he handles a knife and throws a cigarette. I think he's a good actor; his facial expressions really fit the role he plays, for example, as he blinks at the end of the audience. You might add that it wasn't too hard. Anyway, I think he deserves a longer career. As you probably know, it was destroyed by greedy journalists who made money by printing false accusations that said they were involved in a scandal. The story is not very important. In the first half of the year, Fatty and Alum are shopkeepers and rivals for Almondin's affection. After a heavy food fight, Almondine is sent to a girls' school by her father, the store owner. (This is the beginning of the second half). Both Fatty and Alum enter the school on the move and the fight for Almondine continues. (Some character names differ in the version I saw. They seem to have replaced the original cover cards with new ones for some reason.) <br /> <br /> There are a lot of cork gags like food fighting and pratfalls, but in my opinion, it does well. And there are some gags that I liked very much, such as how the dog runs on a pepper mill (or is it a coffee grinder?), Or a scene where Fatty dons coat, although of course not necessary, or when the lady Teachem, the head of the girls' school, sponsors Fatty, and repays it back. Buster Keaton is also funny in this, his first film; a good addition to the cast. In the first half, he is a customer in the shop, in the second half he supports Alum in his fight for almonds. I liked his acrobatics, for example, when Fatty pushes him from one room to another, doesn't show a simple pratfall, but lands on his hands and head and makes a little pirouette. Watch out for one scene in battle with food: Alum throws a bag of flour at him, but lacks the store owner instead. This makes Buster laughter, which must be a rarity, because it usually always shows a neutral expression (which - as you probably also know - got the nickname "The Great Stone Face"). (One more note: Al St John, who plays Alum, was 'Fatty' Arbuckle's nephew, and later became famous for the role of 'Fuzzy' that he played in many Westerns.) <br /> <br /> they don't like me, like "One Week" and "Balloon" (movies that Buster shot later, without "Fatty"). And I was often not allowed to laugh out loud - but it smiled a lot, so I gave her eight points.
