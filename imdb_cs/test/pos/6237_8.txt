Some movies just disappear, but the Tourist Trap passed the test of time and rightly became a cult favorite. Although not entirely original - it owes much to the Texas Chainsaw Massacres, it holds its own with a sense of humor, true spooky moments, the brilliant score of Pino Donaggio, and entertaining performances of Chuck Connors and cast. Don't get PG reviews to take you away, this movie proves that gratuitous gore and nudity are not needed in any horror movie to make it fun. These elements are usually used to cover the lack of excitement in the film. Here, scares are deserving and effective. In addition, only Chuck Connors could carry the scene in which he must share the soup with the mannequin! Really classic scene. This movie is now more widely available on DVD in widescreen format and is a fan of the 70s horror movie.
