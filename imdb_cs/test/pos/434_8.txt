As a classic Hollywood musical, the plot is just an excuse. He has to see for those interested in the French music hall (including Ã‰dith Piaf) and for the magnificent 10-minute Cancan final. Dancing in the movie is not like what usually goes for cancan. Some may object to Technicolor costumes and bright lighting, but give you a clear look at some of the great costumes and sets. Consider that Jean Renoir's love letter to Paris grew up. Certainly Jean Renoir's film for people who don't like his serious movies or who like his Hollywood productions. <br /> <br />
