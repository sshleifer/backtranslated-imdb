Chokher Bali was introduced in (Washington) DC Filmfest on April 15, 2005. Director Rituparno Ghosh was there to present a short introduction and answer questions. As always, I think Aishwarya did a fantastic job. Can I understand those who think they should be more aggressive or ugly, but in 1904 would that be really realistic? Maybe, maybe; realistic, I'm not so sure. I think her interpretation was valid, though it might have been other ways to do it. I hate to use the word, but it was the most "inaccessible" Indian movie I've seen so far. I know that there are many Indian history, Hindu religion, etc., but the level of detail here was far behind me. Of course you would have a much better understanding of the film if you were familiar with Hinduism and its habits, esp. as they were c. 1904. I missed a lot of things - one of them was the fact that mother-in-law would want to consider Binodini in the house as a counterweight to her serf Ashalata. * spoilers * Ghosh had some things to explain to me that the movie is better for me. First, the original Bengali version was 20 minutes longer. What was left out? Apparently three main things: the beginning of the segment where Binodini (Aishwarya) leaves E. Bengal for Calcutta. According to the director, various characters of W. Bengali speak vs. E. Bengali - About some political notes later. Of course, all of this is lost in the Hindu version, and certainly non-Indians like me wouldn't matter anyway - but it certainly will have a Bengali situation. Next there was a segment where Binodini wrote a poem - a sign of her independence, etc. Finally, some other business about jewelry. Although some people think it was too long, I think the original, longer version would be clearer. Women 's hair was probably another sign (again Ghosh) - her mother - in - law had short hair (short hair for Hindu widows), her sister - also a widow - had longer hair (more modern!), and of course Binodini / Aishwarya they had extremely long hair in waist length (refusal of widowhood status). The end really threw me - suddenly Binodin, who never had political thought, writes a political manifesto? Hey! Ghosh explained that he was at Locarno, at the film festival when the headlines were finished. The headlines use the word "country" throughout Binodini's letter. Gosh said that a more appropriate word would be (I forgot his exact word) something like "I" or "independence" - she talked about her own liberation and "finding" - not Bengal, India and the British. . So why did Binodini just disappear the day after he found Behari again? Apparently because during his stay at Ganges he realizes that he doesn't need a man - a man - to define it. She can be herself. He refuses Behari, who was throwing himself on himself a few months ago (?). Of course I'm not sure how to buy another meal, but that's another question. <br /> <br /> The red scarf (again Ghosh) he buys represents a "revolution" and a "passion". I'm not 100% sure why she's putting a scarf on a dying woman, but maybe she refuses passion / revolution? Binoculars used by Binodini throughout the film (watch Mahendra and Ashalat, ship on the Ganges, etc.). She is a voyeur to see the life she desires, but she can't have. Finally (I missed it!) Leaving the binoculars on the letter desk, he shows that he no longer needs them - he goes away to lead his own life. Finally Tagore quoted at the beginning as he apologized for the end ... It seems that Tagore wrote it as a series, hooked his readers with sexy widow's pieces. Eventually, however, he sold conservatism and Binodini kneeled at the feet of Mahendra and Behari, begging forgiveness. One of his students (?) Wrote to Tagore to take him for his sell-off end ... and Tagore replied with an apology for the end. Of course, Ghosh goes in a different direction in the movie.
