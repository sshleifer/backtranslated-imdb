Anyone who correctly identifies introductory images when God kills without reading end credits certainly deserves a free ticket to rest in Transylvania. I would like to imagine it as a favorite movie on the dark box "Twin Peaks" in the movie night if there was time. I think a better title could be: "How much fun can you have with someone who is almost dead in a forest with neolithic technology?" The answer is enough. So, despite the stupid "God is killing," the uber-conceit (apt phrase taken from the previous letter), the more clearly "Alistair Crowley - Hi, I'm the Beast, I'm dealing with it!" than Christian cosmology (I can't believe another viewer had a strong head in this book to see the Judeo-Christian Bible) ... despite all this ... it's a bold, important job that most people shouldn't see. I am both amazed and climbed that it was at all.
