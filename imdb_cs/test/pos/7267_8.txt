.. the princess bride meets ... well Trainspotting. But wait, really, it's a good combination! This was definitely one of the best movies I've seen for a long time ... it has funny dialogues I associate with The Princess Bride or Cemetery Man, along with the disgusting scenes of horror violence ... the heroic feelings of the bride's princess combined with is special) lack of really good guys that Trainspotting had. I'm not saying it was as good as a princess bride, but it was in the arena, and it shook. Some of these dialogues go beyond pleasing, brilliant, the plot is interesting, the characters - even if they are SLIMLY anacronistic - are anacronic, not because of their natural nature (in the 18th century, unlike the comments of the previous reviewer, there were wonderfully homosexuals). a little bit of the language they used. Anachronisms made it fun, though, and not cheesy and easily rejected. <br /> <br /> If you've ever read any Simon R. Green, or Gleen Cook Garrett series, you know exactly what this movie is. Check it out. That's great.
