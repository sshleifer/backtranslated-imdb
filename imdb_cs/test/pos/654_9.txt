A very memorable comedy. It is fun to see how different situations evolve, and finally, after a long journey to this largest collection of eclectic humanity (and the world's largest honky-tonk) - the great American highway - converge. Just like the "mad, mad world" has a lot of contemporary talent, old boy politics, good comedy action and dialogue. Contrary to the fact that it is a goal that it strives for, not unwitting seekers - they have no idea what they want when they drift along the great American road. Nor do they carry the weight of having a big fall guy who is only stored at the end of a big belly-laughing. However, the final stunt sequence is nothing spectacular with excellent film cuts, humor and timing, and the urban bank scene is cheerful with a very original acting performance of one very talented character. The general destiny of the city's inhabitants in the face of chaos leaves the feeling that the proverb is flying on the ceiling. Slapstick is funny, but Honky Tonk Freeway deserves to be heard and attentively seen because it is surprisingly charged with nuance and character reactions that are easily omitted. All in all, a very funny reflection of who we are and are, good or bad, and the wacky situations in which we are.
