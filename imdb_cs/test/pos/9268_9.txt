I saw this documentary at the independent film festival Slamdance 2005. This documentary is filmed, directed and edited by the son (Craig) of a year-long battle between mother and cancer. Shooting over the course of one year "The closer" the document is in the truest form and gives you an inner view of the struggle of the family to fight cancer, the viewer gets an insight into the effects that cancer has. throughout the process. I've never seen such an honest film, it's a powerful and raw film, and since it wasn't shot by an outsider, you get the real emotions of everyone involved. Many documentaries are filmed by an outsider, but with the story being told by the son, the film adds another emotional level, as opposed to what I have seen before, or others. This is a moving story that everyone can see and which may concern. I warmly recommend.
