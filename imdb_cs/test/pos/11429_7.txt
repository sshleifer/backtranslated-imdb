This is one of Stan Laurel's best solo comedies before working with Oliver Hardy in 1927. Laurel is a very good actor in the film, and provides a good comedy. The best scene in the movie is when Stan dances with Mae Laurel (his real life wife) at Cafe Espanol. Tent makes silly dances that are funny without hearing the music. I'll recommend it to all Stan Laurel fans.
