In the spirit of the Great Space Path, but a few years earlier. Hot Fudge was one of the psychedelic examples I grew up on. Seymour was a big, fuzzy, green puppet, with a half-moon smile of huge teeth that almost split his head, wearing different shades of Elton John. He "played" the piano, and had Jesus looking in a white suit sitting beside him. They would have a moral discussion and then made a song about it. Remember nothing but the introductory theme, Seymour and Hippie. Nobody else I know he even remembers. I grew up in Jersey, so if it was made in Detroit as a previous post, it wasn't just local. Seymour reminded me of a lot of Sherlock squirrels from Magic Garden (other psychedelic kids show if he was there.) People always talk about LSD influences of 70's music and movies, but even the children's showers seem to have received the same. .
