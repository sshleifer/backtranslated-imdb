Romanian cinema is little known from Romania. No directors from Romania have come to the attention of the international public, as some of the other Eastern European countries, such as Hungary, Czekoslowakia or Yugoslavia, have succeeded. One of the few prominent directors in Romanian cinema is Lucian Pintilie, who 35 years ago directed the great film "Reconstituirea" - quickly removed from the circle by communist censorship. After this film, which is still a reference for Romanian cinema, Pintilia could not freely create in Romania until the communist government fell in 1989. 'Furia' reminds me of the film Pintilie 35 years ago. The title means 'The Rage' and I can't imagine why distributors decided to translate it differently. It's about a lost generation. While in the classics Pintilie is the root of evil in the oppression and lie of the communist regime, here young people have to deal with the emergence of a subculture and moral filth that filled the emptiness left by the totalitarian regime. rule. The end is tragic and painfully anticipated. The film is well directed and acting is good. Without too much complexity, an emotional connection between the characters and the viewer can be created. You might say that some situations look like "8 Miles" or "The Fast and the Furious" - but look at the date of production! This film was made at the same time, if not the Western peers. If this is actually Dan Muntean's first film, as the IMDB says, this is an excellent debut. Anyway, a good movie can compete and can sell well in the western market. There is hope for a new generation of Romanian films that will make their place in the international film scene with a bit of luck and good distribution. <br /> <br /> 8/10 on my personal level.
