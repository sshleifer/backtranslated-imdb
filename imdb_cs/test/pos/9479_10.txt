If you like Cagney, you will enjoy this movie. It has a pretense of American integrity at any cost, personal or social. Cagney plays in the NYC head of weight and measure. Cagney goes against the crooked politicians, the criminal underground, the prominent philanthropist, and the simple food merchants who add a few ounces to the chicken price. The chicken scene is cheerful where Cagney finds an unsuspecting butcher in a bird's cavity. Chicken fits around a merry-go-round business about who controls "evidence." If you like old phones, there are interesting scenes of dials, phones, and even bizarre phone cables. Compared to the many films that are being made today, it is pure fun and includes the mystery of comedy and message that honesty should be the guiding principle of mankind. Made in simpler times it reflects the world we can't find today. Fashion (especially hats) clothing and cars all play a prominent visual role in defining this small film.
