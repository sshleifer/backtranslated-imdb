I loved this movie !!! It was so easy to become a part of the lives of the characters and really feel the emotions they went through. A movie full of laughter, sarcasm, shocks and excited fantastic romantic dramas! The only part I didn't like was a special feature. The behind the scenes commentary was a little off. Because I saw a movie before I prefer that actors like characters (stupid, I know), but actors are very different from the characters they play. But still, his absolutely fantastic, magnificent, brilliant movie I recommend to anyone looking at this movie and thinking it should hmmmmmmm buy it? the answer must be clear yes!
