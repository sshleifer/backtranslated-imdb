This film deals with topics of loss, personal struggle and transformation in such a clever, refined, sensitive and visually stunning way that I was completely transported. It is a rare gem of film in the way it honors beauty and women. You'll have to see for yourself. Dreya Weber (Jane) masterfully portrays the subtleties of a remarkable, if not somewhat broken, personality by every woman. I found that the sincerity of the emotional interactions between the characters is very refreshing and deeply engaging. There was nothing in this movie that called me "low budget" in terms of quality. Nothing. The fact that it is a low-budget film is a tribute to filmmakers. The final sequence of credits will also set your socks off. It's a great celebration of Jane's choice. Unexpected and inspiring.
