SPOILERS AHEAD ?? The first ten minutes of Star Witness are introduced into the quotes of a typical urban American family that is in a nameless city, which is another way to tell the Warwick Brothers NYC version. Except for young children, including the charming Dickie Moore, and cute Sally Blane, they are pretty tough partners and their conversation with the dining table is boring and we wish the story moves and brings Walter Huston's star. But wait, guys, wait. Suddenly, a serious gangster film action breaks out, pulling the family against their will, and then never stopping the child. There's tension, an Oscar-nominated script, a good acting performance; all you want old movies to be? I have a question Chic Sales Performance; it must be an acquired taste, but its presence is essential to the conspiracy. It is treated with a special credit status, so Warner Bros. he had to be really on the sellout, but as his routine routine fits in with the public, something was lost. Maybe it's lost on a time period, an unknowable factor that you had to be a 1931 cinema to understand. Also the top is typically melodramatic. However, this is the best edition of the studio I have seen so far (however, I have only seen eight, so perhaps it is not a convincing view). Don't miss it when the TCM shows it. 8 out of 10.
