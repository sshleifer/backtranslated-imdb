If you had a mother who described you like that, you might want to tear her off. Danny DeVito feels like Anne Ramsey, it's just a way to put the plan into action. And his creative writing, taught by Professor Billy Crystal, gives him an idea. This and viewing the classic Alfred Hitchcock film Strangers On A Train, which gives DeVit the idea to change the murder with Crystal, who hates his wife, Kate Mulgrew, who not only cheats him on the book he wanted to write but is also carrying Tony Ciccone with hunky . Throwing Momma out of the train plays something like Strangers On A Train, as DeVito seems to have done his end to the murder system. But Crystal has a little problem putting Ramsey with Danny's help. The woman might need to kill, but she'll take a lot of it. The only recognition the Academy received by Throw Momma From The Train was an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Ramsey lost to Olympia Dukakis for Moonstruck, but the film proved to be her best hour. Ramsey already had a throat cancer that could kill her next year, but look at the list of credits she managed to tie up after Throw Momma from the train, she worked to the end. I saw interviews with both stars Throw Momma From The Train, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito, and both were pleased to admit that the performance of Anne Ramsey as a mother of hell made the film a success and stole it from under them . Their recognition of Ramsey's talent and performance is the best possible honor. If Marion Lorne was something like Anne Ramsey in Strangers On A Train, Farley Granger would like to approach Robert Walker to get rid of her. Throwing Momma from the train is one of the best black comedies out there, you shouldn't miss it.
