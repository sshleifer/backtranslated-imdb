I thought this movie was incredible. I really liked it, even though my brothers didn't have much. The special effects were excellent and this movie is about my favorite sport; golf. The only thing that was disappointing about this amazing movie is that it's hard to watch two or more in a row. This movie is all up all the rest I've ever seen. It was all I expected from the film. I loved it. Also it was quite child-friendly. This film has helped me realize that when you put your mind to it, anything is possible. I would give it a clean 10/10! It was better than The Legend of Baggar Vants and two Pirates of the Caribbean. Totally awesome. He loved it.
