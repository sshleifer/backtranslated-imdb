Darr (1993) was an incredible film. In my opinion, he's one of the best Bollywoods. The film itself evokes feelings of sympathy, fear, confusion, happiness and sadness. Shahrukh's role was incredible, in fact he gave an obsession to a new face. Juhi Chawla's innocent and girlish character contrasted with the fiery and passionate character of Shahrukh. The role of Sunny Deol as a "good guy" looks like a "bad guy". The fact that Shahrukh, not Sunny, has taken the audience's attention proves that everyone has such a helpless inner effort to pursue something that is not actually in their hands. Even though the film is several years old, it overcomes any recent. The song "Tu Mere Samne" was full of passion and meaning. His personality fits perfectly into the role. He should seriously consider playing again in a similar film.
