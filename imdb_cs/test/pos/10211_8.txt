I doubt the real story of Western Union development would ever get a real audience. Instead of talking about building a telegraph system in the West, it was the story of the meeting rooms, dominated by one of the most interesting (and unpopular) great "robber barons": Jay Gould. Gould picked up a fighting company and turned her into a communications giant - and part of his attempt at a national rail system rivaling Vanderbilt. Although interesting, it's not as exciting as the story of laying telegraph lines. At least the audience could see it. Jay Gould died in 1892. If he had lived in modern times and invested in Hollywood, he would probably have agreed to this assessment. The film explores how the Indians are threatened by the telegraph system, prompted one Jack Slade (Barton MacLane). Slade, desperate, is not satisfied with the development of a communication system that will surely rip his ability to avoid the police in the area. He is confronted by a man in charge of laying telegraph wires, Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), Creighton's associate Richard Blake (Robert Young), and quasi-lawyer Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott), who is Slade's brother. Blake, an Eastern man with little Western understanding, romancing Creighton's sister Sue (Virginia Gilmore), but it's hard to get used to the new environment. But he becomes a close friend of Shaw, especially in trying to face Slade. Slade, by the way, was a real Western criminal and was the subject of Mark Twain's ROUGHING IT. It was hung in the 1870s. But he had no involvement in mixing Indians against railways or telegraph companies. However, MacLane makes him an unforgettable evil and a totally bad type. His killing of one of the main characters is done suddenly and from behind - and he sees the corpse as if he just got rid of the annoyance. But Lang is responsible for it, just like the others. Look at the Chill Wills sequence where it is on the telegraph pole that fixes it. Several times, she drinks tobacco juice while talking to Young, who sprays a little. Then there's the Indian attack we're watching from the ground. Finally, Young suddenly splashes again, but it's not brown but red. He looks up to the top of the pole and there are Wills with an Indian arrow over him.
