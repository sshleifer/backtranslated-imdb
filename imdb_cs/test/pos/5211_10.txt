For the main criticism of the film ... Love Story: It wasn't a love story. They were two people who were upset when they tried to find humanity in ANYON. The same thing happened with the soldiers and the Russian boy. He added a feminine touch, but look at American movies ... not where the love story is close. There was no plot: does the war have a plot? I think it's stupid criticism. The story is. It starts with 400 men and the film narrows to show the life of about 10 men and how each of them participated and died. Death is the end of some story. Just because there was no happy ending doesn't mean he has no story. There was a terrible truth in this movie. I would not necessarily call it "anti-war". Of course, it was a political statement, but the film was not about politics at all. In fact, except for a few events when the captain? It turned out that Nazi Germany was never choking air. They were far enough away from the main Nazi party. Fat cats will not go to Russia! Maybe not a very accurate and not a Hollywood hit, but it has a good knowledge of a common soldier (I'd say it would be just about any nationality and war) and what it has to go through. It was a lost battle, of course the film would be depressing. And to the person who said it was gutsy (and stupid) to even portray the Germans as victims: there are victims in every war on every side (every real soldier tells you). This film is a delicate balance between film and documentary film. Some problems with arguing about one, but instilling the best of both worlds. Watch it as such. Be careful, however, because it's a hard movie to watch, if not graphically, emotionally. I'm waiting to make a movie about Iraq. He will probably have many of the same topics and will be very controversial, I want to see who has the courage to do it first. (Jarhead doesn't count)
