I was a huge Asterix comic fan when I was a kid watching everybody. I've never heard of this movie when it was released, but I watched it with my kids yesterday. I remembered the comics so much that I knew a lot was added to the film's story. Some of the changes I thought were somewhat frantic (just like the "nephew" nephew's modern nephew and daughter of the Viking boss - almost everything about her), but I found it most fun. Most importantly, seeing the reactions my children watched confirmed that the film was pleasing to its target audience. As a family movie, it works better than other Asterix titles I've seen. Many names that were not in the book I found had the same appeal as those that were. Overall, a friendly family movie, no matter if you are an asterix fan or not.
