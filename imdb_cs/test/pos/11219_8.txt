NORTHFORK is primarily a masterpiece of widescreen cinematography. The film itself is worth its time. The strong, wide open plains and the eastern Montana badlands are captured in the alternate, subdued tones of autumn or early spring. Huge gray cement Fort Peck Dam is the protagonist of the film. The film comments both gently and not so gently on about a dozen Western landscape issues. Dialogue may occasionally attempt, but images and concepts are strong enough to lift the film. The fifties period works so well and is executed so well. I think this year will be kind to this movie.
