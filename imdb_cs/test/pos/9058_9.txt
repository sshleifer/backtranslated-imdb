I went to see the movie with caution. Suicidal "comedy" did not seem consistent. Having a brother who tried to commit suicide and saw the devastation that caused our whole family, I know how devastating it can be to solve this question. I have to say - this film deals with a way that allows the viewer "inside" someone who suffers and just doesn't know why or how to stop it. While the film is not perfect, it respects the subject and it is more important to make it accessible to the masses. I know for our family, humor has helped us with a lot of pain. And Max and Grace are just what they're trying to be - a suicidal COMEDY. It's funny - and I also felt that the characters were real and alive. It is also extremely intelligent, yet simple. It stops chasing it and I appreciate it! I give him 9 and I recommend it.
