Warning, contains spoilers! This is one of the best Italian movies I've ever seen. There is a teenage girl on the site who is interested in occultism and has supernatural powers. No need to worry, the girl knows what to do and there is no return, she belongs to Satan. During the movie, weird things happen in a typical Italian way, not too much logic, but that's just a good thing. It's amazing how fun these movies are .. On the last battle we see her and her mother fighting each other (naked) off course) and doing some mysterious rituals, you can guess who wins ... why can't there be more movies like this? <br /> <br /> There's excellent music through the entire movie and the actors are in this type of movies pretty good, better than usual. Especially Anne Heywood looks and looks good. Gles and similar stuff so it's not boring at all. My rating is 10. <br /> <br /> Hopefully someone will release on DVD.
