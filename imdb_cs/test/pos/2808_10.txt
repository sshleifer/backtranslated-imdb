I really don't care that nobody on this line this movie, me, and that's what this review is about. Lou Diamond Phillips is great in this comedy role. that the line on the train ab ac is now an instant classic for me, cg is great, yeah the train looks a little fake, but wow aliens sometimes do rock ,, Todd Bridges, where is Arnold, and Mr. Drummond,, wow he was out of the loop , guess that's what jail does for you .. bullet train is en route to las vegas with senator for him to make a great speech, meteor just hit, and now all at once we aboard the train lost aliens and our heroic the cop must save the day to make it worse, his ex-wife is on board and arguing with him. I just thought that this movie was so amazing, you must see if you like the action.
