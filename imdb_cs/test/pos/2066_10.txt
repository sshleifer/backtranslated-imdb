Certainly a movie for people who are just asking for fun and who are not thinking about their films. A lot of events, lots of great dialogue (eg fun for quote), a bit of intrigue and things that break down everywhere. Samuel L Jackson and Geena Davis had great chemistry. Violent but not cruel. The fact that the female part was a competent action guide is a pleasant turn. <br /> <br /> You've seen the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoy it so much that you turn it on every 3 or 4 months in my favorite movies. At first I rented the movie because Samuel L Jackson was in the movie but was caught up in the events around Samantha's attempt to regain his memory and never looked back. <br /> <br /> All those brain people out there - break the infidelity once, take a little less seriously - you can really have fun!
