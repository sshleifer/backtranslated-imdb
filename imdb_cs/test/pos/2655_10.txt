2001: Space Odyssey <br /> <br /> Is it a Sermon? The history of mankind? Investigating the man's futile attempts to advance in technology just to destroy technology? Is it about the delicate balance of time and space? The Hour of Evolution? Or it's just a spectacular effect; Kubrick did just to show us the limitless possibilities of the film and to introduce the truth to us that images are extremely powerful than words? 2001: The Space Odyssey is all these things. One of the most interpretable films ever created is almost fun to analyze and discuss the ambiguous design of the plot and the events of the film than to actually watch it. But it is open to discussion deliberately; If Kubrick Explained the Importance of His Amazing Classics of 1968 (Rank 22 in the Top 100 Movies I Made, On My Personal 21st Most Popular Film - and Nominated for 4 Academy Awards: Director, Screenplay, Direction and Visual Arts, which they have gained would lose half of their fascination, all its complexity and a good part of its film value, and we would only remain with technical ingenuity, which in itself is worth praising. And there is a lot of time. 2001 is very elegic, and also coldly distant, separated.However, the emotional remoteness and slow pace justify a unique visual experience, 2001 begins with the ancestors of humanity apes who move from planet scavengers to hunters and toolmakers after they have discovered a giant monolith in the middle of their desert home, then (in one of the most nasty series of film history) ja as the bone was thrown into the air and became a satellite, it jumped forward a few thousand years into space, where astronauts discovered a similar object on the moon, and another film followed the mission of the space travel crew as they watched the monolith's signal through the universe, accompanied by their untrustworthy HAL computer who attempts to sabotage the shuttle and kill the crew before finally leaving a lone survivor of space and time (in the drug-induced surge that probably gave the hippies an epileptic shock during the day) to grow old, die, and be reborn "Star-Baby". Rival. This stimulation and emotional emptiness is also in sharp contrast to the most ironic movie scene; destruction of HAL. When the ultimate crew explorer turns off a machine bathed in the sacred aura of red light, Kubrick has always used it as a repetitive motive, HAL sang a beautiful melody, it's a strangely emotional experience. And it's all brilliant. Another remarkable aspect of Kubrick's masterpiece is the unforgettable voice of the HAL (calm, sinister, Douglas Rain), the minimal use of dialogue (Kubrick wisely believed his images, propel the film, give banal, useless lines to his actors) The best known is "Open the Door Under the Gulf of HAL", satellites dancing around in orbit to unorthodox music, the first, breathtaking shot of the earth; Slowly revealing the glare of the sun in front of it, playing the sound of blasting, triumphant horns. <br /> <br 2001 will always be a mystery, and will forever witness the film's strongest point: the visuals are stronger than writing, all from one of the best-known and best directors of the film whose unique vision has always been its own. /> "Open the door under the Gulf of HAL" -2001: The Space Odyssey
