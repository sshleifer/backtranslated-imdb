In my endless endeavor to see as many quality movies in my life I've come across this film on cable. I tried Hitchcock three times before, and I never had the feeling that the man's work lived according to the praise he had received. I've always felt it was good, not great (from what I saw) This was the best of his movies that I saw. Robert Walker is absolutely freezing, his performance is in a movie where Hitchcock wanted to go. Even average performance here damages the overall product. My favorite scene was his obsession to get a lighter out of the runoff (how exactly did he get his hand down there?) Bruno is a pretty convincing character, but I also loved the performance of Patricia Hitchcock as Barbara. The rest of Morton's and Guy's family were a bit dry and boring, but she added some flare to the film, as well as some better lines in the script. Finally, any thrilling movie, you'll live and die with your end. This one holds water, unlike several other Hitchcock movies I've seen. I wasn't really sure how it would end, which kept me on the edge as I watched and waited.
