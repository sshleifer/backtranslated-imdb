Rarely is there a film sequel that surpasses or even equalizes the size of its original predecessor. Such a movie is VIrtual Encounters 2. <br /> <br /> It's a couple of high school boys selling virtual sex to the whole area. If you like naked chicks, he adds that. Six-foot tall Chrissy Styler is an amazing specimen and you'll be dreaming about it for days if you're lucky enough to catch an unrated version. She wears only the right amount of body shimmering in her more nude scenes and her giant cans seem real. (= Giddyup !! <br /> <br /> W / Except James Cameron "Foreigners", "The Godfather Part II" Francis For Coppola "The Godfather Part II" and - Of course - Zuckers "Airplane 2" is the only continuing with a film history that has a classic film and improves on it. It is a criminal way in which the academy ignored this film, Nikki Fritz and the one who is tethered at the beginning (just like a brunette who gets to the end, all deserved Best Supporting Actress nods. Shame on you, Hollywood !!!
