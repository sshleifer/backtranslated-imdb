I saw this film at the Rotterdam Film Festival and I was pleasantly surprised. The photo is so stylish and beautiful, and the story is just not your average film mafia, actually the story is pretty much in the background. It is rather a personal journey of a middle-aged man who is imprisoned in the existence he had to live. The actor, Toni Servillo, is excellent, excels at "calm man". The girl, Olivia Magnani, is the granddaughter of the Italian actress Anna Magnani and lives up to the family name. <br /> <br /> If you expect your typical Italian movie, where everyone is screaming at each other, this is not your movie. You're not an average cliche and it's definitely worth seeing this.
