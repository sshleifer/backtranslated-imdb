The young, ambitious sister, Mrs. Charlotee (Rosie Holotik) is sent to work in a psychiatric shelter in the middle of nowhere. Within 3 days, she encounters strange events, even a patient in her bedroom watching her, but still remains. Mental illness patients are just a little eye (mainly a judge), but my favorite was an old crazy freak (Rhea MacAdams). The plot is fine at best, and acting is surprisingly fine, but after a while it will be a little bit more. But it's still fun, unpredictable, strange and original. Note: The thing inside the basement is hardly scary, so the name is a small banana.
