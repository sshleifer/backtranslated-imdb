One of the best movies I've ever seen. The performance of Louis Jouvet is fantastic. It's really a 'fill' part of it, and that's amazing. He's such a good actor that you can't think of anyone else to attend. And both Suzy Delair and Bernard Blier are like the standard French people trying to defend themselves against the murder ... <br /> <br /> The story is stunning and well built. You can feel the atmosphere of Paris for this period (which is about 1930-40), between the two wars ... Clubs, old small buildings, neighbors. <br /> <br /> All these things contribute to making a great movie.
