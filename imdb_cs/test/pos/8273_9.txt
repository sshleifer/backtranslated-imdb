When it was first aired at the Masterpiece Theater, it had a profound impact on me. It's beautifully filmed and acted. I immediately read Mary Webb's book and remained one of my favorite favorites. Janet McTeer is amazing as Prue and I was expecting to become a regular British drama scene. I think she decided instead to focus on the British scene. I was hoping that with the American success of Janet McTeer's years (with Tumbleweeds) this movie would be available again. Unfortunately, it has not yet been released on DVD. If someone out there is listening, please make it available again!
