I was really surprised when I came across this film on cable TV a few years ago. The story is a great example of how our country constantly changes and fights for it and uses it as needed. Conflicting desires of "people" and of government. The actors were fantastic in their imagination and I totally fell in love with the Tantoo Cardinal-she's so credible and was such a character in this movie as well as Rip Torn. The story was also a love story about the country, the past and the two main characters. I tried to buy this movie and I couldn't find it - but I would love to own it.
