"The Bride of Chucky" is one of the best horror films that have been released in the last decade and could be one of the best horror films of the 1990s. Chucky's girlfriend, Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) manages to find his battered remains after being sucked into the ventilator at the end of Part 3 and brought to life in a trailer park. Her neighbor, Jessie (Nick Stabile) and his girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl) are tortured by their uncle. (John Ritter) Tiffany upsets Chucky when she refuses to marry her, so she buys a doll with which to play. Chucky kills Tiffany and then transfers her soul to the doll she got. To put them back into human bodies, they must travel to New Jersey to obtain an amulet. Jessie sees this as an opportunity to escape from Ritter and embark on a journey, but not before Ritter is killed by Chucky and Tiffany. Along the way, several bizarre incidents force them to stop by the bed and breakfast. When more people are killed, they call their best friend (Gordon Woolvett) to solve the situation. They convince him that neither of them is a murderer because the police have started to deal with these crimes. He finds Ritter's body in the trunk at the back of the van. He thinks he was founded and confronts them about it. Chucky and Tiffany then turn to prove they've done it. The group steals a motor home and arrives at a cemetery. Jessie and Jade get Chucky and Tiffany to turn each other and give them enough escape. Chucky captures Jade and forces her to take her amulet. Chucky and Tiffany re-launch their controversy that gives Jessie and Jade enough time to kill both of them when the police arrive and rid them of crimes. Good News: I have to put as much money as props on the FX department, like Chucky and Tiffany as dolls look absolutely convincing. The scenes with them together are the main highlights, including a cheerful conversation where Tiffany advises Chucky on how serial killers in the 90s work. As has been said, the number of single-rows in this movie that are actually funny is incredible. Chucky gets most of them, but Tiffany also bursts some gems. It's actually more fun than what Hollywood is calling comedy these days. Gore is a rich and shocking reality. Several deaths in this film are actually original and creative. Turning Ritter into a new Pinhead image was a brilliant scene. The honeymoon couple was also a nice scene of death. For teen love, pairing with Stabile and Heigl works great. They have great chemistry and actually behave like a normal couple. I also have to admit that when I first saw this movie, I made a jump during certain scenes, and that shows what an incredible job director Yu did. Apparently he had learned enough to do the same with "Freddy vs. Jason." He knows how to set-up and pay-off, and here he shows some great skills that have Hong Kong influenced the look and style. He could be another great horror director if he continued his CV with films like the two. Nice soundtrack, too, like "Freddy vs. Jason." Bad news: It will be a great find for cheese film fans. However, this movie has a high cheese factor that can prevent a serious horror fan from having a good time enjoying this movie. The film knows that it is a cheesy movie and that it enjoys it, making it impossible for a serious fan to do things like single-layered boats. It's not so bad from the movie, but it has to be watched within the mind that it's a cheesy movie, and that the kitsch of certain scenes adds to the film, not to take it. Get out of this state of mind and find yourself in this movie. Final verdict: Fans of kitsch movies and other films called "Children's Play" will find a lot in this film. For serious horror fans, take a look at it, but keep in mind that it's not a serious movie, and that kitschy is supposed to be there and you might find that you like it. Rated R Graphic violence, graphic language, short doll nudity, dark puppet sex scene, some drug use and numerous drug references.
