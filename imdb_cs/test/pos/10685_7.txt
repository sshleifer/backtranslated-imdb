Okay, I'll tell you that some science in the "Doppelganger" (or "Journey to the Far Sun") is a kind of dope. The idea of ​​an entire planet is not revealed (because we do not see the other side of our sun at all - every astronomy student 101 knows that another Earth-sized planet would cause gravitational disturbances in other planets' movements. that they will regularly find comets and asteroids and moons. <br /> <br /> And the idea that the Earth's mirror image in some way evolved almost perfectly in parallel to our country, to English-speaking scientists and human counterparts for every person born on our Earth. ..that takes things from 'hard science' fiction and to 'Twilight Zone'. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it requires a fundamental suspension of critical thinking in order to be accepted and enjoyed. <br /> <br /> But man, this movie knocked me socks off as a teenager.I was still used to pretty cheerful, positive science fiction movies when the hero finally invites zil - even "2001" can be interpreted as a "positive" ending. <br /> <br /> But in this case: Thinnes attempted to anchor himself with his mother's path to return to his own Earth just to bounce back from his docking bed (something about the polarity not being reversed because His "twin" didn't do the same thing, Thinnes's "twin" seemed to be satisfied in his new home. get damaged craft for safe landing and try again, armed with new information that would allow him and his supporters to succeed. After all, he was a Hero and the hero always wins. Instead, Thinnes could not keep control of the crippled vessel, and the subsequent crash of the ship to the launch site was so terrible and destructive that he killed everyone (except the Chief Project Manager) and destroyed all and the Thinnes project. Thinnes never got home and he was unnecessarily perished, his secret was never revealed. With the exception of the Planet of the Apes series, I've never seen such a sad and unpredictable ending, and it's always stuck in my mind - especially the furious devastation of a crash scene near the beginning of motion (Did you know that a spaceship would never be fly again!) and the one at the end. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see this film again and see how well it has grown over the years.
