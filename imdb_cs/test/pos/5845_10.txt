Oz is located at the Oswald State Correctional Facility. It tells the story of confrontation, cruelty, violence, hatred and survival at all costs. In a place like Oz, you have to have eyes on the back of your head. This totally original, intelligent and convincing drama tells how warped life becomes as soon as you enter the gates of Emerald City. What is to become a professional establishment is in fact far from being. The show reveals some of the many shortcomings in the prison system, the underestimation of humanity that cold assassins are still able to keep, and one real fact: Prisoners are those who control the prison. This beautiful and somewhat surrealistic show teaches the importance of every life and helps to understand why most prisoners are there. This show may seem shocking at first glance, but to really say it, such a thing is necessary. Oz is a great depiction of hell on earth and how such a place teaches you some of the most important lessons you will ever learn.
