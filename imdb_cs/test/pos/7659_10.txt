Beautifully shot, the mind extends exploration of Gypsy culture in the context of their music. Travel the continent and experience the amazing musical styles of different Roma groups. It is a little misleading to say that this film is not narrated. It is masterfully narrated by the music itself, hovering tunes and subtititled lyrics to tell the story much better than the narrator should. Check out this movie.
