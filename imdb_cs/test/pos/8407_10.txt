Letter to the boys. I tried boys, I really tried! I was trying to watch this movie. I left the room when it was, or jumped on the computer as the woman watched her. This is her second favorite movie, The Godfather is the first (I love). I ended up with pieces of this movie and finally after a year of sitting and watching it. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I loved this movie. Dalton plays great Rhett and has his prey. Whalley plays wonderful Scarlett. Full of fire and sulfur and nothing stops her. My favorite scene is when she's overseas (Ireland?) And the government is about to pull down the peasant's house because he's behind him. rent. Scarlett gets all crazy about it and pays the whole debt, making a huge name for herself around this little town. <br /> <br /> All I say guys, you might want to try this movie ... especially if you're a fan of Gone with the Wind. It takes a little bit of getting used to the new actors, but I think you'll find them refreshing.
