"Gypsy" is perhaps the greatest musical ever written, so it's too bad that it's a film version of such disappointment. To compensate for this, we have this re-make, which, if not flawless, is a pleasant and well-made adaptation of the musical. The script is absolutely accurate, all the songs are included and the production remains close to the original production of Jerome Robbins. Bette Midler is a handy choice for Rose, her singing and personality Merman-esquire, and her acting splendor. Peter Reigert is a good Herby, if not a great singer, and Cynthia Gibb is straightforward, natural to Louise. In fact, a live recording of the 1989 revival with Tyne Daly could be a better idea if only because "Gypsy" is just more exciting on stage, but this movie is a great translation of a great musical.
