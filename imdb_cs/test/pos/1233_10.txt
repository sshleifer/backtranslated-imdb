Hi all Denver fans! I couldn't agree with you! This show was so cool and cute, I watched her as a child in the late 1980s. There are also other favorites among Denver, such as Care Bears and Rainbow Brite. I'm 24 now, but it's still one of my favorite shows and my favorite 80's cartoon. It brings back all the memories. The theme of the melody was also great, I get goose bumps whenever I hear it. Sadly, it took so short a time, but it remained a solid favorite. It's great that I'm not alone and there are people who liked them too. This is one of the cartoon performances I will hold for future generations. <br /> <br /> Viva Denver! :)
