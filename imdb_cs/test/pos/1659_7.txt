This 1955 film is followed by Tony le Stephanois, recently released from prison for stealing when he assumes a robbery of his life. He joins his old robbery friends and brings a rescue expert, Cesar of Milan (played by Jules Dassin, who also directed. He drove because he was blacklisted in the US as a Communist and couldn't work in Hollywood.) 1/2 hour during robbery. During this time, there is no dialogue and no music, just muffled sounds of kicking on the floor or drilling a vault. It increases tension and pulls you in. They get away with a few hundred million francs worth of gems, but the jewel offered by dancer Cesar brings their raid to the attention of the trio of brutal brothers. They go out to take a hideout for themselves and bring misfortune. A big ruse / gangster movie, but I prefer J.-P. Melville's films in this genre. This movie is like some lemonade I had last night. I went to a Caribbean restaurant and the lemonade was made from sugar cane. She also had a lot of ice and was heavy on lemons and left her quite sour (which I like). Sugarcane juice gave her a delicate, somewhat softer taste than real sugar, and the ice made sure it was cool and refreshing when I sucked it. 7.5 / 10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
