It is a beautiful but simple movie about one man who is led to find an answer, an answer that he does not necessarily need, but has his whole life structured. It is joyful, it is cheerful, it is wonderful, it is torment, it is delicate and dynamic, I say it's a genius. I have read Jonathan Safran Foer's book Everything Is Illuminated (Mainly Because I Heard Elijah Wood starred in the adaptation movie), and I was just enraged by the characters. I laughed loudly more than once. And every time someone talks about what it is, I hear the same hackney response, almost as if it were one big long word: "It's about how it looks, how it happens when it happened." But this story is so philosophical; it goes deeper than that. That conversation about ring and "in case." It's really one thought. Suddenly, this story combines from a simple search for inner metamorphosis and now I look at things somewhat differently. <br /> <br /> I recommend you rent it sooner if you read it because the book had many obscene, perverted stories that were not included in the movie, especially the history of Jonathan's family, which was not necessary for the film. A little trivia, as I have heard, is that Wood's current girlfriend has a portrait in this movie as a drummer in a band that Alex arranges to get out when Jonathan gets off the train to Ukraine. You spend half of the film trying to figure out exactly what it is about, and what Jonathan is about because his character is as tight as a turtle in a shell. It's amazing and, in my opinion, one of Elijah Wood's best films.
