I watched it on TV in 1989 and I regret that I was recording it. I was very interesting and exciting. It's amazing how events unfold, and his man catches the past with him. Acting is the first speed and the story is exactly what the title claims ... "Twist of destiny" ... but no one could escape the life this man had at the beginning of the movie.
