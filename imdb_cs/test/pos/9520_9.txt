Or at least after this movie you feel pretty high. It's the kind of movie that rollinging really refers to, even though it's in a totally casual, intelligent and open way that belongs to French. No, Catherine Deneuve does not spend the whole movie high (sorry to disappoint all the purians with the agenda) .. but one scene I refer to includes all the members of the wedding party - And it's a musical number! Anyway, everything fits quite smoothly together, and the unusual, bright, colorful family (Deneuve's mother is a lesbian, Deneuve her bon vivant daughter) alternately entertain and annoy us as a real family to do .. but because it's a movie that they mostly enjoy. Br /> <br /> I don't want to say too much about the end, but Deneuve ends up marrying a man twenty years younger. This is quite believable when we see how the relationship evolved over time, and how the two are naturally drawn closer and closer. The end is happy; and like the rest of the movie, satisfactorily unpredictable as well as the perfect pitch.
