You, Living (Mordant). I have never written the word before, but here it comes. Look at it. It's part of it - corrosive, but also funny. So aggressively funny. This is a dour film, sure, with so much dry dry dry wit and strange humor it is impossible to make it at some level. Filmed in a very loose style, often with a static camera and truly balanced, stable compositions, such as theatrical scenes, we see a short enactment. But it seems to be ordinary - which is not. Common life is shown to be tasteless, ironic, gorgeous, coy, and depressing. And impossible. We living, we must live, and because we are alive, we can also notice. Something like that. I think it was Ebert who said you laugh and you don't know why. Exactly. And the promo material somewhere said it was a cross between Bergman and Monty Python, and what they mean is that it has a dry, quiet, sounding view of the famous Swedish films by Ingmar Berman, but it has zany, somehow touching elements of British comics. . <br /> <br /> I'd say for sure, be sure to watch for at least half an hour. There is a part of me that I thought I was in the meantime - the rest continues in a similar gathering of small parodies and moments, and they gradually evolve, but there is no great plot to watch or culminate in the usual kind. A few moments later, even the attention to the storm, which will bring us out of everyday human events, is a few moments. Shooting is wonderful in its classic control, almost like a series of Gregory Crewdson scenes (and actually surpass the photographer). And acting, with all its common, non-glam humanity, is right on. A surprising, beautiful, special experience.
