OK. In the end, it's a horror movie that I do well. As soon as I heard the music, I knew that some effort had been made to create what I thought was a masterpiece of good ol'horror. Zombies, whores, booze, terrible snatches and much more. Great cast, well acted, well directed, well written - there was hardly a mistake. Even American actors with Irish / English accents have really downloaded it. I thought actor Larry Fessenden looked familiar to me. It was a missing tooth. Finally, I realized that this guy was in "Habit" a movie about vampires in New York. I thought he was excellent in this role. Now I wonder if he's American or not. His accent was so persuasive in "I Sell," that I thought he had to grow up in an emerald island, not in the US. Well, apparently he's born and raised by the New Yorker. Great actor - he really did his own role in this movie. Nothing favors a horror movie that took place in Europe in the early 19th century (just like an old hammer.) I encourage anyone who wants to have a great time watching this well-made movie.
