I first learned about the last days when I rented a DVD and was interested in being a member of the LDS Church. I found this movie very cordial and in some areas it made me cry. The reason is that many years ago I met a young man who went through what Aaron (played by Steve Sandvoss) in the Latter Days, but unlike Aaron, this dear young man did not survive the suffering. He ended up taking them life after his church, his friends, and his family denied him because he was gay. There have been many people who don't think the things that are mentioned in the movie really happened on this day and age, but it's sorry and the sad things they do. For those of you who are gay and young, you need to see this movie and if you're gay Mormon, you really have to see this movie. In addition, if you access the DVD, the DVD help is available. Teenage suicide in the homosexual world is very worrying and this film touches it, but that part is hidden to some extent. The game and the music are excellent. This movie sold out every movie house that showed, but it just showed up in big cities and had a very limited edition, so for those who would like to see this movie I would recommend the release of a DVD. The only people I know who do not like the film are the members of my own church and have not seen a film about the homosexuals and the LDS Church. Watch the movie, experience the story and feel that the emotions that are presented in this film will not be disappointed.
