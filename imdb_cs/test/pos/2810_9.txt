Surprisingly good for T.V. Thriller. I didn't expect much from this, but I'm glad it's one of the best of its kind. It's a fast pace and offers solid acting and interesting events. <br /> <br /> The story gets you hooked from the start and with many hits, you can't help but find the movie very interesting. The story of Thiessen's character is hard but turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood father's father. The term "alien" and his actions are worrying if you think this is a common disease in society. Serial rapist does not respect society or his own family, and this film perfectly displays illness and crime. My beef with the film was a pointless situation when Thiessen's character returns home with his wife, who was released on bail. At that moment, she knew what he had done to his young relative (played by Allyson Hannigan). But that's just a typical Hollywood scene that provokes more trouble. The culmination scene shows Thiessen to follow her husband when he is about to commit another rape, then calls the cops who come in time to catch him. The end tells us that my husband was sentenced to 99 years in prison in real life. Acting is also pretty good and Tiffany is great and gorgeous as ever. The direction is also very good.
