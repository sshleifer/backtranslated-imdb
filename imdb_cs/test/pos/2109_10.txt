GRAND CHAMPION undoubtedly has the most impressive cast of AAA stars and musicians who have gathered for a fun "G" adventure. This is a MUST BUY for each video collection! Director BARRY TUBB skillfully combines the rodeo / 4H drama for "GRAND CHAMPION" with a moving and witty story of perseverance against challenging challenges. Joey Lauren Adams brings her typically solid performance as a well-meaning mother, but the star of the show is 12-year-old EMMA ROBERTS, whose presence on the camera is shining like her famous aunt JULIA. You can expect a lot from this young Roberts-protected, as he has proven himself in his new hit series, Nickelodeon, "UNFABULOUS".
