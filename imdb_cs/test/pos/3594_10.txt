Most of all, I enjoyed Corfu's scenery in this film because I love Greek and I liked the flattering view of the director. Based on a true story in the years when Greece tried to stand on its own feet, war, Nazis and hardships. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love, but times are tough and have lots of casualties. Great in uniform, Nicholas Cage gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled (early) love. I adored Christian Bale playing Mandras, the husband who is the hero of the hero, looks very good as Greek, his personality corresponds to the Greek patriot! A true fighter there or something! One of the movies I want to buy and keep in my collection ... forever!
