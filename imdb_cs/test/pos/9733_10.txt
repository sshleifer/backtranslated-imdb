First of all, I hate Sci Fi Stuff, And although this movie got a little Sci Fi at times, it's okay because in the least it focused on Andre Toulon. In the last three years, Andre seemed to have some kind of mention, but the stories never focused on him, which made me angry. What also makes me mad is the amount of 0 on the voting chart. Give him the rest of the people. If you saw this movie and like it, vote for it. Please. What I Loved About this movie is that it went back to Where it all started. When Andre first learned the Secret to Life. I would recommend Renting if you have previously seen a puppet master movie and liked it. But don't rent it if it's your first time viewing one of the PM Collection, mainly because you can think that all puppeteers are like "Dull" like this.
