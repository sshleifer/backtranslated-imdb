This animated short is a remake of one of Tex Avery's short shorts for Fred Quimby on M-G-M (Dog Gone Tired). The escaped convict (here only known as Joe), who just broke out in 'Alka Fizz Prison', is trying to keep up with Droopy (known as Sgt.McPoodle of the Mounties), but he always runs into it. or another. It is easily one of the most lateral fissures, humorous shorts that rolled off the M-G-M studio animation. It manages to get most of it is laughing out of shocked reactions Joe has whenever he meets a McPoodle (including some equally climbed sound effects - ie. Car horns, screams, elephants, etc.). As with Avery M-G-M, frantic, kinetic stimulation is to be expected (along with some nice, surrealistic gags - ie, Joe is trying to escape from McPoodle and actually escape from the movie). Pop this into your DVD player and laugh silly.
