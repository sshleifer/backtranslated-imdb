Like all good art, even this movie can mean different things for different people. For me, this means that if you don't open your hart to others, it can rob you of happiness and leave you empty. The comfort of selfishness is like unhealthy food: it feels good, but in the end it can make you sick. Almost everything I see in the US is the commercial mass production of action garbage, shallow dramas and silly comedy, and this sensitive, deep and poetic film really touched me. Thank you, Nuri Bilge Ceylan (and everyone else in the cast)! Ivan Yanachkov
