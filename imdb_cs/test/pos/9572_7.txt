I love the mockumentary format that Chris Guest and crew have developed over the years. I actually like this and "wait for Guffman" better than "Spinal Tap", which was the first band (and did Rob Reiner but played Guest and several other his mockumentary regulars). This humor is not for everyone. It is somewhat subtle and not very physical, so some people may not. However, as a dog lover (and a show exhibition fan), I loved this movie. There are so many funny lines in it! My daughter and I often quote them. I find it amazing that these people can ad lib so much funny material for every movie! What a fun bunch must be. I highly recommend people who prefer humor to the brain.
