Beautiful, emotional and gentle. I watch this film in a small-screen art center in a movie room with 95% of seniors. I wish there was a bigger cinema like Lowes here. Great cinematography of Wong and Christopher Doyle. Because I understand the cantons, it's much easier for me to understand the film. As simple as the story, many English-speaking viewers did not get the whole story. Three old ladies next to me still go and have no trace of the film. <br /> <br /> Spoiler; They were surprised to mention that Mr. Chow had slept with Mrs. Chen and had a son. She went to Singapore and tried to tell him, but not. The Spoiler <br /> <br /> In fact, the translation of the Mandarin film name means flowery as moment or memory. The phrase usually used to describe beautiful and wonderful memory that was inpermanance and short. The whole film fits to a large extent with the title. Not to mention the flower "Cheung Sam". <br /> <br /> My favorite scene was definitely a street corner in the alley. It looks so beautiful, the sun shines on the old and faded walls, at night in the dark, in the rain, indeed a poetic moment. I felt a strong sense of intimacy in their relationship as they stood against the wall and spoke quietly. I felt a terrible grief when Mr. Chow practiced his departure moment, and Mrs. Chen screamed on her shoulder ... Bravo Wong Kar-Wai! <br /> <br /> Like I like, Chungking Express top my favorite. However, I will also give it 10. As a landmark, CTHD got only 7. <br /> <br /> If you love art, you'll love this movie. Don't miss it.
