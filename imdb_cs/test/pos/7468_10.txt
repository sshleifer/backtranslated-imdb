This movie is excellent! To this date APR, 8 2007 it was on demand from the show time. From the moment I saw it, it was a moment, but in the first role I saw, it's Thomas Jane. First you see a normal guy who seems to be a bit henpecked, with a wife who seems to be on her way to her own way. The directors cut that I just watched has a splash scene that's cool. Paulina Porizkova is dressed as a cheerleader, looks very fresh and warm. Trying to buy coffee late at night without small bills is in a hurry, Paulina shows her name on her jacket is a real deal. The meeting with his old friend on the road, Nick, played by Aaron Eckhart, was fine at first, and he even lent his wife's car to a store. Then he notices a silvery silver briefcase and the day changes for strange and violent. There is a cast of real characters that pass the next series of scenes. But, Paulina Dallas steals the show I think. Her story of Casey's story to a doctor who is there to get a personal interview in an adoption application is offensive. As a rule, I never thought that tall women are so sexy, but there are exceptions to other rules. Paulina is how she has never seen her in movies before. Sexy and deadly, like in one movie with Tom Selleck, but with never seen evil. If your movie search adds to your collection, this one is worth the price. Paulina in nude is worth standing for herself, but this story has everything one could hope for. Love, friendship, sex and violence in an amazing mix. When I first saw him years ago, he fired my mind and I know you will feel the same.
