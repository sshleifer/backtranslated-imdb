In the last ten minutes of this exceptional TV series, I was blubbing as an idiot. I have to say that the idea of ​​sitting down for 90 minutes of what was quite depressing on Sunday was not welcome. The idea of ​​another, a great one, the BAFTA winning option didn't hit me ...... However, the final result knocked me down to 6. This is one of the best TVs I've seen in age. For years, I was under the impression that the BBC's drama department left all the originality. Our friends in the north were the last production that really fired me and that was 10 years ago. But faith is restored and honor is satisfied. David Tenant was incredible! So many actors I would have thought would really go to the city, but I never saw Mr. Tenant as an actor or a doctor, all I saw was Alan Hamilton. Since Daniel Craigs spoke as Geordie Peacock all these years, I didn't have the heart as I plucked so much. Sarah Parish was also incredible, and I really hope that this role will bring her better roles in the future. The whole cast was great, but a special mention must go to the director, who actually put us in Alans' head. Especially the toaster scene made me feel quite uncomfortable.
