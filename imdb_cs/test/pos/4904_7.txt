A lovingly created and terribly interesting look at Garfield's daring, breakthrough performance (representing a new kind of rebellious acting style that would translate into Brandos and Clifts, and so on after the war), but all that nursing affection is a little choking. Priscilla Lane is a clear, engaging performer, but the other sisters didn't actually register (even though they're all allowed to be cupcakes and funny) and I had a hard time buying Garfield with one of the other male characters. Jeffrey Lynn is a pleasant actor but lacks the weight of the movie star to deal with Garfield's luck, Mickey Borden, and the movie is blown away. (Imagine Jimmy Stewart or someone in that part.) I was also not convinced that Garfield would make the key (at least) final decision he made. The film needed another half-hour run to better explain this action; it is terribly hurrying and under-motivated. Yet it is not difficult to understand how someone who grew up with this picture remembers them. It's not a classic, but it contains several classic moments. Two scenes with revolving gates are purely film magic.
