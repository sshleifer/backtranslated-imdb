The incredibly sexy Rosie Holotik plays Charlotte Beale, a new sister in one of those film asylum institutes, where an authorized physician has her unorthodox ways to treat prisoners. Reluctantly bringing her aboard is committing Dr. Masters (Anne MacAdams, a.k. and Annabelle Weenick). Inmates don't take too much favor on Charlotte. Part of the secret, part of the horror movie, this initial effort by director B-film S.F. Brownrigg has an oppressive feeling for it. These colorful psychoses, including a nymphomaniac without self-confidence, a tender giant who has already had a lobotomy, and the supposed "judge" who speaks in legal jargon, control the screen with their disturbing presence. It's a picture that works pretty well, creating a daring, grim atmosphere right from the road. Some short occurrences of graphic violence also help to give good old-fashioned exploitative quality. It builds in intensity when an imperial heroine tries to keep her common sense and offer one surreal encounter after another. Particularly effective is citing poetry, the crappy old Mrs. Callingham. For cheap cheeses from the 1970s, it's quite effective, with a particularly ugly climax. I had a pretty good time to watch it. <br/> 7/10
