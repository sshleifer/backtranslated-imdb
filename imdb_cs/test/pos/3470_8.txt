A surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find a common ground, and especially the "flowering" of one of them. The upset youth of "Spike" (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is housed in a house for the disabled and quickly follows up friends with youth (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson never knew anything outside the home, but McAvoy has and is determined to return to the real world. Together, they manage to overcome physical flaws in this humorous and pleasing and often heartbreaking inner strength fairy tale. Both leaders are amazing, especially Robertson, who must certainly spend some time studying the disabled to withdraw this complicated role. He appears in almost every scene, and acts to an absolute storm. For anyone who doesn't know, they might think he's really CB. Highly recommended.
