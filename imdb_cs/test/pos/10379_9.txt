You do not know why some people complain that this film is not comedy and at the same time is unrealistic. If it were realistic, there would certainly not be much comedy. I also don't think comedy would make you laugh 20 times out loud. There was a lot of gentle humor, sweet feelings, and Kim Frank just portrayed a dreamy character. In real life, there are many people whose facial expression doesn't change much, so Kim Frank, who has kept his position, was fine. The end was quite unrealistic, I would say, but happy. It's a fun movie with a good ending. I liked it. Actually, he loved it. Krueger, who went to Schwedt, was a serious part, and I am glad they did not show what happened to him. He shows how he was when he came back, as clearly indicated.
