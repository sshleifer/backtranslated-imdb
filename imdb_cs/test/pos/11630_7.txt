OK. Is Barney the Best Children's Show of All Time? Of course not. But in some of the comments left by other IMDb members, you would think it was a multi-million dollar production with high-ranking actors and a ridiculous budget for special effects. Well guess what? It's Barney for God. It shows children good behavior, good domination and it is okay to be who you are. For those of you who find it uncomfortable because you don't have five years and the exhibition wasn't meant for you. I think an IMDb member who wrote the first page review may have gone too far. Did you actually describe the Sesame Street sign as "Down on Earth"? Everyone grows up, it's a great show for preschoolers and actually helps kids learn in a fun and creative way.
