"House Calls" is a wonderful romantic comedy that can best be described as "how they used it." He plays Walter Matthau (in one of his best roles) as a recently widowed doctor who goes to the dating scene again and hits paydirt as if he has a different woman every night. Then she meets Glenda Jackson, a hospital patient, and develops a relationship with her soon. But it is the one that will be rigorously tested when informing him that he is a man of one man and expects to be one man. This is a sweet, very funny movie that also plays Art Carney. Senile Hospital Administrator and Richard Benjamin as Matthau's friend and doctor's colleague. It is necessary to see for every Matthau fan or any light comedy fan. You will not be disappointed.
