Much better than expected. Good family swing - catch it on repetition. The whole is more than the sum of its parts. Paul Giamatti chews the scenery - has more talent than the role he deserves. Respect to follow Inspector Uhl from "The Illusionist" to go over the top. Blue man scenes had my 11 years in stitch. The creature was special fun for parents - nice to see Lee Majors and Urkel again (umm, Jaleel). It will be hard to figure out 10 lines for this movie, but let's hear it for a movie that promotes honesty between the child and their parents! Amanda Bynes is doing a great job of becoming a sting. I can't normally build Frankie Muniz, but it's fine. Hats to Casting Director - Only If You Want Giamatti!
