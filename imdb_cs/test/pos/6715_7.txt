Lifeforce begins in space where HMS Churchill watches Haley's comet and its equipment detects a 150-mile extraterrestrial ship headed by a comet who is unable to contact Earth for intervention Colonel Tom Carlsen (Steve Railsback) decides it's the only chance to explore it. Going out in the suits of Carlsen and some of his crew comes into a mysterious ship and finds the remains of a bat as a creature race and three perfectly looking humanoids, two men (Chris Jagger and Bill Malin) and a beautiful woman (Mathilda May). whom they take on Churchill. Thirty days later and back on Earth, Churchill is detected on the radar, a rescue mission is only sent to find that the ship is being fired and all crew members are reportedly dead. However, the rescue team will find three humanoid aliens and take them back to Earth, where they will return to life in the London Space Research Center and literally suck in the life force of human sacrifices, which in turn need to do the same. they cease to turn into dust, things look grim as the epidemic spreads across London ... <br /> <br /> This English production was made by the notorious Menahem Golan & Yoram Globus, which was responsible in the early 1980s For a lot of cheap low budget flicks action under their production company Cannon usually play Chuck Norris & they wanted to move to a great time and signed by director Tobe Hooper out on three movie deal (which were Lifeforce, Invaders of Mars (1986) remake & The Texas Massacre) Power Chainsaw 2 (1986) is a continuation of Hooper's own classic, which is nothing to be said, but despite being a commercial flop at the box office, I have to say that Lifeforce is a very funny, though somewhat stupid, science fiction horror movie. theaters back in '85 Lifefore was reduced to 101 minutes Golan & Globus, but in the last few years the longer 116 minutes cut has all but topped it included DVD, VHS, Laserdisc & TV, although Hooper's original film cut was 128 minutes long, so there are still more shots there. My comments will be based on a longer 116-minute cut, the script by Dan O'Bannon, Don Jakoby, and the uncredited rewriting of Michael Armstrong and Olaf Pooley, based on Colin Wilson's 1976 novel The Space Vampires and many extraordinary thoughts, that is the range is really ambitious & one feeling that it will end up being a bit of a mess, but hell a fun one. He moves like a rocket and there is a really interesting story in his heart, even if the film gets into a mess. There are also some merry moments in Lifeforce, a scene where a security guard tries to convince a nude woman Vampire to give up by offering her half eaten biscuits is a real camp classic, a terribly crowded hypnosis scene, including where Railsback ends kissing \ t t Patrick Stewart and many others. I don't know, call me strange, but I thought Lifeforce was a great fun and very entertaining in almost every direction, from stupid character, strange dialogue, strange ideas that never meet, and some amazing Lifeforce visuals is definitely not a movie that you will be bored. Director Hooper had a little more money than he ever had (twice what he had for Poltergeist (1982) even) & uses every bit of it to bring this magnificent movie to the big screen, John Dykstra guy Responsible for Star Wars (1977), Star Trek: The Picture (1979) and more recently Spider-Man (2002) has been put into work on visual effects & generally speaking look fabulous. Outer space sequences, especially spacecraft, look great, there are also really good visual effects on Earth, including the destruction of London, when around 100 years of blue souls. There is some nudity, but not much gore, there are some dead corpses, a few gunshot wounds, skin on one's hands peeling off, blood gushing from one's eyes, nose and ears & there is separate arms as well as some zombies. Special makeup effects are also generally very good. I wouldn't say Lifeforce is as scary as it's a science fiction movie than a horror movie, I loved how the Hooper shoots the universe sequence as it constantly rotates the camera to effectively sense the weightlessness and that there is no "solid" floor as it does it was. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of around $ 25,000,000, it did less than half that in its theatrical run & didn't set the world on video or DVD, which is a shame because even though it's a bit of a mess, it's very nice to watch. Shot at a location in England. The 2: 35: 1 cropped image, cropped in 2: 35: 1 format, is a 4: 3 cropped image and removes vast parts of the information from both sides of the screen, most noticeable when opening scenes in space where it is sometimes it is difficult to discern what is happening and the sense of space and the spaceship is lost. Acting is fine in a very silly movie, Patrick Stewart replaced Sir John Gielgud, Nancy Paul replaced Olivia Hussey, Frank Finlay replaced Klaus Kinsky, while Anthony Hopkins turned Caine down. Life forces are a bizarre movie, no two ways to really & anyone looking for something simple & straightforward should look elsewhere. Anyone looking for something a little different in the sci-fi genre than giving Lifeforce a go because it's one of those bad ones it's good movies with some impressive effects & it's not your average mill film run in any way.
