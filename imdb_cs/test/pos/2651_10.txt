Not only unique by its time, but one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. Made without CGI on a very lean budget in today's edited numbers. Stanley Kubrick has made this film without a high shooting ratio, which he usually has. Undoubtedly, Stanley Kubrick is the greatest director in history. This film was shortened from five to two hours and twenty minutes and the artistic direction was excellent. Stanley Kubrick and the great Aurthur C. Clarke have worked together to write this less classically. An alien special message on Earth at the dawn of man and one on the moon that modern man finds. Finally, people, along with the most advanced computer ever created by Jupiter, will find another monumental message that turns out to be a gateway. Anyone who has studied film and / or wishes to be part of the film industry or just enjoy great movies must experience this film. <br /> <br /> If you don't like it, then you belong to Bollywood or your right Aussie.
