Give Williams a certain degree of fame with this movie and have really wasted it. Don't be discouraged by his bad movie choices ever since. This movie really excels. "Hair" is a musical that really deals with the attitude and probably the personality of the famous peace movement of the 1960s. There's a lot of spectacular music. Unlike music videos from the late 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, video flashes match the theme of music. In other words, the video makes sense when it is in line with the songs so you know it was never possible on MTV. The subject deals with drugs and hippies, but mostly it is an anti-war film dealing with the nonsensical tragedies of Vietnam. One of the protagonists is an Oklahoma boy who intends to make a difference, believing that all patriotic dribbles are spoons, and he becomes a New York gang that is more or less glorified. their characters are very unique and apparently it wouldn't make sense today, but this band will merge by burning their cards. What comes from some spectacular scenes and fascinating scenes including not only three leaders but three other gang members, as well as a newcomer with a small child whose entry is easily one of the ten most noble entrances of all time in the cinema, partly because he sings one of the greatest songs of this generation . Despite their flaws, you love these people, a movie triumph with a heart and a grand finale.
