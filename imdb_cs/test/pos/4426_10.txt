I just returned from a tour of this academy, which was nominated for the Academy, and I was thoroughly touched and interested in the work of this colleague I had never heard of before. Of course I am someone who is fascinated by beautiful architecture, so I realize that others don't care. We can only imagine that there were more visionaries in Philadelphia in the late 1960s, when Kahn was. The plans were the possibility of what a wonderful city center would be. If you are wondering if you will learn more about the Bangladeshi building at the beginning of the film, be patient because at the end it will be the culmination of the film. His son's personal discoveries in the process of making this film are quite interesting, sometimes touching and sometimes funny. There is one of the most comic anti-visionary praises ever captured on camera. Round the good points of this documentary is a moving musical score with some outstanding expressive string music. And expressiveness is the main point that can be found in the Kahn architecture. The points raised by other architects about the spiritual nature of matter and how Kahn's buildings brought these things combine the overall experience of this film.
