Canadian filmmaker Ron Switzer delivers a solid, continuous exciting ride of relentless horror with outstanding science fiction film "Science Crazed". Terrible monster to avenge his mother, police officer and tenants of the apartment building. Brilliant practical makeup and special effects create a truly frightening monster, especially when lurking with atmospheric shadows and the smoke of the gloomy setting of the apartment. Characters are developed beautifully with excellent and surprisingly moving cast performances. Donna Switzer, a newcomer to Ron Switzer, has also written a screenplay that united the engaging ride of twists, turns, and horrors to keep you up to the last slide. Science Crazed will undoubtedly leave ghostly long after the shocking conclusion. Highly recommended!
