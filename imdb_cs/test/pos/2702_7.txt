Every time I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, there is the old familiar feeling of the 70s. What a tremendously beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb, cast in the title role, has a good job, but I thought Karen Allen would be a better choice. This is a tearjerker film that does a great job of presenting a professional career to Karen and Richard, but also the personal struggles Karen has dealt with and her illnesses. The recordings in Herpa Albert's studio are very nice. However, Karen Carpenter has proven to be a time when she was very special and brought great pleasure to her fans and music lovers. Even if you weren't a Carpenter fan, it's a nice story that captures how great talent can become a victim of society's pressures.
