I'm not a big fan of Lucio Fulci's movies. Most of his 1980s had moments, but often appeared as imitations of the imitation Dario Argento. Except for the fun "Zombi" (which was an imitation of George Romero), I didn't like them very much. I know that the Italian horror often overlooks the plot, but the story and characters in his films were too far, even standards. That's why "Don't Cheat Duck" me. It is actually a very well made film with a mysterious mystery of murder. His perhaps best giallo ever did, just seriously competing with Dario Argento's genre records. And unlike Fulci's previous giall "Lizard in the female skin" it never surprises. Fulci's direction is pretty good here. It keeps the story at a good pace and keeps the viewer interested around the world. Also, the conclusion to the mystery is a complete surprise for viewers. In addition, it adds some clever touches, such as positive soul music during a particularly disturbing cemetery sequence. Overall, violence is restrained and used only when it is necessary for the story. Acting is also largely good, full of familiar faces from the 70s of Italian cinema. Both Thomas Milian and Barbara Bouchet are super cool all over the world. The only weak link is Florinda Bolkan, whose performance is too high. It's the only laughter aspect of the movie. "Don't Torture Duckling" definitely comes with my recommendation and can be a good introduction to giallo subgenre as a whole. (8/10)
