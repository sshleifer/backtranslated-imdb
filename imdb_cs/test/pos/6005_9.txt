This production was very well done for the TV original, which gave Swift's work a very original slope. To make the picture work well, Gulliver begins the film, which comes home. Anyone who has read the book knows it will. The frame story of the book has Gulliver's crazy confusion in the sections. For example, he is terrified that he tramples little people in England because he has just returned from the land of giants. But the film has all sections of the book during one long journey. When Gulliver tells his travels, editing the cuts from England to the road is very effective. I admit that I first found them intrusive and irritating, then they became natural. In addition, they became a welcome addition to the story. As he tells his adventures to a larger and larger audience, more and more people listen to his compelling imagination, even though they doubt his truth. For example, his hatred of the dirty Yahoos and the admiration of pure logic from the fourth part speaks well when defending his own common sense. The interaction between events in England and similar events or scenes in the story is very effective. For example, tearing a cloth from a table to design a drag movement group of ships is inspired by filming. Adding a Gulliver family threatened by a lush doctor works well. Swift only suggests that a long-suffering woman protests against other ways. It becomes a natural part of this story. Casting and negotiation was competent. Some roles were exemplary. Mad magician Omar Sharif is excellent. O'Toole's little emperor is delightedly moving toward senility. Many specific complaints from other writers seem to me as a simple personal preference, which is what we are here in the end. I read the shortened version several times a year from the fourth grade. Maybe I escaped the complete version until she was in college class, but read it several times since then. And I had to start over when I started reading about this movie. While the Danson version is better than the previous movie, it does not replace the book. However, I think he will bring many readers to the book. If you haven't read the book, enjoy this movie and go to the source. If you appreciate the satire in it, find Swift's "Modest Proposal" and his "Drapier's Letters". Both are satires attacking the miserable treatment of Ireland and Irish during Swift's time. Drapier protests cheaply, inflated copper coins are deposited on Ireland. It was a small coinage, not good for face value in paying taxes and official debts. The cry from Swift's satire caused the coins to be sent to other poorly British territories, American colonies. Universal Satire in Swift's Book and This Movie Just Poke Fun; they cannot change human nature. Give Danson a torture experience. I think you'll find them as provocative and fun thoughts.
