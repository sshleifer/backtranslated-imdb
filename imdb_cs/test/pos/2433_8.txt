This short and in place. This movie was great! I loved it! I actually took it to Hollywood Video for 3 money on VHS and watched it about 5 times in the last couple of weeks. I'm a big fan of Bogart and I just got into the movie. I thought the song was funny and now I have it as a phone ringtone. Robert Sacchi is great and removes good Bogart. His nose is a bit big, his voice is a mix of Bogart-Columbo and he does a few things that are awkward but otherwise he was fantastic and this movie was amazing. No one can be perfect Bogart, but he was great. Remember, Sam Marlow is a fan of Bogart and won't do everything he did. He talks about a lot of other movies and does some things that have never been part of the real character of Bogart's character. But it's so fun and cheerful and has a great cast, including some beautiful women. Watch it and have fun!
