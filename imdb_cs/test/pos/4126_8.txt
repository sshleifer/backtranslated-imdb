That occurred to me while the last scene of the film froze to reveal that Buddy Holly still had little information that there were still people still living in that place in Clearlake, Iowa, who remember it alive. This must be a haunted memory, bestowed with even more pronounced "American Pie" because it pays tribute to the day when music died. The world has lost tremendous talent that day, lives short of their prime numbers, and one can wonder what might have been if a trio of musicians who died that day survived and created an even greater musical legacy. I've been watching the film today about thirty years after his original theatrical release. Thirty years, I have some problems with it. I've forgotten a lot about this when I remembered some little things like cricket in the wall that became the immortal name of the band. But above all to music. It's hard to just sit there and not start tapping the rhythm of "Oh Boy" or "It will be a day," and one has to wonder where the threat to our morals might have come from these melodies. At least with Buddy, how could jungle rhythms be with them? Funny how every subsequent decade brought its own threat to the structure of the company - the Beatles, Motown, Disco and many other musical forms. We keep listening and dancing to the beat, so I think they couldn't be so bad. Another movie from a movie I forgot was different. This is where I learned to slam the phone on the table when the man at the other end didn't see things my way. Over the years I have done it a few times, but now I have forgotten the source. Well, I should be good for another thirty years. You must definitely give Gary Busey recognition for his portrayal of Buddy Holly. When he saw him today, no one could imagine him as a slender rocker with horn-rimmed glasses, but it was the characteristic and performance of the tour that brought Busey to the Oscar. Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith are competent as members of Buddy's band, although their characters return to much of the story. I enjoyed the subtle ways in which other musical legends, such as Sam Cooke and King Curtis, came into the picture without ever being present. I will always be a fan and supporter of music from the fifties and sixties - the "oldies" they call them now. I think it's too old for me, but you can't replace the growing up experience with the history of music that is now on the big screen. Which only reinforces the idea of ​​enjoying music until the day I die.
