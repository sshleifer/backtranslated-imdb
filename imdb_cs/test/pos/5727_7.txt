OK. All in all, this three-part documentary will bring most people up-to-date on the physics world and the last 300 years of discovering our universe. If you read Stephen Hawkings the brilliant book "A Brief History of Time" and understood, then you could benefit from a visual description of some of the concepts .. that I did to some extent. Greene is bearable, but obviously for the masses, he tends to explain things in a promising way. This is, of course, intentional and will be ideal for almost all who follow this series. Visiting scientists were good. (not Hawking, but I assume he has his own DVD (s)) I waited for him to appear, but he turns over the same for almost 3 parts ... (a very respected American with several British and one antipodean) I bought a Nova 2 Disc Edition (NTSC) and there were a few inclusions that really made the overall experience easier. <br /> <br /> 1. "This is brought to you" at the beginning of each section was evil for the first part, but seeing it two more times before it was over was very common. <br /> <br /> 2. I can't help but suppose, but at the beginning of 2 and 3 there is quite a bit of overlap that has reached me several times on the FFW button. <br /> <br /> 3. This set of discs was straight from TV .. (ie Ads, what happened last show for those who missed it, and frequent "goto pbs.org for more ...." ) appearing during the presentation. (Quite unlike the BBC, which is incomparable to the presentation. Plans, Blue Planet, etc.) My 7/10 is based on the content itself. Niggy was there, but I overcame them. If it were done with this classic British accented moderator (you know the one), it would be a perfect disc in my opinion. <br /> <br /> If you saw it and want more ... then I highly recommend Hawkings book "A Brief History of Time" ... I wish it was a movie too. <br /> <br /> Happy watching.
