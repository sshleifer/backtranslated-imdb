This movie bombed at the box office and voted, but I loved it. One measure of film worth how much you can still remember after 25 years. I won't bore you with a list, but there are dozens of deeply comic scenes, also a good story and great casting. Little robbers are hooves. Check it out and see if it ever gets on TCM.
