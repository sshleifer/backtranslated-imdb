One of the best, Lackawanna Blues <br /> <br /> Great movie, great cast, great music, that's one of those movies that is so good that when you finish, you wish it to continue for another 90 minutes, This many times i will w3atch. This is one of those movies that catch you from the start and twist and slam you emotionally throughout the function. The cast is extraordinary without the slightest indication that someone is reluctant in their role. You get the feeling that you really took it. Everything was devoted to the series, costumes and music of that time. The relationship between the characters we encounter is both simple and complicated as the film continues, but Mrs Merkerson's stable performance is so strong that the film ends before we have filled the beautiful mistakes. To cut someone other than "Nanny" is an injustice because we have very good performances by great veteran actors, including: Jeffery Wright, Jimmy Smits, Terrence Howard and Delroy Lindo. But it's Marcus Franklin, Macy Gray and Mrs. Merkerson, which makes it a great experience. <br /> <br /> The movie moves fast and is short to today's standards, but it's no doubt one of the best movies you make. see you this year. If you like period pieces that will challenge you emotionally, pull your heart, lift you up and tap your feet at the same time, then it's a movie for you. I showed it to a few friends and everyone wants my copy that says it's all that movie is so good. Take a look at it yourself. Danceability-1, Amsterdam Holland
