For me, this is another of the movies I saw in Los Angeles on the "Z" Channel when it was up and running. And it was another of the movies I saw when I was young ... and I learned that there was a world ... one I didn't want to accept. Moving to Los Angeles and watching international cinema has become my good interest and so far, no prime channel programming has matched the "Z" channel in its international film performance. Three international films stuck in my young head were "Spetters", "Beau Pere" and of course "Pixote". That was the most shocking and saddest movie I've ever seen in my life. It was also one of the first films that made me realize that there is a difference in cinema: having fun and informing. Let me be honest .. grew up in a small town on the east coast, I had no idea anything like that - in this range - existed. All I knew from South America was brochures about the wonderful Brazilian holidays and that Columbia had a lot of drug trafficking. Then comes a movie like Pixote. Sad. Disturbing. Unflinching. Scary. Following: Children. Those in need of refuge, love, understanding and all these things are a way to survive day by day through drugs, sex, robbing, theft, sleeping in the streets and in sadistic group houses, etc. Their survival is hard to follow with other street children , prostitutes, etc., and start to wonder how things like this can happen in this world. <br /> <br /> Pixote is not a movie for fun, it's a movie of information. It shows shocking and disturbing images - but shows life for these kids everyday streets.
