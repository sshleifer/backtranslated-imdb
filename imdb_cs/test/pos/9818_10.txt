The masterful rendering of this Ettore Scoly epic heart deserves a much wider audience. It is a worthy successor of risorgimento classics such as Vischonti's Senso and Il Gattopardo, as well as Rosselini's Vanina, Vanini. The 19th century is truly a fruitful source for Italian filmmakers. The time and trap settings are beautifully realized here, but the story is timeless and can occur in any period. What is so interesting in this story is that the hero becomes trapped in a claustrophobic situation in which he finds himself in a heavily watched object of desire and is utterly helpless to break free from alarming circumstances. Nice and calm Giorgio (Giraudeau) is frustrated by his inability to visit his charming but light-minded married wife (Antonelli) and falls for the dangerous passion of Fosca (D'Obici), the ugly and sick daughter of his strict commander. (Girotti). The resulting anxiety and the ensuing tragedy that this unlikely couple will undergo make them so understandable, woeful and extremely sympathetic to the audience. Bernard Giraudeau's stellar performance will impress and leave a lasting impression. Do not miss.
