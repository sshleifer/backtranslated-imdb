I'm from Texas and my family stayed at Santa Fe with my brother a few years ago. He suggested we come down with a staircase church. I was totally blown away by the miracles that took place there. The film is great - Barbara Hershey and William Petersen were perfect for the games they played. It's amazing, absolutely amazing. If you haven't seen the staircase in person, it's worth a look. Wood is beautiful and the architecture is stunning. Just in the chapel gives me goosebumps! To read about the history of the chapel, and then see its beauty is breathtaking. Watch the movie - it's great! Then look at the staircase personally!
