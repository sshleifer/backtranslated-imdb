When "Madame" decides to let her cats inherit, it's a problem. The snobbish Butler Edgar, who is next in line to inherit, decides to get rid of the cats. The story can start and cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise not be possible. An adventure that allows them to discover the charming but not entirely trusted O'Malley cat. It helps them in many dangerous and fun situations to the inevitable happy ending. The power of this film is in its humor and music. Edgar is just funny as an insulting servant who's out there to deal with the score and of course he takes some serious beating. One of the best scenes includes him chasing two dogs Lafayette and Napoleon. The score is great and just like in the "Jungle Book" you have scenes that are almost "musical" in the sense that the story does not progress and focuses on making the protagonists dance. And of course we like that the score is pretty Jazzy. And of course it's not just me, but also my kids who love this. Sincerely, Simon
