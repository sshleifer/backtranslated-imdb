In one of the better films of the year, Tom Hanks stars as Congressman Charlie Wilson in this sardonically funny and extremely relevant (given that current events) the historic comedy-drama surrounding the 1980s Afghan / Soviet fiasco. The Soviets attacked Afghanistan and killed hundreds of people. Why should anyone care? People are dying, right? No, the reason the United States was involved through Charlie Wilson was that the Afghans began to return illegally to Pakistan in fear of getting into the sh_t, which in turn led Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq. Charlie Wilson joined forces with the sixth richest woman and religious fanatic in Texas, Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), and the amusing and powerful American spy for CIA, Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to help Afghans with high tech weapons destroy a Soviet fighter plane that would try to attack their country. Although it is certainly not a serious Oscar candidate for the best picture, "Charlie Wilson's War" is probably one of the best of many political films of the year. Academy Award winner Mike Nichols provides a solid direction, as expected, while Emmy Award winner Aaron Sorkin (Sports Night, West Wing) provides a remarkable scenario that almost flawlessly balances comedy and drama. Also, acting is great for the most part. Tom Hanks delivers his best and most enjoyable performance since his 2000 Oscar nomination as a FedEx worker stranded on a tropical island in "Cast Away". Hanks has a slimy character like Wilson, and his trademark charm turns him into a nice guy. Amy Adams and Ned Beatty are as reliable as ever, but the real stand-out performance of the film is from Philip Seymour Hoffman. Hoffman, probably the best actor working in the film industry today, has a little supportive role and encourages everyone around him. From his first scene of screaming to his boss before he forcibly breaks the window, Hoffman sucks you. The only unsatisfied member is the surprisingly exaggerated Hollywood player Julia Roberts. Roberts's overflowing and above-average form of a rich oil woman from Texas hits all the other bad notes and is most annoying. After 97 minutes, the film is short and sweet, and that doesn't mean it doesn't move at some points, but when it drags it, it's for a very short time. Finally, Charlie Wilson's War is by no means a perfect movie, but it's definitely worth a look. Grade: B +
