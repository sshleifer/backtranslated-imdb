This film was obviously based on a true story. But I'm not sure how accurate it is. But it really reminded me how amazing it was when I saw that someone was murdered in the news, how much it does not affect me. Sure, I think it's terrible, but honestly. I move on. It seems that murder is now trivial. That's what River's Edge shows. It does not seem to care about this girl and her death, not even the killer. So what's the point? The killer in this story is John, and he's hiding with another murderer named Feck, who plays Dennis Hopper for a great deal of the movie. Feck is older and you can see the generation gap. He says he loves the girl he killed. When he asks John if he loves the girl he killed, he simply says, "She was fine." The film seems to offer only one solution: life is more important than death. The character's life is spared, people have a second chance and one hopeless case is killed. Acting is really good. After watching this movie, I could only conclude that Crispin Glover is either a great actor or a terrible actor. I have no idea yet. It was my main reason to see this movie. But the best performance is clearly given by Dennis Hopper. Although fashion is really 80's and characters sometimes mention current problems, I still think River's Edge is as important as today. > <br /> My Rating: 10/10
