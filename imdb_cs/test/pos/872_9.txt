(Includes Spoilers) <br /> <br /> People who put Lonely Heart in a newspaper are often idealists. He is trying to give a few words to everything they are and are waiting. The exchange of letters is full of hope ... Louis Mahe (Jean Paul Belmondo), the owner of a cigarette company on the ile de la Reunion (east of Madagascar), is hit by the letters of Julie Roussell that she proposes to her. But the unexpected pretty brunette comes from "Mississippi" but - Catherine Deneuve. And from the beginning, we know he's a marital cheater and a crime has occurred. She is not interested in the "Julie" closet (she doesn't even get her suitcase open) and neglects her canary before she dies. But the most basic tricks of seduction (open zip) are enough to transform Louis into a submissive dog. First: a common bank account. And then, when Julie's sister warns herself, years. With 27,850 million Louis '28 million - she would need his signature for the entire sum. Louis and Julie's sister involve a private detective (Michel Bouquet). Louis is trying to track down Marion (Deneuve's real name) in Antibes, where he works as a taxi-girl - her gangster-lover has left her without money or somewhat without money. Louis can't kill her. He tells his story: Orphan. Premature. Lesbian experience. Many sugardaddies. Prison - and will soon lead him through the nose again. The detective proves to be crafty and tenacious as a blood dog; Louis and Marion are burying their bodies in the cellar. Escape to Paris, where Louis finds out Marion has an expensive taste. He worships money as a deity. It sells its business at a fraction of its value. However, when a detective's corpse (flood) appears, he must flee again - without money. Living in a mountain hut, along with a whimpering loser - Marion can think of a fun life without this pendant ... <br /> <br /> The highlight of the career of all involved. Belmond's delusion makes him almost nice. Deneuve looks beautiful in her dressing room by Yves St. Laurent and her performance is amazing: First she pretends to be a fragile wife - too shy to ask her husband for money, that's why a common bank account is needed - but after being exposed, it sounds like Katharine Hepburn in the prison scene BRINGING BABY. The scenery is spectacular - tropics, riviera, Paris. Truffaut goes with obvious self-esteem: the 1960s were the only decade when European films were the head and shoulders of American production. After this film, Truffaut was able to look at his idol, Alfred Hichcock, full of face.
