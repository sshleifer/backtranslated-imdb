In a word ... magical. And so incredibly real. Vijay Raaz is so incredibly raw, so incredibly vulnerable that you want his characters to succeed in anything he does. And he plays perfectly Hari Om - from his absolutely perfect "Bollywood E-Shtyle" to his embarrassing and timid manner of first kiss. He is really a talented actor and I would not hesitate to see him in anything because it brings everything to life and gives him a soul. Camille Natta is absolutely beautiful. It took me some time to warm up to her - perhaps because she plays the role of an ignorant but fascinated tourist. Her transition has really become her, and she has formed very well into her role. Even the man you love, her boyfriend Benoit, was amazing, though you never care to get to the smell he plays, Jean-Marie Lamour makes a perfect cadre. Script - so real. I found myself turning to my friend repeatedly during the movie to say, "That's exactly what's going on in India!" Very real, very raw. VERY bittersweet but surely you're leaving the theater. Nitin Sawhney's music is amazing and fits perfectly with the ever-changing mood. But Vijay Raaz ... I keep coming back to him - because that's what MAKES this movie. He's a hero, a charming, disarming rickshaw driver you'll ever meet - it's magical. A beautiful, real, sweet, incredibly talented actress I can't wait to see shine and success in Bollywood, Hollywood or anywhere!
