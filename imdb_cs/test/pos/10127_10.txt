Radio was a very good movie, and honestly, I never cry in movies. But it was pretty close to tears. It's really up to me when Radio's mother died and he just wouldn't get out of his room. I felt really sad that if you were mentally retarded you would not be able to understand death. I really liked the movie and must see it.
