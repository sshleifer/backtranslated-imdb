He is a brand new murderer in the free space and does the work of God. Yeah, right! This killer is Jason Voorhes looking like a chump and Freddy Krueger looked like a rag doll against this dude. He is Jacob Goodnight (WWE's Glen "KANE" Jacobs), a 7 'monster who controls Ax, and a hook and chain. Those weapons are nothing for him that his real finisher pulls out of the victims. This is absolutely methodical! When the meeting happened four years earlier, Jacob killed the rookie cop and headed the veteran after putting a bullet in his head. How did Goodnight survive on Earth after 4 years? Now he's in a convicted hotel called Blackwell. And this hotel has a lot of stories. I thought this movie was creepy and interesting. I liked the part where Goodnight tried one of the girl's tattoos on her back. And thanks to her manic mother she is a really good night. If you think Friday was something, think about it again. This film leaves you on the edge of the seat. And I think the eye rip was cool. This film proves it and it wasn't a waste of my time. I enjoyed it. The title doesn't lie! Rating 2.5 out of 5 stars!
