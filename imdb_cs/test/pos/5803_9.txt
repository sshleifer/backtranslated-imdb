This show was so exhausting to watch and there are only two numbers, a drowned world (alternate for love) and paradise (not for me). The launch of this show will be most exciting in history, as Madonna enters the scene through a huge Swarovski crystal ball that descends from the ceiling and huge screens from behind show paintings of horses galloping. Horses play a role in this show because of Madonna, who falls from one. The infamous scene of the Madonna on the Cross is in this show as a huge screen counting up to 12 million, how many African children are orphaned because of AIDS. Finally, there is a web address for those interested in donating. Then we get into the issue of the environment and again the image of politics and religion is revealed. There is an interlude and then the show starts again to the music I Love New York and Ray of Light this part of the show is one of my favorites with dancers doing funny hand movements. Towards the end it is a musical number with the song Disco Inferno mixed with the song, and the dancers do more there presence known. The end is full of energy as the show wraps into Lucky Star and Hung Up and hundreds of golden balloons fall from the ceiling at the end of the message "Have you admitted?" come. The DVD is worth buying and when it came out, it added as a bonus to the show's soundtrack. Jonas Akerlund did a great job with this track, which kept her in line with the tour style.
