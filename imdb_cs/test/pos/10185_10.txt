The three-part series ended last night on PBS, which in my opinion was his first wide-ranging exposure to the American audience. The richness of his text and the unique quality of his filming are high points. It looks very novel when you see and hear an action game using the popular language of Georgian England. Yet the extent of the drama is a stunning sensation that makes the quaint language perfectly fit into every scene. Such bold exposure to the old reality evokes literary giants such as Tolstoy or Shakespeare, as well as the entertaining form of C. S. Forester or Patrick O'Brian. The universality of basic human conditions lies at its center. Talbot, who is played by an actor with an almost perfect name, Benedict Cumberbatch (certainly Dickens couldn't beat one!) and extreme vulnerability, acting tour de force. I really can't remember from this very subtle cast any misinterpretation. This is a tribute not only to the actors themselves, but also to the director. The most impressive element, however, is how perfectly the life aboard the war en route to Australia is presented at the beginning of the 18th century. This is especially true of how the movement of a ship becomes almost the very character, something that sea stories rarely take into account except for the background. Anyone who has ever had a de mer personally will immediately recognize him and appreciate the more difficult it must have been in the filming context. This is no fantastic Pirates of the Caribbean. Some effort must be made to achieve understanding of its nuances.
