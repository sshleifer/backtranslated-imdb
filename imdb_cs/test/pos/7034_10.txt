I've been waiting for this movie for ages and finally I'm! As soon as I heard the title, I knew this movie would be my favorite movie, and when I saw it believed, I wasn't disappointed! This film had everything dance, love and Patrick Swayze! There was so much in it and it was dealing with important issues (that was at the time of 1960), such as abortion. Dance in this movie was fantastic, just like acting! Swayze was as brilliant as Gray! Although this movie was absolutely fantastic, you can't say you've seen it unless you've seen the last scene. It's really breathtaking, because the choreography of the last dance was brilliant, it had a dance at the end of the movie and it wouldn't really surprise me if it affected people to dance! Overall Dirty Dancing is a movie that SHOULD NOT miss, and even though half of the actors are in "Where are they now?" actors will always have this outstanding film in this career!
