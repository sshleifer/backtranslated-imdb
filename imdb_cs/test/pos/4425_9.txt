Then again, I like Rachael Ray. It's fun, sweet, fresh and so enjoy watching. I have to change everything she does because I'm a vegetarian ... but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. After all, he's a TV personality. I think he's cool to be so inviting with his fans and he still seems to be on the ground. It seems that the studio audience is a bit small, but that is what creates a more cozy environment. Some people have sent that show upset. I think it depends on your own interpretation and on it. If you notice the first 30-minute meal episodes, you will see a completely different personality than in recent years. I'm sure he'll find his comfort zone with this show. Good luck Rachael!
