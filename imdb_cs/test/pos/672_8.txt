Great B-function. A virtual two-hander and set during the day (you can see it's a stage stage, and even how it had to function as a radio game), and though only 77 minutes long, played in sequences similar to something like real time. Robert Ryan is a psychopath who holds Ida Lupino trapped at home. They are both great, especially undervalued Lupino, whose early independence and self-control will soon disintegrate before Ryan's furious intruder. Today, of course, it would be all guts and gore, but the restriction shown by director Harry Horner (much better known as art director) just adds to the tension that is sometimes worthy of Hitchcock.
