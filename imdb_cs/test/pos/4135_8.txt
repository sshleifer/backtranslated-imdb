When I was seven, I saw the story of Buddy Holly Story. I didn't know who Buddy Holly was, nor can I remember what it was that I sat in front of the TV, tuned in to HBO and watched this engaging biopic. I remember realizing that it was (somewhat) a true story about someone who really lived. I remember the music, the great songs I still love today (I can't believe Gary Busey sang his own songs and so well - What stud!) Then the end came. He died. He died. I could not believe it. I had no warnings, no prior knowledge like most coming into this movie. She taught me a cruel lesson about life and how she doesn't follow the rules most movies teach us. I watched the movie again tonight and dealt again ... and a little sad. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, but I admit I'm a little biased.
