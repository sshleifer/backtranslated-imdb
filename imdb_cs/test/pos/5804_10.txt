Madonna has been swinging on the ship for more than 20 years, bringing a lot of experience - of course - and a lot of knowledge. She had never thought yesterday that it would be okay, she seemed to know what would be popular tomorrow. He courageously accepts all new trends, technologies and incorporates them into his own acts. Her world tours have never been "average". When Madonna performs, she gives 120% - everything is bigger, better, theatrical and meaningful. He takes inspiration from the East, West, and then is unique. Everything is given a deeper meaning, and The Confessions Tour is no different. From the very beginning you find yourself on the edge of a chair. It starts with a bang, then boldly rides a horse riding high in the sky, doing everything in its power to entertain you. He remakes his own songs and gives them a modern feel. She sings on the disco, almost comes in the middle of the stage and with her amazing dance crew, who knows no dimensions of fear, the show is more than you have negotiated. It is a spectacle, an audio-visual orgasm that cannot be expressed in words. Lucky are the ones who actually saw Madonna on stage. Pushing fifty, he's still in incredible form. The recent Sticky and Sweet Tour are even more groundbreaking, proving nothing else that Madonna was, is, and is always the only pop queen.
