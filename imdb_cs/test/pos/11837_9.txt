toplines to ok comedy about an aging father (C. Aubrey Smith) who decides to gather his adult children from all over the world. Davies works as a choral girl in New York when she gets a message that "dad" wants her. Hmmmm, that sounds good. Davies' considerable talent as a comedian saved this otherwise such comedy by upsetting British country landscapes with his harsh American personality. Not as sharp as any other Davies comedy, but still worth a look. Ray Milland plays his long lost "brother". Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray and Halliwell Hobbes are also entertaining.
