Sean Astin throws off another amazing performance in "Toy Soldiers". He plays a very smart joke, Billy Tepper along with Wil Wheaton and Keith Coogan who play his best friends, Joey Trotta and Jonathan "Snuffy" Bradberry. During a regular day at a school for boys in Saint Anselm, a group of dangerous terrorists takes all the boys and teachers hostage and threatens to blow up the school if the leader, Luis Cali (Andrew Divoff), is not released from America. Prison, but they are not just ordinary boys who are hostage-taken, most of these children are sons of very powerful people in America, and half of them were excluded from other schools before they came to Saint Anselm. They are mouths and actions can only kill. When the government desperately tries to find a way to help, Billy, Joey, Snuffy and some other boys decide to take things into their own hands.
