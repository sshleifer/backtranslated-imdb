I highly recommend anyone who likes good plots, good actors (though not well known) (often it's a better way), science and / or science fiction presented in an intelligent way on small screen effects, even if they didn't have billions of dollars to keep it They Made ... <br /> <br /> Much Better Than Any Star Wars ... <br /> <br /> There was only one comment that was not necessary: ​​Talking about the comet, the commentator says LIFE was maybe brought to earth through a comet ... that's fun, there's always a chance for a magical journey, huh?! This is what is great for LIFE, can come anywhere, no need for external force
