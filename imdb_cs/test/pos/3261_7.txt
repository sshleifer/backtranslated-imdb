"Two Hands" is a fun, humorous story about Australian lowlifes. The scenario contrasts with the world of fast money and fatalities with inexplicable fate and circumstances. We are gently asked to think that the main events in our lives are sometimes generated without being fully aware of the causes. The forces of fate and circumstances take Jimmy, the main character, into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and ultimately the understanding of a more personally promising world. Clueless Jimmy, portrayed with the admiration of Heath Ledger, is a child who has grown up without opportunity. The highly paid world of crimes offers the greatest attraction to its numb senses. Love and help of friends leads him to a higher platform. The film is well managed and well-functioning. The band of criminals meet among the sympathetic and contemptuous, which interests us in their crazy antiquities throughout the film.
