He watched it again. I wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had the best time. That's why these movies are made, entertained by people, and Zombie Bloodbath 2 does it for me and everyone I've shown. The story relates to a group of teenagers in a van running into a group of fugitive convicts who took over an old farmhouse. When a scarecrow (that is, a demon that I think) is disturbed, it comes to life and revives the dead bodies from local cemeteries. This leads our heroes to escape only to the land of two insane killers who are in the process of torturing some people in a deli in a small town. Soon it is clearing with people fighting against zombies. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie! From various formats (black and white film, video and digital cameras) to very fast pace and great music, there's always something going on and NEVER bored! Sure, it's cheap, but you can say that great care and hard work came into this movie. I read other reviews and all I can say is that these people missed the point. If you want a 35mm full moon fluff, or if you're in modern things like Urban Legend, then I'll say it. If you like low-budget stuff like Gates Of Hell and Evil Dead, I'm saying I'll buy it now. is pretty good and editing is very impressive. There is enough going on in this one to fill two more movies! It's actually one of the best b-movies I've seen in age.
