I was really and amazingly surprised "O 'Brother, where are you Thou?" The video store was from all the movies I was planning to rent, so I met it. I came home and when I looked, I dove and laughed aloud. Coen was once again making an amazing film. But I think that when you first look at this movie, you'll recognize the characters. The second time, now that you know them, laugh hard to hurt you. I would highly recommend someone to see it because if you are not, you are really missing a movie gem for ages. 10/10
