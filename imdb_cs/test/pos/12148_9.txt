Classe tous risques directed by Claude Sautet was not a film to be honest when I really heard it until the New York Film Forum said they would have a 2-week film screening with new English subtitles. When I also read that it was in the style of classic French crime movies ala Jean Pierre Melville, I jumped to the chance to check it out (at best it would be with his great work and in the worst case I would get to good popcorn in the big theater) . It was well worth taking, as Classe tous risques is one of those kinds of French movies that is just waiting to be re-discovered (or first discovered). Sautet keeps the tension in the close of the first forty minutes of the film with amazingly tense care, keeps a good (if not great) mid section and then ends with what is always expected of these movies, but with fascinating motivation through the characters. With a movie of this kind, you know how it will end, but it's a cool, attentive journey that counts. The film features performance with some real truth and sincerity, in the middle of "old-school" criminal code, Lino Ventura as Aldo, who steals huge at the beginning of the film (one of the best beginnings of the film in this genre and country) amount of money with your partner in crime). When one night is suddenly, ugly fate, Aldo is once again on the run with two young children. He gets the help of Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo, a role in tune with Le Doulos only with smidgen more humanity and charisma), who is also a thief and directs him to Paris. However, there are some problems with some old Aldo business partners and one old score may be the right ticket. It may seem that the plot is unhurried several times, but it is not. Like Melville, Sautet will not allow any story to tell its story, and that is a very tightly structured film, with some good humor back and forth (sometimes I grimaced at the insolence of the criminals at the beginning of the chase sequence, and also with the woman who had with her a cat and fish a great thing. <br /> <br /> Along with the fine score of George Delerue's superb film, exceptional cinematography and the mood that rarely met Classe tous risques, it is a reminder of the bridge between a true old-fashioned noir movie and a crime movie. in these new films, "thief-life" has the 1000th grade and the honor of thieves in this film, and is the second banana for the works of Melville and Jules Dassin (a compliment that I assure you).
