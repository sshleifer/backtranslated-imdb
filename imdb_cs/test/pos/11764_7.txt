After seeing the trailer, it was easy to see the movie. I don't care about the stupid "stoner comedy". I'm sure it was also an easy choice for a lot of people to get together, smoke a bowl and go see this movie with a guy from The Simpsons and some guy named Billy Bob. If it was a good time, but the movie is not so funny - too bad someone had to go and bum high. Unfortunately, I found out that the trailer was misleading after he left. theaters, so I had to wait for the video. I really enjoyed it. Nice locations, quality productions and excellent performances from the entire cast. When we look at it, the plot twists were not completely unexpected, but I did not consider it cumbersome because the assumption was so engaging. Did something happen to the producer and let the affiliate producers do the marketing themselves?
