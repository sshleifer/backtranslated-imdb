I really liked this movie. One thing I noticed is that the Korean TV drama is much better if it gives you the whole story. I watch movies when I don't have the time or feel like I'm going through 16-30 episodes. The movies seem to be in a hurry, and if you don't look carefully, you can skip something. I feel this one was in a hurry and I had to rewind a few parts to try to find what I missed, especially at the end. If you love nice love stories, I still think it's cute, and if you have extra time, I still think it's worth a look. It is always nice to go back to the actors in different areas of the film, because we can't follow them when they begin as we do actors of producers and directors in our own countries.
