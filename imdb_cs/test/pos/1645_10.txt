The team turned into an Arctic research post between Scully and Mulder, two other scientists, a pilot and a guy playing Ben on Seinfeld, where all members died either by killing or killing. He finds himself a worm - a virus that is parasitic to madness and death. The problem is that after a dog roars out, someone can be infected, but who? This is not just my favorite season 1 episode, but also one of my favorite shows. The Arctic environment closes the characters and, of course, as Carpenter's thing, it's a lot of fun when these dramatic characters suddenly emerge in dramatic scenes. And the visual effects of the worm and its effects beneath the skin are raw, and I didn't mind. The drama between the characters ends up working more than usual because of the tension and because all the actors (including the Bana guy) understand what's going on in the story. And as usual I loved the ambiguity of the end. Highly recommended.
