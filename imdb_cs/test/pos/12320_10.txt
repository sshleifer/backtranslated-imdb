John Huston's latest film, a great American director of Irish origin, is an adaptation of the latest story from the early Dubliners, the greatest writer ever to come from Ireland. Film is a family affair. The dying director based on the script that his son Tony Huston adapted from one of the most enjoyable, beautiful, and deepest stories he has ever written in that language, and has considered many of the best English language stories. John directed his daughter Anjelica in what might be her best performance. The film is short, only 83 minutes. It has no action sequences, no conspiracy, it is almost harmless and it may seem slow. Guests, friends and relatives come to a party that takes place in Dublin during the Epiphany week of January 1904, in the house of two elderly sisters, who annually organize music and dance dinners. What the audience sees at the first hour is a file interview. Guests talk, listen to music, discuss the latest opera premieres and make jokes, sometimes embarrassing. Conversations gradually pass to long-dead friends or relatives who are never remembered. This is a movie in which you have to stay, let it drag, listen to what and how guests say how they communicate at a party. Pay attention to body language, looks at their faces as they move away from light, laughter and contemporary music to long gone, but in fact they have left most of the rare memories where the dead title is not dead, but forever young and so alive. By doing so, you will be rewarded with the last scene of such emotional strength and impact that it will always be with you. It will break your heart to pieces, pull them together and put them back. The film, as well as Joyce's story, focuses on Gabriel Conroy (Donal McCann as James Joyce's alter ego, who has made a very moving inferior performance) as one of the party guests who come with his wife Gretta (Anjelica Huston). Still in love, Gabriel feels a close connection and fascinates her. It's after the party, they realize that even after many years of proximity they don't know about their past, its pain, regret, and the unforgettable emotions and losses she has experienced as a young girl. part. She first looks at her and thinks of her not as an indelible part of her existence, but as another human being with her own inner world, with her own loneliness and sadness, and for the first time, "strange, friendly pity, or she has entered her own soul. who tells the last strongest and deepest lines of the story: "Snow is general throughout Ireland ... a weakly falling universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, to all living and dead." <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie or read Joyce's story, please. They are indeed works of art that leave an eternal impression and change something in you to the best.
