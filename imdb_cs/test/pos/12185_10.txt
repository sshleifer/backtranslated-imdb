all right ... first on Anne Rice BOOK Fans .... <br /> <br /> sure that the eyes are not blue ... sure that she's not blond in this movie ... but even if Marius doesn't trick is a Creator ... even if they have completely changed the story ..... <br /> <br /> how can they say it's not a good movie .. <br /> <br /> this movie ... is the BEST Vampire the movie I have ever seen ... and the trick in it is perfectly depicted .... maybe not its features ... but I don't think we can find a better trick .... as it speaks ... and the way the way he looks at mere mortals ... his arrogance .. and the sheer love of glory is displayed flawlessly. <br /> <br /> If u for once ... consider it just a movie .. join every scene with a book ... u will love the movie just like me. <br /> <br /> Now ... for no readers .. <br /> <br /> Be ready in the fall absolutely in love with this movie .... it has all the things .... and goth music. .. is as a complement ... dialogues ... are beautiful ... and catching ... and even though his vampire movie ..u finds himself smiling ... to joke characters ... and you find yourself sympathetic to vampires .. <br /> <br /> overall ... one of my favorite movies ... !! 10/10
