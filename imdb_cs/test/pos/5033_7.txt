John Travolta played in his comeback of a slightly twisted angel in "Michael". Maybe he's a messenger of God, but he's not the most beautiful guy, as reporters Andie MacDowell and William Hurt appear. When I first saw this movie, it was before I started watching "All in the Family" so I didn't recognize Jean Stapleton as Edith Bunker. Now that I recognize her like this, I try to imagine how Archie would have been torn at her for hiding an angel (which she would probably have placed next to blacks, Jews, etc.). <br /> <br /> I know it's not related to film. But I'm glad that I associate things like that. Anyway, it's a pretty interesting movie. Also starring Bob Hoskins, Teri Garr and Richard Schiff. What John and Paul said ...
