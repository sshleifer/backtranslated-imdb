The plot is somewhat original and all the actors have done their job quite well. There's a lot of comic relief. Some things don't make sense (eg, the first scene of "persecution", why would the heroine not hide somewhere and wait for the baddies to leave?). Indeed, Russians speak Russian without accent, but cars are extraordinarily strange, with models over 50 years old, and so the place seems strange. Overall, if you like thrillers you'll probably be just like this one.
