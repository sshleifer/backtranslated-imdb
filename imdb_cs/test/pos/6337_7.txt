Thirteen of the fantasy (excuse the incredibly homologous terminology) The "supernatural" television series will move Sam and Dean Winchester to Missouri, where they were invited by the old flame of Dean to explore a number of mysterious murders in their small town. . As it turns out, a large pick-up truck with an invisible driver runs down the African Americans on a deserted stretch of road ... While Dean tries to revive his past love affair, more cities appear as roadkill. The cause seems to be caused by a past racial incident in the 1960s, which caused the frustrated spirit to remain in the haunted limbo and try to kill the black motorists. "Route 666" is another good installment (which is not uncommon, I noticed) that contains some remarkable aspects relating to a pair of main characters like Dean getting laid and Sam admitting the regret that he left college ... it won't go through as the most frightening thing in the world, though it does well for an hour long show. It's not a fantastic episode but a solid concept with more links to horror movies.
