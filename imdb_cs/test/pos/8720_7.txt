The swinging bachelor Matthau, a successful dentist, is tearing down his blond Mrs. Hawn when he told her he is a married man with three children. After attempting suicide, Matthau decides to be responsible and marries the girl. She is afraid that she will be a "homebreer", a light look Hawn wants to meet her wife and explain everything to her. Matthau employs his faithful sister Bergman to deal with his wife, and that's what's really complicated. The color comedy with irresistible guides often hits the mark, but is not believable for one second. The scenario asks us to believe that we men are one-dimensional grasses that are truly out of faith. But maybe this comedy doesn't have to be analyzed too deeply, just sit back and enjoy the still so much fun Matthau, still so charming Bergman and d√©butant Hawn who basically created the role of a stupid blonde girl.
