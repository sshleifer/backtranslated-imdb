Oh, how refreshing you can see the 18th century vision of England accompanied by mud, smallpox and gibbets ... and accompanied by a beautiful techno soundtrack. This is the story of the oppressed highways Plunkett (Robert Carlisle) and Gentleman-fallen-on-hard-times Captain Macleane (Jonny Lee Miller), and how to get together and rob aristo pigs. Plunkett is a hard nut, but MaCleane is too polite to do so, becoming a "gentleman's dag". He falls in love with Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler) (who is honest, the only weak part of the whole shebang) and wants to impress her. Costumes are fantastic. Large, colorful, historically inaccurate beautiful fingers. Alan Cummings gets all the best threads and the best lines like Lord Rochester, a sports piercing eyebrow that is not from the 18th century. The music passes between the swooping of famous choirs and the pounding bass of techno, which is not the jarr you think it should do in a historical movie. The scenario is fast and enhanced with modern speech; Businessman Ivory, this is not. There are merry parts, disgusting parts, sit-on-on-your-seat-and-nibbling-your-nail parts, but the whole thing chugs along and is wonderfully entertaining around the world. This is a cinema pleasure. Inadmissible.
