This was a very nice soft-core film for both men and women. Lots of nudity / sex, but without a total attack usually find. They couldn't do a better casting job because the whole set was overwhelming. Believe me guys, if you want to get your wife in the mood, do something with Bobby Johnston! And I'm sure dear Monique Parent, Samantha McConnell and other ladies would do it for all heterosexual men. Unfortunately, Bobby and Monique don't share the scene and if you're aware of the movie, where do they do, please, please! I'd like to know. The photo was much better than usual. It was a story. Predictable but nice, sweet and romantic. At least it wasn't one of those annoying, predictable, mysterious mysteries of full bottles of blond women with huge false breasts. I give it 7/10!
