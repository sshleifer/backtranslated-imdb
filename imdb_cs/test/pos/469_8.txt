This movie is like Happiness meets Lost in Translation with the end of the sixth sense (or maybe with the Crying Game surprise) and the best soundtrack I've ever heard ... if it all makes sense. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds tells you you're on a twisted ride. (I was surprised that no one left at the time of the Brooklyn premiere.) But since then, the film will settle into a conversation between two truly injured people, Daphne and Buddy. They are lonely, messy and the boy talks about sex. Daphne brings to life the most interesting accompaniment stories, some are pretty funny (Mr. Chang) some worrying (Harlan's music scene telling us what we see, what's happening or what Daphne really feels) and because I have a friend, who would be used to escorting, maybe I would add that it seems quite real. You are alone, multi-layered and mostly brilliant. Okay, maybe a few minutes less talking, and I don't know we miss something. Then again, I have to see it again with the knowledge of the end. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. <br /> <br /> (The director asked people in Brooklyn audience to write an IMDb review because many people read it.
