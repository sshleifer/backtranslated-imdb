Valley Girl is an extremely well made film with versatile great cast. Although the dialogue is a little dated when the film was released, it was very modern. To this day I know that many people (including teenagers) who cannot create a sentence without using the word "like" This is undoubtedly the link that will leave this film. Rating 8 was awarded for this, as, the most excellent film.
