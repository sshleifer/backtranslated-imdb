This is the 4th movie in the Karate Kid series. Whatever it has nothing to do with the previous 3rd, the remaining character is Mr. Myagi. military club on campus. Naturally she is trained as to combat. By the way, through Myagi, Julie learns Karate and becomes a better person spiritually and learns how to respect herself and at the end gets into her respect again. As well as the unique notion that the antagonist is a woman and has a man as her enemy.i there are also some combat scenes that are done pretty well, very low key and minimal violence. The end is also good and a little surprising. It is a predictable but not typical ending for this kind of film. Of course, the film echoes the original, especially the spiritual aspect and the lessons learned are not. as good as 1. mov ie, and certainly not as good as 2..it is but a huge leap forward compared to the imperfect 3rd entry. This is a very fun under the dog movie that is suitable for the whole family. 8/10
