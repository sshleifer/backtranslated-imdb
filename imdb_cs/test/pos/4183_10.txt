This film, like many of their music, is either underestimated or unobserved by a casual observer. It's amazing and in many ways before his time. The pictures are funny, intrusive and at least engaging. <br /> <br /> Music is amazing. <br /> <br /> This is not a "candy pop" sound that is unfortunately associated with it. This is the band's sound in exploration and rebellion. HEAD, alone, should put The Monkees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me why these guys aren't there?
