You will love or hate movies like this thriller located inside a solitary asylum in a remote lonely country. It's not so much a horror show, but a mixture of scary images and psychic patients. "Scream" is the best term used in what was obviously a popular classic that is known for strange and evil behavior. Notice the "judge" who is about to stand behind the doctor's ax! Brr-r-r-r !!! Nothing else can be described here except by some bloody tasty goodness, but when you get a chance, remember the famous old hag lady saying, "Get out! Get out! And you'll never come back!" Don't you want to look in the cellar?
