Seemingly the story of a little kid Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day. The kid is kidnapped to keep his parents calm. They know something about the plot to assassinate an unnamed country ambassador during a performance at the Albert Hall in London. The film is rich in Hitchcockian incidents. A friendly but opaque Frenchman seems to be grilling the innocent Stewart - a doctor from Indiana - a little too intensely to be curious. Later, the Frenchman appears in an Arabic disguise, a knife in his back, and whispers to Stewart some information about the murder plot. Stewart tells her wife, Doris Day, who looks really dazed - but refuses to cooperate with the police and risk her son's life. Instead, the couple are trying to track down the killers, buy them and give them a son, take them from Morocco, where Hitchcock gave us the usual view of habits, places, and food in London. There is a cheerful wild goose chase involving a set-up between Stewart and taxidermy shop staff. Employees are more interested in guarding their half-packed specimens than anything else and shuffling around to protect leopard and swordfish carcasses. Stewart manages to save his throat during the scuffle before he is cut out with a swordfish note, but is bitten by a stuffed tiger, an action that Bernard Hermann has strengthened. The scene ends with Stewart, who ran out the door. Hitchcock ends it with a lion's head shot, looking at the slammed door. There is also a running gag, well done, probably some visitors are waiting around a couple of hotel rooms in London, waiting for things to be explained. <br /> <br /> There are two serious issues that touch easily. One of them is the relationship between Stewart and a day that is not as pink as it should be, considered a bourgeois ideal. For several years it has been a music scene and is internationally known. And she gave it all to marry an ordinary guy who happens to be doc. It is understandable, say, a nurse or stewardess or almost every other woman than an international star with a hopeful career in her own right. It's not embedded in, but the edge is obvious because it wasn't in the original version. It reminds me of a small exchange between Joe Dimaggio and his then-wife Marilyn Monroe, who has just returned from entertainment units in Korea. "Yeah, Joe," she snapped, "have you ever seen ten thousand people standing up and cheering?" "Seventy thousand," murmured Joe, a former New York Yankees hero. The second problem is devotion. Who has greater social value? One own young son? Or an unknown ambassador. Do we put ourselves or our loved ones at risk for national stability? Day faces this dilemma in its hardest form on top at the Albert Hall. Its solution chooses devotion to political stability, although its motives are problematic. She screamed to save the ambassador's life, or does it just to relieve the anxiety that stuns her? (Compare: Alec Guiness falling to the detonator at the end of the "Bridge on the Kwai River.") The photo is very good and the setting can be menacing even on a quiet street in a residential area of ​​London. It's half a day, and Stewart is alone and determined, but also frightened. There are steps from someone on Gulliver's Street. Is it tracked? Is his life in danger? And where the hell is everybody living on this street? Hitchcock pays attention to the local details that we can tell when it comes to joining a brick wall side by side. The director had a disagreement with Francois Truffaut, while an interview for Truffaut's otherwise praised book. Truffaut argued that the older version of "The Man Who knew too much" lacked the depth of a later version. Hitchcock replied, "It seems to me that you want me to make movies for the audience," but finally agreed that the 1930s version was the work of a talented amateur and that version was a professional work. No argument there. This is Hitchcock almost near his zenith.
