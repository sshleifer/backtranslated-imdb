Homegrown is one of those films that have cracks but deserve it better. When I first saw him, I had a warm response. But over time, I really grew up - no pun ;-). The more I see it, the more I appreciate it. Writing is top as well as acting. Throw a few surprising portraits and good direction, and end up with a big little movie. It's also good to finally see Hank Azaria, who has a chance to shine in the lead role. And Thornton delivers his usual performance. Even relative newcomer Ryan Phillippe brings, plays friendly innocent with wit and subtlety. On the note side, Homegrown is simply "must see" if you're a Billy Bob Thornton fan. Stephen Gyllenhaal seems to have been influenced by earlier Thornton projects like One False Move and Sling Blade (though Homegrown is certainly much more than language). And the role of Thornton as a character that is both sophisticated and earthly is perfect for the actor.
