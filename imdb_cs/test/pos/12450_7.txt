I remember seeing this movie in the theater in 1984 when I was six (doing math). I loved it very much. I was Tarzan for two weeks after I saw it (climbing furniture, jumping around making monkey sounds). It started with the fascination with Tarzan and the monkeys, but surprisingly enough long-lasting love for Christopher Lambert (remember that I saw Highlander very shortly after that). 1984 I last saw the movie about a month ago. It happened on the cable as I prepared for the bed at 3:30 in the morning, and although it was late and I was tired and had to be at 9:00, I stayed and watched this movie I loved as a child . When I was browsing, I realized it wasn't such a big movie, nor did it make Andie MacDowell's voice dubbed by someone else. Of course, as usual, Ian Holme was usual and surprisingly the monkey still fits the species, but what was most surprising was the good Lambert as Tarzan. Was great! The depth he had captured in such a small number of lines, his primordial body language, and above all his ability to bring this character through his extremely large sheet, was simply amazing. As I said earlier, I'm a Lambert fan, but I'm used to Highlander, The Hunted, and Fortress. He was really pretty good at this movie and it is a pity he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again. To make the short story too long, I was a little bit disappointed that the movie wasn't that good, but I was glad Lambert was good and I don't regret staying until 6:00 to see it.
