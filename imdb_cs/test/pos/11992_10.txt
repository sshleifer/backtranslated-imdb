Like Richard Pryor, Mason never got the material he deserved. Whatever you know about it is probably bad. Get accented and look at his character. You'll be very surprised - it's one of the best stand-ups I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of stand-up comedy (from Lenny Bruce to Eddie Murphy to Jerry Seinfeld to Chris Rock - Jackie Mason) definitely up). He is known to be a comic book comedian. Even Howard Stern said he is one of the top 3 funniest comedians ever. The violence that Mason is not Dangerfield is ridiculous. Dangerfield is famous for being a huge Mason fan. Dangerfield's career didn't go anywhere long until he started after Mason's shows. That's when Mason gave Dangerfield the inspiration for his, "get no respect" routine. While I think Dangerfield is great, you can see them both standing up and see that Mason is a better comedian.
