After reading so much negative press about this movie over the years, I've always avoided it, but the arrival of cheap public domain DVDs encouraged me to finally do it. Unfortunately, it has been moved from a bad copy. A modern prequel, shot on tinted supplies, is blurry and contrast, nonexistent. Faces are sometimes difficult to recognize. With the fact that the real story is fun and Lou comes as a perfect actor, more than in many boys movies. Once the movie goes into the 'Jack' story, the film switches to 'color' and I use that term freely. Most shades are orange or brown. The Greens look particularly bad. Dorothy Ford as "Polly", a giant maid, was a big plus for me when I was having her early 'Andy Hardy'. <br /> <br /> With so many negative comments on the actual print quality, I'm still glad I gave this movie 7. It gave me a lot of laughter and that's more than the vast majority of comedy I've been watching for decades manages. One who watches if you get a chance.
