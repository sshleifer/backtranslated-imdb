When I first saw this movie, I thought, "What the hell?" A 10-year-old child who rides past bizarre places where he meets bizarre people who go after a game called MOTORAMA! Damn Yes! I enjoyed this movie a lot! Jordan Christopher-Michael is a great young actor! It's a pity he stopped acting. He very well interprets his character Gus in the film. Want more? OK, don't even try to understand the story, but why does this movie need one!? Open your mind and let Gus guide you into this path. <br /> <br /> "Motorama Gus, You Won Motorama"
