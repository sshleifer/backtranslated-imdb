Initially, I found that it was really shocking to see how William Shakespeare's work of love was reworked into a bloody, violent and eccentric film adaptation. But once you have seen it, it grows up for you when you look at it for the second and third time you sew a shock and start appreciating the film for your own merits - solid acting, good dialogue, nice sorting and choreography, not-too-bad soundtrack and some (special) effects that continue. And the end. This is a rebellion!
