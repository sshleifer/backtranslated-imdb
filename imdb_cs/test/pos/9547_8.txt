What could happen in a boring Texas city in the summer? Well, a lot of teenagers find that a few things can and can happen. It turns out that the Mexican werewolf of this story is nothing less than el chupacabra and the film, unlike the name, would suggest not a remake or lookalike of American werewolf movies, but something completely different. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not bad for a low budget movie! Some smart camera work, pretty decent looking traditional creatures and gore effects, and for once not all-knowing people who can and make mistakes like shooting a colleague thinks it's a big bad animal, and are confused by things they couldn't know. <br /> <br /> Sit down to expect a million-dollar market and turn it off after a short while. Sit back and expect some fun and a relatively simple story and it's pretty good! Overall, it gets 8/10 from me for being creative, with OK playing, and withdrew some good work for the budget this movie had.
