As an independent Long Island filmmaker who had two theatrical versions under my production / directorial line, I always said how much I could learn when I saw FRED CARPENTER production so I was lucky to have his Eddie Monroe "as my dedication to his excellent budgeting, production, casting, setup, and mastering talent." My heart came out on his characters, it's a story and was absolutely victorious over the trick / switch that brought the movie to fruition! The place was amazingly chosen and human emotions in his characters brought a realistic reference to my ties with all the elements Mr. Carpenter used in his whole life, his and his film benefits!
