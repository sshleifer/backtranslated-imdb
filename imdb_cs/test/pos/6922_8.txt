As Anglo-Irish, I make sure that this reviewer is different than distortion. But I assure you that this is an Irish film - and not English, because it probably suggested the last comment. This film was written by Neil Jorden and Conor McPherson and directed by Conor McPherson - both Irish. The cast is almost entirely Irish - it was shot in Ireland with an Irish crew. Even Michael Gambon was born in Ireland - I remember joking with him about this movie. Michael Cane was apparently brought to increase in boxing sales abroad. <br /> <br /> He loved the movie, I just wanted to fix a completely uninformed comment! Now with revision - I loved Dylan Moran, I've always been a fan of him, himself and Michael Cane has created a surprisingly good double act. It was great to see the Morans range as an actor as he plays several different formed characters during the film. I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in comedy - because it is a fresh, unpredictable and inventive turn in Irish feature laughter. I laughed a lot. what more can you ask for?
