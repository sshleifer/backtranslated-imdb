I remember seeing this movie in the theater and I like it. Last month I stumbled upon him and watched him again and found it better with age. Especially for those of you who describe it as the 80's cheese, if you objectively compare it to the horror fluctuations of the past two decades, it's quite good if they are against films in its unique horror sub-genre that I would call an action / horror movie as opposed to psychological horror such as "shining" or "exorcist". In addition, for his budget, this movie really delivers goods (or in this case bad). The film actually has some character development and gives enough history to the infamous hull of the house to get the atmosphere right in front of the characters stepping into the front door. The film also has some hilarious single inserts and gives a corresponding mood that a creepy horror movie should have. If you compare NOD with the current big horror movie budgets, such as "I'm a Legend" (Vincent Price was much better), this movie really excels. Modern horror flicks have become almost totally dominated by CGI. Most of them have no graph or character at all and are completely predictable. Special effects dominate these films from start to finish and the characters are 24k plastic. When it comes to the 80's horror cheese, I'll take it over 95% of the current genres. On the closing note that NOD saw again, I remembered the beautiful Jill Terashita and wondered why I hadn't seen horror or otherwise in more movies. Jill for a special chance that you read it - I think you are beautiful and you should have been in more movies. Finally, if you like horror action flicks, you probably like it a lot.
