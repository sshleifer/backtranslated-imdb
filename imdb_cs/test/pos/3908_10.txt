This outstanding movie starring Elizabeth Montgomery is long since released in the form of a DVD. The same can be said about her earlier, also excellent, Rape Case. I can only hope that my comments will inspire some enterprising soul to place BOTH Elizabeth Montgomery movies on one DVD that will be made available to many fans. I believe that this excellent acting role was unfortunately stereotyped by her role on Bewitched, and as a result she was not available to more serious acting roles. I'm sure if the two movies, perhaps the Legend of Lizzie Borden trilogy, were released in DVD, her fans would set a record for how highly valued her serious acting skills were.
