Russian actress TATIANA SAMOILOVA reminds me so young Audrey Hepburn and the camera in THE CRANES ARE FLYING seems to love her anyway. She is the focal point of bittersweet war romance on the background of World War II in Moscow. The film is almost poetic in its gorgeous black and white cinematography, which was the main reason for watching the film in the first place because I never heard of it and decided to try it when it was broadcast on TCM. It is a very moving love story about a girl's deep love for a man who is suddenly swept away by his role as a soldier proposed in war Russia. She is unable to forget the memory of her romantic bond to him, but inexplicably marries someone else who has forced her on, a pianist who soon realizes that she still loves the soldier she hopes to hear. Their marriage is a problem because they can't leave the memory of happier time with their soldier pet. At the end of the story, he accepts that he will never come back and be able to face reality and cope with the situation. At the train station, where incoming soldiers greet their loved ones and sincere girls share the joy of returning soldiers by giving bouquets to their joyful family bouquets, it is a very annoying final scene. The stylish and imaginative work with the camera is what carries the film as well as the fairly tale story. Tastefully done, but perhaps English subtitles did not say the whole story, because some elements of the plot seemed a little bit blurred, as if they were overlooked. Summary: Easily understand why she won the award at the Cannes Film Festival. I was reminded in style of another great Russian film BALLAD OF SOLDIER.
