I have always loved ironic symbolism and the brilliant cinematography of Coppola's masterpiece. I was lucky to meet Martin Sheen outside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium one night in 1981 when he waited for Charlie and Emilio to leave the concert. He was very humble about the praise I shared with him for this work of art, especially his portrait of a young captain. That is, no doubt, a necessity to see, a complete 10 and an important part of American film history. "Charlie Don't Surf". Robert Duvall's famous line (other) does not need to repeat as it became oft repetitive anthem, and his Pattonesque character will be long to be remembered as a classic American war hawk in the John Wayne tradition. It's surprising how young Laurence Fishburne looks.
