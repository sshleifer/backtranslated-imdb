I was pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was. Whether you are a gore fan or a tension fan; you will love it. I used to like horror movies, considered them silly. But it will happen anyway, I will make exceptions. I find something extraordinary in this movie. I have seldom seen a movie that scared me, but I'm telling you the truth that this movie trembled my neck. Unlike most horror movies, this person takes care of character development. I highly recommend this movie and I am glad that Asylum finally brings good horror movies in these days <br /> <br /> I recommend! Enjoy!
