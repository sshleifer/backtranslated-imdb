This movie was very different from previous movies and I wondered, "Where's Ralph Macchio?" He could be involved in the plot somewhere like an old friend of Myiagi who teaches Julia what she already knows, and Myiagi can come and add more! Macchio could be in love for Julie in this movie! Does not matter! On a serious level, I enjoyed this movie because it was a teenage girl teaching how to do Karate, and her feelings are very different from what Daniel did. Julie is much wilder than Daniel and needs taming, something that Myiagi considers very demanding; She's a pretty troubled girl and a rough, unpleasant brat! We can all learn from Myiagi's jokes!
