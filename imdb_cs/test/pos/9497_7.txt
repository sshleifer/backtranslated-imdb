I found that this film is full of irony. But watching a movie you can almost see what happens. Leila is a confused, bored wife who is always looking for happiness. When she thinks she will find true happiness, she clings to it and leaves behind everything she knew. But she discovers that her own almost compares notes between her ex and her current husband. She learned that if she shared more information about what had plagued her in her previous marriage, it might have been a lot easier than she wanted. She realizes that words are nothing that happens, but she learns that she is too far into her second marriage and finds herself looking back and hoping to change again. The main conflict in this film is Leila vs. You can't have real luck with being really happy. I like this movie but I would just recommend this movie to women, I can't see men actually find the joy of this movie.
