This is a great movie. The story is grotesque, but the actors are brilliant. Especially Mads Mikkelsen's performance as Svenda is wonderful. It's a simple story about two guys with an urge to do it on their own, but it unfolds with a strange and absurd story where many people accidentally killed and served as chicken steaks. If more people could understand Danish ... That could be a great candidate for the English version. Also worth mentioning is Ole Thestrup, who always adds an extra plot to the fence, with his slightly crazy Holger character. I can only recommend this film to a Danish audience. See also Adams lerbler (2005), Anders Thomas Jensen's film, also with Mads Mikkelsen, accompanied by well-playing Ulrich Thomsen.
