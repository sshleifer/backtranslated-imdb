Unfortunately I have never seen the full version of this movie. I saw the 87-minute version twice, in the fifties. Even more floridly directed than the standard with Julien Duvivier, it's a wonderfully ordinary piece full of crowded shots over, over and into the beautifully atmospheric kits Andrejew. Beautifully lit by photographer Andr√© Thomas, Black Jack is nothing if not an expert. Strengthening this imaginative visual style is a scenario that allows us to list our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalia, some brilliantly bizarre, thoroughbred characterization. George Sanders gives polished performance while an eccentric millionaire (who turns out to be a rival racketeer) is admirably played by Agnes Moorehead. She also recognizes most of her role, Patricia Roc. The film was made in places in Spain in 1949.
