John Huston has completed his remarkable career with one of the most sophisticated and sensitive movies I've ever seen. To say goodbye, he decided to adapt the beautiful story of James Joyce "The Dead" and made not only one of the most faithful adaptations of film literature, but also created a film that is still far more than 20 years later. contemporary film. When I watched this film as a university student a few years ago, I watched the screen in amazement, admiring every aspect of the film: playing, writing on screen, direction, costume, environment, music, cinematography. I'm thinking about it, I still can't do anything I criticize. Huston just knew how to tell a good story. Tony Huston should also get a lot of credit. He knew he was better than a text that was not only perfection itself, but was already visual enough to focus on film. Father and son let the story breathe and enjoy long, fascinating conversations between characters and in meaningful silence. Donal McCann also deserves credit for his performance as Gabriel Conroy. I've never seen him in movies, nor have I seen him, but he has one of the most prestigious performances I've ever seen. All in all, The Dead is a great movie experience, from a legendary director who has never ceased to be excellent.
