I didn't expect to like it. I actually watched it because a friend knew that a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but was not credited. Knowing that Dylan Thomas, and indeed being grateful for his poetry, but conscious and somewhat anxious about the man, I didn't feel that I needed to see a twee adaptation of his lame bohemian life bare. and that wasn't it. critical and yet grateful. it made me cry. Kiera Knightley was excellent, even with a slightly tense Welsh accent, and it's a sad story they say. Dylan thomas is not a hero, but unfortunately he has not been throughout his life and in fact are not so-called "wild woman" pr spiel. this is cillian william movie. a man who leaves a woman he loves to fight a war they ignore. his call for reconnection with this indifference is what is really the interest of this film and what a beautiful performance of this actor. i thiink this movie is underestimated because it was sold so badly. Dylan thomas fans will expect something more from their so very bad hero and get less, and that is how it was on the market. it's not a movie about Dylan Thomas and it's much more interesting.
