In full contrast to the previous correspondent, I thought that the Shoppen Munich (as it was billed in English with English subtitles here in London at the German Film Festival in November 2007) was very funny, very good and well written. It's pretty daring to design a 100-minute film that consists exclusively and relentlessly of talking heads. But I think Ralf Westhoff succeeded with wit and zest. No standard film devices, say, following the renowned character of the soul, with some meditative tiny-seventh chord music and long shots of nature. But when someone said something that revealed their souls - well, we were on a man with a timer for another superficial show. Which is, of course, a point: a collapsing field of superficiality of thirty places where everything is quick to answer and answer. Maybe most of the movies are so clich√© and stupid that we are English ready to laugh at any vaguely intelligent and uncontrolled movie, but I can promise you that in today's screening (Curzon Cinema, Sun November 25, 2007) the whole audience roared with laughter. So I wasn't the only one to argue! My girlfriend (who speaks German and lived in Munich) thought it was merry. I (who doesn't speak German and I think I wasn't in Munich) thought it was funny. I would recommend Shoppen (Munich) to anyone (especially couples ...) looking for a clever, witty, original, wise film about the superficiality of modern relationships and the confusion of a generation who feels they have lost their joy -all after the first round. NB: In the English subtitle in London, subtitles (which were very good) showed quite below the slightly reduced image, not inside it. I thought it was a good thing.
