Mostly encountered in the back streets of Toronto NG, it is a dark, mysterious journey that leads the viewer into the minds of a young man and woman (Vern and Sarah), each of whom has a fascination with riddles and a disastrous incident in the past. Gentle dialogue and first-class casting drive this low key, noirish way into the girl's quest for meaning behind the word riddles that appear in her life. She helps her, anything but an enthusiastic friend, they both get to the end of their journey, but with the price they have to pay. The film never wants to answer all its mysteries, but it has an excellent job in exposing a few plot twists
