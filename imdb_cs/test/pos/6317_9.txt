I saw Le Conseguenze Dell'Amore at the Rotterdam Film Festival in 2005, the first of ten films I've seen there. Le Conseguenze has left the strongest impression of ten films. You know from the first shot that the movie will be something special. Beautiful cinematography has left me in awe of what can be done with the camera. The music is also at the same level with visual elements that complement the colorful and stylish architecture-like images. Toni Servillo plays the lead character of Titta. She is a tax expert who lives in a hotel. He brings a suitcase with money to the bank every week and plays a story about it. He is always very controlled and shows no emotions to anyone; It looks good and good. He has the habit of ignoring people who have no meaning for him. For example, Sofia (played very nicely by Olivia Magnani), who works as a bartender at a hotel where she lives. Even if he works for two years, he never greets her, even if he greets him. One day he confronts him, and the next day he sits at the bar instead of his usual window seat. Hence the story really begins and will develop in a strong story of love, sacrifice and mafia. <br /> <br /> I won't spoil the rest of the movie. Check out this movie if you like stylish movies like those of David Lynch, Godfather, etc. You don't see it if you're an action buff.
