On June 22, 1941, the city of Przemysl, Poland is divided between German and Russian. When the Germans invade the city, the Nazis send Jews to the ghetto. Young Catholic Fusia Podgorska (Kellie Martin) hides and hides many Jews in the attic of his home with his young sister for two and a half years until the end of the war. "Hidden in Silence" is another good story of human sympathy in World War II. This film looks like "Rescuers: Tales of Courage" and is also based on the true story. Unfortunately, actress Kellie Martin plays a strong and strong lead character, but she is very weak for such a role. In many dramatic situations, the expression of her face is not convincing. I noticed that many IMDb users liked her performance, but I'm not sure if they like her amazing character or her performance really. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ocultos no Medo" ("Hidden in Fear")
