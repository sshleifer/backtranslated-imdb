.. especially Lambert. That's the basic Burrough Tarzan I grew up when I was a kid. I read some negative reviews on this movie and I couldn't help but wonder what their problem was. Of course, they didn't see the movie I did, or they expected something more similar to the Saturday afternoon series. That was Tarzan, who was from the novel and filmmakers should be pleased. solution of the source material and take it seriously. Lambert was excellent. I still think he's one of Hollywood's least rated actors. That was the movie shining on. The photos and apes made by Rick Baker were amazing. You certainly felt from the jungle. The other half, Tarzan's attempt at civilization, really pulls you into an emotional conflict that has been forced to resolve. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie
