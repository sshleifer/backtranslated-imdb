After two years of using this movie review site, I finally registered with IMDB, so I could give Farscape "10". The show is writers, cast and crew have proved to be unambiguous masters of the sci-fi genre. Even those who do not usually appreciate science fiction should be encouraged to give this exceptional series a chance! Farscape's merits are just too much to be listed, but one of them stands out above all; the quality of writing is amazing. Since Blake's 7th, I have not heard this dialogue. In fact, Farscape feels a lot like "Blake is 7" with good special effects and a little more romance. <br /> <br /> Everyone, enjoy!
