Let's face it, a lot of bad movies are still. For those people who work in the movie, you've probably poured a lot of time and effort into many of these fewer miracles. Sometimes, and that's my opinion, it's just an act that is important to us. Tell a story (no matter how simple and unrealistic). The collaboration process is also one of the key features unique to film and theater. To produce any caliber, it requires the talents of different people, depending on its scale, to revive its story. However, the most interesting part of the American film is not the film. He is a filmmaker as a character of his life that requires our attention. None of them serve as models of the creators we know and work with. But I will argue that they are the archetypes of small parts that try to be part of this iconic activity of independent filmmaking. (Very small part of us all right) These are the people who live under the rocks of their own lives, so they accidentally found themselves in a romantic movie. This leads me to another argument. American film captures the raw spirit of independent filmmaking. Bad stories tell about (today) digital film with sloppy effects and terrible performances - because it's the best they can do with a budget of several thousand dollars, rather than a studio budget of several million dollars a day. This is the difference between low low end productions and studio productions. An independent filmmaker just wants to create a linear or even non-linear storyline that will shoot as well as he does with the money he invests in himself and the resources around him to see the finished product on his television. Robust individualism manifests itself in every artistic form. I consider this film a great documentary of truth for many filmmakers. And no, I'm not full of myself. Man, these people are cheerful. Their problems seem merry, their features are merry. Best line movie: "It's okay! .. It's okay! There's something that could live! Jesus told me!" He said a million times a funny old man. Hat's gone to Tom Beach. Chicago Rules.
