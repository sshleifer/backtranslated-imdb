I think FARSCAPE is the best scifi from Babylon 5 and is one of the best science fiction TV series of all time (with Dr. Who, Blake 7, Red Dwarf, MST3K and B5 mentioned above). I found that Farscape's characters and races are more interesting and imaginative than the typical "human-to-mole" found in many series. The effects are pretty good and the stories get involved. Despite the lack of season 2 and some season 1, I consider developing characters very well.
