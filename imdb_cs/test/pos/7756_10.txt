You won't be able to turn away from your return and you won't want to. "Melancholy Haruhi Suzumiya" (Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu) is one of the funniest anime I've seen for a long time. If you can turn away from crazy and sometimes perverse, humor, it is easy to find a brilliantly designed and masterfully done job. Part of the brilliance is based on the fact that the episodes are not in a chronological view. so that you don't have to understand some of the things he talks about, but as the series progresses, you'll find yourself saying "ah, so that's what they meant!" While it might confuse some people, after watching the show you will hardly be able to make a case against telling a story in this fashion. After all, he focuses on the characters. The title character, Haruhi Suzumiya, is by far one of the most idiosyncratic heroes of any anime ever. Her opening speech in her class, in which she claims to be "not interested in normal people," and is looking for "espers, extraterrestrials and passengers in time," is absolutely bizarre, but she's so nice. Then there's Kyon, the "normal" guy who is drawn into the madness surrounding Suzumiya-san. It's a storyteller and his quick joke always makes the scene a lot more fun. He finds himself in the midst of various factions trying to influence Haruhi Suzumiya, and the other three figures are representatives of these factions; ironically, they are the same beings that Haruhi is looking for, and yet they cannot be revealed to her. The first of them is Yuki Nagato, a quiet girl who has become the only member of the school literary club and a representative of the Integration Mindset; she is basically an alien, although the best description is a computer program in the human body. Her purely emotional reactions make her a comical corpse, and you always think she is more than just an eye. Then there is Mikuru Asahina, a time traveler who is incredibly cute, the main ditz, and the subject of Suzumiya's plans to promote her club, the SOS brigade, to the world. The end result is that Suzumiya is doing her things that border on sexual harassment so they dress up in fetish uniforms. The ultimate character is Koizumi Itsuki, a shy and constantly optimistic philosopher who becomes Haruhi's "espero", although he can only use his powers under certain conditions. The end result of all these characters is comedy, unlike others, it's both raw and deep, and always brilliant. Do not believe me? Check out the first episode, their "student film". You'll see what I mean.
