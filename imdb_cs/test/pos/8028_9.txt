This film is about Carlos "Jackal" (Quinn), an international terrorist who, according to the CIA agent Henry Fields (Sutherland), apparently regrets women and children for what the hell he is doing. At least that's what he says to blame the US naval officer, Annibal Ramirez (Quinn again), to take on the role of acting as Carlos and put him as a traitor in the KGB's eyes. Ramirez is apparently physically identical to Carlos, but he is mentally opposed to Carlos. He is carried by order and Carlos is carried by chaos. The film is not all that would be shot from a gun, and that's a good thing. In her first half, Ramirez undergoes training to act and think like Carlos, and it is actually where the film reaches its difference from other run-of-the-mill flicks action. Israeli agent (Kingsley) joins Fields in Ramirez training and together they take on the role of parents in giving birth to a new character Ramirez. Ramirez learns that he doesn't like the things that Carlos doesn't like, acting for a fraction of a second like Carlos, and even making love to Carlos (courtesy of former friend Carlos). All that is learned would be naturally used in the later half of the film. It's a little fancy, but Quinn gives a stunning performance like Carlos-wannabe. Another thing I liked about this movie was that it didn't use much of the inherited conspiracy in bad double movies. , the one in which the evil twin goes into the family of a good twin. Ramirez's family comes into the picture, but instead emphasize how his new character is wrecked on his family life. A good laughing humor that often comes with the acerbic duo Sutherland and Kingsley is featured in this film. The exception is the overused and seemingly gratuitous joke with Ramirez's first name (Annibal, Annabelle, getting it?). Also exaggerated was the constant pursuit of the duo about how powerful and cunning and smart Carlos is. In my opinion, during the last showdown, the payout was unable to cope with the building. Overall, the movie was nice. I am not a big action movie fan, but this movie was more intelligent and witty than the average action movie and my attention remained. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10
