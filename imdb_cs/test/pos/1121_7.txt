Another of the infinite amount of cookie-cutter 'Kickboxers to fight to death for the amusement of Rich Scumbags' movies that there was so much of the 90's ... You know, those created by the words 'Death', 'Blood' and 'Steel' and the words "Ring", "Fight", "Match" and "Cage" and placing them in a random generator! However, Death Match is said to be quite a good entry into the over-used genre, thanks to its exciting battle scenes and surprisingly good kickboxer performance. The story relates to two friends - ex- World Kickboxing Champion John Larson (played by Pug-faced Middleweight Kickboxing Champ Ian Jacklin, probably earlier best known for his terrible performance as a major villain in Ring of Fire 2) and Nick Wallace (Nick Hill, a sympathetic guy probably best known for the role of street-warrior Sergio in Bloodsport 2), who works the LA docks of the shipping crate. One discovery of boxing weapons and a short battle later, our two heroes are unemployed and lean on the bar. Reasonable John Larson decides to head north and seek work; stubborn Nick Wallace heard a guy who paid good money to fighters to fight in private kickboxing matches. "Why should it change?" says John: "If you need me, I'll be there." Predictably, it doesn't take long for Nick to disappear and his good friend struggles in a deadly "death circle" trying to find a lead to his missing friend. Certainly, there are no prizes for originality here, but as I said, this power of film lies in its action, in the casting of real fighters in real life and in relatively good performances that can pull them out. Ian Jacklin particularly surprised me. I used to see him as a bad guy in the Ring of Fire 2 and in the tripe bits like The Steel Ring, and I was always quite amused at how bad the actor is (good fighter!). But in Death Match it's pretty good! Given a decent script and hairstyle, it turns out to be a pretty charismatic leader! And his friendship with Nick is very well portrayed. Jacklin and Hill have nice chemistry and you really believe that these two characters take care of themselves. Enough for one of them to lose their jobs, travel halfway across the country and risk death to save others. It was also nice to see Matthias Huesa as a criminal follower with a bit more depth than we are accustomed to seeing from his many "criminal peasants". But don't be fooled when he thinks he's a star just because he is on the cover of the video (with his head stuck on Michael Bernard's Shootfighter), he is good when he's on the screen, but he is not on a lot .. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, the movie is pretty slow when there is no fight going on, with lots of useless scenes (what is with Jimmie Fiorello's gangster is a pointless story about his grandfather?) , and the end of the fight is disappointing short, but overall I enjoyed it! Lots of fighting, most of them good. Isn't that what we really need martial arts? And of course eye candy, here in a beautiful form very nice Renee Ammann. All in all, a pretty fun kickboxing movie.
