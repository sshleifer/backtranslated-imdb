Paul Mazursky's Tempest - An interesting, weird and special movie about the mid-life crisis. Set in NYC and a remote Greek island with John Cassavettes as a world-renowned architect who decides to drop. He is accompanied by his daughter (Molly Ringwald) and social singer (Susan Sarandon). An interesting trip.Rulul Julia and Gena Rowlands round off a strong cast. A good drama mixed with comedy and tension and near madness. B +
