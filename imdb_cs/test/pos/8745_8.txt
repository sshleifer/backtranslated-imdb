I have read countless reviews about mini series superiority. I certainly cannot agree on such a blanket statement. If you analyze all aspects of video / film production, there are numberable areas where the film is probably superior. Of course, many of these comments are valid for specific mini areas. -series. Specifically, in terms of more threads (customs) and more advanced themes (eg Pakistani farmer and family). That means I found out that the character of Catherine Zeta-Jones is much more convincing than desperate women, from poverty to wealth, which doesn't "come back". This is a much more sympathetic character than the cold women, who apparently didn't have so many reasons to turn to evil. (And yes, I see ... her children. She was desperate, I didn't see her as desperate.) <br /> <br /> I also appreciated some of the other topics that appear in the story. In the mini-series, Benicio del Toro's character was very convincing. Film anchor. This thread has changed (as an alternative to the Pakistani family) in nothing but good. Fantastic adaptation. (Of course I am skeptical that in such a system there may be someone who is so clean, but I do not have enough information about the nation's policy.) <br /> <br /> After watching the first episode of the mini-series, I actually revised the movie. Why? I read about fantastic acting. I found that the performances in the first episode of the mini-series are borderline laughter. Sure, this improved as the mini-series progressed. Now that I have just completed both versions in a few days, I cannot agree that the performances in the mini-series have reached the same level as, say, Benicio del Toro, who was brilliant in the film, though Ormand, Paterson, Shah, and Lindsay Duncan were very good. I also feel that the police in the film far exceeded the mini-series. The Germans had not impressed me by that time. Finally, the dialogue, as it was introduced in the film, is much more different. Especially in scenes that are almost literal. "Careful, you're starting to sound like your husband." Unlike "HAHAHAHA! You sound like Karl." Again, I found that some of the mini-series games are unconvincing. That was the main example. Other superior aspects of the film, in my opinion: score, cinematography, editing. <br /> <br /> Should I complain that the movie wasn't longer? No. I think it was a fantastic adaptation to the format. The changes were on their own. Would you like to sit in the theater at 5/7/10. Of course not. Mini-Series: 8 of 10 <br /> <br /> Movie: 9 of 10
