This movie was great and fun. Pauly's funny. The best-looking girl is Tiffani all the time, she is absolutely hot in this film and proves she can deal with this film. This movie needs to see comedy .... and it's not all about Tiffani, his great movie in general, but Tiffani adds a taste for this movie because she's doing her scene very well and she's all the way sexy .... .
