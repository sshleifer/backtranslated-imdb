Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918, a doughboy who can't seem to get a marching straight. He spends time "there" in the trenches of the First World War. Several gags stand out: Limburger cheese as a makeshift grenade for one. The shingles of the barracks in the trenches, where Chaplin and his friends wash out their beds from the floods, are the highlight. Chaplin ends up seizing several German soldiers with one hand, and controls the German commander for refusing a cigarette. Asked how he did it, Chaplin replies that he surrounded them. Chaplin hides behind the enemy line as a tree of all things, and these scenes are very funny. She escapes into a bombed house where she meets a French girl, played by Edna Purviance. He is watched by German soldiers, again escaping them and Purviance is arrested for help. Chaplin is able to pull out at a fast pace by blowing up a soldier and using a soldier uniform. He eventually saves Purviance of course and captures Kaiser in the process. Chaplin on the way employs some gags and grotesque when turning German soldiers. With this film, Chaplin explored the location options in filming while keeping the audience's attention for closer to the feature length of time, something his contract with Mutual Film Company banned him. The film also allowed him to entertain the enemy, something he would do again in a larger dictator. *** of 4 stars.
