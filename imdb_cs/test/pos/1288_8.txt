The debut that has been torn from the darkness of one of the brighter stars of the current noira is sure if it is limited to stabbing the game and obsessing. Filmed for zero money, Nolan couldn't choose a better item than the drab and underside of London to overcome his business, due to lack of funds. This short (67 min.) It is best that he plays with the expectations of the audience and the protagonists about who he is, although the initial setting was ringing in the alarm bell. Muddy cinematography (he often used natural lighting for a budget) can be mostly written up to a stylish noir, though the restriction shows occasionally. One can easily see Nolan's style evolve in this fledgling effort; in MEMENTO and INSOMNIA many same themes of blurred identity are repeated. It's not a masterpiece, but good and certainly worth a look at the modern fans of Noir and Nolan.
