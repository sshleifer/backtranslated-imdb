This movie is amazing because it turned out how good cartoons really looked in the 80s, animators weren't lazy like they are today, the caricature had so much detail with very little resources they have with them compared to what we have Today If more people were asked to have these cartoons rebroadcasting, maybe all the other cartoons of the 80s would show up on TV again, so I would like to say that it was the cartoon I grew up with, he was on TV again.
