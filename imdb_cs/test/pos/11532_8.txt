I've seen this movie three times and every time I appreciate it more. I think Jordana Brewster should have been nominated for an Emmy for her real and natural performance. Many of us who were Phoebe at that time will understand how real it is. Life for most of us is neither gently glowing romantic nor cruel cynical pessimism. It is a blurred balance and this film captures this balance. It is also well designed, with many fine details in its composition. Just like the film, or not, judging by the extremely high ratings it receives from demographic women under the age of 18, we know that this film reveals some important truth about how young women are seen in the world.
