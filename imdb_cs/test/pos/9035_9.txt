Alien in the Dust (1949) Director: Clarence Brown <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br /> <br /> Outstanding Story of "Southern Gothic", adapted from Faulkner's novel, about a black man accused of murdering a white man who asks a young white boy to help him prove his innocence. Lucas Beauchamp (Juano Hernandez) is an anomaly in this small town. He is a black man who owns the country he lives on and does not think that it is much of a sick social order that mostly maintains peace and in many similar small towns. So when Lucas is found to hold a gun over Vinson Gowrie's dead body, shot in the back no less, young Chick Mallison (Claude Jarman) (who Lucas once rescued after Chick failed through the ice while hunting on his land) fears that the city has finally a chance to "do Lucas *****. " Arrested, and with a very real chance of being lynched before the night ends, Lucas gets to help Chick as the only person he knows is "not overcrowded". Chick asks his uncle John, a lawyer to defend Lucas, and while the man is initially harassed by his own ideas, he agrees and fights the crowd to save Lucas's life. The film has an unusual sincerity for its time and is mostly without moralization. The character of a lawyer tends to speak an incredibly self-confident dialogue that sounds mostly like something from a printed page, but has a minimal impact on the tone. This is due to the rich characteristics of everyone else. Juano Hernandez, who most of the time appeared in Oscar Micheaux's films, is excellent as a proud Lucas. Porter Hall as the father of the murdered man, perhaps in the best role I've ever seen, and Elizabeth Patterson as the unhappy old lady liking Lucas's case, standout in supporting roles. The setting is perfectly realized. It is actually filmed in Oxford, Mississippi, Faulkner's hometown. Brown also uses the crowd effectively, it's always an anonymous crowd against one person (like Lucas, when he is arrested or John when he goes to his office), that is very menacing. Or the grotesque flesh of the whole city, which was in jail to witness lynching, as if it were a show. Notice the absolutely riveting scene when Chick and his friend Aleck set out for the cemetery. Robert Surtees (BAD AND BEAUTIFUL, THIRTY SECONDS BEFORE TOKYO, BEN-HUR) shot the picture. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of 4
