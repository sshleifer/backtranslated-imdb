Looking back on years of Jim Henson's work after his death, it's like looking back at another time. Unlike most of the so-called creative types they are trying to sell, or worse, to cynically exploit, children nowadays never seemed to really forget what it was like to be a child. And if there ever was a moment in which it was demonstrated, the Labyrinth Party is a 1979 Muppet Movie. Muppet Film ends with a confirmation of everything progressive. children who did not meet the expected standard in the 1980s. And as we look forward to the fruits of the era in which we are gossiped and bound to talk about something that no one can offend, there is an open celebration of difference or diversity that has formed a large part of the Muppet Show. I said it in other notes, but I have to say it here. The big light in the world came out on the day Jim Henson died. The movie Muppet begins its cast to sit to see the premiere of what it is about to see for another eighty minutes. With short and precise moves, we are introduced to major players and some minors. And when that story starts, boy, we have a great song that takes us to the moment. The rainbow link painted both a beautiful and sad image of what the muppets were, especially Kermit. It wasn't just a lot of felt puppets with singular personalities who came together to take part in the show. They were living things based on part of all of us, just writing as boldly as we are used to. When we met each of us, we saw another reflection of ourselves, and children in the audience would react differently to each character. So everyone had a favorite. When the animal appeared behind the drum set and tried to eat cymbals, I knew I had found one of mine. I'm more of a Swedish chef now, but what the hell. <br /> <br /> A number of musical numbers complemented the characters, which further developed their motivations and personalities. Can you imagine that? shared insight into Dr. Teeth and his bands, as well as the creative soul of Henson. But the most relevant song for me was Gonzo's number, which asked what it was and where it came from. Many of us would spend a lifetime looking at the stars, and as Gonzo said we knew we would be back there once. Not that all the songs were so fatal. Fozzy and Kermit share a number after they decide to combine their talents (or lack thereof) and go on a journey. If today's "musicians" were required to lose the ability to use pop structure to create something audible, this would be the number. Never before, and never again, would the group dynamics of cast and music complement each other perfectly. With puppeteers and voice actors so perfectly at the top of their game, the human cast had a lot to live up to. <br /> <br /> Which makes it all the more amazing that the human element also lived until the end of the deal. Cameos literally pepper movie, with all from Steve Martin to Telly Savalas popping in to offer your support. Richard Pryor, the last person to be expected in the Muppet movie, seems to have started a cheerful moment. Mel Brooks's portraits are as disturbing to me as they are to adults, like when I was a little boy, but I suspect it's because Henson knew why I now find it disturbing. But the great acting power comes from Charles Durning, who, as Doc Hopper, embodies everything Henson and his audience have decided to resist. At each intersection, Hopper comes to either offer Kermit a chance to sell out and betray his own kind. Or perhaps offer breaks to be the right word when Hopper's attempts to secure Kermit's consensus are gradually becoming stronger and more violent. The whole thing is one great metaphor for how each artist has his heart broken by the world. Of course, the animal also turns out to remind us that precisely because our friends are not nice and cuddly less than a friend. In fact, it turned out that the animal was Kermit's best friend at the moment. And that is the main message of any good show or film that Henson has been involved in ever since. To avoid or reject others simply because of linguistic or cosmetic differences could literally be the worst mistake a person ever makes. There is no doubt that in today's world, where an ant in purple suit can tell my sons that they are not good, if they do not have good feelings for fifteen seasons and are still not under close scrutiny of childcare, Henson's Creation Workshop could never they didn't get out of the country. Misleading the title of the album, daring to be stupid is one thing, but forcing the choice on others is another thing. Muppet shows how Henson dared to ask us to think both inside and outside the proverb. He would never be different from him, but he would never want us to stop trying. That's why Muppet Movie is the epitome of ten out of ten movies. If we sent a movie to space to prove intelligent life, that we have more to cost than to be destroyed, it would be.
