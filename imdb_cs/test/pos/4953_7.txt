In the 1980s, patriotism and, in some cases, lack of expression. "This time we can win", a line known from Rambo: First Blood part II. Desire for the style of the movies they grew up with, unpacking the balls on the wall "we're good, your bad ... now we throw something out and go home" While Rambo, Rocky and most of the Top Weapon seemed more focused on attracting an older Iron Eagle crowd he went straight to the children. Canadian writer and director Sidney J. Furie brings everything you love and hate about the time period. The kick in the pants emerges from the 80s anthem (never say die, Road of the Gypsy, etc.) On top and sometimes an incredible action adventure. Iron Eagle succeeded for one reason ... it was F.U.N - Fun. It's a type of movie that you can turn on and sit down and enjoy every nonsensical moment of the 80s. You don't have to think about whether it could really happen, or if the acting is truly believable, it's just fun ... and that's all you can really ask in this type of movie ...
