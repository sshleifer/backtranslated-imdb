This classic blaxploitation about kung fu mom, who travels to Hong Kong to avenge her brother's death, offers everything you learned from the genre. Playmate Jeannie Bell (with a giant afro) really kicks ass and usually loses clothes very quickly. If you don't take it too seriously, the movie is great to watch. Stan Shaw gives a solid performance, Jeannie Bell is a little less convincing. Pam Grier is not. There Quentin Tarantino got his idea for a scene to switch lights in "Jackie Brown". Don Julian's soundtrack is a gem and is often used in rap songs.
