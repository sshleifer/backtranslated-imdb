Alfred Hitchcock shows originality in a remake of his own 1934 British film, "A Man Who Knew Too Much". This 1956 take the same story is much lighter than the previous one. Mr. Hitchcock was lucky to have co-workers who went with him from one movie to another, and so they kept the standard in their work. Robert Burks did a great job with cinematography and editing of George Tomasini shows his talent. Eventually, Bernard Herrmann is seen conducting at the magnificent Royal Albert Hall in London on top of the picture. James Stewart was an actor who worked well with Mr. Hitchcock. In this version, he plays a doctor from Indiana on vacation with his wife and son. When we met him, they are on their way to Marrakesh on a local bus and begin to intrigue. His wife is the most beautiful day of Doris. Before her marriage she was a well-known singer and now she is a perfect wife and mother. The film has some good support cast, Brenda DeBanzie, Bernard Miles, Daniel Gelin, Alan Mowbray, among others, doing a great job in portraying their characters. Although this is a "light Hitchcock", one cannot reject it as a failure. "The man who knew too much" is a change of pace for Hitchcock fans.
