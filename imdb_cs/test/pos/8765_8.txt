Saboteur is a 1942 film, partly aimed at gaining American support for the war against Nazi Germany. Propaganda or not, it's great fun. Leading actors are Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, although director Alfred Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck in roles that would give the film a bigger character. This is a good movie as well with Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, who bring their own style to their characters. As in other Hitchcock films, we see the director's disrespect socially polite and well-supported. He often portrayed spies and foreign agents as nice miner-class people who at the same time grinned at democratic values ​​and notions such as guilty until proven innocent. These traitors from the upper crust are the last to follow or even suspect by the police. Hitchcock had a lifelong distrust of the police. He wanted to promote an ordinary guy, a fool and a colleague who wasn't taking too seriously. You can see that he wants Gary Cooper as an icon in the form of Frank Capra. However, Bob Cummings puts his own stamp on the boy-side door and works well in the role. Priscilla Lane, as a spunky female leader, performs as an American girl who can do pretty well in the rehearsal. Robert Cummings, a defensive worker at Barry Kane, is dedicated to bombing who kills his best friend. This leads to a cross-country chase scene reminiscent of other Hitchcock heroes on the run. Hitchcock repeats some well-established formulas from previous films - a reluctant woman who is drawn into action, such as Madeleine Carroll in 39 steps, and risked her life to avoid the authorities behind her. We look at the scenes of America because Kane is trying to find a real culprit in the bombing of what he is accused of. We see rivers, bridges, backwoods cabs, truckers, Hoover Dam and finally New York City. New York is the perfect backdrop for the climax when we go from Rockefeller Center to the ocean liner (with a Normandie boat) and a spectacular final at the Statue of Liberty. Great movie with continuous action. Don't miss it.
