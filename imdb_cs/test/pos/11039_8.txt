This short was the first short released by Paramount's famous study and was one of several done studio showing Popeye involved directly against the enemy, most often Japanese. While Warner Brothers, Disney and, to a lesser extent, other studios, made shorts often depicting Germans as foil, most of the efforts of famous studies focused on the Japanese. Since Pearl Harbor and Popeye maritime ties, this is quite understandable. This is an average short time. Seein 'Red, White and' Blue and Spinach Aged for Britain. But it's still worth watching. Recommended.
