Wow, what can I say was a good movie, very different from all the boring remakes we've seen recently, the only thing I'd like to see a little more than the end when Jane left her husband. it fell on her, not just her, but everything she was, so I wished it. The producers would actually show that this ending would, instead of keeping it with their imagination, ended up that I really hate it when they do it. Aviation looked like fun, but I think you should be light and muscular, I'd like to see more movies like this, maybe it could be some sort of sequel to Jane and Serena. she would go for the girl too she was attractive.
