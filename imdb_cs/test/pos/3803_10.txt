Although this film has never achieved commercial fame, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-executed artistic expressions often do not gain mass appeal. The story depicts a young boy who steals a car and sets out on a surreal dream adventure with a very small foundation in our concept of time and space. Anyone who is trying to see this film in terms of its reality is likely to be disappointed; it should not be "realistic". It is however intended to be metaphorical with extensive symbolism apparent to those with excellent attention to detail. In addition, symbolic representations are left open for interpretation, which can be said of a large number of works of art. Do not be fooled by the envelope (if you rent or buy this movie) - the film is not what might appear to be on the surface.
