This is actually a very good surrealistic mysterious film, despite the description it is trying to sell as a Sci-Fi movie. The Balkan stars are a woman chased by mysterious visions and lost memories, trying to get together. He spends most of his film trying to make sense of his visions. Very atmospheric and effective. It is true that Kinski does not appear very well in this film, but the actors looking at him are very good. In the US, only the English dubbed version is available and dubbing leaves something that is desirable, but the actors do a very good job. The cinema, winner of the Vittorio Storaro Academy, is excellent. Also Bazzoni's former Giallo, the Fifth Cord, is also excellent, as well as the Storarro lens.
