Family Guy must be my favorite cartoon of all time. It's definitely the funniest TV show ever and is better than The Simpsons. I was never allowed to laugh so strongly in a TV show in my life. Conspiracy, characters and themes that are dealt with in the show.There are very few topics that have not been addressed by Family Guy. I've seen just about every Family Guy episode ever made and I would have to say that the show was better in the first two seasons. The second favorite character is Stewie because he is the funniest villain to be on TV show. comic genius! 10/10
