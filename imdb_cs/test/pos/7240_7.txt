Often overlooked in Agatha Christie's stories is her progressive, anti-conservative attitude to a number of issues - from the role of women to the effects of tradition on the faith of people in supernatural. In "Nemesis" you can spot a lot of these overtones - but you can also find good old fashioned interesting secrets that keep you in the dark for most of your length. Also, lifting "Nemesis" over other series entrances ("They're doing it with mirrors", "4:50 from Paddington," etc.), is the fact that you can really feel the tension at the key moments before and after the killer's appearance. Finally, Jane Booker is protected and protects my body at any time. (***)
