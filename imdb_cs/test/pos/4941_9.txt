When I played the first Soul Calibur on the Dreamcast, I thought it was great. When I played the other, I was addicted. Finally, when Soul Calibur III was released, I bought a playstation 2 and a game. <br /> <br /> It can help you keep the clock for hours, with a huge number of characters, lots of unlockable content and not. to mention the big combat system, it is really the biggest fighting game to date. Strengths Games is primarily a game versus gameplay, two people were fighting each other, either playing as one of the main characters or as a crafted and customized character. Create Character is huge and allows the player to create thousands of different combinations. The only thing that worries me is that if you create a character that uses the "Grieve Edge" fighting style (kicks only), it must wear those ridiculous shoes. ^ ^ <br /> <br /> This is the biggest fighting game you could ever want. Now I just hoped the planned movie wouldn't be stupid.
