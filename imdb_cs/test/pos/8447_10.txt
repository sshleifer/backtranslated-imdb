I work at a nuclear power plant, so I get these answers. <br /> <br /> Seriously. Go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisades_Nuclear_Generating_Station and see where I work. I couldn't think a safer industry would work. events as tiny as paper cuts. Any problem identified as a potential problem with respect to nuclear, radiological or industrial safety is immediately identified in the corrective action process. The bottom line is that US nuclear power plants are working with the security of their minds.
