In the post of Civil War, America, President, (Van Johnson), travels to Dallas and is murdered by corrupt officials and an entrepreneur who is interested in installing a vice president who can blackmail them for incriminating documents. The shooter (Guiliano Gemma), convinced that his black friend is wrongly accused of murder, aims to reveal the truth. Tonino Valeri drove this fascinating, if it is a wrong movie, which is of course an allegory for Kennedy's assassination. The film may misrepresent blacks as slaves working on plantations in Texas, but the film is still pleasant and presents an interesting interpretation - that Kennedy's death was the result of a coup that many Americans could not accept at the time. Oswald's murder is replayed as a black murder defendant murdered by responsible men on their way to Fort Worth prison. This moment in the film is more melodramatic than Oswald's death with his various escorts shot down before his over the top of the death scene. However, this is definitely one of the more interesting and valuable spaghetti westerns. Worth a look!
