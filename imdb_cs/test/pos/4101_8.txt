The reelling of the classic story is set to music by Burt Bacharach and lyrics by Hal David. Actors in this fairy tale of the outer world, who meet the mystical Shangrala, appear to be real people. It is a pleasure to watch Bobby Van, whose acting role is given to me by Red Buttons, and as always by George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke), who always carries gravity in his roles. Surprisingly, Charles Boyer is an older lama. Who would know? <br /> <br /> The versatile cast, including Michael York and Olivia Hussey, makes this work a goalkeeper for those of us who value people.
