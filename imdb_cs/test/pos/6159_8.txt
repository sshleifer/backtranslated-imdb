Involvement from Europe about Czech fighter pilots flying to the RAF during World War II. As an American, it is always interesting to see a new view of known events in history. There is nothing terribly original or revolutionary about the style in which it is filmed, or about the romantic love triangle that tells the story. Yet it is convincing all the way. There is a good balance between drama, romance, humor, action and symbolism that is beautifully underestimated by the director and cast. This is the breath of fresh air after sitting over crowded and boring Hollywood epics like "Pearl Harbor". Solid production all around. It is definitely worth your time if you are a fan of foreign cinema.
