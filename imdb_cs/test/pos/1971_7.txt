David Cronenberg's films are easily identifiable, or at least the elements in the film appear as his trademarks. Fetishism, blurring between organic and inorganic, vile pulsating things that should not be vile and pulsating. "eXistenZ" is a classic Cronenberg. In short, it's about the future generation of computer games, but instead of a video monitor, the visuals are delivered by your mind. The game connects directly to the 'bio port' at the base of your spine and while the game is running, the player cannot tell the reality of the game. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays game developers and is making progress in the novitiate, Jude Law, through the pace of the game. While in the game they reveal strange events and possible crimes. But are they real, or is it a game? Neither does the author of the game know. The movie is pretty fun, keeping the viewer in the shot, but in the dark until the last minutes. Another thing I like about "eXistenZ" is that it doesn't use heavy reliance on special effects, it's the story itself that powers the movie. Recommended for Saturday night when science fiction science is required.
