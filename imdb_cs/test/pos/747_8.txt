Even more in a long line of "Don't" films from the late 70s and early 80s is much more. This movie is a highly underrated low budget schlocker with a twist. It has a grainy quality and a bizarre soundtrack that is typical of horror movies of the period, but it is a highly underrated performance of surprisingly talented actors / actresses who make the film good. A young nurse comes to the progressive psychiatric hospital Dr. Stephens right after he was murdered by one of his patients and everything is not what seems to be. It seems Dr. The Masters, a somewhat ambitious physician, assumed her responsibilities and began to make her own thoughts. Each patient takes their own unique personalities and has their own personality traits and deficiencies that contribute to highly entertaining interactions. There is a nymphomaniac, a crazy old bone, a woman with an unhealthy obsession with an infant and a man who has returned back to his childhood. A strange story that later finds that a young nurse trapped in asylum with patients running around freely and accumulating. If you are a fan of cheap 70 years sleaze before it's a movie for you!
