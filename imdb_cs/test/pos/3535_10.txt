I saw the Messiah: - First kill and I thought it was one of the best programs I've ever seen. It was one of those programs you think you can't, I can't watch the rest, but you have to watch it to see who did it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely amazing actor in him to switch between two completely different characters, one of them evil, the ugly person who did it, and the other person who is Jez Clifton, the cop. To do this, I would certainly not be able to do it, not without bursting. I really love and care about Jamie Draven with all my heart and always, until the end of time, I think Jamie is the sweetest, cutest, most exotic guy in the world. I absolutely love Jamie in Ultimate Force because she looks damn sexy in the blacks he wore. I love Jamie Love Paula Draven <br /> <br /> -X-
