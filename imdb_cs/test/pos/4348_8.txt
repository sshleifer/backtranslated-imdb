<br /> <br /> Oh my word! I've never seen a film that lacked any kind of moral judgment or thought about something other than the death of scum!

Not only does the spoon feed us absolutely hell on earth, seen by the face of the piercing Bronson, but it also shows us a spoon that feeds us and says, "Look at what your observation looks at and ask a question: Do you enjoy it? "And even if you say you CAN'T BE !!!! You'll know that deep inside you will know ... it's a masterpiece
