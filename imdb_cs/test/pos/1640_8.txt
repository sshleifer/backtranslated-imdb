FBI agents Mulder and Scully are assigned to explore the secrets of what happened to the Arctic drilling team, in this early episode "X-Files", which David Duchovny himself regards as one of the first "rockin" episodes. It pays a loving homage to much praised by John Carpenter 1982's theatrical function "Thing", and one can see similarities. Visually, color and lighting schemes combine to give the story a hellish quality. Production / art design is particularly impressive. shots from the exterior of the Arctic camp resemble an earlier film to automatically create the feelings of deja vu for some viewers. Of course, our heroes are threatened by the weather, so the sound design, including the wind, inspires memories of "The Thing." the culprit is the ancient worm that has been exposed to the team; once inside the host stimulates aggressive behavior. This allows the paranoid aspect to be fully grasped and the way the script is set up cannot be too sure who is infected and who is not. This leads to inevitable testing. This episode certainly works to illustrate how tension can cause group disorders. It even allows Mulder and Scully to have times when they are not sure they can trust each other. The guest star is a good little group of actors: Xander Berkeley, Felicity Huffman and Steve Hytner, and with the scientists they were obliged to accompany Mulder and Scully on the mission, and Jeff Kober as the pilot to take them to camp. You can also once see Jason Voorhees depicting Ken Kirzinger as one of the unfortunate original team members. By the way, there is one direct link between 'Ice' and 'The Thing': artistic director Graeme Murray, who has worked on both projects. <br /> <br /> 8/10
