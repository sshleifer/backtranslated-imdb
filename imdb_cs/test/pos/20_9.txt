A number of other comments on the film all say it - just to add that we showed it last week at about 30 in our Community Cinema, and that had a total average score of 8.6. We would recommend it to 100% for today's audience, especially if they could see it on the actual screen of the cinema, and talk to others about it, as our viewers did. The pure power of the ensemble's performances was incredible and absolutely stunning. Of course, Finney and Courtenay were really stars. but they were all busy. For our afternoon viewers, most of whom are "seniors," the fact that the storyline could follow with such ease for clarity of speech and the awesome non-technological use of the camera and sound has great influence. As pleasant, many have said to see a really great movie that is British: it is still not dated twenty years: it is not full filled with blood and guts: it is not confusing because it is foolish. Camera shots, and back and forth through story lines: No seed sex scenes. Such opinions were even pronounced by some who were younger.
