I love this movie !! Maybe it's my generation, but I can really connect with what it says and means. all the time I laughed. duration of the film, the following day and beyond. I think this movie is not the one looking to see if you care about storyline and character development. this film is largely for the generation that understands it. There are a lot of things you just know are being brought up in the generation you wouldn't have done if you were saying 40. I think Sacha Barren Cohen was very, and I think very well. he's a genius. and the reason h is such an idiot is because he can get people to believe he's a complete idiot, and at the same time he's funny !! Very good movie. strongly recommend !!!! (not so strongly if you are over 30)
