Some may think Imaginary Heroes is a movie just like "Igby Goes Down," but it's not like that. At Imaginary Heroes, the director feels like it's the Travis family and the people around them. The film itself is great and the performance is very good. Weaver's and Hirsch's acting is believable and helps the film do what it is. Actors, director / writer, Dan Harris, made a movie that many people should see. Don't think it's just another teen movie, it's a family movie and their problems. I gave this movie 10/10 because I don't think it's the best movie that no movie can be, but its closest can be perfect.
