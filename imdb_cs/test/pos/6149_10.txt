I disagree with the synopsis of imdb.com that it is a bisexual guy who is preparing for a wedding. It's more about all that goes through - self-induced and because of our parents - that we have to "get over" when we grow up. Like Linda McCarriston's poem, she says: "Childhood is a barrel that suits you above the waterfalls." This film is much more like a narrative poem. It's about the life and mistakes we made and hurt over the years and experienced, and how it is about love (not trying to be hypersensitive or schmoopy) and to be with one special person.
