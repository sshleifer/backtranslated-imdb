If you ever babysat in the house you didn't know or if you saw the original and enjoyed it then it will be a good choice. Ignoring the review and what was posted here, I went forward and rented this movie because of the memory of how original it scares me as a teenager. This movie has (of course) changed some of the original story to relate to today's teens, such as babysitting is in trouble for going to her mobile phone minute and has to take on babysitting pay her bill. However, it keeps on the original story pretty well. If you can relate to babysitting, don't know the house and it's the usual cracks and cracks, it's pretty exciting. When the murderer turns out to be very scary, you'll find yourself on the girl shouting at "GET OUT OF HOUSE". If you've never been babysat or been in such a situation, then you probably won't be able to relate and won't like it. It's all about understanding her fear.
