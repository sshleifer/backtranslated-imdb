This film strongly demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in culture so deeply rooted in ritual and tradition. All this in the background of India, which itself fights for freedom from these same values. This film is both political and personal and never too preaching or idealistic on both fronts. It is easy to see why "fire" has caused riots in India, yet tragic. A real movie like this deserves to be seen by all the people in the world, not just privileged people in the West.
