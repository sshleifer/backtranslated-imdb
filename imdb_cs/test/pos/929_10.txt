It's my favorite movie because there is so much that you don't look at it at first sight and so many things that interest you: "Did Kieslowski mean that, or is it in my head?" For example, should a judge be God or a sovereign being? Also, Irene Jacob, as in The Double Life Of Veronique, is excellent, there may be a few superficially handsome actresses, but no one who manages to convey the beauty of the spirit with physical beauty as it does . Tritingnant is also spectacular without really saying a lot and things he says are excellent, like his answer to Valentine's Day. . . "Be".
