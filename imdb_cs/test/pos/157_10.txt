I won't bore you with any synopsis, chances are you already know them. And hopefully you're already familiar with the work of Park Chan-Wooka. IMPORTANTly I disagree with some of the other commentators who say that "Park did not move from the revenge trilogy of blah blah blah." Because you know what? He has!!! The trilogy of vengeance differed from each other in a way to get started, how can you even compare the disunity and subtlety of "sympathy for Mr. Vengeance" with the frantic and extravagant "Oldboy"? Chan-Wook Park has an incredible style, but its films don't all share the same style! That was true and remains true with the release of "Thirst". "Thirst" is an incredible picture, literally has everything you want in the movie. Jaw-dropping violence, tasteful gore, great humor, incredible tension and even very realistic sex scenes. The story is so crazy that in no time can you guess what will happen next. I'm so glad Park is back in top form with this fantastic story of a dark comic-vampire. Watch it as soon as possible!
