Fans of Gerry Anderson's productions will recognize several actors and vehicles from the UFOs (created by Doppelg채nger) - as well as sound effects from various Anderson series. Barry Gray's excellent music (mostly unique to this film) contributes to a sense of confidentiality. Just for these reasons, I think any Gerry Anderson fan would find the Doppelg채nger worth it. Simply as a movie, the Doppelg채nger is wrong. It is known that there have been major problems during production, and I think that is why there is a time-consuming process that ends abruptly and seems to have no meaning for the rest of the story. Probably time / budget constraints prevented new events from appearing! Sparingly, special effects range from extremely good - better than any 60s movie I know of - to disappointment. However, even in these shortcomings, the main story of Doppelg채nger is well said and keeps the viewer (or at least this viewer) at all times. Maybe the end is not what you might expect from Anderson, but it's also typical for Anderson, and it's definitely appropriate. To find out what I mean, you'll have to look at it yourself. :)
