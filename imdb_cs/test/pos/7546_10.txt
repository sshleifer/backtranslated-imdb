This comic-class classic of an English schoolgirl is and was one of the greatest classics of an art house. Then the house disappeared with the arrival of videos. And so the audience of this film. Loss is not for art houses or for this big movie. The loss is for those who will never be able to see this unforgettable laugh filled with a film masterpiece. But I am the preacher, not. Who else would look for this movie?
