Yes, let's get out of the way before we start: * That's the one Sean Connery returned in 1983 after the stint we had Roger Moore. It's the last Connery movie. And YES it is a (kind) remake of Thunderball, but rather a film inspired by it. If all the Bond purists think I'm going to be controversial, you're right. Bond is one of the biggest movie series ever, but that doesn't mean the series should go on forever. I think it's one of two movies where they could do a huge favor and end up Bond. Still offended? Then I'll continue ... Hey, if you think I'm indifferent to Bond's movies, you're wrong. I grew up with Mom who was OBSESSED with them. Some free time, Bond and his opposites will be on TV. Bonds Rules and "Never Say Never Again" (directed by Irvin 'Empire Strikes Back' Kershner) is one of the best. It does not have to be 'Goldfinger' or 'From Russia ...' and does not have to be made by the same production house as all the others (which I heard why they refuse to accept it ever made??) But still stands overhead and shoulders above Recent Brosnan Tours ... (if you don't spit on the screen, read on). CHARACTERIZATION!!!!! Something so big of a blockbuster forgot about these days, but something that is necessary to tell a good story. 'Never' played a great hand by dealing with 007 the way he did since 'Dr. No'. It's "a little bit" and so he has to do things like going to a health farm - a direct order from "M" (!). Yeah, if you haven't seen this movie, I'm not going too far from the plot because A) Load and B) Of course I want you to see it yourself. Don't be discouraged by my 'old appearance of Bond', Connery still gets a lot of great pieces that you can recharge, swim, blow, speed, smash and crawl. The man is a legend and this film is one of his most enjoyable trips as Bond. High-tech gadgets galore, a few great villains and an excellent support cast (including the fantastic portrait of Rowan Atkinson) raise this film far beyond the audience's expectations. This could be Bond's latest film, and it would be the party to remember. Playing a secret agent when someone was retiring was a refreshing ingenious move - the last scene wrapped things up perfectly in the series ... ... but we still had more, and then more and more, and one more Moore. Still, if you want to find out what "Fatima Blush" is, it's about getting this movie. Then you can at least pretend 007 spent the last moment as a mysterious secret agent, in the arms of Kim Basinger, and grinned at Mr. Bean. (P.S. * This other film that I think could finish everything?
