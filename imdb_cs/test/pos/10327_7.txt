This movie got boys on MST3K, but in fact it's a slick and ugly piece of low budget noir movie. The plot is tight, the characters are believable (within the genre of good-boy-gets-obsess-with-bad-girl), stimulation is solid, the climax is well-worked, and the cast is supported by several actors with a subtle character. It is true that most of the time you want to hit the protagonist with a brick, but in fact it is really scary when he plays a master. The scenes between him and his father are quite powerful, minimalist. Sure, it's depressing, but that's the reason. A good movie.
