SPOILER ALERT - And I really stand! READ THIS ARE NOT PREPARING THAT ARE READY TO MAKE A MAJOR MAJOR ELEMENT ELEMENTS REVISED !! I watch and appreciate movies about real life horrors (such as war and holocaust), or where death and sadness are important to the storyline. the main character. So, no matter how well this movie is made, it has a big blow against it because one of the main characters at the end dies of illness (though he never says what he had in the English version with subtitles). So you can ask yourself, "then if this blow-hard hates this type of movie, then why did he watch it first?" You'd have a great point to ask about it, even though I hope I'm not really tough! Well, when I found him in our local library, I had no idea what it was about! The movie was not specifically designed for export because the subtitles were in Korean, English, and Japanese, and the box was printed in Korean. Well, because I'm a fan of trying to make films from any nation (I've seen movies from at least 30-40 different countries), I tried. Well, except for compulsory death, I loved the movie and so hated the way it ended. Although I usually hate the Hollywood-type miraculous endings, I wanted to see how the guy saved a new drug or experimental operation. I was really bummed that he had to die - especially since it seemed to be one of the most beautiful people I've ever seen in movies. His smile was contagious and I really wanted him to do it. Well, at least I can appreciate the film's message that you have to grab a moment. Great gaming, music, etc., but it's not the most happy ending for me. This film was good enough to encourage me to try other Korean cinema.
