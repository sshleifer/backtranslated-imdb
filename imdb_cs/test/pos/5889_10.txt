The best years of our lives are often compared to It's a wonderful life. They should never be. Their only society is the desire to make a serious remark about the war that has taken millions of lives. It's hard to know what value individual life can have. (How many people know that 1 in 22 people have lost their lives violently in the last century? What statistics do we have to live on.) Our feelings about war have changed in 60 years. Gradually, we switched from the fact that war is only if the enemy is the right one to believe that no war is absolutely fair, especially those that have been recently fought. I was a lifelong pacifist. I'm against the whole war. I recently tested this position. It happened when I was on the USS Lexington, which is permanently anchored in Corpus Christi, Texas. The ship required a crew that is 3 or 4 times the community I live in. It is a powerful experience, moving on decks. She saw a lot of actions. Someone gave me the right to be a pacifist and wasn't cheaply bought. I can't look at the best years of our lives without thinking about things like Lexington. Every Three Veterans paid their fees. And they paid my money. None of them escaped more easily than any other. The Navy, the Air Force, and the Army paid the same, albeit in different ways. Everyone had problems directly related to the war. And everyone had to work hard to overcome these difficulties. It took more courage to face their civilian environment than to deal with the war, because everyone had to do it alone. Everyone could understand and sympathize with the problem of others: in the end, no one could help. The moving part of the movie (this could be the initial part of the spoiler) is what follows when one of the male executives found someone who knew enough to advise. The obvious case is when Derry told Herald to marry a girl. Don't hesitate, do it tomorrow. It's hard for Harold to believe that someone can love him when he was a football hero and an athletic star before the war. But to his appreciation, Harold listens. Next is when Al tells Derry to stay away from his daughter. The meaning was clear. Place your relationship with your wife? a standard fair for films of the 30s and 40s Derry didn't mention it: he felt he wasn't suitable for Alina's daughter. So he agreed. The truth of the film is based on the fact that the daughter feels the same with Derry. Real emotions from real people. I think our era has deep problems with feelings and sentiment and honor. Sometimes I think these values ​​don't exist. This is perhaps the reason why people watching this film have problems. Al is not without the advice he does not want. Whenever his boss talks to him, he gets Al nodes. And right. There are some things that cannot be judged by occupational standards: they must be judged by large general intangible assets, and only someone tested by the severity of life would understand what these intangible things are. All these lines until the end of the scene, where all the aircraft that fought so bravely, deprived, stacked, stored, knocked out and soon recycled: their function, value and pride are as transparent as Derry itself. He can overcome this translucency he does, which fits in his mind, the woman he loves. I gave 10 years of the best years of our lives and there are only a few. That's not a movie for popcorn. They deserve our attention. We are very privileged to get to something as private as the lives of these wonderful people. We should be careful not to abuse this privilege.
