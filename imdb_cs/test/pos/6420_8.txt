In a bizarre experiment, the astronaut is abandoned on the Moon when Alice (Florinda Bolkan), an embarrassing translator living in Italy, awakens from a nightmare about a monthly mission mixed with an old film that frightened her as a child. He also doesn't remember the last three days, except for the torn photo of the Garma hotel in his apartment. Fired from her job, Alice heads to that island resort to try and put together a piece of mystery ... Often offered as a giallo because of his director (Fifth CORD Luigi Bazzoni) and the presence of Evelyn Stewart, Nicoletta Elmi and Klaus Kinski, FOOTPRINTS, is actually a deliberately stimulated psycho-thriller with sci-fi subtext. The disturbing distinction between dream, reality, memory and movies, is an intriguing story beautifully photographed by Oscar winner Vittorio Storaro with a thoughtful score by Nicola Piovani. It also combines elements of such diverse films as Armando Crispino's MACCHE SOLARI and Lucino Visconti's Death in Venice in his portrayal of alienation, isolation, hallucinations, and perhaps madness. The Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan, who is constantly on the screen, is reduxing her Carol Hammond in Lucio Fulci's LIZARD IN FEMALE LEATHER like Alice, a young woman tucked into a secret that her common sense challenges her. Places reflect Alice's unstable state of mind; Garma Island, out of season, with Arab influence and ancient ruins, is a lonely, almost mystical place that is not willing to give up its secrets. Evelyn Stewart has a bit of a head start at the beginning because her friend, Nicoletta Elmi and Oscar winner Lil Kedrova are hotel guests, Peter McEnery plays a pretty biologist who is trying to help Bolkan, and still intense Klaus Kinski is in the movie "Blackmann" - with a movie Footprints On The Moon. FOOTPRINTS is an elegant "Guaranteed 100% Euro-Strange" case, but not for everyone. There's only one murder in the end, but you won't see her begin to meet.
