Not all movies are Oscars worthy, but let's admit it, sometimes these types of movies are more fun to watch and leave a longer and lasting impression. He left me a smile and joy, and I couldn't wait to hug my son. Anyone with a pet (no matter what type) knows what it means to lose it. I believe most people would identify with Buddy that they would lose their best friend he had grown from birth. Bruce Willis was great because a mogul made a nice guy and Joey Lauren Adams was convincing as a good mother. The little boy who played Buddy had a cherub face and his sister and Edgar played great backup roles. He liked it a lot and it was something the whole family could enjoy. Thanks!
