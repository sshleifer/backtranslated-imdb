I bought this video on a VCR in a good shop for 50 cents. I took a few videos that I bought them to sell them to others when I viewed them for a 50 cent rental price. This is the only one that will never return. It is an explosion of artistic talent, color and sound. I don't know if I should call it circus, dance or both. It's bigger than life itself. They will only be able to do it for a few years in their lives. These are performer artists. If Gene Kelly and Burt Lancaster were alive today and saw them live, they would be amazed. I would lend it to others to watch, but I know if I do, I'll never return it.
