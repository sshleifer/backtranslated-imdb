Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp or Little Man character wins World War I, called the Great War at the time, one handedly, even capturing the Kaiser, something all Allied armed forces were unable to do. It is a pity that everything seems to be a dream that is somewhat of a cop out and the weakest part of this fascinating silent short (almost 46 minute feature film). There are imaginative gags galore, including Charlie, who had to put on a gas mask to eat the Limburger cheese sent from home, and then used the cheese as a weapon against the Germans; Charlie sleeps underwater in a flooded trench beside a soldier still annoying; Charlie disguises himself as a tree - one of his best sketches at all - and Charlie pretends to defeat his friend who became a prisoner of war and hug him when the enemy is out of sight. One amazing feature is how much Charlie, when behind enemy lines dressed as German, resembles Hitler within ten years before Hitler and his Nazi criminals won German politics. Obviously, Hitler made his appearance after Charlie's movie.
