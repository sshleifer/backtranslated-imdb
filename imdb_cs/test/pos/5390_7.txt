Gary Cooper is a great guy. He always liked his simple characters. As some others have commented on, there are some peculiarities in the script, such as the American Marshall, who got his job and couldn't even hit a pistol gun. A ranch with about thirty hands, but it can't seem to hold its cattle away. But there is a lot of quick thinking, direct shooting of Cooper to keep you entertained. This film was made in 1950. People in their 20s and 30s have difficulty understanding that these movies were made for entertainment, not Oscars. Expect Oskar to make this film unfair. It's about good guys to find a way to round the bad guys. So rent, borrow, or buy this movie, pop some corn and enjoy Coop one more time.
