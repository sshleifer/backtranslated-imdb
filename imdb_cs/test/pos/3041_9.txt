John Voight plays the cover character in this film based on the author Pat Conroy's (Prince of Tides) autobiography. A nice teacher's film tells the story of naive Pat Conroy, a young English teacher whose first job is a primary school on a country island. The only white man on the island must struggle with internal and external pressures when trying to instill education and values ​​to children who have been systematically denied these generations. A solid performance that really makes you think.
