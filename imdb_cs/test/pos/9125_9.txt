"All men are guilty," says police chief. "They're born innocent, but it doesn't take long." Add this piece of nihilism to the fascination of Jean-Pierre Melville with the idea of ​​the Code of Conduct and you have Le Cercle Rouge. However, this Code of Honor among fraudsters is not just a cliché; it is a figment of imagination, though film moralists - realistic moralists, in their opinion, the romantic moralists of most - have started making films on the subject. Their theme is that it's not what a person does, but how he does it. Most often we ended up with stories of experienced people with their own sense of honor, stories of things, fate, fatalism, and code triggers. For most of mankind, with the exception of screenwriters and film directors, it would really get in the way of living their lives, raising children and being a good friend. This caused fatalism is something of a self-indulgent concept. Le Cercle Rouge is, in my opinion, a classic movie for people who can secretly enjoy the adventure that the last bus home is missing. But where, in my opinion, Melville's Le Samourai - Criterion Collection is a story style, Le Cercle Rouge handles a brilliant combination of style with a strong story and convincing actors. In my opinion, the meaning of the film is nonsense ... but the film itself is a first-class experience. Melville's hopeless story of three cheaters - Cory (Alain Delon), Vogel (Gian-Maria Volonte) and Jansen (Yves Montand) - is based on a bit of wisdom that may be attributed to the Buddha: who are destined to meet, cannot change with their destiny. Maybe because some believe that Melville himself came up with a wording, if not an idea. Either way, we know from the outset that this film will not end happily, will depend on fate and coincidence to help us, and will allow us to recall the nihilistic philosophies that we discovered and loved when we were in high school. Once Corey and Vogel meet and then gather in Jansen's unique talent, we're off on a one-way ride to rob an exclusive, heavily protected jewelry story at Place Vendome. Tensions arise because we not only know that French police are behind Vogel, but we also realize that some determined fraudsters are after Corey. The great pleasure of the movie, for me, came from admiring the work Delon, Volonte and Montand brought to their characters, and the intelligent ruthlessness André Bouvril had brought to his character, Police Captain Mattei. Melville hooked me as he developed these characters and their own situations; he built me ​​emotionally and then let go of me when he brought me to the likelihood of their fate and let me see how it happened. Melville founds his pieces - escape from the train, escape from the woods, later shootout in the woods, meeting with Mattei and a man who refuses to inform - with interesting options. In all these cases, he builds up tension by taking his time; a rare feature in filming and an even rarer feature now. And Melville needs time to build Mattei as an individual. Mattei is a sad, experienced man. He's a loner. When he returns to his apartment, he has a routine set - he greets his three cats with greeting, pulls out a bath and prepares them food when the tub is full. I don't know who Mattei is destined to meet, but I hope it's someone who likes cats. Nihilism is always fashionable among some creative people and some critics. In most cases, I think it's much harder to set aside nihilism and simply live your life without too many people being damaged. (And it's even more challenging to show convincingly in the movie.) Le Cercle Rouge is a movie that tells me little, but in a way, I think, a beautifully crafted movie.
