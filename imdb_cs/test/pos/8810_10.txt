It takes a lot of time for the film to reach the already insensitive particles of my brain that have not yet been solved because of the overcharging and redoredoredocopycopoly of the movie world. But this movie came to the list of 'Magic Movies'. To become a "magic film", it must leave every string of my being trembling in what I can only define as "bliss" and "complete satisfaction". This movie got into the threads as the mind thinks, and if not for the deeply personal bond of my head and the head of who made these stocks, it would look like another 'dead rave scene' movie from behind when the 90's exploded with its Ecstasy madness. It's not like the movie's gone. He reached into me and pulled out something I thought was dead for a very long time. I forgot how long it has been since I saw something that left me in the good. I highly recommend seeing this movie.
