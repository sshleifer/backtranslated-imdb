I only saw three episodes of Hack, starring David Morse, and I seem to have missed 37 episodes! well it means that ITV 3 displays them in chronological order. I was just watching 'Misty Blue' (episode 38). I really enjoyed 3 episodes, but then I'm a David Morse fan (esp St. Elsewhere). For anyone reading it, Hack is excellent. It is a pity that it is broadcast on ITV 3. The cast is strong, although I can't get used to the idea that David is playing a bent cop, we all know that he's a good man who was accused wrong. Do I see Gary Cole hosting what happened to 'Midnight Caller'? Just wonder if Hack is available on DVD (yet). I love it. Cheers.
