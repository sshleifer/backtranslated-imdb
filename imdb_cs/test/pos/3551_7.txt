John Barrymore plays a gentleman who is also a thief, Arsene Lupine. Although no one is sure that this is the case, Inspector (Lionel Barrymore) is sure, but he cannot prove it. So, Lionel spends most of the film after John - hoping to catch this brilliant and slippery thief. Although I liked the movie, I think I had more expectations about it and thought it might be better. than a very good time. It's because he paired John and Lionel Barrymore in the movie, and because these brothers were so dynamic actors, I think I was expecting sparks and magic, but instead I just saw it. Now that doesn't mean it's a bad movie - it's definitely not. It just didn't grow to the level of being unforgettable or a movie that we strongly recommend to see. Thanks to the corresponding scenario, the film is pretty good, but I was surprised to hear no French accents in the movie, even though it was allegedly about the French people! Also, there was not much life in the film until it was almost finished. The end was really excellent and fun - so good that the movie increased from 6 to 7. It's nice to see that it ended on a high note.
