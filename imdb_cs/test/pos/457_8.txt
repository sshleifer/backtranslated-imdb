I've seen some of Yul Brynner's movies - yet it's his best performance because the camera captures his emotions up close as he growls, smiles and laughs. Brynner could still be arrested in the Ten Commandments, Taras Bulba, The Magnificent Seven, Brother Karamazov, and Mad Woman Chaillot, but none of these films caught his range of talent in close-ups like this. He is arresting and irritating to watch in every shot. <br /> <br /> Just as fascinating and sexy, without removing clothes, is Deborah Kerr. The scenario allows her to radiate sensuality that is not visual but suggestive - this type of years later in Iguana Night. The film does not suggest sleeping with someone who would help release the band from the clutches of the Russians in the fact that it is shown to flee the Russian Major (as opposed to the Maupassant story or Isak Denisen's story). However, the film breaks out with the proposed but genuine physical graceful character of Kerr. Kerr could not, in my opinion, ever be classified as a beautiful actress, but she is an excellent actress. He puts his soul into the dignified characters he portrays, which often interferes with the spirit of the character. It is this contradiction that makes her role in The Way, Quo Vadis, and The Night of Iguana unforgettable. Why is it an unusual movie? In Hollywood it is not easy to see Russian characters portrayed as good people - Dr. Zhivago was an exception. Brynner's Romance Horse Thief was once again a great Abraham Polonsky cinema, but never recognized as such because of intolerance towards Leftists in the post-McCarthy era. The film is also unusual in its casting - the great French actors Gerard Oury and Anouk Aimee - pulling their shoulders with Jason Robards and British actor Robert Morley. The film is in many ways international than American. All four are great actors and contribute to fun. Those who have read Maupassant and Denisen's works find that the film is not true for any work. However, the film can stand alone because its disinfected (censored) version has its own dignified charm - which is due to the reality of the night that led to the release of the band. I think Litvak deserves to have his last laugh when he has provided an interesting and plausible list of the stories that led to the film, and at the same time involved pieces of both written stories (eg, Last Bus and Last Kiss) <br /> <br But I have one bleak - why does Hollywood never recognize the sources that inspire stories? Only recently (eg Insomnia) did the original works begin to be screened.
