Peter Boyle has always been a great actor and proved his performance as a Bigot pistol, which made me hate him every time he used the word "N", I watched him and his big mouth and wanted to blow his lights off. (Just think that Peter Boyle was one of the monks) (now supporting actor in "Everyone Loves Raymond") Susan Sarandon, who makes her first debut, needs a bath right away and enjoyed it with someone else in her own dirty water. I noticed that the great Raggerty Ann Doll (creator, John Gruelle) was the only thing Susan could really believe and love, and the doll appeared in a few scenes. If you really want to learn about a 70-year journey with drugs, free love, and smoke dreams, then enjoy the excellent direction of John G. Avildsen ("Rocky and" The Karate Kid). I always thought he should be Peter Boyle. is finally a cult classic that is worth seeing and sharing with others.
