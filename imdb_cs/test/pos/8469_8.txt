It was on the day in 1891 when the Scottish inventor William K.L. Dickson surprised his boss Thomas Alva Edison with his remarkable work on film development. After many experiments, Dickson was now able to capture real life scenes with his camera, and reproduce them through his invention, the Kinetoscope, as if a fraction of the time was preserved in celluloid. Soon, Dickson's kinetoscope will become a huge success as a new way of entertainment, with many people eager to pay the nickel that has been charged to watch people dance, or acrobats performing stunts through the "peepshow" Kinetoscope. However, the invention was not complete in order to capture the film real life as we know it, the sound was needed on movies. So Dickson continued to experiment and this short experiment, the first Kinetophone movie, was the result. In this experiment, codenamed simply as "Dickson Experimental Sound Film", director William K.L. Dickson stands in front of a recording cone for a wax cylinder (the earliest way of recording sound), with his violin on his hands, playing a song named "Boy Boy Song". The idea was to load the song at the same time the camera was recording its movements. To make it a movie, two of Edison's "Black Maria" laboratories decided to do a little dance in front of the camera. Contrary to what Vito Russo said in his book "Celluloid Wardrobe", this little dance had nothing to do with homosexuality, because it is obviously a reference to the loneliness of the lab, similar to lonely sailors, the "Boy" song "was dedicated (the title Russo suggests, "Gay Brothers" is actually anachronistic as "gay" had no homosexual connotation in the late 1890s). Unfortunately, Dickson was unable to achieve the desired effect and the Kinetophone could never create a synchronized While the drum with the sound and celluloid with pictures, the synchronization of these two elements was not exactly effective, and the sudden appearance of Auguste and Lemie Lumière's Cinématographe made Edison's team focus on projection systems and finally Dickson left the company. In 1998 Dickson's cylinder with the film's sound was rebuilt, and the film editor Walter Murch made a revival Finally, "Dickson Experimental Sound Film" could be heard with synchronized sound, just as its creative inventor intended. Although not a successful attempt, this excellent film is a testimony to the giant genius of the father Kinetoscope. 8/10
