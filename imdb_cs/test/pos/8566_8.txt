It's supposed to be my fault. I am a huge fan of the 80s who have been designed to entertain and not care if they offended someone. This step has no meat, not substance, no deep thought provocative scenes. Just old kids from college, having fun, and if you need to show a couple of breasts, then that's it! This movie is for when you just want to relax and don't think. Viva la nudity!
