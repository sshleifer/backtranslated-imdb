Where this film is true to Burroughs' vision, it is excellent; where it deviates from Burroughs, it's excellent. It's the story of a family, finding a father a real and emotional orphan. Lambert talks about one of the most beautiful lines in the whole cinema "He was my father!" is enough to bring tears to the eyes of her cynical critic. It's not a perfect movie - the notorious dubbing of McDowell's voice, Glenn Close, is incomprehensible and only explainable in terms of a very British mistake - but a subtle, erroneous masterpiece and noble farewell to Sir Ralph Richardson.
