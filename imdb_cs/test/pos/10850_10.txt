I love this movie. I saw it again and again when I rented it from Netflix. It had a lot of substance and meaning for me. I think many people will enjoy it. I've read and seen a few lesbian stories over the years and I'm glad they're getting better on how they're presented. and the feeling is from gay women. Its nice to see two women find themselves and are as happy as others in this company. The directors are realizing that Lesbians live very full and healthy lives and that we have amazing stories that individuals and families could see and hesitate to see.
