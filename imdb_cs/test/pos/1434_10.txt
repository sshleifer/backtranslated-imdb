Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra), who sets out from a six-month drug rehabilitation program, and after serving his time to deal with cards in illegal gambling games, hopes to be clean and seek a new life as a big band drummer . However, when he returned to his old Chicago crime scene, he soon discovers that there is pressure around him, including his wife, Zosch (Eleanor Parker), who was in a wheelchair to return to her old "Dealer lifestyle" â€œ. he started on the path of self-destruction that is heroin-dependent. It's very rare that the movie has as many great performances as it does. Frank Sinatra is excellent as Frankie Machine, and realistically portrays the symptoms of a drug addict who is undergoing withdrawal, which is probably better than anyone else who was in front of him. Sinatra seems to have enthusiastic understanding and awareness of his nature and expresses a constant struggle for control of his own life, which is always forever in the heart of a man, Frankie Machine. As his crippled wife, Zosch, Parker wants to own forever Frankie to "handle" him to earn good money to take care of her and pay her ever-increasing health care bills. He seems to be frightened by anything he sees as a threat to her control, such as the freedom a drummer's life could offer, or anything that could change the status quo between them. Viewer Molly (Kim Smith), a girl who lives in the same building and seems to have real, strong feelings for Frankie not to control him, but only to help him prove what Frankie is doing to him she has done the world if she can stay straight for so long to wake up and realize it. But Darren McGavin as a heroin drug salesman, Louie, always waits on the wings when they only know the right buttons to push, just to say that a former drug addict returns to an old habit that is beneficial for Louie but deadly. for an addict. The setup also seems to insist on its own life, a constantly dark, daring, dirty and criminal paradise with nowhere near enough positive things to look forward to in life. Where it is too easy to escape through a bottle or drug, a quick "fix" is really no fix at all, but just works to keep one in the dark away from daylight and all the clear prospects that the world could offer. It's a neat touch that when Frankie is on the right track, the setting is always brighter than when he's on the wrong track. While some argue that this is a bit dated, for me it is a bold film presenting a realistic internal war within a person for control of his own destiny, which has the very strong character performances of all involved. Since a man with a gold weapon has my highest possible recommendation.
