I saw the original Outer Limits in real time when I first aired, and since then I have been reviewing the entire series in re-runs and on DVD again and again. I will find new external limits to WELL more than just a remake of old episodes of repetition, as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested. With seven (7) years of programs versus only two (2) years of original series, producers and writers have certainly added significant new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer run and a very well-produced (wired) TV series . Surfaces are intelligent, scientifically accurate projections of the unknown possibilities of the sometimes frightening and immediate future. While most Hollywood producers and directors unknowingly see Sci-Fi as indistinguishable from Horror and Fantasy, this series returns to the beginnings of science fiction in the logical, moral, and philosophical projections of today's new technologies into their possibly horrible term implementation. This series does it very well and remains unique in its avoiding "shooting em-up" video game monster mentally much of the current generation. He has a brain, history, message and good fun. This is a series for adults without unbearable fantasies. Hurray! <br /> <br /> Now that we can only get MGM to release a whole series of new external DVD limits instead of just six bad teaser disks and Season 1 now available.
