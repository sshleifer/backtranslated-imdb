Ray Charles Robinson (Jamie Foxx) is also a very talented pianist and singer. Ray is also a smart man. Ray began his career in the late 1940s before finding his distinctive style. Ray is certainly popular in nightclubs with his music. Things change when he meets an ambitious music producer (Curtis Armstrong). Who knows that Ray got what it takes to be a powerful performer and also meets a woman (Kerry Washington), he also loves and marries along the way. Ray's album becomes a hit when they mix soul music and gospel. Which makes Ray a controversial man during the 1950s and 1960s. Ray has love for all kinds of music, including Earth. But Ray is not always the perfect man, it seems. Because he had a lot of unsuccessful relationships with another woman when he was married. But he also had to fight racism, the people who crossed him, his musical ideals, and of course his drug addiction. Which caused Ray's life to be extremely difficult for him and also to fight the tragedy of his childhood. Which Ray has always blamed himself. Director: Oscar-winner: Taylor Hackford (against all odds, Devil's attorney, Dolores Claiborne) has made a fascinating story about life that has always been interesting from the end of "Ray". Charles. Foxx won an Oscar for his moving performance of a late entertainer. Foxx brings heart and soul in both film and humor. But this movie has a lot of rich performances by top actors including: Regina King, Clifton Powell, Boke Woodbine, Aunjaune Ellis, Warwick Davis, Terrence Howard and Sharon Warren as Ray's Mothers. This is probably the best film of Hackford's career to date. The film has a lot of songs from Charles's best music. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a sharp Pan & Scan (1.33: 1) and superb Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Disc 1 has an informative commentary by the director and the DVD also has an original theatrical cut and an extended version. But u is better to watch the theatrical version instead because the bonus shots are in bad condition at times and u must click on the logo if you want to see these deleted scenes. Disc 2 deleted scenes with optional director commentary (as seen in the extended version), featurettes and more. However, on this DVD, these attempts are disappointingly short. Because the film is extremely good. This film was nominated for four Oscars including Best Costumes, Best Director, Best Cut and Best Picture. It's a wonderful story with a true life that is well explained, but of course, Charles's life was even more controversial and outrageous than the last movie. Still, it's damn close. Screenplay by James L. White. From the White Story and the Director: Hackford. Oscar-winner for best sound. Don't miss it. (**** Â½ / *****).
