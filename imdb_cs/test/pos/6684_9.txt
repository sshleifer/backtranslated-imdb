I was really surprised when I saw this film by director Iain Softley for the first time; they differ in so many ways from the usual Hollywood mass production. The storyline itself is simple - Kevin Spacey plays the mental patient Proto, who claims to come from the planet K-pax, which arrived on Earth with a beam of light, while Powell, played by Jeff Bridges, tries to help him solve his delusions. First of all I have to admit that the cast is perfectly chosen: Kevin Spacey is really great at showing an interesting character Prot, who always walks in a subtle line to persuade us to be real and then wonder if he is vicious or not ... Some of gem scenes include one where Prot innocently eats a whole banana (even a peal) while meeting Dr. Powell; or an observation scene where he confidently demonstrates his knowledge of the K-Pax system for astonished astronomers ... Conversely, Jeff Bridges is the subtle, rational side of the film and delivers it perfectly. There are all other casts of super actors (like Saul Williams's compelling performance as Ernie) who make this movie really works. K-pax has it all, comedy elements; Sci-Fi, even a psychological thriller (related to Ident Prot), but most importantly, can be categorized as a pleasing drama. The main premise of the film is rather complicated, but the director will never let it loose, it always keeps it believable and yet mutually interpretable. The camera and photography have a nearly key role here, continuing the main idea of ​​light travel, a great focus on light play, setting the flash - one of the unforgettable scenes where dr. Powell holds a crystal figure in his office, refraction of light in a beautiful way, while at the time he suspects this idea can be true? K-pax is a gentle and slow pace, fascinating and enjoyable, it's a gem that suits you, one of a kind of film that may not be for all tastes, but those who see it - they can fall in love with it.
