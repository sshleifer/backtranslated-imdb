If you haven't watched the movie yet, but you like comedy, go out and at least rent it! The fact that she won, Oscar animation, is no coincidence! I haven't seen many other Wallace & Gromit movies (in fact, I think I was just looking at each other), but humor is very strong ... and some would also say very British. Okay, of course! The story will only be an excuse for all the jokes that come, but even if it's not the most elaborate, it still works (by the way, my niece thought she was seeing one of the biggest surprises, I didn't, Kudos to her , o)). I think that after you look at this, you go out and look for more W&G movies out there. Have fun!
