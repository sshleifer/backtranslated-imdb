Until I saw this movie, "Life is Beautiful" was my favorite movie of all time. This movie is all that should be a great movie. A great scenario, insurmountable behavior, and a direction that does not approach sentimentalism, or what the subject seduces or leaves it without the emotional impact it requires. This film contains a taste that could not come from Hollywood and lacks premonitions that would come from France. I was expecting a beautiful movie and above caliber when I saw that the hand-made films logo appeared. I don't have to go into detail because previous posts include everything that this movie must all be seen on this planet.
