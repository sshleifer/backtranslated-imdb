This film tries to escape to the typical 'I fight because I am obliged to defend my homeland. NAZI are all bad guys, I'm against them (typical of German war movies). As? By not talking too much about it and just referring to war and prisoners of war. However, I would like to see a German film that is something between the Come And See extreme and Das Boot's "bad NAZI". I say this because, besides this factor, German films are the best depiction of World War II and the German side. You can easily see some German hierarchical relationships, very different from those in the US military. This is a movie that tries to get a real look at what was Stalingrad, and I wasn't there, and I doubt most people were there now, but if I chose one movie showing this battle it would certainly not be an American enemy at the gates. Why do I say that? Because even the best soldiers are not heroes, and because of the conditions they may consider to be their own lives instead of their homeland. This is true for all ranks, and finally you see Paul Paul giving an example.
