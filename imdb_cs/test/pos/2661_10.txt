The awakening of humanity is the theme of "2001: The Cosmic Odyssey", a process that develops in space-time. "We see" our primordial past and "derive" the cosmic future. Intuition tasks thus become the door of perception in our ongoing collective journey. From this transcendental perspective, the conventional, egocentric plot seems useless. Our crazy conflicts and self-confident dialogue are consumed in evolutionary changes and are irrelevant in the universe, which is extremely beyond understanding. It's a hard lesson for vain and aggressive species. Not surprisingly, some of us huff and puff on the movie's slowness and minimal story. For sentient viewers, the reward is an inspirational sense of miracle and respect. <br /> <br /> In this movie, which is mostly visual, geometric symbols lead our intuition. Circles and arcs represent nature. Right angles represent conscious intelligence. Some people think that the elegant, black monolith is the Von Neumann probe. Maybe. Monolith is undoubtedly a visual metaphor for extraterrestrial intelligence, whose physical form is never shown. The secret is deeper than the explanation. "2001 ..." is unique among the content and range movies. Cinematography is beyond this world, special and visual effects are breathtaking, and classical music is noble. I rarely use the word "masterpiece" to describe the film. But Stanley Kubrick's "2001: Odyssey of Space" is an art in the highest sense, like Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa", or Vincent Van Gogh's "Starry Night".
