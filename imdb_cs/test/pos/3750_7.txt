I remember this old movie. It's a great, cool, atmospheric horror picture of a man moving to a Scottish castle just to find strange events in the corridors at night. And in the most famous Hollywood-style maze in Hollywood, we have more strange events. Yes, this is the maze you have seen in every feature film that has ever included topiary puzzles, up to "The Shining." Punchline this story is about the last thing you guess. I certainly didn't see it. This is a great example of how good and convincing a movie can be, even if the assumption is completely looping, bordering on laughter. I would recommend it to everyone.
