That was a special movie. I liked the adventure, though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character kills a federal official. Then there is a refugee on the run. They later blow up his house and then finally commit suicide. It looks like he should do just a movie for a more mature audience or make it more family friendly. That was a special movie.
