Glenn Close is back as Sarah Plain and Tall, the woman who keeps the family together in good and bad times. Acting is excellent - Christopher Walken (unusually restless), as her husband again brings top performance. It's good to see how young Christopher Bell grew up; Too bad we don't see Anne's power (Lexi Randall, also a few years older), but a new addition to the Witting family (played by Emily Osment) was very welcome. Finally, Jack Palance, as a long-lost patriarch of Witting, is as good as ever.
