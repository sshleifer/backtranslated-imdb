Is it a bad movie? Of course, what did you expect from a movie called "BEACH BABES FROM BEYOND"? It is the movie "BABES in BIKINI" and has no prejudice that it is different. Since it is not "LIVING WITH VIEW" or "SCHINDLER SHEET". If you want a movie like "Room with a View" then you wouldn't look at Beach Babes from Beyond. But if you are looking for a good Babes in Bikini with almost no land, this is the one for you. This film brings what it promises and then some. It's 100% pure adolescent fun. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of BABES in and out of the bikini. The movie was pretty funny and great to watch. It was one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen on home video. <br /> <br /> Every high school boy should watch at least one bad movie like this. This is actually one of the most memorable movies I've ever seen. So I am shamelessly saying again ... If you watch one movie "Babes in Bikini", it is.
