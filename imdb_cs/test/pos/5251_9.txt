While reading some other remarks, I have to agree that some (very few) deficiencies found in this brilliant 20 th century documentary (with Billie Holliday, Bessie Smith, Edith Piaf, Judy Garland and Mercedes de Sosa) are justified. Because initially it was a 6 hour television documentary about her career ("ESTRANHA FORMA DE VIDA" (V) 1995/1999). A much broader and more detailed view of the inner world of Amalia. As for the headlines of her song, I'm all for it! Although music, voice and performance can be - they are! - Universal, there is so much verse in words just begging to be translated. I think it was a conscious choice of manufacturers. They targeted 200 million Portuguese speakers in Brazil, Portugal, Mozambique, France, Timor-Leste, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Canada, the USA, South Africa, and St. Tom and Principe, Goa, Daman, Diu, Venezuela, Luxembourg, Germany and the rest of the Portuguese-speaking diaspora all over the world. As for Mistress herself, she did not live to see this abbreviated DVD version of the document, but she received a preview of "Estranha Forma de Vida". And it seems that it was her own. So much.
