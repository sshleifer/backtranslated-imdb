The good news is that the circus is in town. "Bad news" is just above the underground home of Bugs Bunny. He wakes up when his place shakes like an earthquake when the workers pound the ground and the elephants stamp, etc. <br /> <br /> To be more specific, the lions cage is just over Bugs. opening. The lion sniffs food, and by the elimination process he discovers that it is a rabbit. Mistakes, wondering what the rocket is all about, going through the tunnel and plunging into the lion's mouth. <br /> <br /> I'll say for the BB: it's totally fearless, at least in this and at least 30 seconds. When it comes to his senses, he runs like a fool and we get a lion-anti-rabbit battle the rest of the way. Once again, Bugs faces a silly opponent, one he calls "Nero," but the lion is wild and Bugs will need all his wits and somewhat-false bravado to repel this beast. About half of the gags are stupid and the other half funny, but always fast moving, colorful and good enough to recommend it. It's not everyday when you can see a lion on a horizontal bar or do a hula dance!
