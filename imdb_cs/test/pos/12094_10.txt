Turkish culture is complemented by many different cultures. Different cultures have different musical styles. Istanbul is like a mixture of turkeys. it has mostly the same language but different dialects. this document shows us these different kinds of music with different dialects and different instruments. You can watch reports with singers and groups, their performances, their daily lives and learn their thoughts on music. the film includes not only Istanbul music, but also life in Istanbul as people communicate and eat and drink. The surprising part is, even though I live in Istanbul, I learned a lot of things from this movie.
