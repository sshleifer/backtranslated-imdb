Hong Kong filmmaker Chang Chang Ho's 1972 martial art movie epic "Five Fingers of Death" is widely considered by a large number of film professionals and kung-fu film fanatics to be a martial arts film that started it all. Being released in 1972, it was a phase-two three-step process that would lead to an explosion of martial arts films in the West - "Billy Jack" (1971), with his famous Hapkido showdown in the park, was released a year ago, and Bruce Lee starred in "Enter the Dragon" (1973) two years later, solidifying the film 's martial arts position in the Western cinema. But what is all this about "Five Fingers of Death"? The film, with its terrible dubbing, explosive (if not highly improbable) action sequences and technical flaws and all, has a plot, albeit very thin. Chih-Hao (late Lo Lieh) is a young and dedicated Chinese gong student who is selected to represent his school in the upcoming martial arts tournament. His teacher offers to allow him to self-educate himself in the style of "Iron Fist", a style so deadly that he can very easily kill a man with just one shot. In addition, Chih-Hao's coming to school coincides with a violent conflict with a competing school, her students, and a trio of Japan's deadly hitters. Before you know, the main obstacle is the training of Chih-Hao and his ability to represent his beloved school in the upcoming tournament. Allow me to say that "five fingers of death" is in fact a movie that started it all. As another viewer mentioned, "Five Fingers of Death" helped set many standards in martial arts films over the next three decades - Asian, European, and North American martial arts movies. These standards include a devoted student, learning patience and perseverance, conflicts between rival schools, intense ethnic animosity between Chinese and Japanese, and learning the fight system for this good old-fashioned action film theme: revenge. "Five Fingers of Death" would also serve as a significant influence on the films of American film director Quentin Tarantino "Kill Bill" (Tarantino borrows this project quite liberal, among many others, you just know it). Acting is pretty good, since it is a martial arts film from the early 70s, of which Lo Lieh is the best. As an atypical martial arts student, his performance is quite pioneering, although at first glance you wouldn't really know it because of how often this strange arc has been done over the years. He is quite humble in his actions, doing anything he can to endure his enemies and not fight them in anger, nor to bow to their stupidity or arrogance. Also, when he suffers from his main obstacle, it makes your heart sink a little because it is so brutal and you're wondering if he is going to get enough to realize his lifelong ambition. Five Fingers Death is a classic in every sense. It is by no means perfect, and viewers would be crazy to expect something on the "Godfather" of martial arts films. What it offers is a perfect example of an Eastern hand-to-hand fight before the East Cinema was the main west of the world. PS: "Enter the Dragon" It was Yeung also appears as a Mongol street fighter near the beginning of the movie.
