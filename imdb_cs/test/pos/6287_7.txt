I sat across several movies in Paula Shore, but this is the only one I liked. Of course it helps to be much less irritating than usual, maybe a little sympathetic. The rest of the cast does a great job, especially underestimating Carlo Gugino. The film itself is basically a harmless and silly comedy, and although few jokes are particularly funny, the movie is quite entertaining.
