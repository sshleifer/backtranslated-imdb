"Alexander Nevsky" marked the return of director Sergei Eisenstein to filmmaking after the exile period, and what he produced is a bald propaganda film that claims Russia's dominance over Germany. There is a very small plot: the Russians to unite with the battle Germans; Russia wins. The film is a really widespread installation of mostly battle scenes, mixed with some moments of German brutality (as a somewhat shocking scene that shows German soldiers throwing Russian children on a furious fire). This was Eisenstein's first soundtrack and it is clear he had no idea what to do with the media. This movie really looks more like a silent movie with some sound. There are some dialog scenes, but they sit rather lifeless on the screen, and stimulation is all gone, as if the actors weren't actually on the scene at the same time they're filming them. Mostly Eisenstein uses the sound as an excuse to overlap Prokofiev's crazy score over anthology, and this is one of the greatest assets of the film. Tell what you will talk about the ability of Eisenstein (or lack) to tell the actor or tell his film in a more narrative format, he certainly knows how to edit images and music together for maximum effect, and "Alexander Nevsky" through they all shine through its flaws. <br /> <br /> Level: A
