In Belarus in 1942, two Soviet soldiers are captured by Nazi friendly Belarusians. In captivity, the attitude of both men to their fate is very different. One of the soldiers can find inner strength and spirituality, incomprehensible to the other man. Larissa Shepith's latest film is one of the most beautiful war movies in the history of cinemas. Vladim√≠r Chuchnov's cinematography is incredible - especially in the opening sequence, where the long, slow, viewing footage depicting solitude and the almost desperate nature of the winter landscape in rural Belarus perfectly set the mood. It's easy to compare Tarkovsky's films, even more, because Tarkovsky's alter ego Anatoli Solonitsyn has a small but important role in The Ascent. Acting is generally brilliant, especially Boris Plotnikov, in the Sotnikov section. The film reveals an old-fashioned belief in the power of religious passion that is associated with characters like Dostoevsky's prince Myshkin, or Tarkovsky Stalker. However, it is not about the weakness of the film, but one of its greatest strengths. Religious content seems to be so honest and man that it is impossible not to move. The film's emotional wealth cannot be overestimated; the answer is not as simple as it could be a brief summary of the plot. The slow development of the characters and the emphasis on their elaborate relationships are somewhat reminiscent of Commissar, another great Soviet film. The output deserves a second observation, as does the third and tenth. It continues to provide interesting ideas, beautiful images, and emotional complexity.
