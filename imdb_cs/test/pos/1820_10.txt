This is the essence of the early 1980s! Shopping centers, credit card machines, food, punk hair color, soundtrack ... I'm in love with this movie. This sweet, intelligent Romeo & Julie teen movie is instantly addictive. Martha Coolidge is one of my favorite directors. He really employs his actors like John Hughes and Steven Soderberg so check out -Joy of Sex- and -Real Genius-. Soundtracks for -Valley Girl- are great. If you can find a copy of the movie, buy it! It's from the press and it's hard to get to it.
