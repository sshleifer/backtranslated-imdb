Hello, I wonder if anyone has a copy of Broken Promise? I loved this movie growing up and watching it every time it was on. It was a flight because I saw it and would like to get a copy. I checked the whole Internet and couldn't find it. If someone has a copy for trading or for sale, email me at NoelGypsy@Yahoo.com ... Thank you and have a great night !! Christine --------- "Broken Promise" was made to eleven-year-old Melissa Michaelsen, whose parents left her and her siblings. Michaelsen, who was taken to the county, had to helplessly watch her brothers and sisters split up and behave in different families. One of the children is even institutionalized. Juvenile Court Officer Chris Sarandon joins Michaelsen in her fight to unite with her family under one roof. Broken Promise was originally offered as a "General Foods Golden Showcase" presentation. That was the first telecast on May 5, 1981.
