We are taken to the shops where Nick looks at the coins in his hand when he finds out if he can get a special coffee that is 69 cents 20 ounces and comes with pastries. He decides to go for a bigger size, which is of course more expensive and does not entitle him to the cake. He tries to argue with an Indian official in the register holding the land. It is a matter of principle with it. Well, Nick is upset that he won't get in the way and kill her. <br /> <br /> The story tone is set from scratch. The people we meet are not nice guys. There's Nick, his girlfriend, Dallas and their partner Billy Hill. They're drug dealers. Nick decides to visit Casey, his friend and former crime partner, in Houston. He wants to do one more transaction and then go to Paris with the profits from selling drugs he brings. What he doesn't realize is that Casey went straight. He is an architect, married to Christine, and wants to adopt a child. Casey doesn't appreciate his ex-boyfriend bringing drugs to the house. He decides to get rid of the thing by releasing it into the kitchen drain. The unexpected arrival of ice, a pizza delivery man, will surprise Casey. This man was sent to kill him, but before that Casey brings him to share with Ice, who has a talent for rapping. At this point, Dr. will come from the receiving agency. Casey shows a two-year gap that cannot be justified. Jarvis begins to question the future father. At the time, Dallas is making entry. She is a woman who asks questions that are empty, like asking to know if Jarvis is looking forward to pornography. Jarvisi, who wakes up, ends up huff. Dallas decided to seduce Casey at all costs. There is a surprise in the store when Billy Hill enters the picture and does not like what he sees in the process of shooting Dallas. Billy Hill also came off Casey, but he is overwhelmed. Casey gets a visit to Kasarov who wants to get his money from Nick; in his absence, he will take him from Casey. Kasarov gives a deadline and Casey decided to outsmart all these low lives. He has all the parties come to his house in the set hour and various factions will take care of themselves. Eventually, Casey has a better plan that includes accepting Christine to stay in Paris. I've never heard of "Thursday" we've been drawn into it because of the talent in it. Skip Woods ran his own material. This seems to be a movie with good intentions. The film sometimes remembers others of the same genre, not sin of any shape or form, which seems to be a major objection to the negative comments that remained at the IMDb site. For starters, "Thursday" shows funny Skip Woods, who left to write more movies, especially "Swordfish". The scenario is divided into chapters with suggestive titles that relate to action. Denis Lenoir does wonders with most interior photography. Thomas Jane and his film Casey make a great contribution to the film. Though hard to imagine, he beat the odds and did something of himself. This actor, recently seen in the TV series "Hung", is one of the actors we can't watch. Dark Hair Aaron Eckhart is a welcome addition to any movie. He is a greasy criminal who shows no redeeming qualities, or anything close to remorse, and does not hesitate to involve his former friend in his program. James LeGros has nothing to do. The same is true for Paulina's Poriz, a wonderful being who is just a distraction, or additionally adding a sexy angle. We enjoyed Glenn Plummer, who looks like Ice. Phone calls. Michael Jeter and Mickey Rourke also appear.
