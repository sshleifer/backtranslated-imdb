on the story. This is a reality mixed with Americana- and very original. Emily Grace is a young girl tired of her boring life working on a minimum wage job, in New England. Her sleazy chief propositions her - she ends up and takes a little money from the registry. Driving from New Hampshire to Miami, Florida is not a short journey and her Ford Escort dies. She then meets a personal senior couple, portrayed by Judith Ivey and Bill Raymond. They have RVs and kindly offer to help her out - it's not safe for the girl to be alone on the road. Especially I-95. Emily Grace is very realistic as Alice and is initially assisted by Judith Ivey's character; buy her decent clothes, cosmetics, etc. Initially this is a nice holiday for Alice, who hopes to connect with her girlfriend who attends a college in Miami. There is an interesting cinematography as the trio drives the RV down to Florida: rest stops, bland scenery and finally beautiful mountains in North Carolina. Finally there is something terrifying, and Ivey's character apparently has Invented Stories about her daughter, as well as her husband, who now seems a little sinister. I will not spoil the result of this film, but it will end up positive when the audience is waiting for the tension - this film reminded me of a little Spielberg's "Duel" - although it was not so terrible at first - the story's morale is - never you don't know what people think - especially if you're traveling across the country. Attention!!. You will enjoy this movie.
