I've used this movie in my Ethics course for over 10 years (also Woody Allen's "crimes and offenses" - another amazing, multi-level ethical study). It's fiction. I don't focus too much on the unrealistic features of "aliens" because all the fictional films are obviously false at many levels. I like the movie as a gallows comedy, tautically speaking, with many ironic twists and visual pleasures - even if it's "incredible". The story is so good that I don't even think I criticized his credibility (although I have to admit that the tennis match seems to me to be the weakest part - too many Hollywood gloom and lack of real tennis competition) <br /> <br / > Some film problems that promise realistic moral education and ethical discussion: <br /> <br /> 1. Ethical Passivity: Some Guy's weaknesses are determined by Hitchcock. The primary ethical view of a film is the risk of being unable to express its moral positions. Guy is unable to effectively block Bruno's crazy designs at the beginning. An interesting question is why and how does Guy act so passively, inefficiently? A possible answer is his depression because of his intense and complicated divorce. 2. Misunderstanding: Guy commits another start failure: on the train, quickly off, agrees that Bruno's ideas are good. But Guy's literal meaning is contrary to his immense, sarcastic meaning. Bruno takes literal meaning as an agreement on cross-murder. Guy takes sarcastic meaning as an escape from any murder agreement. To some extent, close to the beginning, Bruno may partially pretend that the deal was struck, drawing Guy further into a network of complicity. Bruno manipulates Guy; Guy's linguistic ambiguity on the train gives Bruno a chance to put an ethical "cut" on Guy. Bruno manipulate Guy can also take on other meanings. . . . 3. Secrets: Some have speculated about the sexual relationship between Guy and Bruno. This seems to be ridiculous at first, especially since Guy appears to be heterosexual in his relationship with Miriam and Anne. However, remember that Guy is also ineffective in both women. Guy appears (stereotypically - that is 1951 recall) effeminate, especially in relation to Bruno. The guy, the strong athlete, is weak inside. Bruno is also in conflict (playing "against himself"), appearing on his face and physically strong at first, but then displaying some "effeminate" features (Bruno's fashion and footwork, his emotional emotions on Guy in different situations; his acceptance of manicure from his confusing mother) Bruno kisses and desperately cuddles his mother's hand, other subtle homosexual stereotypes that have a Hitchcock view of puzzle meaning). I wish I heard Hitchcock clarify the intended meanings here. 4. Dishonesty and Distrust: Guy makes some colossal mistakes in hiding the truths about Bruno from the family and the police. Guy can't fully understand that making a mistake can be better than covering or delaying a confession. Again, Guy is driven by passivity, insecurity, fear - and perhaps even hatred that is closer to Bruno's own intolerance than we would like to look or admit. Both Guy and Bruno act on their own parables of impotence. 5. Lack of Evidence: Guy is experiencing the problem of gathering evidence to master it. While a quick transition to the police would solve a huge problem, Guy seizes himself with his own doubts and uncertainty: the absence of the desired alibi; the inability of the alcoholic professor to testify about Guy's name; obsessive need to look politically intact; and other personality factors that make Guy feel defenseless. He's just as dysfunctional as Bruno - just not as dangerous (but one could partially blame Guy for murdering Miriam). 6. Illness and Mental Disorder: An interesting question is how responsible Bruno is for the murder? The more ethically incompetent Bruno is as a sick sociopath, the more Guy can be guilty of being a healthy person who could not stand up and act morally to prevent crimes. Guya's failure is like a man who fails to call the police when a sick friend threatens suicide and follows death. One might argue that more than one crime has been committed and that Guy is an emotionally bullied accomplice. These and many other features of the film make Strangers on a Train the jewel of moral play. diamond for philosophical and film considerations.
