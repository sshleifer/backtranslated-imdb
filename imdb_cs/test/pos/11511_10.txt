First ever: If you like watching movies, I recommend you NOT to leave this. Why? Then you will not appreciate any other film so easily ... <br /> <br /> Actually, I do not want to raise any excessive expectations, but it is almost scary, how perfect, intense and beautiful this work of Einar Gudmundsson is. When in most films at least one aspect spoils the whole thing, such as good actors, but horrible dialogues or nice scenery, but low budget cinema? there is nothing of this ambivalence in Angels of the Universe. Really everything is just great, even (and last but not least, the soundtrack) with the wonderful Siguro Rose. A student who goes schizophrenic after being fired by his girlfriend, especially dialogues (and monologues), deserves some attention: along with (and sometimes in sharp contrast) conspiracies range from depressive and fatalistic to the whole opposite comic and absolutely absurd. In addition, they are often (with quotations from Hegel and Shakespeare) such poetic beauty that the film almost plunges into the surreal sphere, and its incredibly authentic actors are only really saved to the real world. One of the other remarks has already referred to another point: This film is not a trivial entertainment to relax in the evening, despite several comic reliefs, which are largely disruptive, partly cynical and bitter , and above all sad. modern poetry about the life of madness with all its emptiness, anger and solitude. Finally: When you saw the movie? watch it again. There are some great visual metaphors and allusions that you only realize when you look twice and connect them with the story's morale. "And of course: read the book, it contains a lot more small funny stories in between and you also do to understand some things in the movie a little better.
