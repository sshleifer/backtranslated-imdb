One of the interesting aspects of this historic drama is the way in which "conservatives" or British American loyalists are depicted, and what kind of shine is given to their enthusiastic support for King George III. In many respects, the American Revolution was definitely a family affair, because some of the richest colonial families fell apart. If this film is a strong critic, it is possible that the people in this story are a little nicer than in real life. In some ways character action by Major Boulton, played by Cornel Wilde, make him the least likeable cast member and mistake in the story. It seems to be different from being a prickly kind of patriot to be something of a thing. This film focuses primarily on the concepts of personal honor and personal prestige that were the main social "norm" at this day and age. In its subtext, the fact that about twenty-five percent of the colonial population was definitely overlooked by the British. But the power of a conservative element is not obviously malevolent, although a good doctor's figure is about eighty-five percent of the twit class (steal the fine phrase from Monty Python Flying Circus). Anne Francis does a lot with a somewhat thin section of the script and excels. It was a good choice for a woman who had loyal loyalty, a "gal" that was somewhat more modern than the social conventions of that time that could be allowed - if there was no fight for life and death. One of the good aspects of the film is the way in which the rivalries of American revolutionary leaders degenerated into utter jealousy and how these personal conflicts almost almost totally knocked down the revolutionary effort. All in all, leading characters are very well drawn, smaller characters are not just human "props," and the battle scenes are credible enough to take a dramatic action. <br /> <br /> This is a great spy movie. It's not quite a big historical drama, but it satisfies quite well. He evaluates seven largely because Cornel Wilde is so deeply immersed in his role, and he does so well, and because Anne Francis supports as much of his efforts as possible. <br /> <br /> The color printing used on Turner Classic films was very clear, so it was a nice presentation in this important respect. <br /> <br /> I hope it will be back soon.
