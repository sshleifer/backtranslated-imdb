Rating: 7 out of 10. Director: Barbet Schroeder. If you like Hitchcock's "Rope," you will enjoy this movie. "Murder by Numbers" stars Sandra Bullock as a psychologically concerned but brilliant police detective Cassie Mayweather. Her partner is Sam Kennedy, a non-discriminating detective starring Ben Chaplin. Teenage killers are high school students Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt). These young psychotics are beyond proving their superiority by committing a perfect murder and getting rid of it, but the closeness of capture is exciting and exciting for at least one of the murderers. Supporting characters include a police chief, assistant county attorney, and a college janitor who assassins murder. The film reminds me of various films "Hitchcock" crossed with the TV show "Law and Order". We see a fair piece of police work and it is really interesting to find out which detectives follow and which they do not. Another storyline in the film concerns the past of Cassie Mayweather and imprisoned ex-husband. Most viewers found this aspect of the film unnecessary and slow, but I found it to be the most interesting part of the story. "Murder by Numbers" is a nicely crafted movie if you are looking for a safe or should I say a dangerous, murderous secret. For more excitement and tension, try "Se7en" or Hitchcock's "Dial M for Murder".
