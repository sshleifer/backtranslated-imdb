Everything you could ever hope for if your Jackass.As fan is always Knoxville & his crew risking life and limbs just for our entertainment tracking. If you're a fan of the series and the first movie, you won't leave it as it often does. The jokes that pull each other out are twice as fun, cruel, rough as ever, and stunts and brave actions are twice as rough as any episode you've ever seen. If your fan does not waste time going to look at it yourself because of Jackaass's standards this movie is easy 10 out of 10 just for introductory credits alone, I can't go into detail without spoilers, but you have to get to see it believe it.
