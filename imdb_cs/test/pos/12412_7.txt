I can understand why others have responded somewhat uncomfortably to the pinnacle of a climax that is really hard to take seriously. However, I believe that the building works quite well on it. The music, quite scary and backbone tingling, actually provides a haunted aura corresponding to the unforgivable sound of a constant ringing phone that controls the English actress Joan Matlin (Jean Marsh). She borrows a friend a nice apartment and tries to jump into a career in New York (.. city buildings outside the window look as realistic as David Letterman) and is extremely welcome by a noisy phone that rang quite a bit, followed loudly against the wall. Joan seeks answers to those who are responsible for such disrespect of their common sense, and finds that no one is renting this room and that the former tenant has actually been strangled. Without the help of a manager, Joan decides to find out who is causing her such anxiety. Joan discovers that the room is empty and a phone with a strange female voice that will haunt her. The episode, I think, is a tour-de-force for Jean Marsh, who is one woman show. She is the only actress we see, and we watch her through a crisis that erodes her slowly, a phone and a banging from the other room, which causes her to fear. Instead of leaving, Joan remains, so shaken by the noise and break point where she only wishes the phone (.. or who rings) to stop. The episode provides a possible answer to who Joan is worried about and why. The character named Beth comes to the story late when Joan tries to figure out which female voice it was through the second line that recognized her name on the dreaded phone she found in the room opposite her. Beth's fate could only tell the viewer why Joan is traumatized. I think this episode is instead of the credibility of the ghost exercises, others didn't particularly like it, but I certainly did. I admit that the phone, like the physical threat of "crawling" towards Joan, is hard to take seriously, not to mention it's an attack on it, but I thought the intense opening was twenty minutes before it was cold enough to replace it.
