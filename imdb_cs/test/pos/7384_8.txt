I really loved this movie. I thought it was very good. Character interaction has been beautifully performed as well as characterization. The actors were definitely believable. The story was very deep and interesting. Although its parts are a bit slow and sometimes a little boring, it is definitely worth watching several times. The chemistry among the three main actors was great. If you don't want to watch it, at least look at the drama between the characters. The whole thing was just "Whoa!" It was like I couldn't look any further. The whole film grabbed my attention and kept my interest, despite the slow parts. I loved this movie and almost everything about it. I loved the end because it was so interesting, and if you watch the movie a second time, it makes sense. But I do not spoil anything.
