A very intelligent and exciting thriller that does not rely on action, but on a situation that is rare today. I would compare this movie with Den Jackal, another film about the persecution of a dangerous international criminal. The whole game is superlative - Aidan Quinn has a complicated double role as a criminal terrorist Carlos and as a navy man impersonating him. Donald Sutherland plays a CIA amoral agent who hires him. Ben Kingsley plays an Israeli officer to help plan. It is a very tense and effective film and it is remarkable to consider how little action is involved. The first half of the movie is set up as the Navy prepares to impersonate Carlos. The other half is a breathless action player, action based on characters and their situations, making it all the more enjoyable. A really tight film that shouldn't be overlooked.
