One of my favorite movies whenever he is on it, although I admit I miss it once when it was on Foxtel last year. Despite the age of the film, it doesn't look like a story, even though it was done a thousand times before it was fun. I was one or two small niggs in the story, but I watched them and I just enjoyed the movie. Overall, I give him 7/10
