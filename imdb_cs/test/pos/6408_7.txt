In comparison, Tarkovsky is a madman. By comparison, Bela Tarr is MTV. Compared to this film, the film "Russian Ark" is a roller coaster ride. I've just described the 3 experiences of the sllllowwwwwesssstttt I've ever known, and all this is all. But it doesn't say it's bad. On the contrary, I really liked it. But it was a chore. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to describe the plot because you can easily find it elsewhere. Just say that the plot is INSANE. It's one of the most creative and bizarre ideas from "Becoming John Malkovich". I believe an interesting conspiracy is the main reason I didn't nod (also humor was nice. That's something we rarely see in slow, wind movies). standard. Most films have little conspiracy and little essence; yet, it will fill 90 minutes with a lot of charming images to captivate us. But "The Hole" has a 100% plot / theme without the eye. In this regard, I believe it is a truly intellectual experience, just like reading a painfully detailed novel like Thackaray's "Vanity Fair" (which I have never been able to complete!). <br /> <br /> If you have tremendous attention, I think you really like this movie. Despite its dark tempo, it is very creative and imaginative. It's like Jean-Pierre Jeunet on quaaludes and with a dull, dusty camera lens. Good luck.
