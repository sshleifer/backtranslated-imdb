This late 50s French study of dissatisfied youth (in their early twentieth, actually - "adult", but still not settled into the adult world) probably lacked the mile mark in terms of exact depiction of the 1958 French youth. (Do not try practically all the movies of young people doing adults? Those who do not have - River's Edge in mind - are really rare), but director Marcel Carne, the glory of Les Enfants du Paradis, is too accurate an observer of mankind to NOT BE a look at the essence these characters. Details in a sense are not important - you could change the details and set this film today and it would work just as well - but loneliness and insecurity and superficial passion and confident anger are well captured. Young Pierre Brice and Jean-Paul Belmondo are in supporting roles, but Jacques Charrier, Laurent Terzieff, Pascale Petit and Andrea Parisy are playing roles with subtlety and depth. There is also a fine jazz score that you can get on CD JAZZ IN PARIS - JAZZ & CINEMA VOL. 2. Unlike some who commented on the film, I don't see the director-writer Carne as if he was in the judgment of these characters - he seems to be an objective observer for me. Of course, these middle-class characters may seem like people who are spoiled and have no hell to say to working class viewers, and I think Carne is certainly aware of that. For this American viewer (I watched dubbed, quite literally I would say, the version of this title THE CHEATERS), the film provides an interesting window to France in the 1950s. It is also confidently poetic (a scene on a ledge, rescuing a cat, it's just one example) and has intellectual desires in this enchanting way with which only French films can get - I can imagine a cumbersome, melodramatic, shallow way that this the kind of material was mastered by the American studio, and the sensational, moralistic, suggestive way in which this type of material was controlled by American filmmakers. I feel that Marcel Carne has captured the essence of the time between, say, graduation, and when in the early 1930s people have settled to a great extent, whatever the routine. Those who are willing to watch a movie with an open mind and not fire on the many simple goals it offers should find a serious and valuable study of people in their early twenties. And even if you don't want to do it, you can go to another room while the movie plays and simply enjoy a great soundtrack, with a great 50's jazz and instrumental pop, including a gorgeous original American jazz Philharmonic score, including Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Getz (spelled "goetz" in credits), Roy Eldridge, and Ray Brown.
