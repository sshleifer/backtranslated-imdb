From each category it is one demented and over marginal, even in today's standards. Filmed entirely in crap-o-rama, this movie will blow your mind (and something else too!) <br /> <br /> The amount of hilarious bad taste and sleaze is overwhelming. The dialogue is amazingly fast and camps. You'll either love or hate this movie, but let it go. I saw it four times and I love him absolutely. Divinity is alive in an effort to be the dumbest person, but so are its rivals in this obscene and disgusting (but witty) and stylish little film. The Divine was phenomenal and "she" will always be very missed. Edith Massey makes an unforgettable performance like "egglady" and don't forget the energetic Mink Table! <br /> <br /> Ãœber crazy s ** t! <br /> <br /> Recommended for sick little puppies; Women Problems <br /> <br /> Desperate Life <br /> <br /> Polyester
