"The man who knew too much" falls into the middle Hitchcock area that has characterized many of his films during the 1950s: it's not a masterpiece of tension in any way, but a scary lot of fun. James Stewart and Doris Day play a holiday couple who get caught up in a plot of heavy foreign intrigues. The famous top scene takes place at a concert of classical music, where someone will be murdered during the assassination conflict in the game. Of course, the helpless Hitchcock allows us to know what's in the place, so the race to stop the assassin becomes a nail bite against the cymbalist. So much of this movie reminded me of the 1978 Chevy Chase / Goldie Hawn comedy "Foul Play" that I have to believe that the film was inspired by this. Neither film is a big deal, but both are easy to use. <br /> <br /> Stage: B +
