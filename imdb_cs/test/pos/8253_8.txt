Wonderful! He never pretends to be a masterpiece, but it is a mini-gem of British comedy in the late 1970s. Since the producers wanted to sell him abroad, he's an American player (later actor Richard Jordan), but at least he's not an ordinary boring Hollywood type. Around him is the cream of the British character's acting talent, led by the wonderfully dazzling and superior David Niven. Ivan Horrible Niven naturally gains the best steamers and all the best reactions. It can be surprisingly threatening and dangerous. A moment in the snooker club, dropping the enchanting facade and threatening Richard Jordan to come as a shock to those viewers who think Niven is just a light comedy star. It is filled with real power and recklessness when we suddenly see Ivan earning his nickname. All the more surprising how sick Niven was at the time. Shortly after making this production, he lost his speech skills to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (known as Lou Gehrig's Disease). This is the last picture of Niven, where you can hear his own voice, which is then dubbed by Comics Impressionist Sid Caesar. Next to him you can see numerous famous faces from the 1970s and television. Elke Sommer (flashing boobs in the true seventies politically incorrect bimbo mode), Oliver Tobias, Michael Angelis, Brian Croucher, Davy Kaye etc. Davy Kaye gets one of the biggest laughs while holding a security guard who has caught a phone call. "Who are you ringing ?! .... Bloody Dial-A-Disc! You gormless git!" Great shots of London's streets; making movie period patina time capsule red phone boxes with rugged round numeric handset, black cab powered "Cor blimey, gov!" cockneys, and ladies and gentlemen modeling all the ways of deeply dubious late seventies retro casual wear and hairstyles. Unlike the classic Ealing comedies from the earlier era, 'hero' is allowed to get away with his crime and escape into life in the sun. How the times have changed! The code of morality, according to which the scammers had to be punished in films, long ago in the 1970s, when heroes like Pinky Green earn brazen anti-authoritarianism and determination to "joke" in the stuffy capitalist. establishment of entrepreneurs with a suitable fat cat. We are encouraged to cheer when Pinky embarks, unpunished and free as a bird with bad profits. Compare it to the end of The Lavender Hill Mob! <br /> <br /> Highly entertaining, picturesquely dated in fashion and attitudes, and late night cult viewing. Ideal to watch midnight after closing pubs; If you're at a certain age, you feel nostalgia and you always wanted to see David Niven at a McDonalds branch, silently intimidating an American with a retractable telescope!
