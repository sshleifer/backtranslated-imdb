The name does not apply to the disputed poker hand, but to the six comic players. They come in pairs: Charles Ruggles and Mary Boland as a couple driving to California for a second honeymoon, George Burns and Gracie Allen as another couple who go to share the cost, and W.C. Fields and Alison Skipworth as Sheriff and Hotel Owner in the small town of Nevada. Isn't there an effort to create a coherent story? It's a collection of comic bits that are together. Everything the first couple wants to do is spend time together, but Burns and Allen's characters are not married, so men sleep together, just like women. There is a bit of a plot: a bad guy plants a $ 50k in the Pinky trunk (Ruggles) is out of town, but since the expedition is led by Gracie, the prey cannot be found. The bad guy appears in Nevada and the field accidentally intercepts him. A bunch of nice pieces, the confused expression of Ruggles, Gracie Batty, broken conversation, and Fields playing billiards with a corkscrew on a corkscrew and making chirp, crave, a double step backwards when threatened, and his amazingly strong way to extend. words. And he tries to remember the name "Gracie," he tells Skipworth, "Hmm. He starts with K ... McGonigle." He says, "No, no, no, no ..." "Mmmm. Wangahan!" "No, no, no, no no. Oh, Gracie." "Yes, that is correct."
