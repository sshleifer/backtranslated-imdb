Eichard Gere & Diane Lane Again in Another Romantic Love Story. They are a great team, but this film will not be the best among them. This is another story of two strangers who come together and fall in love, then go on the road, then when they meet again and live together. <br /> <br /> SPOILER, but not really. There will be a tragedy, one of them will die. How many times have we seen it before. Those who have never seen the Tearjerkers hope that they like it more than I do. This story has about every clichÃ© it is. The only reason it's got a rating, I'll give it. it is due to its gentle action and excellent production. The cast next to our two stars includes Christopher Meloni, Viola Davis and Scott Glenn. they all give real good performances and do the best with the material given to them. > <br /> Rating: *** (of 4) 82 points (of 100) IMDb 7 of 10)
