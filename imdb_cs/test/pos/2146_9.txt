'The Gate of Heaven' is not a masterpiece that was apparently what was needed to justify its great expense when it was first released, and, more importantly, the continued restless dependence of Hollywood on the Auteur model. "The Gate of Heaven", which is finally seen on the DVD in a cut of 229 minutes, is an excellent movie. It's a lethargic touch in pace. But at least it's the pace. Despite the inability of the building, which now means many films, many films have appeared that have been deliberately damaged by being hacked, regardless of rhythm, so films have become formless and confusing. In addition, criticism on the film has become quite poor in retrospect. If good guys and bad guys are too obviously pronounced for a serious movie, and yes, Muslim, and when Sam Waterston's muscatioed, the furry-dressed villain is a comic book opera (and not the multi-level way of Bill The Butcher of the "Gangs in New York"), And yes, the townspeople seem to be touched by "Fiddler on the Roof" on occasions, then dozens of serious movies made since then, including 'Titanic' and the clueless 'Cold Mountain' (which has some similarities and is a remarkable failure in compelling qualities compared to with this film) can be challenged for the same reason. Despite the allegations, the film has a plot, a pretty well-essayed chart on it. He simply does not resort to the quality of the "epic" standard, as it provides the Titans with heroes, rafts of sub-lands and confusion. He is experimenting with a narrative in a way that is much smaller, more modest, with carefully captured moments of interaction with the character and well-textured expeditions of common actions, such as the opening at Harvard, and especially the beautiful scene. where Johnson County People, following the leadership of brilliantly physical violinist, making a celebration on roller skates. 'Deer Hunter' was a critical and commercial success but left the first half inspired by them, a mosaic-like accumulation of details, and I think in a manner similar to the criticism of Robert Penn Warren's novel "Men of All Kings" and his Dictionary of Jacob Pieces, if Cimino didn't have such a strong understanding of the Hollywood epic conventions, he might have created a special rare piece of art based on sincere visualization of people within his environment. In contrast, the "heavenly gate" succeeds in pulling its narrative momentum and tension in a slow, expanding arc until the finale explodes without leaving the mosaic approach. <br /> <br /> The central romantic triangle, for example, resists standard inflexions; a respectable, intelligent but mentally defeated man, James Averill (Kris Kristofferson) competes with a hot-shot but identity-assaulted young shooter Nate Champion (Christopher Walken) for the hand of a young Madame, Ella Watson (Isabelle Huppert); There is no confident bouncing, no face blinking, blame or typical moments of sad bag, but rather a sad and distant decision by Ella to choose a younger man he loves less because he is ready to make a commitment. Ella appears as the true hero of the film (although Huppert's performance, although inept at first, is really very good, balances dewy emotionalism with the spirit of a hard hammer), attempts to rescue Nate and then collect the opposing side of the immigrants into corporate defense. Subsequently, Averill is pushed into action when friends die. Indeed, in the process of overcoming so many clich√©s and style traps, the "Gate of Heaven" successfully and deliberately threw away the defeated defeat of the indomitable heroes of so many "Western" 70s players and portrays potential, energetic, cheerful heroes. to the endangered but still honored victory. The Social Conflict So Many '70s Western People Finally Make A Full War; where capital is attempting a devastating final victory over the unfair people who stand in their way, they suddenly find a massive and more powerful people's army, led by a man who played ten-year-old Billy Kid's destruction. This is what led the film to be described as the first Marxist Western, but in fact it simply omits the genre theme that existed before the 1960s. Such a diverse and classic old school works like William Wyler 'The Westerner', and even 'Shane', tells terribly similar stories. It's just here that the romantic shooter myth has been replaced by the romantic myth of the people's rebellion. In the grand, exiting but realistic and so chaotic finale, the attacking attacking refuge Cattlemen's camp is surrounded by dust clouds punctuated by fallen horses, writhing bodies and gunfire. Averill puts his classical education to work to finally steal the Roman trick and bring Cattlemen to the brink of annihilation before they are rescued by cavalry (another distinctly sedentary, but certainly not so insulting after 'Little Big Man's unrelenting portrayal of Native American. Massacres). Indeed, it is hard to think of a more heroically American vision of resistance from below. The only real dead point of the film is a useless coda, suggesting that Averill's eventual decline is a somewhat tragic tragedy. Despite some shortcomings and a slow middle part, the "Gate of Heaven" is a masterpiece, a real attempt to create a contemporary Western and new kind of epic. If one still has to get involved in a choir that counts on Cimino being absurd in her scene and spending behavior, it is regrettable. Nowadays, as 'The Adventures of Pluto Nash' and 'K-19 - The Widowmaker' see nearly a hundred million dollars drop into the sewer, and yet the mark of shame hangs on this film, one is wondering exactly what the grim death meant. An attempt at original style, clumsy sexuality, a very hard sense of detail, a breathtaking rigor of filmmaking and what is being filmed contrasts with what is currently lacking in today's Hollywood product.
