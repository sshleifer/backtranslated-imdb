If people were really so stupid, I could be SRW - the supreme ruler of the world. In this one Knotts plays a subdued bean counter for some small jerky water town led by a group of curvaceous just slightly brighter than he. When things get shaky for scammers, they go to Figg's heel frame. Lots of laughter, as Knotts makes his usual mess, stumbles. Especially I appreciated the cable extension scene; at the highest level.
