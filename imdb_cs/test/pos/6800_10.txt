In my opinion, the National Velvet is one of the best family classics of all time. It features Mickey Rooney as (Mi Taylor) and Elizabeth Taylor as (Velvet Brown). Velvet wins a race horse named (Pie) in a raffle. She immediately falls in love with her. With the help of a former jockey, Mi trains him to race at Grand National's. After the jockey, which was scheduled for a race bike, gets out at the last moment, he convinces Velvet to take his place. It was a well-made film. Gentle storyline and top-level playing. The inner game between Elizabeth and Mickey was magical. This is a wonderful family picture that is professionally run by Clarence Brown. The photo is stunning. This is a movie you will enjoy for years. This image is what made Elizabeth Taylor the household name. Both Mickey and Elizabeth stayed close to the movie. After all these years, they still send postcards. <br /> <br /> One side of the note. Elizabeth loved "Pie" horses so much that the studio gave it to her.
