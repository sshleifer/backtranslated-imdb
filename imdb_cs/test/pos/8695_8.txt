This movie has a great premise and is really crying to turn into a Hollywood blockbuster. As I recall (and it's been a few years since I saw the movie), the action begins with a London-filled omnibus filled with people. There is a terrible downfall and one passenger dies. The rest of the film is then told in flashback, with 13 characters on the bus and their recent lives explored in complex details. At the end of the movie we return to the crash and find out which of these cheerful, lively characters has met with a terrible end. Great stuff, a bit like a good tabloid news story that has been complemented in precise, even detailed details. If only video was available ...
