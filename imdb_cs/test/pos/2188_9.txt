Televised in 1982, from Los Angeles production, this is probably the best example of the movie's musical scene you're likely to encounter. Released on DVD in 2004 in remastered digital transmission, it is quite overwhelming. Hearn and Lansbury showcase their lives, and the rest of the cast is apparently captured in electricity production. Of course it is Sondheim's music and lyrics that make it possible. If anyone doubts that he is one of the "greats" of American music, listen to it. The kits are crisp as they fit into the plot, and the clever enabling of fast scene changes and cameras capture the action without destroying the fact that it is a theatrical production. The central, movable and revolving platform is Mrs. Lovett's Pizzeria, with a barber shop upstairs. Around it are various portals and moving stairs that allow the rest of the event. The brutal story of injustice leading to revenge, murder and chaos is liberally spiced up with dark humor and comic moments. Sondheim does what Hitchcock did for showers for the barbershop! Significant work in the American musical theater is given by the electrifying performance.
