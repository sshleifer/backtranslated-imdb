If you enjoyed the Butterfly Effect, Donnie Darek or The Machinist, you will also enjoy K-Pax. For me, this film was really uplifting and yet depressing at the end. Spacey provides great performance like Prot. He also does not forget the look of Saul Williams in the movie that I am a big fan of. After watching, I recommended the movie to a lot of my friends, and everyone was pretty much blown away. But it is still very underestimated, perhaps due to lack of action and explosions. I'm sorry, but it's not a movie about how things are broken, it's about how people behave and how people live in a world that doesn't exist. <br /> <br /> Enjoy and enjoy.
