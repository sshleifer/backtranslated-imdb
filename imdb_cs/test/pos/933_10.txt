The last part of the Kieslowski trilogy based on the colors of the French flag finds the director in peace with the metaphysical and transcendent nature of the film image. In red, images are crucial, as well as obvious but clever color coding. However, Kieslowski's Red is more than a sticking to empty aesthetic motives based on the "cinema du look" of a multilayered, densely meditated on the nature of fate and love. In red, love and destiny are intertwined, but complex concepts, dictated as well as the whims of human beings as invisible parallel associations that seem to go through us. You feel red is really an allegory, a reenactment of the ubiquitous gestures of Prosper in Tempest, but it is more than it seems. Red requires countless perspectives, and with each viewing, something new appears, which itself enters into a perfectly rendered structure. Although Red stands as a masterpiece from Kieslowski, it is best seen as part of the trilogy. The blue and white elements are marked in red, which the viewers will know.
