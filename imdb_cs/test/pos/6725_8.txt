Flowers! If it's one thing you take from this movie, it'll be flowers. They are so conspicuous and used as conspiracy devices, becoming an expert in identification with daisies and black tulips while the film is over. Daisy in Amsterdam tells the story of a frustrating love triangle between 1 girl and 2 men in her life. One professional hit-man earning a living, the second agent of Interpol. With a pan-Asian cast (Korean, Hong Kong) and crew (director Andrew Lau of Hong Kong, Korean writer and Thai post production team), I could imagine headaches in coordination. Park Yi (Jung Woo-sung) is a hit-man who has found a soft spot for Hye-young (played quite by Jeon Ji-hyun). It is love at first sight in the daisy meadows, where its clumsiness has taken its attention. However, being shy and always mindful of the dangers of his professional career, he can only admire her from a distance, make small (or perhaps big) things for her in an anonymous fashion, but the one that takes the cake is sending her potted daisies every day failure at 16:15. From a distance he becomes her guardian angel, protecting her and protecting her from damage. Hye-young is in love with this mysterious stranger. She keeps waiting for her to appear, but I was really wondering how hard it could be due to almost accurate delivery. However, she is terribly moved, and touched on this single act. However, as the stars would have, the interpol detective Jeong Woo (Lee Sung-jae) chances of Hye-young in the square during one of his secret missions, and he is also taken by her. In a similar way, given his profession, it is doubtful whether he should take the first step. <br /> <br /> Which is where viewers could be frustrating. Apparently the lady will be a bad guy (then again, he's a "good" guy), Park Yi is angry with Jeong Woo's persecution, but still refuses to enter and identify and Jeong Woo is an opportunist grabbing an unwittingly anonymous identity. It's almost like you slap everybody to wake them all up. <br /> <br /> This is the tension that interests you. And it's a sinister fun to watch two male men find themselves in difficult love, without jeopardizing their career or their loved one. But I don't think the fans of the event have enough cat and mouse revelations and unspoken camaraderie in the form of Infernal Affairs, as well as sufficient firefights, though I felt the end could be firmer. <br /> <br /> What rocks are clever edits. Telling a story in a nonlinear timeline (no worries, not so bad, you will still be able to follow the story) from the perspective of all leaders, keep you in tension and culminate in a three-way split screen representing all your emotions in one converging event that I thought that it is very well done. It's a beautiful movie in terms of lush meadow landscapes and busy city squares, with plenty of classical music to soothe the soul. As with novelty films, all leaders are eye candy - girls will have a field day with two pretty men's clues, while boys have to do with a somewhat pudgy-faced (argh! Ok lah, at certain angles) Jeon Ji-hyun. If you're in a novel with the same balance in the action / tension department, then Daisy will be your choice. If you prefer a more classic crying, then the Korean movie that debuts at the same time would be another alternative, You are my sun. And yes, I totally kick the last scene that I thought only the Koreans did the best? Kinda reminded me of JSA.
