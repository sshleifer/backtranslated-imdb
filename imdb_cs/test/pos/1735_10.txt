2005 will be the year of Dr.Who's incredible year. Everything seemed to click; first-class new Doctor and companion, big audience (10 million for first episode and Christmas special), major award, critical response, and those idiots who spent years giggling on Dalek's apparent inability to negotiate stairs were well and truly silenced. But then Christopher Eccleston dropped the bomb and ended up in one series. The honeymoon seemed to have ended. Fortunately, the public seems to have adopted its successor, the excellent David Tennant. At the top of this show boasts the fines of S.F.X, as well as the spacecraft crashing into 'Big Ben' in 'Aliens Of London' and outstanding stories like 'Tooth & Claw', 'Army Of Ghosts / Doomsday'. The new "Dr.Who" is basically the same as the old one, updated only for the 21st century. Some fans have accused Russell T.Davies of 'destroying' the show. They need to remember that sixteen years was no show before it came.
