The first of the five films of St Trinian (though the last is usually discounted) was based around artist Ronald Searle's schoolgirl characters and features the wonderful Alastair Sim in drag as Millicent Fritton, school principal, as well as her own brother. Much of the humor is dated, yet curiously moving and outrageous in today's PC world - girls drink, gamble, smoke and are later sold to rich Arabs, but still remain in charge, beating bureaucrats, police, judges and other characters they maraud across England. Perhaps because movies have been so regularly seen on television, St Trinians still inspire fancy party and club nights. Films have recurring characters including PC Ruby Gates (Joyce Grenfell) and Flash Harry (George Cole). The ancestor of the whole series is a charming movie called The Happiest Days of Your Life (1950).
