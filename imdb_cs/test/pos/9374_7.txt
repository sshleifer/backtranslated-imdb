I did not read the source, Richard Brooks' novel "The Brick Foxhole", which I hope is not as unfortunate as its name, but I understand that the original villain was not an homophobic but an anti-Semite. (And to be honest, Sam Levene is written as a gay man who picks up a drunken soldier.) But, well, you have to go with the flow. Consider the year 1947. Even anti-Semitism has not been processed on the screen. Many people responsible for contemporary films were Jews themselves, but anti-Semitism was for many years verboten because it was considered unpleasant. We can hardly blame the creator of this film for not leaving a homosexual victim. Now it is really unpleasant - and besides, there may have been a lot of rooting for the audience for Robert Ryan. We are by no means freed from prejudice, but since 1947 we have long gone. For the first time in years, I watched it when I was watching relatively slowly for the first time in years. film, many shots of two people talking, shadows, time passing between question and answer, uninspired cut. But I could live with it because of the theme of the movie and some other things. One of the things that keeps me on the action as they develop so deliberately is the performance of Robert Ryan. The guy's doing a great job. Sometimes it may seem thoughtful, cheerfully subordinate and helpful to the police - "Anyway, I can help, yes, sir." Then, alone or with another soldier, warm hatred rises to the top, not so much through what he says, but the way he looks. The frown, the piercing gaze, the dark eyes glittering. Wow. The film took a lot of heat by preaching Robert Young about the murder of his grandfather. That doesn't bother me at all, although I think Dmytryk didn't have to force Young to put his face in the camera when he talked about "MICKS and PAPISTS". Considering the context, it is one of the more shocking moments of the film. Part of its impact is due to the almost random delivery of the message to Young, and part of it is due to the fact that the message was not heard on the screen before. Another feature of the film that almost transforms him into a surreal is the character of Paul Kelly and his relationship with Gloria Graham. Saint Guacamole, what is the elliptical interview Kelly. "Do you know what I told you? All the things I told you? They're lies." His character neatly crosses pathos with horror. It's impossible to know what to do. It adds virtually nothing to the plot, but the film would be much less without its presence. It's a whimsical, murky movie. His people live in the dark. And there's murder. Virtually no one shouted or shouted. The horror that these men have experienced and that some of them still carry with them like malaria seems to be just below the surface. <br /> <br /> See if you have a chance.
