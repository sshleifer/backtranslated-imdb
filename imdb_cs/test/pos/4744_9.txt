Seven Ups was compared with Bullitt for the chase scene, but nowhere near the corresponding Bullitt. Bullitt has a beginning that builds builds. When McQueen leaves the thoughtful hotel, he gets to his Mustang, which is parked under the Embarcadero Freeway (now torn down) and notices that the charger is nearby, you know you're going to see something spectacular. From the moment McQueen starts the car, it starts with the best ever shot. Adding to this is the amazing Lalo Schriffin if I remember correctly the soundtrack. It takes a long time to hear the first tire shouting. The shot of McQueen's Mustang, which suddenly appeared in Bill Hickman's rear-view mirror, is unmatched for visual impact. Hickman's expression of surprise and double excitement really increases the effect. Then, of course, San Francisco is unmatched for setting up cars that race up and down and around corners. Also, Bullitt being filmed in the 60s when the cars were still "hot" (Mustang GT and Dodge Charger) made for a better set of wheels then two boring, smog devices loaded with Pontiacs in the 1970s seven seats. Bill Hickman was the driver of the bad car in both movies. I saw him sit at an insider movie as soon as I saw a lot at Univeral when I was making film reviews on paper. Well they tried it in Seven Ups, though with a chase scene. Seven upwards had several "jumps" over the small hills, (Yawn), but of course they were not San Francisco hills. The Seven Ups chase, where they are actually driving fast, is longer than the gradual fast sequence at Bullit. But the scene of a single shotgun shot that completely blew the hood of Roy Schieders Pontiac is the pinnacle of absurdity. I would say strictly Hollywood, except that it was shot in New York.
