The highlight of Lackawanna Blues is the character of Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, who runs the guesthouse and provides unwavering support to the young boy, Ruben, the storyteller. Based on the experience of writer-actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson, the film lovingly restores a New York guesthouse in New York City and in the 1960s evokes the cultural climate of the world. The first half of the film is practically continuous music. The other half addresses more characters in the guest house. The nanny's ability to "take fragments and make them whole" affects everyone in her sphere. A particularly lively scene is when he confronts an offensive husband and tells him firmly: "If you touch that baby again, we'll dance!" As the actress S. Epatha Merkerson added, this line is so sharp and filled with such determination that the hair-shaking husband is frozen in his footsteps. Merkerson delivers a spectacular presence from start to finish Her character combines the diverse lives of borders in her home. It was a moving, heartfelt movie with a wonderful cast. As Merkerson plays, the character of Nanny simply radiates love. This is a cinematic experience that I remember for a long time.
