I thought this movie was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the pieces I missed while I bent over holding my stomach! The critic who reviewed this movie for this site has challenged anyone who has IQ over their shoe size to find this movie funny, and my IQ is about: 135 ... I urge this person to ask me and then eat their own Words! This movie is brilliant, and if the critic wasn't such a boring idiot, he could smile once in a lifetime and take things as easily as they intended !!! <br /> <br /> The music numbers were so imaginative! Anyone watching any movie about this time will notice men in stockings and realize how different it is from today's clothing and how funny we would find today's male population if they had stockings day by day! The idea of ​​devoting a song of butch men dancing in stockings was as fresh as no one must laugh !!! (And moreover, seeing hip-hop rappers doing ballet is always hysterical - as a dancer too, I've done ballet and hip hop and danced with men who had to do both .... it still tears me apart !! !) <br /> <br /> I love this movie, if you haven't seen it yet, don't listen to the criticism ... watch it and then decide for yourself !!!
