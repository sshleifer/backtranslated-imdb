The subject is World War II and Robert Ryan is a rejected soldier whom Lupino hires as a handyman. She's a war widow. The set is limited, but the actor is involved. Robert Ryan is in conflict: one moment seems nice and then confused where he lives. At first, Lupino tries to help him. He seems to be concerned, but nothing more dangerous. But how do we know? Tension is building up. I really like movies like this that rely on the human element for tension. What is this man capable of? There are some scenes with O.Z. Whitehead and Dee Pollock as an unpleasant boy who sees something wrong. We're still thinking of helping her, and Ryan's personality turns around again. It becomes like a Jekyll / Hyde character and finally chases Lupino's knife. It's worth watching these two great actors. 9/10.
