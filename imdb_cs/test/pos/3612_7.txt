Here's a well-developed war story, pretty shot and well-functioning. The depiction of the Italian and German cast of the Greek island of Kefalonia is well done. John Hurt as Pelagia's father and island doctor is great, Nicolas Cage has a good job as a captain of the title, Penelope Cruz has a good job of being beautiful and burning his lashes at Cage. There is heroism and humor, there's drama and romance, and that's all on an idyllic island. Strangely, very similar, or I should say, almost identical, the story, with the same characters going through the same series of events, is said in a novel of the same title, written by Louis de Bernieres. This wonderful historical novel tells the story of beautiful Pelagia, the daughter of Dr. Iannis and their life on Cephalonia during World War II. Pelagia is a fiancee, local fisherman of Mandras, enlists when the Italian army attacks northern Greece from Albania under false pretenses. Finally, when the Axis predominates, with great help from the Germans, a crew of Italian soldiers are placed on the island, and Captain Corelli plays a major role in keeping the occupation quiet. When Mandras joins the guerrillas, the charming Corelli and his mandolin are housed with a doctor and his beautiful daughter. Of course it's a love story. But it is also a war novel, a summary of Greek history, a story of a communist uprising in post-war Greece, a portrait of Mussolini's madness, and most importantly an ode to island life in Cephalonia. Some of these elements are returning in the movie, but in general it's an impossible movie book. I'm glad no one ever tried. But Captain Corelli's Mandolin is worth seeing. Just make sure you read the book * after * you will see the movie.
