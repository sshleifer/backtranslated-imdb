Without going into any good detail ... if it's a somewhat provocative ... television movie, there seems to be a consensus among the users that there's "no one to blame". <br /> <br /> I disagree. Yes, young man lover Beverly D'Angelo, played by Rob Estes can be young and horny (and good looking) because he doesn't get as much as he wants from his mom, it doesn't mean he can climb in bed and have sex with his daughter. OK, he can use the excuse he wanted to watch with her, but I can't buy it. People must take responsibility for their actions. Not only did he "cross the border" by having sex with a very vulnerable teenager when he was reportedly a "responsible adult," he said, "Your mom must never know about it." How responsible was he then? Yes, it's a good movie, but it got what came to it. Don't play people that what happened is "no one's blame".
