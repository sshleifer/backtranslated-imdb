One word. Hilarious. I haven't seen the movie like that for a long time. In places in the movie I completely forgot that it was a movie, I just felt like I was looking at Vivu La Bam or even watching my friend go through something like that. It was realistic and I liked the way Bam, Ryan, Raab, Rake and Brandon and the other guys were not trying too hard. They just treated me like their famous idiotic self. There were several scenes I loved more than others, like Raab in the shower, holy, so I laughed. Honestly, he was probably my favorite in addition to my favorite character. Indeed, in my opinion, the film made just a little more cheerful. It's basically necessary to see for all CKY fans:]
