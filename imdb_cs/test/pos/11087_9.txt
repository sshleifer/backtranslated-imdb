this movement was interesting and absorbing; however, the story was a bit jerky and difficult to watch occasionally. Although the two main actors did a great job of seeing Senna Penn behave with each thread of his being and stealing every shot, they made this very memorable movie. Later movies revealed him to be not the only role executive: he also showed a comedy atmosphere in Sweet and Lowdown. Surprisingly talented and not light I thought it was.
