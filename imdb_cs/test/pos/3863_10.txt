20. Animated Disney Classics is often criticized by many people as "average" or poor in quality, but that's a great movie. Too bad that "Aristocats" won't get a credit. I personally see it as one of my favorite Disney classics. Despite being extremely underrated, he's one of Disney's most entertaining classics. It's full of cheerful (some of them hysterical) moments. Edgar, a greedy servant, is a movie criminal, but it's a perfect comic. It's one of my favorite Disney villains because it's so funny. Each scene with Edgar and the chase dogs Napoleon and Lafayet chasing him is one of the most cheerful things you ever see, especially when Edgar drives his motorcycle into the river and around the bridge, the dogs chase him. This is hysterical! But classic humor comes not only from Edgar or dogs. Other characters have their moments as well. <br /> <br /> The quality of the subject is not perfect, but remains high. Even after Walt Disney's death, artists knew how to maintain loyalty to Walt's spirit and "Aristocats" is one of these examples. That's not how they do it today! As usual, legendary Disney actors talk about characters. In this case, we have Phil Harris, Sterling Holloway, Paul Winchell, Eva Gabor and Pat Buttram. Characters are generally cool: Thomas O'Malley, Duchess and her 3 kittens, Roquefort mouse, aisle cats, English geese, dogs and horses. Also included are human figures: the eccentric and kind opera singer Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, Madame Georges Hautecourt's old lawyer and Edgar himself! The soundtrack has nice and catchy songs like the theme of Thomas O'Malley (but I can't remember his name), for example "Everyone wants to be a cat" and "The Aristocats" (sung by Maurice Chevalier) for example. This film takes place in Paris (France) in 1910. Above all, it is a joyful, nice and very pleasant movie. A timeless classic that is often underestimated and forgotten, but very good. This should definitely be the Top 250.
