This is an interesting, hard-to-reach film from the early 1970s, in which John Michael Vincent acted as a young man who does not cut like a sailor. Dressed in "baby blue" clothes to humiliate them when sent home, unsuccessful recruits are sent. Vincent stops at the bar and runs into the very young Richard Gere, who has just returned from the Pacific tour as a hard-core Marine 'Raider'. Gere's character is already tired and thinking about desertion and uses Vincent's innocence, stealing his "baby blue" uniform after getting drunk and beating him in the alley. Vincent's character, whose name is Marion, takes Gere's gear and is suddenly transformed into Marine 'Raider'. Marion embarks on a trip to Wyoming and stops at Little Norman Rockwell. She meets Rose Hudkins at the local coffee shop, who catches him instantly. Staying with Hudkins' parents, Marion attracts all kinds of attention from the city's people. Mr. Hudkins suspects Marion and wonders how Marine 'Raider' could still be so innocent. The story also educates Japanese internment camps because the city's people go to 'hunt' 3 refugees. Marion is shot accidentally during this hunt. But there is still a happy ending that confuses me a little. I'd like to give a little bit of drama! Anyway, it captures the JMV at the top of its 70 performances. BUSTER AND BILLIE, BABY BLUE MARINE and WHITE LINE FEVER were amazingly good in the mid-1970s. He was both an action star and a heart. During his career, he has made a lot of quality films and continued to do so until the mid-1980s with a great TV show Airwolf. In this work he does a very good job like 'Hedge', silently watching the people in his uniform treat him with him all over the country. He also had to do some stunt work - there is a rough river scene at the end of the movie - and he seems to be the guy who threw me down the river! But indeed, at the height of his popularity, this film could do much more with the JMV's talent and appearance. Innocence may be so interesting. Evil, as explored in "Buster and Billie", is much more dramatic! Anyway, Glynnis O'Connor is as amazing as Rose. The whole film is like Norman Rockwell's painting. Outdoor scenes are beautiful - they had to be filmed in Canada.
