Yes, I give it 10 because I compare it not only with the others who are his kind, but also with who is bombarded every day in what is today sadly called today's "popular culture." It is aside that the film is beautifully cast, as mentioned elsewhere, and gives us a pretty good view of popular theater from the late 18th and early 20th centuries. No small coincidence that many games that Olcott played in a similar similar plot: A boy meets a girl, someone objects, (usually a father or some body figure) a boy fights, a boy wins a girl. He was at that time known as "Chauncey Olcott Act". Not one coincidence John Ford was driving. He called it "The Silent Man". And "My Wild Irish Rose" is itself "Chauncey Olcott act". Great stuff, right? By the way, great songs, great stuff. Enjoy. <br /> <br /> PS - After watching the movie, I'd like to learn more about Bill Scanlan. I found a victim who said he had left "Mauvorneen" as a result of madness (replaced, as in the movie, by Chauncey Olcott) and died in asylum a few years later. But he was himself, a very big star who wrote songs and games and played songs for him. <br /> <br /> Anyone knowing more?
