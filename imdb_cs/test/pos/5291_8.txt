Like the five-year-old protagonist of his last opus, "Ponyo" Hayao Miyazaki's "Ponyo" enchants with its unbridled innocence as if the anime-meister had become a child in the splicing of the story, enjoying its simplicity and radiating infectious magic in the process. . Miyazaki, reminiscent of his earlier works, paints a colorful world obviously aimed at younger audiences, and raw noise effervesfully removes the grim thematic elements that distinguish his immediate predecessors. Ponyo (voiced by Yuri lovingly) Nara), a fish with a young girl's face (to look like a plush baby in a pink costume overgrown in Halloween), escapes from her underwater home and her siblings school to explore the surface. Knitted to shore, she is rescued by Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), a five-year-old boy who, along with his mom Risa (Tomoko Yamaguchi), lives in a house on a nearby cliff. This initial encounter, and ultimately friendship, has a profound impact on Ponya, who now wishes to become a man, but by becoming an involuntary tip of the balance of nature and unleashing the maelstrom on the ground. With the help of Sosuke's help, Ponyo must pass the test to cancel this curse and become a human. Despite the conspiracy that lacks philosophical sophistication, say, his latest "Spirited Away", "Ponyo" is nothing short of tremendous viewing, characterized by extremely diligent attention to detail and a masterful balance of real and fantastic and simple joys and great fears. It is a straightforward story that, though occasionally stopped by its tendency to climb like a toddler, keeps it in line with the youthful pedigree to magically fascinate. "I will protect you," Sosuke says to Pony in a matter-of-fact way, and the child's claims are not similar to the way Miyazaki gives his story a refined spirit.
