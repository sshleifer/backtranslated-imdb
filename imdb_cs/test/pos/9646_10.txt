I felt I had to give some feedback on this movie I rented from Blockbuster. This film has everything - comedy, drama, crime, tension and "realism". This movie also had a lot of action with the right amount of humor! I'll definitely watch it again! There were some humorous parts, as well as action-packed drama. I like movies that interest you what happens next. Writer / Director Travis Milloy should do more movies !!! In my overall opinion, this movie was great! I look forward to his next one! Travis Milloy has a real talent as a writer and director.
