IN & OUT is, in my opinion, a very good movie. I thought Cameron (Matt Dillon) was wrong when he said Howard (Kevin Kline) was gay. I liked Howard's free party the most. It was because jokes about a lot of things cracked, including Barbra Streisand's movies. I also thought Emily (Joan Cusack) looked very beautiful in her wedding dress and that Howard looked good in his tuxedo. My favorite quote from IN & OUT is: "Is everyone gay? It's" TWILIGHT ZONE "?" That was absolutely cheerful! One character I couldn't build was Sonya (Shalom Harlow). That's because she was VERY conceited and snobbish. Finally, I recommend this movie to all Kevin Kline fans who haven't seen it. Be ready to laugh HARD and have fun when you see it.
