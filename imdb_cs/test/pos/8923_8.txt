It is an excellent film full of complexity, themes and great dialogue. The characters are well drawn, Phil is the biggest loser of all time. Adam Haddrick's character is the most serious thing I've seen on the screen because of Adolf Hitler's appearance in Hitler: The Last's Ten Days. I just wanted everyone to get away with it. But without being too far away, there are situations where you just can't lie down.
