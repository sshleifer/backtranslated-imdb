I first saw The Couch Trip (1988) on late night television and I immediately fell in love with it. The funny thing is that I usually caught all the comedies I did, but I never heard of this until I saw it. Dan Ackroyd is a plain and plain hillarious period. He did some great Belushi movies and don't forget Saturday Night Live. But I think Couch Trip is probably his best and most fun. With a good accompaniment to Charles Grodin, David Clennon and Walter Matthau, this piece of cinema shines with comic gold. Ackroyd's wife Donna Dixxon has a great job here. My favorite moments of the movie include Ackroyd and David Clennon charter at Lawrence Baird. The two played well. So if you haven't seen a good comedy in a terrible trip, head out back to 1988 to rent or buy a Couch Trip. I just did it, Amazon 78 cents. What is beneficial, the bad I got hit with a 2.50 shipping charge. Well, well worth it. This guy will love this movie, check it out.
