Where the first movie got everyone laughs because all the cartoon characters were so perfectly brought to life without losing their cartoonic identity, this sequel (which is a separate story like all comics) is even better. Sure, all the ingredients you find in the first movie and in the comics are back again: Obelix is ​​still dying to taste the "magic potion" that gives other members of such a tremendous power, Caesar and the rest of the Roman Empire are still number 1 but some New, refreshing elements have been brought to the stage as well. Not only is the setting very idyllic (most of it plays of course in Egypt), but rather than repeating the movie number one, some additions have been added by having all kinds of links to other movies (Bruce Lee etc.). ). This is nothing new but an unexpected combination of a well-known comic book story (with almost the same name as a movie) and links to things that have nothing to do with Asterix & Obelix.
