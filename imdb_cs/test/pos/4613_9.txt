Good grief sethrp-1, you completely missed the point. The girl was only briefly seen because she was the one who wanted to kill ... all the others were so wrapped up in their own stories they didn't even notice. As one of the other students at the end says - we are all so packed into our own problems that we don't notice what's going on for someone else. The director himself said that if he killed one of the others, he would suggest that their problems be worse than others. The whole point of killing Kelly was that she didn't see us all. Give it now?
