Simply an adorable claymation feature from Nick Park and the spoofing society of such film-greats as "King Kong" and "Wolf Man" has Wallace and Gromit as Rabbit's Safety to find it difficult to solve a major problem in their village .. on vegetable crops of citizens! Worse still, he is about to launch a big vegetable festival, and all the citizens are prepared to win the prize. What makes the situation even worse is Wallace's reason for the whole vegetable-eating rampage .. tested a new invention concerning its brain waves in an attempt to wash the brains of caught rabbits into harsh plant crops. What happens is catastrophic because some kind of hybrid rabbit was created in the process .. and has more to do with Wallace than he ever imagined. It will be on his loyal (and surprisingly intelligent) and fast-thinking dog Gromit to save this day. This is the clever and imaginative task of the crew behind the other Oscar-winning delusions. Play Wallace and Gromit. The vision of good ole-fashion Claymation is refreshing due to the CGI boom, which featured rather bland fare here lately, as the industry spits out more and more average product. Here we have a full function with humorous humor and some wild stunts with amazing animation, not to mention the gute from the eyes.
