Andaz Apna Apna is a movie that I respect and his one movie, I do not mind whenever I see ... almost anytime! This movie is just amazing and I think it's the funniest movie I've ever seen! And yes, I give it through Hera Pheri ... the reason? Hera Pheri has scenes to watch for, but Andaz Apna Apna? Impossible! Simply because every scene is a scene you have to watch out for! Aamir & Salman share great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes, but I will build the characters in the order of favorites: Rank # 1. Crime Master Gogo (the best performance of Shakti Kapoor by date and yes, Gogo is innocent who belongs to the well-regarded Mogambo family (Mr. India glory) Crime Master Gogo is actually Mogambo's nephew, but for Mogambo he is more than a responsible, handsome, charismatic charming son, Gogo, making the biggest mistake in life by lending 36,000 rupees to Tejo (Who is how Balla once said, "Scam and Scam!") Goga's only goal is to return what is his and his way of recovering lost money, Gogo realizes that there are more than 36,000 he needs to achieve, and so ... Gog's fight against the world of sinners begins. /> Rank # 2. Teja Main Hoon, Mark Idhar Hai!: Teja is an evil character who is twin Ram Gopal Bajaj. Originally named Shyam Gopal Bajaj , Teja decides to change his name to suit his personality, when his brother always envied his brother and then one day something changed to a worse situation when his father gave all his fortune to Ram Baja. Teja decided to kill his father, but instead killed Munshi's Harisha Chandra (Raveen's dad) in the darkness of the night, though Teja didn't regret it. The only mission now is to return to some property and set up its own poultry farm and bakery. Teja also needs to return the loan to Gog (but has no intentions). To achieve his evil goals, Teja employs two people: Roberta (Vijay Khote, who is very good at targeting) and Balla (Shahzad Khan, Ajita's clone and son ... who is a very clever boy!) <Br/> <br / > Rank # 3. Amar (Aamir Khan): He wants to marry a rich heiress Raveena, so he sells his father's cheap saloon and heads for Mumbai. Amar, he has no problem caring about the big deal that Raveena's father gives him after the wedding and is willing to sacrifice his luck and move to London if necessary. Rank # 4. Prem (Salman Khan): After Gog, Prem is the second innocent character in the film, and the way Amar tries to use him in a friend's mask is tragic. I won t reveal more characters because of Jesus Christ! I just wouldn't stop writing! The film is absolutely stunning! Go and get a DVD and watch out for those cheap VCDs because they've missed many good scenes from the movie. The background music is shame and action is better than the Matrix, especially the last encounter between Prem and Crime Master Gogo (watch out for it), it will appear at the top. Andaz Apna Apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teaches us a lot about life and values ​​and ethics. He teaches us about bravery (why else would Amar ask Prema to stay back when they meet the kidnapper, even though Prem complained that he had to go to the restroom?). Andaz Apna Apna is also a tragedy, especially the scene on which Salman is targeted by Aamir and overdose on gastric stomach tablets. arrested at the end without even returning his 36,000. Andaz Apna Apna is overall a complete package .... sit back and enjoy the ride! I bet there will be a second ride after him ... and then a third! The film was then considered a flop and I bet no one likes it but the boys are sleeping! This movie is a big hit! Although it doesn't have enough people coming to theaters, the movie is one of the best selling home DVDs and one of the most often movie on most channels, so the producers laughed their way to the banks long back!
