While the film has its shortcomings, it reveals some of the problems that come with life in a country that has no democracy. This forces you to empathize with people under such a government and want you to learn more about their lives, their struggles and the potential leader of Aung San Suu Kyi. This makes one wonder why our government will intervene in places that we do not want to ignore those who ask our help.
