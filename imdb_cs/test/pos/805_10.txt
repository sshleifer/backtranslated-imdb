This is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of "The Hollow." It could be argued that there is not even one of Christie's best secrets here, but what makes 'The Hollow' special is characterization and I found that the actors here, more or less without exception, were perfect in their parts. It is difficult to choose excellent performances in such a good cast, but Sarah Miles is just as perfect as Lucy Angkatell. Extraordinary is that not only does she show Lucy's dottness, tactlessness and her more loving qualities, but she also manages to pull out the basic truth that in fact, Lucy isn't really all so nice! Megan Dodds is also very good because Henrietta and Claire Price greatly influence Gerd. John Christow is a really unlikely character, but Jonathan Cake can still see what his wives see in it. As I said, the script follows the story quite faithfully. The only disturbing thing I found out was that the relationship between Midge and Edward really came out of nothing and I believe some of them had to end up on the floor in the room! Their side story and primary story is very well done. The whole thing also looks beautiful, really capturing the perfect English autumn. It's a beautiful movie in every respect and it's worth seeing.
