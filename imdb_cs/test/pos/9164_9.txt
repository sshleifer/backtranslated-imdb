I would recommend it as the most successful attempt to make a film about the Soviet Afghan war. And it is a very honest and responsible picture, from small details of uniforms and weapons to human relationships, war routine and Central Asian landscapes. It was shot in Tajikistan just after the withdrawal of troops, which happened in 1989 not in 1985. The Italian star Mr. Placido was in the perfect role of Major Bandura. Other characters also looked very natural, especially the drunk driving manager of the club. Sometimes the film team had to escape even under fire. The last scene is a purely "harakiri" type of behavior and reminded me of the last phrase from one famous samurai movie - "We won all battles but lost the war". It could also be a metaphor for the collapse of the USSR - a great country that made it possible to shoot a small child who was injured.
