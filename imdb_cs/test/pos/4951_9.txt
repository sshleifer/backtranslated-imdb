I really like opening the movie when Col. Ted Masters finds on his fighter radar that four enemy planes are approaching from about 10 am. The good news is that the film does not mention at the outset that the colonel, along with a fighter from the wing, who was a lieutenant, was trying to practice "freedom of navigation" along the eastern Meditteranean Sea, but also moved a little behind the restricted area of ​​airspace reserved for dishonest a nation of the Middle East accidentally passing by. I also like the fact that all interventions on Colonel fighter radar readings and computer displays, as an enemy aircraft aggressively selects two American fighter pilots, have engaged in violating their airspace. The first duel immediately reminds me of the famous fighter pilot film "Top Gun". From waxing enemy bandits to thirty-millimeter enemy planes that hit colonel jet engines and pushing the plane down, forcing him to eject, it all reminds us of one thing ... combat combat techniques can keep you alive ... but One false move can cause you to be shot down. The only problem in the movie was the "snake sequence" scene. It was a little too long. Yes, the opening of the movie was great when you see a conflict ... which was a encounter with skirmishes. Only when one boy tells Doug Masters that his father was shot down after the Cessna plane landed in the "snake" race, he forces us back to the time the conflict began. I think the snake sequence in the middle should be interrupted by Cole Masters, who is dragged in handcuffs in the middle of the Bilyad Desert on the way to the prison center ... while the "snake" musical sequence continues. The film won't do it ... if it were, the details of the conflict would be smoother at this point. Still good differently. <br /> <br /> When the word found Col. The Ted Masters trial for high treason (violation of territorial air sovereignty) ended and he was sentenced to hang on the gallows for three days, Doug Masters decides to go to action. With the Air Force, which has vain attempts to save a man, Doug decides to pull his friends and Col. Sinclaira (played by Louis Gossett Jr.) for a plan to rescue the Masters. He risked a high chance of facing a war court and spending more than a year in the military army, going against aviation policy and planning to rescue masters without US government approval. Doug and his friends crept into several classic base areas to get a lot of things in the area where the Masters is held for the upcoming suspension, and the surrounding area around Bilyad (which seems to be a fake Middle movie) East). One plan included fireworks firing outside the dark chamber of the air force as a diversion to get classified photos and maintenance material for a fighter, fighter base, intelligence, and all other military items around Bilyad. When everything was said and done, and Sinclair studied all the intelligence, he almost nearly rejected the plan because Doug was too cocky. Not until they get two F-16s and try to run through the shooting range that I realized they would do overseas. I realized that Doug's shooting and the bomb wasn't good until he heard rock music. I remember dropping one Mach bomb on a horizontal target and a 20-foot bomb ... I realized Doug was unusual. He likes music when he fires fighter ammunition. The last part of the conflict, the final battle in "Iron Eagle" was better than the top of the Top Gun of the enemy sequences. I liked the way the final conflict unfolded, especially when Doug Masters confronted a Middle East fighter pilot who actually led a trial against Ted Masters. Short, but sweet, when Doug took the enemy after a second attempt by a side winder rocket. Looks like this Colonel Bilyad resembled "Darth Vader" in Star Wars .... in the air, he can be very bad, because if you saw Star Wars, Darth Vader was actually Anakin Skywalker, who was ace aces pilot. But the unusual connotation still works!
