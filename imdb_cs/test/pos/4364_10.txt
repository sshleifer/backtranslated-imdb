I consider it a breathtaking but deceptive film because it seems so simple and straightforward: the Vietnamese survivor tells his horrible story and part of the story is re-placed on the spot. Reviewers sometimes even claim that Herzog's presence in the film is minimal, but how bad they are. We know that all the documents are "mediated" to some extent, and this has fine hands throughout Herzog, especially in stunning music, incredibly professional selection of archival footage, and cascade image management. The evocative power of this film is overwhelming, starting with the title, the opening title card from "Revelation" and the initial voice. It is a film that can be repeatedly watched with a growing miracle, not a simple commodity, which is consumed by its favorite drink on its way to the evening news. This is one of those films that can resonate with you all your life.
