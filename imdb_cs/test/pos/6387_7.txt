Like most people, I'm tired of the numbers that clich√©s film Hollywood. There seems to be no creativity in Hollywood. Companies just want to spend money on divisions are the sequels that the audience has built in. This film is a welcome change. This could be classified as a romantic comedy for his genre, but don't be letting you out of this movie. This is a very original movie that is not like most of the things Hollywood produces. <br /> <br /> If you are reading this, you already know the basic graph, so I won't bother. The only movies that come to mind to compare it are "Interstate 60" and "Art of Travel", which are little-known gems that have a different path than most Hollywood garbage. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing if you're tired of watching more of the same. <br /> <br /> Dean
