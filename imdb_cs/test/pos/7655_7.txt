Latcho Drom, or Safe Way, is the second film in the Tony Gatlif trilogy of the Roma. The film is a visual depiction and historical record of Roma life in the countries of Europe and the Middle East. Although the scenes are mostly planned, rehearsed and staged, there is no conventional story and dialogue does not explain activities from scene to scene. Instead, the movie allows the viewer to have an ever look, sometimes more in-depth view of these people during different periods and in different countries, ranging from India, Egypt, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, France, and Spain. The importance of music in Roma culture is clearly expressed throughout the film. It is an important part of every event and an important means of communication. Everything they do is expressed by music. Dance is another important activity. As Roma music, it is specialized and deeply personal, something they know how to do it right. We provide insights into their daily activities, but the film is not a detailed study of their lives. Rather, it is a testament to their culture of music and dance they have created and made them unique. Mr. Gatlif portrays nomadic groups in a positive way. However, we are also witnessing the rejection, distrust and alienation that they receive from the non-Roma population. The culture they have developed in countless generations, and it has been inspired by different countries, seems to disappear into oblivion, because a conventional society has no place for nomadic ways. Other films in the trilogy are Les Princes (1983) and Gadjo Dilo (1998).
