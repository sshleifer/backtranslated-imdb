"Body" is difficult to describe with a solid summary, because, in essence, it is not essentially a plot. The film largely shows a day in the life of a cheater named Joe (Joe Dallesandro, who is in an underestimated picture of Louis Malle "Black Moon") while doing his bikes, sleeping and modeling around cash money to pay for his wife's abortion. Not much, and because the film is quite lengthy eighty-nine minutes, you would think that the "body" would be slow and boring hour and a half. You think it's wrong. The film is made up of improvisation, screenplay and film angles are also very nice on the spot, but there is some truth under each frame that gives the film a dementously fun atmosphere. Everything makes sense and serves the purpose of what happens to Joe this day. He meets a regular John, who is apparently lying when he says he wants to see Joe again, a photographer who talks so much that he gets bored of Joe to tears, two towing queens that read from tabloid magazines when Joe receives his head from a miserable addict . who later mumbles about how he wants to get a funicular, an old friend Joe, who reads man's rape stories, and then the last scene with his wife and her lover, who greatly reflects the scene at the start of the movie (one of the best movie openings) , which I've seen for some time)? and tells what the film is philosophical about. It's amazing how the film's news and styles feel almost timeless, even though it's in New York in the 1960s, real-time, real-time, and filmed as an obvious independent film of that time. It is certainly not a film that could be made today, which contributes to its delicious mysticism. <br /> <br /> Offered by unexpected jumps; and missing scores in advance of your images? "Meat" is probably so raw that a film about male prostitution can get in the sixties.
