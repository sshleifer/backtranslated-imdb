My architect is a great movie about finding Nathaniel Kahn for himself through the legacy of his famous father, architect Louis Kahn, who has been dead since 1974. The film is coming out slowly but perfectly, and what begins as a seemingly lost identity crisis is beginning to develop. a beautiful story with a much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps even more important, our life. I've never heard of Louis Kahn before this movie, even though I was unclear about his work. Through the words (both good and bad) of Louis Kahn's colleagues, you have a very good sense of what Nathaniel had to feel when memories recall and tell stories. Sometimes it looked like these people were telling Nathaniel how he felt about his father. As I listened to each memory, my own opinion on this man would range from beautiful to horrible, sometimes in the moment, so you feel good about the roller coaster Nathaniel's emotions had to drive through. The final sequence in Bangladesh totally made me a movie. The respect spoken by the people of Bangladesh about Louis Kahn's work tied all the loose ends together nicely for me, and hopefully for Nathaniel. I think Nathaniel Kahn finally found what he was looking for.
