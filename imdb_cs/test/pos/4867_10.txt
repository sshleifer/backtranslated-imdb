This second pairing of Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner is great first. Maybe predictable, but I don't care and still laugh so much whenever I see it. Wile E./Road shorts have always had the best place in my heart. So when I knew that the second Gold Collection disc would not only contain eleven of this, but would be in chronological order (2-12, the first episode was on volume 1), it made me misty. I love these things. This short animated movie can be seen on Disc 2 of Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2. It also includes an optional commentary from Micheal Barrier. <br /> <br /> My Class: A +
