Drawn by Pain is simply one of the best movies I've ever seen. Here are my reviews of episodes released so far: The episode one was even better than I expected, and I expected quite a bit of everything I heard about it. I am already very impressed by the actors. His father was scary and he played perfectly. The little girl is so expressive that she uses her eyes to express such emotions. The animation was excellent. The camera was amazing, every camera angle perfectly captured the scene. The adjustments were so good that each scene goes smoothly to the next. Music captured the emotions pretty well and pulled you into the story. I just can't say enough about how wonderful this episode was. Surely it will encourage my desire for more! Episode 2 was even better than the first! All I said about the first episode, going through, just you can learn more about character development. I can't wait to finally see episode 3, or the rest of the show. What is evolving is an interesting story-driven story with all the pitfalls of big Hollywood production, but without bias. So much is said, so few words. This series is something you've never seen and sat down to be a real success. <br /> <br /> This episode was FREAKING AWESOME! No other words describe it! WOW! All I said about previous episodes is for this episode, and yet it was even better! I don't know how you can do something amazing and do it even better! Further development of the character proves that it is a completely built piece. Cinematography stands out as it always has and attracts you to Emily's pain, fear, hatred and emotional roller coasters. I can't wait to see episode 4 ... or the rest of the show. You have really overcome yourself! Just like I loved other episodes, episode 4 is still the best. I love the character's progress. I feel that we know Emily, her pain and her inner struggle. Other topics that I have mentioned in previous reviews continue. LARGE Cinematography, writing is great, actors are right on their pictures and built their characters and animation is just amazing! Another great job from the DbP crew!
