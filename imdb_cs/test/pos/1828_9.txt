Bonny Hunt has revolutionized her directorial debut. Minnie Driver and David Duchovny have something indescribable called chemistry. Sure, the plot is unlikely, but it doesn't stop one of this movie. Carroll O'Conner does a great job as Grace's grandfather. Other great actors play their friends on the card. Jim Belushi is cheerful as Meganu's descending husband, who is part of a wider family. Loyalty, family and marriage are respected. Several sexual references and salty words are used, but in context and with subtle humor. And in the background, that wonderful Dean Martin melody - "Return to Me". <br /> <br /> Recommended.
