I really wanted to write a title for this review that didn't look like scaly or gushing but still described my feelings for this show. I see it is not possible. The "American Family" is one of the best shows I've ever liked on television. Several reviewers mentioned the word "beautiful" here on IMDb to describe this show. Never was the word more appropriate. The camera for this show is amazing. Every scene and shot looks like a masterpiece. The light, the camera moves, the composition of the scene and the colors ... I have to remember that I'm watching a TV show and not a movie. Lee Holdridge and Nathan Wang scores bring tears to my eyes. Most importantly, it is an honest and honest performance. I don't feel like watching a performance ... I feel like I'm watching real life. If this beautiful life were just a real life. <br /> <br /> The "American Family" on TV really raised the bar for quality entertainment. I highly recommend this show to anyone who is willing to watch it. I could easily chase CBS for giving this show, but I have to say that it doesn't matter who broadcasts it. I'm just glad she's out there to see him. So I thank PBS for not allowing this exhibition to disappear into nothingness. I have to give special recognition to the way the final of each season is over. The first was a purely creative brilliance and it brought me to tears. I was expecting whether the second season would end in a creative way and certainly. Tears again. <br /> <br /> Thanks to everyone involved. You really did a special art piece with this show, and I honestly think so. It is a pity that we have only two seasons, but we have received the miracle at all.
