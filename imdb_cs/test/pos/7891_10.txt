I finally saw the real reason Peter Boyle became famous. It wasn't a monster in "Young Frankenstein" or being a free Frank Barone on "Everybody Loves Raymond". For younger people who only know him from television, try this movie, Frank makes it a saint. "Joe" is Boyle in his best acting role and as someone mentioned, he most likely gave the inspiration for "Archie Bunker" to "All In The Family". I think Boyle went back to "Joe" to play Frank. (I say this because I noticed that the basement of both "Joe" and Frank Barone look similar.) <br /> <br /> When I checked it out of the library, I didn't know anything about this movie, I knew Boyle and Susan Sarandon was presented. Yes, Susan looks great here and a very good early role for a young actress. The young hippie wants to be who escapes parents at home and lives with him, the ultimate lost in the drug-induced haze of hippie who also sells as much as he buys. After almost deadly overcharging on too many pills, she is hospitalized while her parents go to collect her stuff, her mother wont go to smelly, run an apartment, but her father does. While Dad collects his stuff, her boyfriend returns home and two exchange words, and then his father does what later we hear Joe likes to do a hippie. Joe shoots his mouth on how he hates different cultures / races, hippies, and a list of others' laundries. When he says, "I'd really like to kill one of them", Father (trying to look like he's kidding) says, "I did it". Joe almost buys him, then takes it as funny. Later, when the police are on the scene and the story is in the newspaper, Joe realizes he's not kidding. Instead of bringing a rich man to blackmail for money, he is actually blackmailing him. Just by wanting him and his wife to "know" his and his wife. The long story short of their association is embarrassing, but after Sarandon gets the wind out of what her father did, there is a risk of falling out. <br /> <br /> How it all plays at the end you'll have to watch for you. While it's over 35 years, the end is something you wont expect. If you haven't seen the movie before. Again, I recommend especially for those who have not seen it. 10 stars for Boyle not only play someone completely the opposite of his character, but for what others will show to be more than just a TV and a movie comedy actor. (END)
