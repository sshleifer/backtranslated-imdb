Often regarded as Argento's latest "big" movie, this entry into the giallo canon is undoubtedly better than any Argento movie that followed him (although I haven't seen "Mother of Tears"), but telling his last "big" movie can be stretch a little. The directorial and stylistic flourishes - the hallmark of all Argento films - are truly present, with some of his tense sequences ranking among the best ("peephole" sequence is exceptionally memorable), and Ronnie Taylor's cinematography is excellent (fluorescent lighting is beautiful). However, the story that is hit and missing in all Argento films is missing. There is a really strong sense of mystery and intrigue, but the plot resorts to what is essentially a chain of murderous sequences, with one by one, leaving no real time to fully build the right, focused secrets to be resolved. All this results in a climax that is ... well ... anti-climatic because the film did not invest enough interest to really interest us. Regardless, it is only recommended because of the master's direction and beautiful images that Argento evokes. I would not recommend it as a starting point for Argento movies (however, I recommend either "Deep Red" or "Suspiria"), but if you like it or even some giallo, then it is a very good addition to your repertoire.
