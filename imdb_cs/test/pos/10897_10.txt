GoldenEye is a masterpiece. The plot is amazingly depicted, the characters beautifully animated and weapons are tyte. The storyline is so interesting, even if you complete every single mission to get more levels, you have to beat them on higher difficulty. The multiplayer mode is so typical. Choose the weapons you want to play with and then play. Me and my friends and my brother always play Goldeneye. If you don't have this game, I suggest you buy it.
