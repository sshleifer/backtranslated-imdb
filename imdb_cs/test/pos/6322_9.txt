A variation of the same plot line was used in an episode of Simon and Simon (Thin Air) that originally aired in December 1982. <br /> <br /> The victim's sex was changed, the surviving husband's one of Rick's "old flames". It is also interesting to note that Gerald McRaney had a role in this episode of Rockford. Both episodes were based on the story of Howard Brown - as shown in the 'Credits' list. Anthony James plays one of his classic roles on television. The continuation of the concept between Rockford and Magnum PI Simon and Simon is interesting.
