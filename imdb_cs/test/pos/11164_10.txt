I just saw this movie in preview and I can only recommend it. It was about 90 minutes and when it was over, I felt it could take hours. The protagonists' stories are so realistic and you feel really at home. The film basically consists of dialogues, but I didn't bored for a minute. 18 people of really different characters and each of them behaved so well. I had to laugh, feel embarrassed, sad and still feel lucky. All in all, it is a film that shows the different kinds of people in our society, the way they communicate and how love has changed and is now being treated as an economic thing. Dating becomes something that is similar to bankruptcy. The whole audience loved it. Please watch if there is a possibility. You'll love it!
