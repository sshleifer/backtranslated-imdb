Lady and Tramp II: Scamp Adventure is a great movie that many kids today can really relate to. It is a well-presented story of a boy who longs for freedom to do things in his own way and how to gain this freedom is just part of what makes this film interesting. It is enough to forget the most beautiful disappointments, such as the fact that in this film there were only adults based on the look of the pups, because it is only 0.5% or less of the amazing effect of the film on the viewer. Great music, live performance, talented animation and direction and a powerful story tells the story of the difference between freedom in the streets of New England and a cozy home with family. And no matter how bad things seem, your family and friends are "always there" to help you, even if no tight place. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to get into the soundtrack!
