I don't see how a film of this quality gets an average of 5.7 from IMDb voters. It is a classic Australian production that resembles recent efforts such as LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPES, SUGAR FACTOR, STYLE STORIES LANGUAGE, RUSSIAN DOLL, SAMPLE OF PERSONS, SECRET LIFE US, LA SPAGNOLA, STRANGE PLANET, FRESH AIR, SWITCH OFF, TIME TIME FOR PATSY CLINE, etc ..., as a 19-year-old uni-student (Newton, possibly in his best role, at least at CHANGI level) with a bored, over-religious mother gets a shock of his life when he decides to enroll in the same course like him - and before you start to think OTHER GOOFY MOVIE, it's not like that, here's some real essence. Sure, it's a simplistic view of life in general and art students, especially (but then are they simplistic for all those philosophical mumbo-jumbo, aren't they?), And maybe even studying the character of Sinead Cusack is sometimes a bit confused. But the movie is bright, fun and has some important news. The cast is amazing: Cusack and Newton are amazing and Rose Byrne (see also The Goddess OF 1967) is so underestimated that it's not funny. She is a beautiful, fresh, confident actress who deserves every award she receives. I gave MY MOTHER FRANK 8/10.
