This film is amazing because the fact that real people portray themselves and their real life experiences and do such a good job is as if they have lived the past again. Jia Hongsheng himself plays an actor who has left everything except music and drugs struggling with depression and looking for a sense of life while being angry with everyone, especially the people who care for him most. There are times when you want to cry because the family, especially the father, did such a good job. However, this film is not for everyone. Many people who suffer from depression understand Hongsheng's problem and why he does things he does, such as closing in a dark room or going for walks or cycling alone. Others might see the film as boring, because it's so real that it's almost like a documentary. Overall, this film is great and Hongsheng earned an Oscar for this film, just like his father.
