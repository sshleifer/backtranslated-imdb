I first saw this film at Alaska Airlines and since then I have seen it twice. It's just - and it's just - one of the best movies in years. I found out that I enjoyed it after my first observation, but somewhat cloudy what happened. After learning again a few weeks later, things began to fit. It wasn't confusing, just deep. In fact, the depth of the film may not be much appreciated. For example, it occurred to me after my third review that Sammy Davis Jr Jr (Grandfather's Dog) is more than just a pet - maybe it's for his dead wife. Witness to protect her cruelly. There is symbolic joy and none of it is either polite or benevolent, just real. The adventures of their journey keep the story in perpetual motion, and even when they arrive, you're not sure if it's really a goal. As the film goes on, adventure and I have a sense that the goal is just a point of travel. The soundtrack is a fun, scenic impression - and both are definitely Eastern blocks. I could go on and on about the deeper meanings in the movie, but I'm not quite sure if I found all these nuances. Besides, it's more fun to crush them. How can any movie be "Everything is lit" turned out to be a fine wine that will sweeten over time. I highly recommend to see it - twice.
