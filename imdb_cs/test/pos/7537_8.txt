About as happy as the British comedy in the 1950s, THE BELLES OF ST TRINIAN'S has almost a gag minute ... and for 91 minutes it makes a great time. Other films I recommend at the same time are TITFIELD THUNDERBOLT and GREEN MAN. In fact, every movie with Alistair Sim or Terry Thomas, George Cole, Richard Wattis or Joyce Grenfell or any combination is a pleasure. in ST TRINIAN'S we get a double dose of Sims who play two roles, throwing himself into his face with his cheerful contempt. Joyce Grenfell as Ruby Gates (oh dear! That name!) She plays her "merry hockey sticks" constant-incognito to merry perfection. Perhaps the best laugh comes from George Cole as Flash Harry (who comes from the bushes when he whistled) and various visits to Mrs. Fritton's (Sims) reactive to explosions ("Oh poor Betty!") Or a science lab. "Just send a few bottles to my room". Each part of the movie is funny from characters, their costumes, opposites and settings, but it continued, but the first three are the best: including this one, BLUE MURDER ON ST TRINIAN'S and later in BIG ST TRINIAN'S TRAIN ROBBERY.
