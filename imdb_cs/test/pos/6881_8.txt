An excellent film featuring Anthony Wong, who certainly lives up to his name. An erotic but increasingly violent courtesy of dreams purchased from a crazy occultist who quickly turns into nightmares of some extent when the wizard gets in to manipulate the poor Mr. Wong. Well filmed and very fast moving it is a non-stop story of serious magic, herbal remedies, power and corruption, but it also makes time for some fine sex scenes and some very bloody violence. There is also just a little touch of humor now and again to catch you away from the guards and the whole thing makes for the most exciting 90 minutes or so. Excellent performance all the time.
