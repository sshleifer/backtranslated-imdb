This film has some somewhat shocking scenes and the thing to consider it was made in 1971. Clint Eastwood, Geraldine Page, and Elizabeth Hartman do an excellent job in the film as well as all cast members. The film begins during the Civil War, when a wounded Yankee soldier, Johnny, portrayed by Clint Eastwood, takes refuge and assistance at a girls' academy in the south. The headmaster, Mrs. Farnsworth (Geraldine Page), one Edwin teacher (Elizabeth Hartman), and a small group of grown girls were without a man in their midst, maybe too long. While their loyalty was in the Confederacy - their emotions and physical needs certainly led them in the opposite direction. Johnny immediately uses his male spell to try to win the women to his side - and keep them from keeping him to the patrols. Nevertheless, the feelings previously caused by incestuous behavior, adultery, brutal rape and inexperience of adolescents combined with jealousy - will turn things upside down with some unexpected consequences for both Johnny and the school. <br /> <br /> 10 Stars
