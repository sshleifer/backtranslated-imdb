This must be one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Merhige has created a vivid painting that evolves with terrible violence, sex and minimalist narration of the life of Jesus Christ. The high contrast and thick grain layer casts doubt on what you sometimes see, but the use of texture combined with extreme contrast creates an incredible viewing experience. This film is not for everyone. I think you have to have an open mind and not be so quick to condemn this film for its content, which, if it is extremely harsh but makes it a relatively important statement about creation, to God and humanity. Whether this film is a work of art or a basket of shock values ​​is open to discussion.
