The spectacular Greta Garbo is the best of her first talkie. She gets subtle support from the rest of the cast, which includes Charles Bickford's rugged sailor who captures her heart. Mrs. Garbo gives a great performance because she usually makes an estranged daughter of a naval captain returning after fifteen years. Also in the cast is great actress Marie Dressler. Great movie!
