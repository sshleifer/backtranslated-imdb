Susie Q. is one of those rare and sweet films that give you a pleasant feeling. It's bittersweet but healthy and its characters are fun and captivating. At first I thought the movie would be a clich√© that would bore me after five minutes, but I was wrong. Sometimes it tore me and it was a lot of tempting, which made me roots of good guys. I loved the movie, and I still remember it today, 9 years later !! I recommend it very ANYONE and the film is family-oriented so you don't have to worry about inappropriate content. Indeed, if Disney would show more movies that are up to par as Susie Q., it would be the most popular family oriented channel in the world. If only Disney showed it to be ONE more time! ^ _ ^ Go Susie Q. !!
