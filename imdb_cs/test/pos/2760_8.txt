Graphically it's the same game first, just different levels and some new features added for fun. <br /> <br /> The PS1 version still has the problem of providing enough air for some skaters. The version of the Dreamcast, which is rarely seen, was the best version of the 4 versions (the Xbox finally came out with the 5th with 2x), had clearer resolutions, and the skaters looked better and managed PS1 and N64 in more detail. <br /> <br /> The levels are truly amazing, from the beginning to the end, as well as the school was my favorite, I enjoyed this level so much, not just for a golf cart that would ever run over you but in length. That's what I liked in the first two games, they don't make these games graphically enhanced, just focus on the level of levels, which is fine. <br /> <br /> As good as the first overall, and worth playing.
