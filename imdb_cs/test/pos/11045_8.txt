Simultaneous viewing of both of these films is not a bad idea of ​​getting a sense of early film production and acting for camera styles. I tell Garbo (but not much) about her nature. Robeson is majestic. However, his performance is focused on the great proscenium theater. Something else that struck me was the film's motives for empowering women and minorities. There were no movies from Hollywood that would allow the marginal voices like Anna and Brutus to come to the fore. They were very progressive movies for their time. It is quite likely that O'Neill saw writing on the wall than everyone else about the future of America.
