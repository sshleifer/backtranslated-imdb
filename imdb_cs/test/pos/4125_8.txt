I saw it (video 2000) years ago and I'd like to see it on DVD. Good movie, but I'd like it even more if it included The Beatles and The Hollies etc. <br /> <br /> I don't know exactly how true the story is - were there any changes to make the story dramatic? I was only 3 when Buddy crashed and woke up to his music until the late 1970s. Much later, I found out that our family moved to our new house - yes, February 3, 1959. <br /> <br /> Well ehmell little things you say and do ... His songs will always remember - always. .
