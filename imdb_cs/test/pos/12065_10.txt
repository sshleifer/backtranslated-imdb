A cheerful show with so many great stories that it reflects the world today as we know it in such a humorous way that it literally stole my laughter for other shows. I laughed so hard that I found some other comedy that shows unfair. The unique recognition of each character is a great original technique that just makes fun and very funny. You may think this is an average comedy about hard life with family. This is what I thought at first, but I found it to hold new and unique techniques that completely differentiate from any other average comedy show. Michael Rapaport is a star. I'm sure I wish this show wasn't canceled.
