This is another of many Eastwood movies that blend intrigues, action, and a lot of romance, along with "The Gauntlet," "Firefox," and so on. Clint's range is quite familiar now. In this, he is silent and a little outrageous, especially in women and superiors. There are no surprises in his performance. But the film itself is a surprise; it is above average. Clint is Frank, a secret service agent who may not have caught a bullet that killed JFK at the moment of doubt. He then took to drinking, which drove his family away, and now plods along the bureaucracy until he is contacted by John Malkovitch, calling himself "Booth," who strikes any sort of bevelled relationship with him based on their shared, disillusioned belief it is pointless except for the impulse to escape and predictability. Now it is rather anfractuous set of attitudes for artists like Clint to the project, but he does rather well, less robotic than usual. And he seems to carry with him, like the burden of stone, a memory of that moment in Dallas. He tried again in the middle of this movie. Hanging from the roof of a tall building, he grabbed Booth's hand and pulled out a gun and pointed at Booth, who asks if he was really willing to shoot. If he did, of course, he would save the president from trying to assassinate the CIA, but at the cost of his own life. Booth pulls him out of the situation as he holds his hands in the air. Clint even has a short speech, talking to Renee Russo, about his inability to save the president in Dallas. "If I responded fast enough, I could take it ... and that would be fine with me." It's underestimated, but his voice is slightly choking, his eyes shaking. It's one of the few scenes in any Clint movie that could be properly called "moving". From his newly found decision, we know that this time he will take another chance. (Ironically, he doesn't like the current president. Who could? He in Colorado gives pompous speeches about how they "carved a nation out of the wild." They didn't do the same in Las Vegas?) <Br /> <br /> says the movie is as good as his villain. It is not true, nothing is so simple, but in this case it could be argued for its truth. John Malkovitch with his Tartar eyes is amazing. <br /> <br /> Talk about disillusionment. Okay, he can sit up a bit, sniff with contempt, even though he puts two innocent hunters between his eyes, but he is fascinating on the screen. Renee Russo has little. Fred Thompson, as Chief of the White House, is now in politics, a relief for moviegoers. If Clint's range is limited, Thompson is something less. In every movie he is in, he wears the same festive and dissatisfied expression as if he is constantly plagued by some form of volcanic digestive disorder. The direction of Wolfgang Peterson is as good as it was in "Das Boot, which is pretty good. There's a lot of usual thrilling cross-section in the final shootout. And when Clint and Russo get into a passionate embrace in a hotel room and twisting backwards toward the bed, like two warm weasels, Peterson shows us our feet playfully, along with a number of items that fall to the floor - not just casual clothes, but also handcuffs, weapons, beeps, palm pilots, Dick Tracy wrist watches and more Interrupted, Clint is back on the bed and sighs: "Now I have to put everything in order again." <br /> <br /> Well written and worth a look.
