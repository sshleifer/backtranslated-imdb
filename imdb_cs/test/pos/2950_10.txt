This movie surprised me. I make it a habit to find out the least about movies before attending because the trailers and reviews provide a spoiler after the spoiler. After joining the theater, I knew it was a documentary about a long married couple and that IMDb readers gave it to 7.8 users of Rotten Tomatoes. If anything, this little gemstone SUPPORTS. Filmmaker Doug Block decided to shoot his parents for "offspring", and at the beginning of the film we were working on the necessary interviews with our parents, Mum's open mother and less than my dad, Mike. I immediately found out that this pair was interesting and had no idea where the director (son Mike & Mina Doug) would take us. In fact, I doubt that Doug himself knew where to go! Life unexpectedly turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the way. It's hard to verbalize how I was with this story and in a unique way, as it was said. Absolutely riveting from start to finish, and it really needs to be seen even if you're not a fan of the documentary genre. This film will reflect on your own life and may even provoke memories you thought long forgotten. "51 Birch Street" is one of those rare movie experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves. The best news of all is that HBO had a hand in production, so instead of playing on a limited art scene, millions of people will be able to see this incredible job. BRAVO!!!!!!!!
