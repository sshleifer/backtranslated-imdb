I can't evaluate it well because I can't say I liked it. But it's a story that bothers me, not a movie. Acting, directing, atmosphere, music was good. It's just after you see a lot of people doing things you really can't cover, the film ends. It's an educational way of showing the horrors of war as seen from home, and the way feelings don't make sense at all and are still strong, but that's about it. The land covers several years when the poet Dylan Thomas is taken under the roof of a former ex-girlfriend. He is married, brings his wife and later a child, while ex (Knightley) marries some other guy. But the tension is there, Dylan is a confident jerk and the new husband returns from a home war with a mild PTSD case. Add some temperamental characters to your hands and your hands are full. <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: You have to be "in the mood" like this movie. It's hard to define this mood. I don't think I was in it yet. At all. So it's probably better tracked by adults with an understanding of the strange complex human behavior and perhaps the curiosity of Dylan Thomas.
