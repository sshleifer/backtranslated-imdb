This film was made only 48 years after the end of the Civil War - most likely in anticipation of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war. In the film, there are props of battles and people of the time who look somewhat impressive and realistic. It also provides a different and more balanced view than its current BIRTH OF A NATION - a totally absurd and racist film. For this reason, this short film would be excellent for use in the classroom to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man running away to become a drummer. The boy is good and he is a hero, although the film is rather melodramatic - a certain day convention. It's not a great movie, but a decent plot, decent gameplay and little of the best you've seen in other films of the day. One unpleasant aspect of this movie was the frequent use of title cards to describe or set up the stage for things that were really obvious. From time to time it was annoying.
