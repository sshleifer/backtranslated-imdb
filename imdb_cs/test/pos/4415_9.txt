I was a junior high school when "Flesh" came across big screens but was lucky to see it at midnight in New York movie houses just two years later. Meat is the first part of the so-called "trilogy" of movies, featuring Joe Dallesandro, as the object of desire. It carries the "Warhol" name, but is more of Paul Morissey's work. The story basically touches on the exploitation around one day in the life of a street musician (played by Joe Dallesandro). Joe is young, beautiful and a little naive ... but he managed to bring the bacon home to his wife, for reasons that should not be explained to fully realize the film. Particular attention to film enthusiasts is that this film (along with the remaining two trilogues) had no scenario, per se. Warhol's superstars were simply assumed ... and the words and actions the viewer sees are completely natural (sometimes ridiculous or meaningless). But in everything it works ... "Rolling Stone" commented in his review that the film was better than "Midnight Cowboy", a film of the same year, polished by Hollywood (Oscar winner for best film), with a big name talent (I admire the film anyway ) ... but FLESH, being improvised, was somehow more intestinal rough and realistic, without the need for complicated sub-land and no "cause de celebre" .. or for that matter any cause ever! The film earned more than $ 3 million and was an absolute feeling, especially on the German market (which ironically thought they got a "censored" version of the film for post-edit .... see note below) . Curiously, the movie is very "cut and paste" with "pop". "clicks", "flashes" and dialogue literally cut off in the middle of a sentence. It is almost as if Warhol / Morissey were telling the simple truth that it is a "day in life" superstar, snippets for your voyeuristic tendencies. Far better than earlier Warhol's 8-hour sleeping and statue of liberty as a 20+-hour movie. FLESH, in my opinion, is the first of Warhol's films that is truly digestible (due to its wide range) and Warhol's first legitimate reaction to the Hollywood phenomenon of "fame". As the first of the "trilogy" to portray a young, desirable male icon, naive, searched, he responded to the invitation to please his family. Subsequent films would show "the same character" with a different set of values. (See "Basket" and "Heat")
