Fortunately for Bill Murray, it's such a light project because he has to carry it. Meatballs are the story of a low-rent Northstar camp and how its advisors deal with campers. Then there are many of their rich rivals across the lake named Mohawk Camp, which culminates in a two-day Olympics. Above all, Bill Murray is clowning around and making a pretty memorable movie debut. The movie is sprinkled with medium-sized laughter, laughter, and more than a few guffaws along the way. The biggest laugh comes from jokes played by the nerdy director. Three of them include counselors who move their bed outside in different places while sleeping. Morty, or "Micky", as everyone calls him, wakes up along the road, in some trees a few meters above the ground, and finally floats on a raft in the middle of the lake! There are also some funny moments that include counselors hitting at each other, but this is a PG rated movie with little in the way of raunchiness. The film takes a serious note involving a shy camper named Rudy who plays Chris Makepeace. Of course, it depends on Murray to teach the child how to open and give him the confidence he needs to run the marathon during the Olympics. Rudy's sentimental situation seems to be largely deployed. Notice how the first time Murray sees a child sitting alone in the grass after getting out of the bus, he tells him: "You must be the short depressed boy we ordered." Wondering if this line was really in the script or Murray was just ad-libbing while the cameras were rolling. In other words, Murray could also say Makepeace, "you must be the actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely child you see in most of the summer camp movies that don't fit." But before it ends, Murray's performance makes this conspirator more than bearable. He really seems to have some good chemistry with Makepeace. The film culminates in games between two rival camps. Very few events we've shown are even slightly believable, but "it just doesn't matter". It's a pretty good movie on many levels. Don't let the absurd assessment of this film scare you at the moment. Murray will always laugh at you. Just be warned ..... avoid sequel !!!! Especially the one with Corey Feldman! 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Hound.
