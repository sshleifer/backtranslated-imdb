I am a sociologist / anthropologist specializing in the field of symbolic interactionism, and I must say that this film shows high quality in the symbolic context of the whole film. To anyone who has not seen it, I recommend that you also read "The Male Search for Perfect Meaning" by Victor E. Frankl. I think you'll be able to draw some amazing correlations. As I said, I would like to say that, despite the fact that the main characters are gay, it's not a story about being gay. This is the story of finding and finding the meaning of life, despite the difficulties and challenges, the pain and the terror that stand in the way. This is the story of finding and finding balance and integrity and happiness.
