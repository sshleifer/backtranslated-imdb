The Missing Star, which competed for the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 2006, is a film that when you think is the first adjective that comes to mind: intense. The intense appearance, intense sequence, intensity of this film captures the viewer from the first scenes in the steelworks, Italy (I couldn't recognize the city, maybe Genoa or even Naples), although the pace is slow. Vincenzo Buonavolont√†, the male chief, and with it, all viewers, sees a completely different China than the normal Western leaders: a horrible high-rise building with about 800 apartment owners, skyscrapers, wasteland, fog, scrapers and cranes everywhere, but also the beauty of the Yangtze Kiang River, which will soon become a great lake because of a controversial dam that will erase many cities. China is a country under construction, but there is still poverty, backwardness and unfair laws in all these colossal public works. This story is easier to access, because Gianni Amelio, a senior director, has chosen two phenomenal leadership: Sergio Castellitto, a well-known actor in Italy, and a Chinese surprise Tai Ling, a pretty unknown girl who gives an equally intense interpretation as Castellitto. The film is not perfect, there and there are some shortcomings, but that doesn't mean it's an average movie. Try to see it.
