This is certainly one of the best Western films made in the new millennium. It's a tribute to all the stars of the great Western Western classics and it's the ultimate revival of Western film. The story of two brothers who meet after the war between states and end up on different sides of the law is nothing new, but interesting, and shootings and atmosphere are great. There is some graphic violence, such as bad guys chopped to death with an ax or women are shot down in cold blood, and Lee Majors are not participating in the event until the very end, that's why I gave it 9 out of 10 points. But it's still one of the best new Western productions I've ever seen. I had the pleasure and pleasure of meeting Chris McIntyre at the West Festival and having fun with him, and I had the opportunity to meet Buck Taylor, who plays the role of an urban doctor. In my opinion, we should be very much obliged to Chris McIntyre for his efforts to gather many stars of classic TV westerns and SASS around him to perform in a new western style. Chris has an excellent talent for choosing the right actors for the main characters. They are both young and promising, and I think we should see them in future Western productions. I sincerely enjoyed this Western movie - it was worth every minute. I hope Chris McIntyre will continue to work on other Western movies and will present some other great productions like this. Great job, Chris! Jasper P. Morgan Pete
