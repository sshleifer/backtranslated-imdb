It's about time "Kate Jackson" has his credit for this movie .., I can remember watching it and trying to understand it on TV .., my grandmother lay in bed dying of cancer and I was barely 15 I couldn't find only after years of Richard's death did I miss other shows / films in which he was. I still have a copy of VHS tape, but it's NOT "CC'd" or closed captioning for hearing impaired & that's the only mistake in a movie that I remember or know to this day ... I wasn't able to find a DVD or VHS copy that has sub-titles in English even. If any of them know about copying on VHS or DVD that is CC'd or has English subtitles, please let me know. thanks - Cofffeenut
