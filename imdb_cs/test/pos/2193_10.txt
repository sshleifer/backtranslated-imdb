Last night I saw my videotape for the last ten years. I found the job itself and the performance as well as in my memory. Of course George Hearn was the master of Sweeney's role; in his determination to avenge those whom he believes, his wife does not die and his daughter's disappearance; at least not to the end when he finds that his thirst for revenge led him to murder his wife. Angela Lansbury, on the other hand, creates a more complex view as Mrs. Lovett. She understood that Sondheim wanted this role to be something of a "comic" counterpart to Sweeney; and even brings some tenderness to her courtship by Sweeney and her upbringing of Tobias. For those who have long memories, this performance will return to their debut performances at The Picture of Dorian Gray and Gaslight; long before the murder, she wrote. A year ago I saw a musical at the Lyric Opera in Chicago. with current opera star Brynn Terfel as Sweeney. Others commented on the operative quality of the score. My conclusion is that "Sweeney" works better with actors who can at least handle vocal lines than with opera artists who have limited acting skills. As a final note, I commend the performer who portrayed Tobias. with his mixed loyalty and confusion about what's going on around him. It seemed appropriate to have almost the last word.
