I enjoyed this program immensely. It is extremely well written, with finely evaluated performances and clever visuals. It's so honest and sincere, refreshing compared to the drug disinfection in movies and television. <br /> <br /> Inadmissible - one of the best TV shows of recent years and triumph on all scales for channel 4. <br /> <br /> 9/10
