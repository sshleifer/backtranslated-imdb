Probably the best horror movie in 5 years .. there was a lame remake, attempts to frighten you (when all you do is go out of the theater) and movies that just shouldn't be made. but this is worth it. The only reason I didn't give it is 10 because Paris Hilton is in it (but her death scene is for that, believe me) .. <br /> <br /> .. here are .. SPOILERS all scenes death in the film. 1. my favorite scene of death - Paris Hilton! after discovering that her boyfriend Blake had laid down with a knife protruding from his neck, Paige starts running. well, walking speed is more decent. he finds it as a garage with all these cars in it. then (one of) the killers cut off the ankle from below (all that time holding a huge metal tip) so it throws and runs and hides behind that car. the killer picks it up and, looking through the window, throws it through the window and shoots it across the forehead. I NEVER ALSO ALSO OUT OF LIFE ALSO OUT OF LIFE NEED THAT I NEVER HAVE ALSO. . Paige's friend, Blake, gets a knife in his throat, and then the killer approaches him (while the HES on the ground), and the footsteps push him further into his throat. <br /> <br /> 3. Elisha cuthbert (carly) (one of EVER's hottest chicks) will not die PHEW, but she gets her lips super-glued together, punching her face, and gets a portion of her index finger chopped off (yeah, I felt like lifting 4. Carly's twin brother nick also survive but not without his ass kicked and stab wound on his leg. 5th nicks best friend Dalton gets thrown down the staircase, and then is decapitated. his body is pulled away and we see how his eyes blink .. then he gets into the wax. and on 2 occasions his skin is accidentally removed, revealing his ugly bloody body.YUMMY. <br /> <br /> .. so that's for sure we're their money.
