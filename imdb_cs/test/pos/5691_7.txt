This low budget crocodile movie really delivers goods. The fact that it was inspired by real events would mean little if you ended up with a fake-looking crocodile, a bad C.G.I. Fortunately, none of the above is associated with this amazing, realistic film. The crocodile is real, there is no C.G.I and filming on the spot takes place in a real Australian swamp. The actors were obviously inspired to create as much realism as possible in their performances and succeed. You can confront their difficulties, which shows how realistic "black water" translates fun. Highly recommended. - MERK
