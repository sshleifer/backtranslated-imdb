Since it is too late and I lack the vocabulary, I will describe this film as "beautiful and heartbreaking," begging the forgiveness of those who crouch in such clich√©s. Robin Tunney has amazing work depicting a young woman in the clutches of the tourette syndrome - her character was absolutely honest and persuasive, and I'll follow her career wherever it goes for this movie.
