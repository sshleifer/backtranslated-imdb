Captain and Tennille have released a very good 3 DVD package with minimal editing. Unlike most different versions, these shows were not hacked to bits. Music and dance numbers are part of the parody as well as during the first broadcast. I believe that some of the music numbers on the DVD may be edited to exhibitions that did not appear to be original, but could not verify the suspicion. I've noticed a few discrepancies between what's on DVD and the program information I found on the internet. I was not able to verify that the information was inaccurate or whether the musical performances were edited on DVD shows. Whatever the truth, I greatly appreciate the efforts made by the manufacturing company. I wish that each variety issued had the same format as the format. I think about half of the broadcast broadcasts are included. I believe that at exhibitions that were not included, they encountered rights issues. Hopefully these issues can be resolved and Volume 2 can be released sometime in the future. There are some individual music videos along with a dance rehearsal among the extras. I recommend this DVD to every C&T fan.
