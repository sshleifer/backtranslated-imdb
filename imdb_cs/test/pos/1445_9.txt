Otto Preminger was one of the greatest Maverick directors. As John Huston, he was one of his own films, such as Mr. Huston, who was an amazing ham that accidentally slipped in and out of the show, but the final product of his work was his own. With a few exceptions, films are now made by corporations, not by individuals, and as a result, they are usually highly polished "packages", a product that is just like a golf ball, a can of dog food, or a motor vehicle. involving people in the process is almost random. Such is the appetite for a product that seems to be an endless array of finished, shiny, superficially entertaining but ultimately empty movies that flood countless TV channels and movies. There is no time for a person like Mr Preminger to put a little away from the stream of "product" and craft personal artwork. Of course, there has always been "Art for art's sake" in filmmaking, but now "Ars Gratia Artis", in all but the name, has been sent to the history of editing. Today Otto Preminger would be lucky to get a pizza job in Hollywood. Half a century ago, when he created an immensely influential, "Laura", "Where the Sidewalk Ends" and "The Moon is Blue", he began filming the controversial novel by Nelson Algren, "The Man with the Golden Shoulder" in his eccentric and individualistic style. street, stayed in the studio and used stylized almost expressionist sets, quirky casting (Mr. Frank Sinatra - hot from his success in "From here to eternity", young, inexperienced but breathtaking beautiful lady) Kim Novak and Mr. Arnold Stang, a man whose peculiarities were after his own heart) and a notable era - defining the score of Elmer Bernstein featuring the West Coast cream of jazzmen. Otto Preminger has always been a versatile experience that should have been considered as a whole rather than divided into acting, directing, photography. What appeared on screen was Preminger's vision, his work, and his interpretation of Algren's novel, not Algren's novel, any of the twenty competent Hollywood hacks made it. Since the first hi-hat cymbal beat that accompanies Saul Bass's iconic succession, we have been drawn into Preminger's march to what is now called "Life," in fact the dark area occupied by cheaters, junkies, cops, drug dealers, stony gamblers, Jazz musicians, their women and hangers-on.The lines are blurred in "The Life", and it's a dog eating her dog down. Residents circulate as sharks seeking signs of weakness to be exploited. Frankie Machine (Mr. Sinatra), a professional card dealer, a former drug addict and a jazz beginner, was born as a victim. While he kicks the habit of going cold turkey there are absolutely no guarantees that he won't go straight back on it further down the line. The depiction of Mr. Sinatra's drug addict in cruel resignations has divided critics, but the fact is that fifty years later most of us have never seen such a thing in real life, so we don't know exactly how to display it. he was very overwhelmed, I watched it recently on the video, it seemed to be harsh, hammy. Perhaps he is the victim of his own success, as many actors subsequently "do" the cold turkey, with the past years, took his performance and refined it somewhat. Arnold Stang is exceptional as Machine Sparrow, a feat that has only crossed in "Is It Crazy, Mad, Mad, Mad World". Try it on the big screen and look at it as a true visionary filmmaker, a giant among today's pygmies - Otto Preminger.
