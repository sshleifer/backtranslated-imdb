"Everything is illuminated" is like viewing a fine piece of museum quality. Absolutely floods emotions with a very wide spectrum. Jonathan Safran Foer plays respectfully Elijah Wood. Looking for her paternal heritage in Ukraine. His travels bring him into contact with Alex, playing very well with the extreme humor of Eugene Hutz. His grandfather is the most emotional link to this film and is aptly portrayed by Boris Leskin. If you find little humor in human characters in this movie, then just turn to Mikke, the real dog Alex and his grandfather calls Sammy Davis Jr.. Jr. They are also called "seeing bitch". Cinematography is magnificent. Colors are a very important part of the film mosaic. It's a film that is worth time and emotional investment.
