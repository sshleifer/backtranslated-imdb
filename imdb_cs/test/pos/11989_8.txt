Amazing, one of my favorite movies down. I guess I can pride myself on the fact that I don't like what the "general people" tend to go. Jackie Mason is cheerful in this movie, so it's Randy Quaid. I can never get enough of his "strong arm" tactics, just like in Moving. He was also notable in National Lampoon's Christmas Holiday. Love this guy.
