Since 1981 Nintendo has been making great video games like Super Mario and Zelda. Most of the ideas would get bored after 20 years. Nintendo games never seem boring because they always add something new. It went from the Wii arcade games and I hear there's a new Wii version scheduled for release in 2011. The thing that makes Wii games so different is the fact that your actually doing something instead of sitting on the couch and pushing buttons. <br /> <br /> And I have more good news. Super Mario Galaxy 2 will be released in 2010.
