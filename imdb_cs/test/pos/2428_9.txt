I wouldn't be so sure I would accept DNA tests as conclusive evidence against Anna Anderson. First read Peter Kurth's book based on this film. Anna Anderson knew that only the Grand Duchess Anastasia could know (court evidence in Anina's favor). Second, compare the pictures of Anastasia and Anna Anderson. Everyone can see that this is the only person. Third, visit the website of Peter Kurth (below) where you can read detailed information about DNA tests, as well as why Franziska Schanzkowska and Anna Anderson are not the same person (go to the link, "ANNA-ANASTASIA NOTES TO FRANZISKA SCHANZKOWSKA"). Even Schanzkowski's relatives believed that their sister and Anna Anderson were not the same person. I always believe that HIH Anastasia Nicolevna Romanova and Anna Anderson were really the same person; I will never repeat myself. <br /> <br /> www.peterkurth.com
