Can a mentally disabled black youth be a catalyst for the unification of people in South Carolina? The answer seems to be that despite his disability, James Kennedy, he understood much more than what he was given and went to become part of the sports scene. The film also tells how many of us overlook people with problems they can help if we have the patience that Jones has shown to a young man for his own guilt in his heart. "Radio", directed by Michael Tolllin, is a formula film inspired by a real story. Despite the fact that the film is not totally unsuccessful because the director was able to get inspired performance from his amazing cast. Coach Jones is a tool for getting a young man called Radio because of his passion for collecting, engaging in sport, the passion he discovers in this retarded man who has had a hard time in his young life. punches. Coming from a poor environment, Radio, he lives with his mother who protects him and challenges the interests of the coach. Radio is seen as a mascot by schoolchildren, initially his sunny disposition wins everyone's acceptance because he is a good man without an ounce of anger in his body. The film owes much to Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. Mr. Harris, one of the best actors of our time, is never bored in anything he loved with his presence. He gets the essence of a principal coach who sees the possibility of something turning into something that bothers the past. Cuba Gooding Jr. he is also at his best picture of a mentally disabled young man. <br /> <br /> The support cast is excellent. S. Ephata Merkerson, one of the best actresses of her generation, is doing an interesting job as Radio's mother. Alfre Woodard, another good actress plays in college with style. Debra Winger has only a few scenes in the movie. "Radio", while being sentimental, warms one's heart because it shows how we tend to see some people in our society that we know nothing and how quickly we should judge them. Michael Tollin gives us a lot of ideas in the right perspective.
