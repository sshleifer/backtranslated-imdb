The thing is a milestone in filmmaking and remains one of my favorite movies of all time. In spite of the sci-fi film's roots, it's finally a horror movie that brilliantly balances spraying with psychological trauma. Today, over twenty-five years after its release, special effects will stand as an example of total brilliance and the effects that Rob Bottin has suffered a complete physical disorder for his art. It would be impossible to do the same movie today as Studio would definitely insist on casting a female character or Paul-Walker type. All-American American scientific team in Antarctica are thrown into confusion when an alien lifeform capable of perfectly absorbing and imitating other lifeforms infiltrates their camp. Their confidence is constantly falling apart because they are increasingly unsure of who is real and who is the imitation, and this "body-hunter" scenario sees that their numbers are falling one by one, being the victims of The Thing. When curved, manifested as another frightening creature, metamorphosis is always terrible and persuasive. help achieve these goals. Long hours of darkness and rising snow provide a bleak background of horror. Director John Carpenter has chosen with great care the team of brilliant actors, and each team member fits perfectly with the role he plays, be it a young and street chef, an older and wise doctor or a bitter and cynical pilot. The point is that nobody here is so close that he is an American badas superhero with blond locks and a six-pack. People who are on the screen are recognizable in our daily lives. <br /> <br /> The thing remains consistently pleasant and influences even after repeated inspections. I have seen the film on more than twenty separate occasions and is steadfast in the direction of direction, acting and special effects. My girlfriend prefers a spin-off movie in high school - the Faculty - which is good and solid fun, but much happier and whiter. She still loves and acknowledges the brilliance of The Thing, and thanks for that ... Because I couldn't stay in the company of someone who doesn't love this movie. <br /> <br /> Classic and then some.
