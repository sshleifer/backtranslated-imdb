I was hooked on "GG" from mid 2001-2002 (2nd season) when I tuned in to see "Smallville" 10 minutes early. Thanks to "Beginning" I now have all the two episodes on the tape, up to the last night (Ep. 4.9). I'm a middle-aged man, and that's just a week-long TV show I'm watching. I love this series because: a) Lauren Graham is a damn pretty woman, funny and smart to start; b) dialogue is very well written; c) It's a hilarious and hilarious way to overdo garbage like "Everyone Loves Raymond" to shame. Many contemporary television comedies have been heavily influenced by the very successful and despised slime-pit known as "Married to Children", where the viewer is encouraged to stand up and feel superior to the characters. In "GG", characters have mistakes, but we can see our own weaknesses in them, and laugh with them, not with them. This is a stimulating television where writers urge us to keep up with the rapid exchange of fires and links to pop culture / literature / current events. I get immense pleasure in watching these episodes over and over again, catching all the monolayers and links to previous episodes. Stars Hollow is his own little world, the one that will happily continue visiting as long as the series runs.
