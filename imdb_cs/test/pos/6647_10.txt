I do not remember a film that so skillfully shows the emotional destruction of a war that is reflected in a single marriage relationship. The film focuses on the connection between Ullman and Von Sydow - both in each scene. In the course of the film they experience a change of role - one has the power of survival and the other is limited to the emotional escape through dreams. Both lose the scale of mankind, but one more than the other. The characters and viewer go through a period of fluctuation in proximity - the camera goes and goes, the sound disappears, the words are lost, only to return the camera to the details of its expressive stars. Confusion and fluctuation can make this movie difficult for some viewers, but that's all under the guise of Master Bergman. I think the use of "false" war makes the film timeless, as relevant as today, and by focusing on human relationship through war, the film is relevant to everyone. A couple could be anyone. The film is not grounded in place or time, but rather in emotions. A unique and effective war film, unlike others. Bergman's films are virtuoso in the presentation of human relationships - that he would bring it into a war film that is masterful.
