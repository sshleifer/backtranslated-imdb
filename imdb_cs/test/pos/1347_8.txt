My friends and I saw a movie last night at Austin at the AGLIFF Film Festival. This movie was one of the best I've seen this year. It was a great comedy - very original and cordial - and FUNNY AS HELL! All in the audience laughed throughout the film. Texas is a big state - with a lot of small cities - and of course a lot of teenagers who grew up like "fat girls". I know that many people will relate to this film on a personal level. Ashley Fink and Robin de Jesus were amazing - they were so big in these roles, it was like a script was written with them. And speaking of the script, it was very well written (very believable), and Ash is a great actor (his facial expressions deafened me). It's an independent movie - but don't be fooled ... It's good! Seeing this caliber of work from someone so young is really inspiring.
