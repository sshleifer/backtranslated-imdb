This film works at many different levels. It's a profile of one very cool couple, a social commentary on aging and nursing homes, a love story, a musical. I saw Uncle Frank a couple of times and every time I looked at him, I'm not sure who's to call first - my parents, my wife, a friend with whom I lost contact. . But it has a way to remember the most important relationships in your life - and you want to reaffirm those that continue. Expect a lot of laughter and probably some tears, if any of the living characters hear a chord. I'm sure you do.
