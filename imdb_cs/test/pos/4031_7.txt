This movie is not really a 1949 remake of O'Brien (which is excellent). He borrows the main space - one has been poisoned and the rest of the film is trying to find his killer. But I like that the writers chose instead of a private bird as the protagonist of the English professor. The land is also completely original. The film generally moves fast enough to wake you up. But what Mars this movie is a strange dated quality about it (probably due to the terrible 80's original musical score) combined with the affected "noir" feeling. Dennis Quaid smiles inexplicably throughout the film at special moments, but is still convincing. Meg Ryan is fine as a student helper / love interest. When the movie gets a little bad when Dex (prof.) Meets a British bodyguard and their fights are pretty ridiculous. The bodyguard works for a rich widow (played by beautiful Charlotte Rampling), but these scenes are too confidently "noir" to help the film together, though the family "plot" is quite interesting. Also, Dex still appears in the same place and finds this bodyguard, which is rather random. In the second part of the film, a man is shot through the window and you can see him jump out of the outside - that was a bad direction. But apart from some of these obvious shortcomings, I think he's still fine. Certainly I did not anticipate the end, so it was good - it is a twist, and although some posters think they were deceived, I thought it was a good and believable end. Dennis Quaid, with his strange smirk and black eyes, is more sympathetic to The Right Stuff, Great Balls of Fire, Inner Space, and Cold Creek Manor. But here, like Dex, he should be somewhat jerky, so he did it well. Pretty decent movie.
