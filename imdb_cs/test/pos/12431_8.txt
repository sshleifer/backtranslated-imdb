Beautiful woman, backwoods, inbred monster man, super sweet monster truck, road kill zombie brother and 2 friends ... one anal retention, too sensitive nerd and another foul mouth, teen teens. Throw them all together with the Jeepers Creepers dash, Texas chainsaw massacre and trip and you have a Monster Man. A hilarious horror / comedy trip that never sets out to "say something". It's a simple, straightforward laugh. This horror / comedy is unpretentious and well done and is in his heart, buddy. This movie offered some funny and disgusting sets. I highly recommend to be afraid of fans who want to have fun.
