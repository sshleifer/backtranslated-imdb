I think I was one of the people who found another of the roth pearls. his performance, as awarded, was overwhelming. The story, which was so aptly told by Ford Ford Coppola 25 years earlier, is gradually developing and leaving the characters to develop. Roeg proves again that it may not be a war that should be interesting. In the most beautiful place lies the story of contrast. Ruthlessnes and beauty go hand in hand while loneliness should become your best friend. This shows a more sinister past of the small golden age kingdom that lands on the coast full of wealth for the 1st Earth globe if u send the right man. All in all, a beautiful directorial film from Nicola roeg wih noble cast.
