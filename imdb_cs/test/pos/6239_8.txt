Despite the stupid premise, ridiculous graphics and low budget, Tourist Trap <br /> <br /> can be striking. Inventive, beautifully scored film, must see. You need to comment on the window to fully appreciate what the director has been trying to do. Also note that this is one of the few semi-classic horror movies that have not been spoiled by a series of sequels.
