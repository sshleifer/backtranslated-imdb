Who ever gave it a review like 'bad taste' is not all quite there ... its funny, brilliant and fantastic you can watch until your eyes are square! not to mention the rest of the work he did in the rest of the series ... everything is as good as Morris's standards. If you think it is "terrible", "disgusting" or "sick", then I can only think of one thing I will tell you: "go to hell". thanks. it had to be said! I think the way so many people complained was a complete joke ... I'd like to make a scream to all the people who actually did it: "you have nothing better with that time? Are you trying to prove it?" on things ... health
