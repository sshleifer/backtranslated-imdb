Although it's a "woman's story", I found it still interesting enough. It is unusual for the sisters to have three sisters in the film! I mean Priscilla, Rosemary and Lola Lane. Why national critics love this film was the presence of bad-boy-rebel John Garfield. In their twisted minds dominated by Liberal, All-American characters are frightening but sour lives, poor types of attitudes like Garfield here are people they can identify with. Yet this film still has a general feeling of goodness, and that's why I liked it. Some characters may have done stupid things, but good hearts. Whose heart was bigger than "Ann" (Priscilla Lane)? I agree that the IMDb commentator comments on critics who say this is Priscilla's film as well as the beloved (not me) Garfield. With Michael Curtiz's caliber director, the film is better than it could be under anyone else. Curtiz made sure that no scene, soap or otherwise, went too long. In addition to Sister Lane and Garfield, we have Claude Rains (who adds much-needed humor to the story), Jeffrey Lynn (the girl's main love interest), Gale Page, Dick Foran, Frank McHugh and Mae Robson. It seems that this movie had to be a hit because it made several spin-offs, neither of them approaching this in content and box office success.
