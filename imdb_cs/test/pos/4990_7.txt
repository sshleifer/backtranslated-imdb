"Comanche Moon" had everything he could. For starters, Simon Wincer is back, the man who's name is synonymous with quality television western. Unfortunately, the "Moon" problems are something even the most talented director can't solve: Bad script based on a faint novel. Forget Historical Accuracy - As every reader of the novels can say The biggest travesty in the "Moon" is that it's not even in line with the information from the original "Lonesome Dove". In the Moon, so many beautiful, rich moments in the miniseries are missing, and even more so in the book. Since most "Moon" viewers are likely to come with at least some "Dove" background, the lack of character-driven and emotional background is downright painful. <br /> <br /> This means that "Month" is one instance where the edited version could be changed to make it more suitable for the screen. For example, the novel "The Moon" focuses mainly on the mosquitoes themselves. Miniseries is trying to get a loan for Comanches, but in the end it only gives them the viewer that they feel they lack some important part of the story. Also, Val Kilmer's Scull is losing it - the role should either be expanded to give Kilmer (and Rachel Griffiths) something to do, or the roles should be limited to smaller support parts. Instead, Kilmer gets the top billing for a character who just lets you scratch his head after his appearance in a totally bizarre final act. There are strange moments in the movie that don't make sense to those who haven't read the book (parrot killer? What?) - there's no single scene to show us that Call and McCrae are close to amazing Texas guards they claim to be. Neither of their moon expeditions (or "Dead Man's Walk," for that thing) ends up successfully, and Call and McCrae seem to go wrong without their mission. Frankly, Larry McMurtry should never get a job writing a script, just because he praises another cowboy movie, Broken Mountain. McMurtry can write good novels (although there is some contradiction over the consistency of this statement), but has never prepared himself as a screenwriter. This production would be beneficial not only to bring director Wincer, but also the original screenwriter Bill Wittcliff to adapt the novel to the screen. Witcliff has no credit on his script, but no one can deny that he has done a fantastic job of going to the original "Lonesome Dove". With all these words, "Comanche Moon" is an almost brilliant production, with the help of an amazing cast, which unfortunately are simply not given enough to do. Gus McCrae's depiction - or rather his depiction of Robert Duvalle as Gus McCrae - is dead. And while some have criticized Karl Urban as a Woodrow Call, he says his performance does not imply the silent, stoic Woodrow of the original film, all I can say is: the McMurtry blame because McMurtry is the one who - as in the "Moon" novel and now a miniseries - he turned Woodrow out of a socially inept, clumsy but natural leader into some emotional character whose lines are only boring and whose character motivations are clear only when you have seen them more appropriately in the "sequel". . It is still the cast that sparkles in the "Moon" to the point that I left the miniseries with such a sense of melancholy that I was looking at the original "Lonesome Dove" - ​​this time because I realized it's probably the last time we see these characters appearing on the screen for a long, long time when they come - and quite frankly, this cast could do so well in a well-developed TV series. All in all, in addition to the unnecessary casting opportunities, the bi ggest travesty is that the original Lonesome Dove novel contained so much rich story for characters that would be fascinating, absolutely fascinating, visible on screen. Unfortunately, all that was thrown aside in favor of a lengthy, inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant McMurtry, prequel.
