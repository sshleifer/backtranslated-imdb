Who other than Troma can take the classic tragedy and turn it into today's standards? Nobody .... in my opinion Leonardo DiCaprio one sucked. Tromeon & Julie is an unambiguous stretch of Shakesperan's original tragedy, but he holds on well. His sick, demented, twisted, yet insanely funny and fulfilling. For the most part, the real story of Romeo and Juliet follows, but many elements of Troma are added. Keenan will be a great performance like Tromeo. Acting is solid and the story is great. Many people look around these movies, not just Kaufman Troma movies, but all those they distribute. Certainly three movies are a flavor, but you have to see some of them. It is a renegade filmmaking at its best.
