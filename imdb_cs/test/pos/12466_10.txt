I don't understand why it is so underestimated on IMDb .. This movie is just perfection .. Better adaptation of all times of Tarzan myth! As French, I can say it's a better role for Christophe Lambert, ridiculous in a lot of movies, but here absolutely amazing, charismatic, incredible! The storyline is great, well said story magnificent, direction, atmosphere, music, all things are perfect! How to trust these sequences with Elgar music, just perfect .. <br /> <br /> Greystoke is a really incredible movie, underrated here, I don't know why, but I really appreciate it
