This is not a walk in the park. I saw it when it came out, and I didn't have the courage to look at it again. You'll never see a scarier or more depressing movie. I felt like I was badly beaten. In what world do we live when we have children who are treated worse than rubbish? This is our world, what we have created, what we could have become. And I would hesitate to say that I-ME-WE is not responsible for that. Babenco woke up this film to shake us into our core and succeed. How can we be cruel or confident or neglected by our children when we see the graphic results of such behavior? It shows us all the accusations that it makes the weakest and least powerful of our society. And if you don't do something every day to prevent it, then you're part of the problem. I am not a religious fanatic, but this film was thinking about the state of my soul.
