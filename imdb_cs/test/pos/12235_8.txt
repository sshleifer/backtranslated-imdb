I cannot argue with other remarks that the story focuses more on the romance between Mary Martin and Allan Jones, much in the sense of "Showboat" than on Victor Herbert's life. But in the 1930s, would it be a box office? Maybe VH music should be instead of VH Life. There is an abundance of this. For me, the excitement of the movie came to the end of the movie when Susanna Foster sings "Earth Romance". It has been more than a decade since I captured this film for the second time in the "old movies" theater. At first, the audience was amazed; then it fell into spontaneous applause. I remember the trembling trembling up and down my spine. My trivia memory recalled the information the local journalist had provided to the interviewing public when the film first appeared in the late 1930s. "The note that hit Miss Foster was far higher than the high C." <br /> <br /> She didn't have to have four octaves and a Lama Yma Sumac, but the teenager was sure enough!
