Despite the fact that this production has received a number of bad reviews, in fact, it is doing quite well. Also note that this is not a BBC program, it was simply licensed to them by Granada Ventures when Jane Austen's collection was released on DVD. So how does it compare with other adaptations of the same novel? The most famous version of these days is the 1995 film with Amanda Root as Anne Elliott and Ciaran Hinds as Captain Frederick Wentworth. Of course, the film was a shorter but good story - the earlier version, with Ann Firbank and Bryan Marshall in the same roles, had four hours to tell the story and move at a quieter pace. Firbank is a good ten years for his role, but he is very good - Marshall is great as Wentworth, a man disappointed with love, and bitter for interference. And hiding in the cast are people who also contribute - Michael Culver, later seen in Cadfael, as Harvill; Richard Vernon, later seen in the Galaxy Trackers Guide, as Admiral Croft; Noel Dyson, formerly at Coronation Street, as Mrs. Musgrove. One criticism I have is that the hairstyles are a little distracting and that the costumes are terrible! However, this should not limit the extremely pleasant adaptation of Austen.
