On the second review, it's still a wonderful romance, which in my opinion is much better than the movie that came with my 2-DVD set, the classic Leo McCarey weepie "Affair To Remember". However, he seems to have lost a bit of favor (only 6.6 on IMDb, and many critics rejected him as a "gooey slush"). How sad it is because it is an intelligent romantic drama with very good work by both leaders, Jennifer Jones and William Holden. The film should be well remembered for beautiful color cinematography and an unforgettable musical score. I don't like Valentine's Day very much, but that gave me an excuse to review this movie again, and I'm glad. While I think Holden's character death is too heavily predicted when tensions are straining from the final scenes, this movie is very moving and I really enjoy it.
