The fact that after fifty years it is still a very watchable movie, he says a lot about it. It is more intelligent and interesting than almost all the latest movies of the same genre you can find and has a sense of innocence on them. I'm not a big fan of this type of movies, but I could watch the whole thing without getting bored, which makes it a good movie that looks at someone who doesn't necessarily share your tastes in movies. I liked the black and white palette, the excellent casting, the clever scene that assures you of the trick to pull on, and the end like everyone else. Watching the heist sequence is aware of the power of silence, which is unfortunately so underused in today's film.
