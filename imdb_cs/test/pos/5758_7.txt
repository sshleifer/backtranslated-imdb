I was looking for this movie as long as I found it, I saw it when I was younger and loved it, after my second browsing I still loved it, and I still. This is a movie of love / hate, if you like bottom, young, comic, then you will find it funny. If you don't like this humor, don't bother. I love this movie and I grew up with these comedy programs, for me this movie is simply placing their comic genius on the big screen. It's not the winner of the prize in any way, but if you just want a good healthy slapstick, then that's it! The film lacks the quality of a TV series, and this is usually the case with movies, but it still has enough material to laugh at you, even though lots of jokes are very similar to their previous work. . yes, humor is a bit childish and not everyone's taste, but sometimes you just need it in the movie.
