No matter how many films are filmed on this subject, there seems to be no shortage of stories emerging from World War II. It is logical that a conflict on a scale such as global warfare would capture the imagination of filmmakers everywhere and give them enough material to base the story on. The circuit, other than most mainstream war films, is Dark Blue World, a film that does not deal with traditional major war battles, does not tell the story of many of its prominent personalities, nor does it target soldiers of all major Allied or Axis powers. Instead, the dark blue world goes to the world of refugee soldiers fighting in exile for their occupied peoples. The film has an amazing job of portraying the challenges faced by Czech pilots flying under the British Royal Air Force, expressing the frustration they felt both in the language barrier between them and among other pilots, but also in being limited from achieving revenge against the Germans until it is trained again. The Dark Blue World also works pretty well outside the arena of war movie as a story of human relationships. The Love Triangle develops between the two main characters and the English woman who complicates the teacher-mentor relationship of the two exiles. This relationship is very well negotiated throughout, developing into almost a father and son relationship in many places. Aerial combat in the film is one of the best and is also very interesting in exploring cultural challenges mentioned above as men try to fly their machines, fight the enemy, and pass commands and answers in unknown language . The tension and struggle of these scenes builds on the tension between the people on earth, as well as the tension on the earth that feels in the air. It may not be a movie for everyone. A tough war movie enthusiast can find his exploration of relationships a bit off-putting, but it's a totally excellent movie, regardless of whether this element is mindful.
