There were several books that cited this as the earliest gay cinema. I do not see it like homosexuals in a homosexual sense, but then they saw two men dancing in what was supposed to be the world's first film musical, its attraction. There were some earlier comments on this film that rejected any homosexual subtext. As for those that are quick to reject this movie as just stupid and experiment conducted late at night after too many drinks ... Well, I've heard that story before. This movie is interesting as weird and if people want it to be the first gay movie, it is. Better than depressing Anders als dies Andern.
