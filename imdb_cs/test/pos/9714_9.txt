It seems that everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon and say "Maha Go Go Go" .... The word is MACHA ........ Like "Mach" ..... Saying maa - ka " ... <br /> <br /> I grew up with this series in the early 70s in LA at the end and greatly lamented channel 56 ... Before there was Tetsuwan Atom (Astro Boy), dating from 1963 to ol ' KHJ Astro Boy was the first television example of the anime we got here in the states ... I was anime as a child and followed it until the late 1980s, when it became a series of poorly animated "talking heads", a phenomenon Nuff said. <br /> <br /> As for "Speed ​​Racer", I really enjoyed the basics, POV shots, movie aspects of live action cleverly adopted. This was quite typical for most Japanese anime ... Graphics Graphics Graphics Notice sometimes, as apparently the series was inspired by Stanley Kramer's "Grand Prix" (1966), especially re done with US credits. <br /> <br /> Yeah, I have an original comic book that makes the show so I know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> What did we do animation-wise except crap like Johnny Quest? things we've done 'since the 20s .... Ho-hum! I think the real problem I had with how the anime was shown on American television is the work of the ax done on the script, credits, etc. to "disinfect" them for the American audience ... I will not go to other programs as we speak 'Speed ​​here. Look at clowns like Peter Fernandez as one of the perpetrators here because he was 99% responsible for transcripts ... Not to mention Speed, Racer X and more ... Between him and the ghosts on Trans / Luxu Felix cat and mighty Hercules - oy vey!) They took a neat, very sophisticated show and tossed it to the level of Sesame Street. Think of "Cruncher Bloch", "Forthebird Company", "Skull Duggery" ... If I go to I I'll vomit. This series comes from 40 years, but I, on time, was excited enough to feel offended dumbing down from this and other Japanese programs ... I think it's obvious when someone 's killed them but they either remove it or shine it over ........ Pleeeeeze! br /> <br /> Good show - originally. Unfortunately, all the newer incarnations of the series have that CRAPPY "made in Korea" look, not to mention that it is "ill-considered" in content. Even Japanese outsourcing their animation now .. <br /> <br /> Try watching 'original Japanese opening on YouTube ever ... It sends chills to my spine ..... If just ...... Oh well . Robert
