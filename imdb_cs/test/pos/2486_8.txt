Certain aspects of Park punishment are less than perfect, specifically some of the acting. However, I feel that it is probably the most important film of the era of the "war on terror". I grew up hate hippies and in some ways still do. It was only when the United States set out on an unnecessary and deceptive war in Iraq that I began to see their world through their eyes. I can feel what they felt. Although the film is somewhat dated, it observes that it brings those unpleasant emotions about our present situation to the surface. It is quite clear in the film that Park of Punishments is to be a concentration and death camp for all "spotless" elements of American society. This is an exaggerated and extreme view of our polarized society, but it is CREDIT. Sometimes I think the US could easily get into fascism. When I watched this movie, I could only think about how I hear similar feelings from people on both sides of the political spectrum almost daily. This film is a raw, concentrated distillation of the American political scene. I am overwhelmed and saddened that something like this (and yes, accurate) was made more than 30 years ago. If you have a milder view of the film and decide to believe that it can't happen here, take a closer look at Guant√°namo Bay, some of our "enemy fighters", the famous CIA secret prisons and many similar incidents. in Greensboro, NC in 1979 (8 years after the production of this film).
