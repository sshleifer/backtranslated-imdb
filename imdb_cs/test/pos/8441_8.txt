Great Corporation Vs. Conscience Do Good. We seem to be witnessing events (real life and reel life) of this kind all the time, and most of the time earns greed by employing all the necessary means (dirty) and the truth being suppressed. At least in this movie Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) got his points across and paid for it dearly. We have seen several other films of this kind that have been produced in recent years, the most memorable of which was the film "Insider", where Russell Crowe played the tobacco industry scientist, who was trying to whistle the whistle and claimed that the industry added more cigarettes to cigarettes. to be addicted. There was also this reporter-protagonist's angle where the reporter is looking for a scoop of his dreams and the protagonist is faced with this moral dilemma where he has to decide between justice and his livelihood and sometimes his life. Jane Fonda has played Kimberly well to perfection. She plays a reporter who wants to watch serious news, while her bosses appreciate her as Eye-Candy. She and her crew (a cinematographer playing post-'Coma 'Michael Douglas, who is also a movie producer) are witnessing a nuclear power accident while visiting. Cinematographer Michael Douglas is crawling / illegally getting a record of this event on the tape despite being an area without photography and smuggling it from the station. The station refuses to broadcast it and informs the corporation that owns the nuclear station. Meanwhile, Chief Engineer Jack Godell launches his own investigation and finds a lot of irregularities in the equipment used in the reactor. This begins with all the dirty policies of corruption and greed. This is a good thriller and managed to create a lot of tension in the audience to the end and the funny thing was that there was no background score to suggest all the scary moments. Now it's great and unusual in movies. The performances were good and I love Jack Lemmon. We know him mainly for his comic roles, but he is just as good in dramatic roles. I give this movie 8/10.
