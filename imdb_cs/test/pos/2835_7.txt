It is a brightly photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator "Rawhide" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is his main aid in this regard. His strong conspiracy can be said in several sentences. A heavy-by-the-book, cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures the leader of an Indian enemy after a fortress fort. He insists that the man return to court to be sent to Tucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner to court and the patrol is destroyed. That is, the leader has escaped and Lance must now lead a second patrol - and pick the men that the fortress can save the most, a company of problems - to defend a fortress that has been destroyed and saved another command. in this sector. As Lance, young Gregory Peck is strong enough. Others in the great cast of this film, which really shows life at the base of the cavalry look like the military foundation of heterogeneous and quarreling types includes War Bond Strong as a hard drinking sergeant, Neville Brand and Steve Brodie as the troublemakers, Warner Anderson and Lon Chaney \ t as psychological troublemakers and Gig Young, Art Baker, Herbert Heyes as fellow officers with Nana Bryant as Colonel's wife. Even Barbara Payton, as an interest in love, gets into a difficult role; Michael Ansara is a captured warlord and Jeff Corey plays the Boy Scout Fort. In this very well-executed western scene, there are really two great scenes - a long section at the fortress before the last patrol is dispatched, and the long patrol to the condemned Ft. Defiant himself. Once in this fort, Peck gets to a magnificent speech in which he tells them, at the request of the men he ordered, why he took them. one by one reads their flaws; they then tell them why they think he sent his best friend to die in his place to take the Indian instead of going alone - and he proves them bad for the rest of the film by winning his lone battle through intelligence and courage. Franz Waxman's music is good, production quality admirable; the argument about what happens when Lance takes the Chief of War becomes true; other than this unsolvable central character error, it's a great western. It's my favorite fifty years.
