Nice combination of giant monsters and samurai genres. The giant monster Majin, the god of the mountain, is a determined and forbidding character, very similar to the Old Testament God, raining destruction and punishment to those who desecrate his holy ground - but it is interesting to note that what eventually awakens him is not human suffering but mere and personal insult. It's beautifully photographed, with solid acting, great miniatures and a wonderful score from the great Akira Ifukube. Majin is not a 400+ foot monster like Godzilla - it's 2 1/2 times the normal size, so the evil samurai that stumps into the ground looks well into his scornful eyes as he bears on their fortress and breaks her into a blacksmith. It's not much in terms of extras, but it's nice to see this forgotten smaller classic saved and restored to digital format.
