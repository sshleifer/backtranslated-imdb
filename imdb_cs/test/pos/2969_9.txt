A talented high school graduate with a bad attitude is forced to play in a state all-star high school football game. When she meets and falls into an attractive local girl, she helps him realize that he has a chance for a "full ride" scholarship if he plays well. Too often, these dramas get into formal traps and tell the same old story about a troubled and confused teen. Matt Sabo FULL RIDE certainly fits this profile, but the individual is much more unique under the surface than we usually see in this genre. Matt is at the center of the action and is a realistic teenager, both over-confident, vulnerable, optimistic and cynical. Affected by Amy, Matt grows up in man character and heart. He, in turn, forms friendship with his teammates, which affects his growth as an athlete and as a team player. FULL RIDE has all the elements we love to see in the movie - great acting, admirable characters, exciting sports scenes, annoying drama and a love story. Although these elements have appeared in other films, FULL RIDE helps performances that are honest and casual, even moving. Perhaps the most impressive on FULL RIDE is his sense of reality. Although the author of the previous comment would seem to disagree (a clearly dissatisfied student who, for obvious reasons, got a bad mark in his film class), director Mark Hoeger bases the film in a credible situation and location and does a great job of getting into the grain of life in a little town. These characters are real people rooted in realistic situations that often create the most convincing entertainment. On one level it is a love story, on the other it is a character study and the other is a simple football movie. All these thoughts merge to create a cohesive vehicle.
