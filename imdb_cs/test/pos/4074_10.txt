I don't care what any of the reviews said, this movie was fun. The thing with this movie is that you can't expect anything but to have fun. This is not some intellectual comedy, it is a smart popcorn movie. The three main members are great and working very well. Shatner is a standout in supportive cast like himself, a former TV cop, brought in by Russ's character to train cops on how to be "TV cops". These are by far the funniest scenes. If you want to have fun and just sit down, then check out this movie.
