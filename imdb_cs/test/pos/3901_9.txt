That was a riveting movie that really pulled me in. I'm a big fan of William H. Macy, and that's great. His great likeness, along with the way his character smashes the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. I found myself tense that the whole house of cards would collapse around him (and spread like his confidant and quiet witness). It took me a few minutes to relax when the movie was over. <br /> <br /> Good performances all around, not just with Macs. Arkin was pretty good, as was Cromwell (he was surprisingly wild). In short, I highly recommend this movie to all Macy fans and / or the murder mystery. But you may want to prepare yourself to feel guilty.
