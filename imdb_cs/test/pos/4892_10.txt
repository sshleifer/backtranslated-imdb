I have never seen the work of The League until the beginning of last year - although when one night jumped, I caught the end of one of three episodes. But last winter I fell in love with the show and its dark, eccentric and sometimes downright ominous characters. So when I learned that they were making a movie in which creative program lovers met their own characters, I couldn't order a DVD fast enough to rip it off the postman's hands. I was so excited to see what the Gents did and how they did it. <br /> <br /> And it was great! Ever since Jeremy (Michael Sheen) was terrorized by Edward, Tubbs and Papa (Dyson, why haven't you played yourself? He's perfectly capable of seeing the Highgate House of Horrors Deaf!), Bernice, who has one more her flock, Geoff , Herr Lipp and Hilary discover that they are characters, which is a great scene. The scenes set in 1690 are very enjoyable, with Gents turning hands even more characters and all new plot. David Warner's tournament as Doctor Pea is fantastic, easy to camp and very funny. The League has always been great at mixing humor with sadness and emotion - and the culmination of this film, where Mr. Lipp struggles with the idea that he and the rest of Vasey are just fictional people who will never be able to change, who they are or their purpose - and witnessing it breaking is truly sad and beautiful to watch at the same time, and it really shows the masters' talent - something they are terribly overlooked to date. And then you have the smarter end - where you sit in wonder - with the beautiful musical theme of Joby Talbot. And you know you enjoyed a very smart and fun movie.
