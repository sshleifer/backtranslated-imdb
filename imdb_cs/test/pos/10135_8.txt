Dirt warning. As many IMDb users already know, I'm not a corny, cheesy person. If you don't read this kind of review, then go. To tell the truth, you hear it from a man who laughed through the Titanic and almost broke his parents' tape from continuously rewinding the propeller scene. Spoilers --- One day I went to theaters with two friends to see Dickie Roberts: Former baby star, last August. Boring trailers were rolling until he was so calm. It was for Radio. The moment I saw the trailer, I had to see this movie on the opening weekend. When the weekend came back, Scary Movie 3 was too many teenagers waiting on Friday night. It turned out that the movie was sold out and these teens were so desperate to see the movie, went and also sold out Good Boy and Radio. I couldn't get a ticket and in the coming weeks I was busy with more important things. About 5 months later my friend rented Radio. He let me borrow it and I watched it in my room. I'll tell you now, this is just a movie I've ever seen that crying EVER. When her mother died, she went out automatically. The next day I went to the blockbuster and bought a DVD. Good for my stupid personal story, let me tell you about the movie. Cuba Gooding Jr. stars as a mentally handicapped man dubbed Radio. Ed Harris's co-stars and this film is directed by Mike Tollin. Radio is based on the true story of a teenager who has a life by spending most of his day alone. He walks with a shopping trolley that captures everything in his power. He has his own collection. At the end of each day he goes home to his mother. He never went to school until later in the film. One day, Radio goes through the local high school while the football team trains. Football flies over the fence and Radio picks up and goes on. Ed Harris plays Mr. Jones, a football coach. They meet and that's the life of Radio. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, Radio and Coach Jones spend quality time together, both teaching each other things. It is beautiful to see how the film goes to the highest joy, the lowest lows, and just to see the radio live its life. You will laugh, cry and live with him in life. This movie has a special place in my heart along with Toy Story and more. This is to be seen for the whole family, alone, or if you are someone who just wants a big drama. Radio is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. The radio will never forget me. Never. How Ed Harris's character said very close to the end of the movie: <br /> <br /> "We don't teach radio, radio teaches us." <br /> <br /> My Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
