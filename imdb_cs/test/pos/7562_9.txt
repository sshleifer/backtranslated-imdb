I haven't seen this movie for more than 20 years, but it has had such an impact on me that I remember sitting in my credits and a few minutes after I was in full respect. This is one of the most underrated films of the decade it was originally released. I just ordered a copy on DVD and paid for the overnight shipping and I can't wait to arrive. Sometimes it is uplifting and also very dark and somewhat disturbing. It is the story of a close knit group of regular children who grow up in the inner city and make them feel as if they were actually sitting on the sidelines instead of watching a movie screen or television. Hard to explain, but it is something that must be experienced. The story begins in childhood and follows the lives of the four main characters through high school and in their separate journeys in life. The whole cast has done incredible work and it's by far the best work of Jodi Thele's career. I hope the DVD will live in my memory and plan to watch it this Friday with a good friend.
