True, "They died with their shoes on" gives a highly fictitious account George Armstrong Custer is (Errol Flynn) life and career, but remarkable, especially considering the battle for the Little Big Horn. Because it is not given that the 1941 film tries to portray both American-American cavalry and Native American leader Boss Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) in favorable light. I am almost tempted to say that the "Little Big Man" in his unqualified attitude against Custer seems unbalanced in comparison. Next, one should not be misleading by the image title? It's not just a movie about the Battle of the Little Big Horn, it's a film about it showing the unreliable West Point cadet, the famous hero of the Civil War, the Indian warrior, and last but not least the husband. The film begins with Custer's time at the West Point military academy, where his rebellion and inappropriate behavior lead to frequent difficulties. During a repressive military exercise, he meets his future wife, Elizabeth Bacon (Olivia de Havilland), who, like Custer himself, is a native of Monroe, Michigan. Custer wants to judge her, but the outbreak of civil war calls him. Custer's legendary prowess is shown in a sequence of battle scenes, the largest of which is dedicated to his involvement with the legendary Southern Cavalry General Jeb Stuart during the Battle of Gettysburg. While on vacation, he travels to Monroe and Elizabeth trials, who promises him a hand in marriage. Immediately after the war, Custer and Elizabeth Bacon are married. With the Civil War, Custer is destroyed, lacking in real command, and must undergo a carefully slow promotion process. small, professional American army. When he starts drinking, his wife intervenes on his former Winfield Scott boss. Custer is given command of the US 7th Cavalry, which he trains to be an elite unit. Neither Custer nor Crazy Horse will demand a battle, but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build railways across Indian countries in a clear violation of earlier treaties. Custer explicitly acknowledges the cause of the cause of the Crazy Horse, but rides to fight his duty as a soldier, and reveals the conspiracy of the money he has received in a letter he writes on the eve of the battle. "They Died with Their Boots on," though short on historical accuracy, is as good as war films and westerns in the 1940s: Both Custer and Crazy Horse are played by major actors, neither Indians nor Southern Confederations are being defamed, and courtship scenes with the beautiful Livvy de Havilland are simply charming.Only minus, and that is why I can't give this picture full of 10, is under the stream of racism in the portrayal of African American servants; overweight, good-natured, superstitious black mother. It is also interesting that the film does not find a mistake with either Custer or Crazy Horse, but with the railroad greed of the society that exert pressure on Washington politicians who use criminal methods to breach the guarantees they gave to the Indian people, and only a few years later, it would seem that American businessmen might even think years of doing anything remotely dubious, probably to be a hint that filmmakers were communist sympathizers. Needless to say, "They He Died with Their Boots on" omits the fact that Custer's overly aggressive tactics often bordered on the crazy, highly overestimating the importance of his involvement with Stuart, and not mentioning the lack of a survey before battle for a small big horn. However, Custer was seen as a war hero by his contemporaries and had some spectacular exploits to show on in the battles of Brandy Station, Gettysburg, Trevilian Station and others, although his arms performances were not as crucial to the civil war as "They Died With Their Boots On" suggests. In any case, "they died with their shoes on" is a well-made war film with western elements, three outstanding artists (Flynn, Quinn, and de Havilland), and offers a positive view The Native Americans as well as the negative of the big money that would not be seen in major Hollywood productions for decades. She would deserve 10 if it wasn't for the racist minstrelization of African Americans.
