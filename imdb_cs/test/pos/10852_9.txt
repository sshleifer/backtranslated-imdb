I loved this movie. Not because of romantic stories among women, but to visualize human power, despair and liberation. This movie needs to be seen. Entertaining! Emotional! Captivating! All characters are very well written and portrayed by some very talented actors. This story is a story of self-discovery and sexual awakening. The path of mind, body and soul. You'll find yourself identifying with the characters and at some points, even the storyline. <br /> <br /> I must say that I recommend watching a movie first and then reading a book. If you read the book first, you'll be a little disappointed. Customizing the scenario has cut a lot and some things have changed. Some for the better and some for the worst.
