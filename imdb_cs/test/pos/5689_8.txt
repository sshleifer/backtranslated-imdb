Gore chasing ... this is not your movie. This little nail has very little blood and guts. Its basically a version of Open Water that is effective and worth it. But what distinguishes him is that we are actually three (as opposed to Open Water) who find themselves in a tree when the crocodile overturns its fishing boat and seeks a guide. We don't want any damage to come to any of them. So when they get into dangerous situations ... we really care. Now I like killers, but I wasn't overwhelmed by Lake Placid all the way to Primeval (though I'm still waiting for Rogue and I hope he's as good as this one!) but that little bugger did this job and did well. It's scary creative, and it just goes into the run of a mournful crying sobbing and arguing about short hundreds of realism, so I've never been angry. I remember reading a real story that inspired it, where three boys were hunting and two ended up in a tree while their friend killed a crocodile. But the thing that always influenced me and which was left out of the movie was that the crocodile didn't eat his friend. No. Clock and clock swam around the tree and shook the dead body still in the mouth of friends in the tree. You seem to stay when you come here, this will happen to you.
