Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a healing it is! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett, they complete supportive roles in four lies and intrigues. In the heart of everything, however, each character retains a strip of decency - the moral conscience has risen despite obvious contradictions. "Discrepancies are the source of all movement and life." How true these words are. Watson's Anne Manning is at the heart of this intrigue - it is the central conscience that the other three have taken on. She is a deaf decency. The circumstances of lie are for each of them: one for the protection of his professional name; one of them is staying due to family / partner pressure; one simply does not want to face the consequences; one ironically cannot believe the truth and lies to save friendship. These are all precarious situations. There lies intrigues - fascinating to watch how everyone solves truth and lies. Contradictions. Despite the seeming dishonesty, decency and heart remain strong. The treatment of the involved subject and the way each of the characters behaves are masterfully delivered with clarity. It's not sensational or complicated as another movie, "Where is the truth". Credits as a result of writing Fellowes and the nuances of performances by both Watson and Wilkinson. Some warmth that comes through seemingly bold or frustrating hidden lies. Under all this, human fragility is not ruled out; And along with the story, the turn of events provided satisfaction and smiles, as the two Manning seemed to have grown and matured in their relationship. <br /> <br /> You could say there is no obvious drama or thrilling scene in a "separate lie".
