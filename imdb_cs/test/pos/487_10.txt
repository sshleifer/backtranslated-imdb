I grew up in Winnipeg and saw that the natives' treatment was almost every day. Every race is good and bad, why is it all bad? This is true for all races today. John Harper was an educated man, graduated from high school, even had a year at the university under the belt before returning to the reserve. How do I know? John Harper lived with his family in high school for three years and kept in touch with us after a year of study. He was a kind and gentle soul, he could have been a fun loving and could be serious when it was right. I wasn't too old to leave our house, but I still remember all the times he helped me with my homework when my brother didn't mind. Before he came to Winnipeg, he taught class 3. None of this is mentioned in the film, and the suicide of a constant cross is a confession of guilt if it concerns me. What happened to John is unforgivable, not only in the indigenous community, but also in the white community. Not everyone in Winnipeg thinks the police are doing it, I knew a person inside and what was like a PERSON, not an Indian!
