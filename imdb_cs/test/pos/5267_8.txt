Vidor shines like Judith, the only truly powerful and compassionate member of the strictly patriarchal family. Her brother, David, is so annoyed by his father that it is a surprise that he is even able to tie his shoes instead of asking for his father to do it for him. I will not repeat it; But I will point out that Nan, who is pregnant by David, is also married to him. This is not an out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which would have been a severe 1921 standard. They are both secretly married, but Nan's father, after paying David's father, tears his wedding letter. Nan's scene of death, with Judith, is a truly heartbreaking and highly emotional experience. This scene in itself is worth watching a movie, but there is much more to plot than that; why on Earth are not modern films with the same attention to the story?
