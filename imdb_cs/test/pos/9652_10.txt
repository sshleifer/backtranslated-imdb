This is the best French movie of the year! I saw it twice and I both found out great. I didn't think it was boring, though it was very long (3 hours). I'm seventeen, so I probably couldn't live the events of May 1968, which was an extremely important turn in French history, but it doesn't matter because I really enjoyed the movie. It's actually quite versatile: people at the age of my parents can identify themselves with characters and so people at my age can. Garrel seems to perfectly understand the young people, the way they think and the complications of love, as well as the loss of illusions about the possibility of changing the world. Maybe because the character played by Louis Garrel (his son) is actually meant to represent Philippe Garrel himself. Anyway, great movie, no action (must be honest at this point), but so strong feelings that you can't stay indifferent to it. If you're looking for a relaxing Sunday-night movie, don't waste time on it, you'll be disappointed. But if you like the cinema, you'll love Les Amants RÃ©guliers, which is a charming movie that comes close to those created by Nouvelle Vague in the 1950s and 1960s.
