The inspiration for this movie was the fact that American gangsters are well dressed, but Aussies, well, if you can kill a guy as soon as you look at a fighter, then you can dress as badly as you want and people won't criticize you. <br /> <br Jimmy is a fighter, illegal boxer, sometimes a bouncer and is offered by the work of Panda, a local gangster boss on the cross (that is, the Australian notorious Kings Cross District, not London's glory cross as many British backpackers find the hard way). <br /> <br /> Given the feeling of love he prepares for work, he loses a lot of money and has to get it Pando before Pando and his heaven can kill him <br /> <br /> Lots of dark humor, interesting action, revelation about Australian lower and human nature. It is highly concentrated in Australian wildlife and explores the nature of Australian criminals (against American and British). One problem is that each of the elements of the story does not have enough substance and depth, but it is a wide stroke image that covers many areas that were not previously covered, so as a total package worth it. Join with "Chopper" and "Dirty Deeds" your Aussie crime fest or "Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Miller Crossing" for international falling crime gang fest. By the way, Bryan Brown is a great actor who has just made a huge amount of really bad movies. Here's one of his great movies.
