This is a funny movie with a subtle intent. His off-beat comedy is cheerful for me, uninteresting for my friends. The soundtrack is perfect. I've got it on VHS and I've watched it many times because it's just a fun and funny love story with great performances of all principles (even if you only use Joan Cusack) as a big hair perch has been wasting its talent I know, I know she was still young ...). <br /> <br /> On a sad note I decided yesterday's night to watch a DVD (instead of watching my VHS tape), and was SHOCKED to find many key cut scenes. And there was no special feature of deleted scenes on the copy I was watching: it was as if the scenes were never deleted !! I'm so glad I bought a used VHS at a flea market. It is clear that there was a great deal of choreography, which is another reason I love her so much. It requires great skills, talent and genius to move on scenes like Mercedes Ruehl, Dean Stockwell, and Matthew Modine do from scene to scene (note the scene when grocery carts converge, rolling on the floor during filming in shootouts). Miami, Lickin Chick Debut, Foot Massage, Hair-Washing Salon.) There is a very "theatrical" feel to this movie that can be turn-off for as many whose bad reviews follow: I know some viewers who do not mistakenly understand this style, exaggerate and superior performance for bad behavior and worse direction. It is not so. Jonathan Demme does a great job of reviving the whole of society and their roles. <br /> <br /> Starting credits and the first scene are among my favorite favorites (more favorite opening credits / first scene: Fly Away Home) <br /> <br /> Too bad Matthew Modine left out of the public eye so reluctantly; I really like and found his cast PERFECT in the role of Mike Smith. Actually, this film is well populated from soup to nuts: everyone is credible and true to their role. As for the question of the expectation that viewers will accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians - why not? I thought they pulled it out perfectly. Charming, fun, exciting ... what's not there? If you want some fun, watch this quirky, colorful adventurous mob-love story. To learn more about organized crime and families, tune in to HBO The Sopranos.
