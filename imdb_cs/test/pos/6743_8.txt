In April 1947, the New York City faced an epidemic crisis. Eugene LaBar, a carpet importer coming from Mexico, came to town, bringing with him a deadly pox virus. He stumbled from the bus, complained of fever and headache, and soon died in a Midtown hospital, but not before a dozen passers-by were infected. The damage has already been done; For the first time in decades smallpox went through the streets of New York. The City Health Offices acted swiftly to isolate the disabled and contain the virus, and created a free vaccination campaign that had over six million New Yorkers vaccinated against smallpox. Due to their rapid response, the virus was contained with minimal sacrifices. But the outbreak had to leave an indelible mark, followed by two similarly themed film noir thrillers a few years later, in which doctors have to track down one infectious carrier in the city of millions: "Panic in the streets of Elia Kazan" (1950) 'and Earl McEvoy's lower budget' The Killer That Stalked New York (1950). McEvoy's film unfolds in a reckless dock-style drama. Reed Hadley's narration sounded as if it had been torn straight from the news, reciting facts, as if she were reading the official transcript of the police. This technique sometimes feels a bit cheaper, but fortunately the narrative is largely limited to book bookmakers, as well as some explanatory fillings during breaks on the property. "Killer" chasing New York, in this story, is not a rug importer from Mexico, but a beautiful diamond smuggler Sheila Bennet (Evelyn Keyes) who has just arrived from Cuba. Within a few days, Sheila has two sides to independently monitor her: cashier agent (Barry Kelley) seeking to arrest her for crimes smuggling, and a team of doctors (led by William Bishop) who identified her as a source of smallpox outbreak. As in 'panic in the streets', otherwise a routine manhunt is given an increased sense of urgency, especially when those in the pursuit initially have no idea of ​​the identity or appearance of their suspect. 'Killer That Stalked New York,' largely manages to avoid a low production budget. In addition to choosing a few lines of dialogue ("we have to stop it!", Dr. Wood called in one place as if he had made a difficult decision), the filmmakers and cast members allowed the story to develop in a realistic, stunning fashion. In this regard, a low budget can actually help the film's intentions, which requires a documentary style that contributes to the immediacy of the outbreak scenario. Evelyn Keyes is excellent in her leadership role, which shows stubborn resistance in the face of unimaginable suffering; At the end of the movie it seems so brutally incapable of its disease that it is almost painful to look at her face. Apart from the virus, Charles Korvin is the chief criminal of this work, as Sheila's greedy and adulterous husband, who, in peace, gets everything that comes to him. And if all nurses looked like Dorothy Malone, maybe pox catching wouldn't seem so bad.
