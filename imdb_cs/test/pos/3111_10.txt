I loved this movie for dialogue and excellent playing Candace and Jacqueline. But I have never known it before and watched Bette David's marathon on TNT that this film is a 1943 remake of Bette Davis's classic Old Acquaintance. Bette co-stars with Miriam Hopkins, who was in a terrible dispute with the film making, because Bette had an affair with her husband Miriam, who directed her in a movie before getting old. Anyway, both are worth every minute of watching. I highly recommend this movie if you like a lot of dialogue and drama. In my opinion, it is the study of women's psychology and their relationships.
