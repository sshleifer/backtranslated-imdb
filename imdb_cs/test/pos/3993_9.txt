No wonder I made this movie at the time. I examined the early beauty and tragedy of Chosuna's life in Seopyonje and wonderfully explored the famous Korean folk tale in Chunhyang. Most surprisingly, Chi Hwa Seon, his 2002 offer, is not presented in the pansori style of the previous two films. But I have experienced an experienced hand. Together we explore the life of a real person: the late 19th century Chosun dynasty who is on the verge of modernity, but is not a nobleman, and that is why the uproar in contemporary Korean society with its fame and its public and the artistic manifestations of contempt for the old Korean noble class and its contempt for would-be Japanese ruling colonists. Painter, Chang Seung Up, popularly known as Oh Won (featured wonderfully Choi Min Sik, the famous star Park Chan Wook is already legendary "OldBoy") is becoming more and more influential and therefore more dangerous throughout the film. The current Korean audience will bring such a hero back to reality, or perhaps because he was so ostracized at his time. I feel concurrent beauty and the tragedy in history remains intact. I am a master in capturing past idiosyncrasies in his country and in this film almost surpasses himself. As I expected in the film, cinematography is breathtaking, the cut is precise and the story is central. The surfaces are built against Seung Up, family ties are tested and broken, allegedly scandalous behavior (and sometimes it's real), all to make a person who "painted fire". But against all the complexities of his detailed but sometimes intricate description of Seung Upa's life, Seung Upa managed to survive. It becomes legendary thanks to its ability to perfectly copy famous Chinese paintings in a single look. Art dealers and agents then besieged him and tried to make money. In other words, the lines of people who wish to use the real artistic stars of Seung Up are beginning to form. But he refuses to be manipulated. His cleverness in avoiding both massive hordes and imperial footmen impresses viewers, if not casts. <br /> <br /> What does Seung Up think? He has powerful emotions and views on painting, such as the aesthetic belief that images are alive and never really finished. He despises those who try to turn art into profit. And they are not interested in politicians who use their power to bring artistic beauty around them, and then discard the artist as a traitor. But he also thinks that painting plays a role in the upcoming turmoil. Terrible scenes involving foreign invaders from France and Japan are presented. I am signing a historical epic motif and its influence in the area remains prominent in this multi-million epic display. The protagonist causes more sadness for himself and for those who care for him when he refuses to paint. This is when the story takes on a whole new meaning that is not only political but also social. I deal with questions in a laudable realistic fashion. He, Oh Won, becomes a Jesus figure. People believe he is capable of artistic miracles, and the government believes he needs his artistic support, but the protagonist remains fearlessly independent and scornful of what others want them to do or be. Finally, the government and the people descend on Seung Up in a way that is taken directly from the Bible. His holiness becomes man; his humanity is not accepted; he dies for (or escapes) the sins of citizens, critics of art, politicians who chase him. But is he dying? As with most of its films, it remains a question. In this case, Seung Up becomes an immortal hermit? The film does not address this question; represents only a possible ending for a real man, Chang Seung Up, or Oh Won. No death is shown because no death is known. It's hard to find a mistake with this film, but I have become so good at presenting various historical absurdities in its culture that it hardly surprises when it does. As usual I am the first in movies, cinematography, editing and writing. It is a well-made film that is full of miraculous stories. It is true that this may be the best thanks to the ancient Korean music of pansori. However, the film contains sections of this admirable art form, and the audience at the end feels as if they have become dedicated to a great, unpredictable story. And they have, because that's exactly me.
