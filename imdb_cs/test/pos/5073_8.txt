The cast of the powerhouse attracts the crowd in the theater, despite the sinister title. Jake Gyllenhaal has been guesting on Conan O'Brien to promote the film and explain that "publishing" was a euphemism for obtaining information by torture. "Extraordinary rendition" since September 11th has undoubtedly allowed the government news agency to free people without due process and use any means necessary for the exchange of information. Gyllenhaal plays CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (CIA). ), which is torn about its task, which makes it merely an observer of unorthodox interrogation procedures in an underground detention facility outside the US. Omar Metwally plays suspicious terrorist Anwar El-Ibrahimi, Egyptian national and green card-bearing Isabella Fields El-Ibrahimi (Reese Witherspoon). Isabella and her son are waiting for Anwar to return home from the scientific conference when she suddenly disappears from the passenger list. He seeks help from his friend who works in the government and learns that the head of the intelligence service, Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep), is behind him. Rendering is driven by Hollywood novice Gavin Hood (who is about to make X-Men Origins: Wolverine) and asks if such "extraordinary rendition" is being done in real life. The film was released locally in the wake of the explosion of Glorietta (bombing / accident?), And the key scene in the movie is when the bomb explodes in a public square, so it had to send chills to each cinema backbone. When he saw the exploding table with the lone red and yellow mark Aajala (Ayala?) In the upper right corner of the screen, plus the effect of silence and slow moving images increased the impact of the real coincidence of the scene. There are lessons to learn from this movie and it all boils down to the personal choices we make daily. We all have a choice that we can exercise by will, and often not always (we want to) see how these impacts affect others who may end up as unfortunate victims of circumstances. What is "greater good" should not be a forced choice that our leaders must accept if we decide rightly at the source. Now it's a utopia worth building.
