In the book of Life, Martin Donovan plays Jesus, who appears at JFK Airport on December 31 to bring the new millennium into battle with Thomas Jay Ryan (Satan) and decided on the fate of the world. There is also David Simonds (Kurt Accountant from Amateur) as a compulsive, homeless gambler. As usual, Hartley creates a surreal world in which the beauty of the ordinary has made strange and strange streams through artistically framed scenes and urban / industrial landscapes full of dazzling light and shadow. As usual, he introduces seemingly random details soon, then brings them back to cheerful and unexpected contexts - humor is simple, but dizzy and untamed. Hartley has the incredible ability to build on the small and torn moments of contemporary secular and outrageous. As usual, it creates a tone that is tired and world-tired but at the same time vulnerable, open and honest. After a few minutes, he moves from the excitement of humor to a language that is metaphysical and poetic - a type of writing that is so dead and perfect that it is difficult to hold back tears despite the lack of obvious emotions. Another amazing and very funny movie. The book of life is filmed (digital camera?) With a blurry effect: a sense of heaven hand in hand with imminent destruction and a hyper-awareness of the present as fragile and fleeting in the last moments. All of Hartley's films have a way to prioritize the present, but this unique effect unites it with how images are washed on the screen in a way that is initially unpleasant, but becomes more beautiful when you settle into it. The last shot is spectacular. All of this may sound precious, but the film is a comedy and makes it fun, even if it makes fun of Armageddon, Judgment Day and urbanity. Although it is actually quite deep, moving and life-confirming, it is largely light and playful. Acting is flawless when it comes to the kind of subdued tone that Hartley has developed in his films (a tone some people don't, and who calls them to act as hollow - the same people who have a negative answer) Peter Greenaway). As always, there are people who react to this film with cynicism and contempt - people who are discouraged by Hartley's shifts and what he sees in supposed or mannerist techniques - but everyone who is a Hartley fan will love this movie (if they have chance to see it, it is). It's hard to tell what it would be like in the video.
