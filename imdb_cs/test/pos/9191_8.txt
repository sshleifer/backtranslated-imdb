This existential thriller, in Portuguese with English subtitles, is a modern version of American film noires 40 years, complete with a surprise twist at the end. It's riveting from start to finish. My only criticism is its poor production value. The film looks cheap, and probably so, so black and white cinema is much worse than Godard's Vivre Sa Vie, citing another film noir more than 30 years earlier. Most of all madness, subtitles are often difficult to read. When will filmmakers learn and provide yellow subtitles so they can be read on a white background. I would give it a total of 8, although it could be higher with better production values.
