Normally, online, but it's Saturday and I'm trapped in my room, on a rainy day with nothing to do but watch science fiction movies and Xena: Warrior Princess (I can't get damned 'Joxer Mighty Song from my head, it's been there for the last ten years or so, just appear randomly when someone (me) does something idiotic). If you have any complaints about this movie and actually send it to the internet, do you have any idea how much idiot you look like? If you expect more from Bruce Campbell than what he explains (in the literal sense) than why you watch his movies in the holy name G-d? No one is watching Bruce Campbell's film when they want to see something brilliant and understandable, we watch it, so we feel better about ourselves (like the people who watch Jerry Springer and eat Chunky Monkey), and enjoy the thoughtless psycho-babbling. I personally love Bruce Campbell's films. I'm not a complete idiot, actually I see myself as an intellectual and a scholar (haha, hubu, Ally). His films reflect crazy, random, unpredictable, ridiculous ideals that anyone who has a brain can scream or not. And he was a bit sexy on Xena: Warrior Princess, even on his face hair. I rate this movie excellent 10, just because I can. If you can't take simplistic schemes (if any), hot babes in sci-fi splendor (skin, spandex), and known if they're not exhausted by the insights of madness, then fer cryin 'aloud, don't watch the movie (or something like a name Bruce Campbell). Yeah, Ted Raimi was amazing in this movie! How to go Ted! You did the best you had. ;
