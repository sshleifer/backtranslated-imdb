George Cuckor, known as the director of women, could not hope for another two talented and beautiful women. The remake of Bette Davis's camp "Old Acquaintance", written by John Van Druten, is certainly dated, but it is beautiful. Bergen and Bisset sparkle as the best friends who compete in everything but manage to stay friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a "serious" writer, intellectual and elegant. At an exclusive girls' school, she meets her best friend Merry Noel and begins a lifetime of not always friendly competition. Later in their life, when Liz is "promising" but blocked by a serious fiction writer, Merry decides to try his hand at writing, infuriating her friend because Merry's occasional approach to the craft she takes herself, maybe a little seriously. Much to Liz's confusion, Merry's insidious novels hit dirt and finally her old friend Liz judges her National Book Award novel. Bergen steals the show as a haughty writer of steamy bestsellers who plan to combine broken pieces of their lives in conjunction with her latest literary triumph, but unfortunately, things are never that simple. The support cast includes David Selby, whom you can remember as the tragic Quentin Collins of Dark Shadows, Hart Bochner, and of course the deliciously young and mercurial Meg Ryan in his first film role since he left the soaps. Rich and famous is feline, camping, funny and wise. It culminates in a New Year's fiasco that highlights the lasting nature of true friendship, and I never let the year go without watching on New Year's Eve. Watch it and see why.
