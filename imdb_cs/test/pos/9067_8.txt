Peter Lorre was born to play Stephen Danel with lines like: "Mr. Smith, you shouldn't hold such a woman." "I told you not to keep the monkey in the house!" The poster for this movie is haunted green and Peter Lorre thinks you never want to go to his penal colony / island. This movie is not available on DVD, although it is classic and very rarely displayed on television. What is the relationship between Stephen Danel and the monkey? Why did that monkey upset him. We'll never know. The film should be colored and snippets should be created in the Kinks video. The film was re-released in the 1950s and only a few Peter Lorre biography spends some text on this film. Casablanca was just around the corner. Bogart could have been on this island, but he certainly had no budget for him
