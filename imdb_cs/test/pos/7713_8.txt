The eleventh, and thus the second to last, Animatrix is ​​the only one. It takes the two main kinds of Matrix movie entertainment inspirations, and combines them incredibly well. This is an extremely faithful trilogy in this aspect, tone. Animation is a wonderful, breathtaking animé. The pervasive style is Noir. The storyline is appropriate and the story as well as the music is in place. Sound in general is fantastic and really helps solidify your mood and atmosphere along with drawings and designs. Voice talk is perfect. This is one of only two where people play their roles in films, and they both have Anne-Moss, who is the only one in them. This is one of the best of nine, and also one of my favorite favorites. That's about ten minutes. Stimulation is perfect. It never slows down much, but it's not even overwhelming. The end could not be more appropriate for that. It shares a nine and a half minute long work with the Kid's Story story and is well done and informative. I recommend it to every fan of the universe and the two genres of which he is composed. 8/10
