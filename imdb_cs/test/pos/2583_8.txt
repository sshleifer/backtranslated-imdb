If you've been looking for a movie in which an out of control nymphoman gets strapped to a radiator an extremely religious southern man then look no further than the latest edition of Paramount Vantage 'Black Snake Moan'. Aren't you looking for exactly what I described to you? Well, then it is best if you look at it and you will look down at the local theater and still see how Samar L. Jackson's character Lazarus would say. As long as you keep in mind and do not take everything seriously, there is no reason not to leave the theater that you have seen it. In Craig Brewer's third offer, We're Taking to the Deep South, where he claims as a film slogan that everything is warmer. While we met the bluffant Godfearing, Lazarus, as was said earlier, he played Jackson, and almost always half naked Rae; role bravely adopted by Christina Ricci. It is unlikely in the film that couples stretch long enough for their characters to teach each other a lesson. In the end, both lessons tell us the message that no matter what we are, we are all people. No one is perfect and if everyone realized it, then we would be much better. The question of whether it will be understood or accepted by all who see the film is a different story. One thing that is not for discussion is how great Jackson and Ricci are. Would you think about the role of a woman who was bothered by sex, exaggeration would be given, but no, not here. Ricci breaks and demonstrates true talent with incredible performance that also doubles. Then we have Jackson, who completely disappears and for the first time in a long time he forgets who he is. Sadly, the third star of the film, Justin Timberlake, who plays Rae's military friend, is not that big. In the beginning, he unfortunately fails as he seems to be trying too hard. Later on, he is still far from the level he achieved in January's "Alpha Dog". Another thing that "Black Snake Moan" boasts is a great soundtrack. Contains songs from The Black Keys, John Doe, bits from Scott Bomar's score, and four of course. It's actually one of his songs, the main movie show, Stackolee, that is the fuel for the fire of this great collection. It's just worth the ticket price. Other noteworthy musical experiences are the Bomar's' The Chain ', Black Keys'' When the Lights Go Out ', and the title track, which is also one of the most memorable scenes in the film where Lazarus sings Rae on a stormy night. But Craig Brewer's efforts cannot go unnoticed. His latest film, 'Hustle & Flow', which ended in overcoming low expectations and getting a critical greeting, put him on the map. What he did with 'Black Snake Moan' will be what sets him apart from the rest of the industry. Not only did he drive Moan, but he also wrote his script. The end result is a story that is surprising and clever. When you look, you feel like you know exactly where you are going, despite your bravery. Just as you think you have predicted the next step, Brewer moves gears and has a completely different route. However, there are some spots in the scenario. Background characters are drab and flat, while the end is somewhat disappointing. He let me desire for something more exciting. After so many heights, I think the final scenes were a little weaker than the rest of the movie. I imagine that most people who see 'Black Snake Moan' won't enjoy it. The fact that they can't stop thinking how unlikely situations are. The depressing part is that there are many other films that are just as unlikely, even outrageous, that are well received. It is a question of race, religious motives and sexuality, which film exhibits will have a greater influence on opinion than anything else. The idea of ​​a black man attaching a white woman to his home is enough for most people not even to think about her. Simply put, it's not for everyone. As I said to enjoy it, you have to go with an open mind, otherwise you just wasted money. For those of you who can do it, I highly recommend it.
