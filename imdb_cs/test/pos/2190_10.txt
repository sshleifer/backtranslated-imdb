Take part in Sweeney Todd's story ... The weirdest, most distinctive, but most beautiful musical, Broadway. It's cool, funny and moving suddenly through Sondheim's most memorable and incredible score and sharp performances. George Hearn is unmatched in the title role, bringing a strong voice and dead on (no pun intended) impersonation of the legendary barber demon, while Angela Lansbury provides comic relief as she cheerfully crushes his victims into meat pies. If you allow it, "Sweeney Todd" is a real experience.
