This is James Bond's excellent movie. Although it is not part of the original and more famous series, and it is a separate movie, it is very well done. The tempting Sean Connery return to the role he made famous was a dead genius as he was titling the movie in a way that refers to his past promise not to play Bond again. Connery was as big as he was in his earlier performances 007. The screenplay is excellent as well as photographs and performances. It is the oldest film I remember with Kim Basinger, who became much more famous after the film; Barbara Carrera was excellent; and Klaus Maria Brandauer was absolutely perfect as the main villain. Frequent references to Bond's aging and changing times and attitudes of the British secret service were most humorous. Gadgets 007 coincided with other Bond films. The only thing missing was the famous music theme 007, which, of course, could not be used by this competitive production. It was pretty amazing when I saw two excellent James Bond movies released the same year, this time with Octopussy with Roger Moore. An interesting aspect of the film is the emphasis on video games and computer graphics. In the early 1980s, such things were the first to flourish, and their use in this film made it a very modern film. The film is actually another version of Thunderball, updated with newer technology. Regardless of the recurring topic, there are sufficient differences to make it fun. I'll watch this often.
