This is Marc Recha's fourth feature film. In the third "les mans buides" -Empty hands- I promised myself that I would no longer cut veins. This time, however, the plot is quite different - a kind of tribute to Ramon Barnils (Sabadell 1940 - Reus 2001) to a Catalan journalist. The visuals in the trailer are a stunning - radiant river bathed in sunlight - and a promise that Marc himself will be in front of the camera, along with his twin - one of the two professional actors - convinced at last, six weeks after its release. Leave in this very unusual road / river film. There is nothing to know about Ramon Barnils, but his strictest inheritance: his constant struggle against the amnesia of what we have decided to forget about the Catalans. "La batalla de l'Ebre" - the view of the Battle of the River Ebro on wikipedia was lost not once, but twice because, after 40 years of silence and 25 years of heartless democracy, no one has forgotten the legitimate side of the Spanish Civil War and those who fought with it . This film is about lonely people who roam about the same places with very little conscience about what happened there 70 years ago. This movie is about landscape.
