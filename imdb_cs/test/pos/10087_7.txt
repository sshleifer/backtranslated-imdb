Another Asian horror packed with intense and scary moments. Another Asian horror brand is the complexity of the plot, which is also here. MAJOR SPOILER WARNING! The film starts pretty simple - two sisters live with their dad and stepmother after being in a psychiatric hospital after their mother's lunch. The nurses seem very hostile to their mother - especially the elderly - and seem to ignore their father. Everything goes smoothly until the mother blocks the young sister in the closet and the older sister tells her father. Then it hits you, "Your sister is dead for years." It turns out that the older sister still did not recover from her mother's death and what we did not know is that the closet on which her mother was hung fell to the ground. the younger sister and killed her as well. Like the stepmother, the alter ego of an older sister is revealed when a stepmother (actually an alter ego sister) sits on a couch when a real stepmother actually walks! I hope it was clearer for the confused Asian horror fans out there. Finally, my favorite scene is a scene where a father invites friends for dinner and one of the friends starts choking to explode a panic attack. Very scary! 7 out of 10
