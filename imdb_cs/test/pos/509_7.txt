I hope you won't be so excited about the summary line (it's a small tribute to Chappelle Show / Charlie Murphy, but also to Daywalker). But I will try to put all the things I like about the movie in one paragraph and everything I didn't like in another paragraph, so it will be easier to read! <br /> <br /> Let's start with good things! The quote "Strong Blood Violence" (which is used by rating committees to describe the content of a film is very well suited here. It's not a film for kids! Or for a weak heart! Character (Wesley Snipes is phenomenal) and a crazy enough story thread to hold / justify action The original idea is also very engaging and intelligent. The action scenes are great too. <br /> <br /> OK on what I didn't like, the overall story is too thin, it's enough as I wrote above to keep the action scenes together, but it could be more, and a character like Blade deserves more (imo) is not the best ... it is also the use of clich√© does not help.Some characters are subscribed ... That's it!
