Now, Throw Momma from the train wasn't a big comedy, but it's a lot of fun and makes you laugh. The title may seem a little strange, but the film is not literally, even if it is something sinister. Danny De Vito basically wants to kill his inverted mother and move forward somewhat, some random and funny events take place. The assumption is pretty funny, and the things Billy Crystal and Danny De Vito get into were great. It seems some of the scenes don't fit me, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. For what it is, it's a crazy comedy that pulls it out well and should only be seen once to say you saw it.
