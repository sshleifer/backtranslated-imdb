After seeing this movie, it's hard for me to understand why so many people hate this movie. I'm not saying he belongs to the top 250 of all time, but it's a great movie in his genre. I know many people find it fun to see how a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' has turned into a comedy. Many people seem to believe that some things should not laugh ... they are bad. Mel Brooks did a great job with Robin Hood: Men in stockings. I also saw Robin Hood's original movies, but I never had such a good time watching them as I was with this. It's just one sequel to cheerful moments and parodies of famous people and movies (Winston Churchill, The Godfather ...). <br /> <br /> I recommend to anyone who wants to laugh very well to watch this movie. For those who think Robin Hood should not let himself be guessed, you are wrong, but don't look at it because you're probably offended. I give this movie 8/10.
