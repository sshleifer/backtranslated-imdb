When I started watching 3 episodes of this series on the Action Channel, I have to say from all the shows I saw that the ADV released, this is one of the best shows of all time. I had to see it again, and that's when I got my chance. I bought the whole box of this series at Best Buy for my 20th birthday. And I have to enjoy it and see more episodes I missed on the action channel and the same 3 episodes I saw. My favorite characters in this show are: Sylvia, Leon and Nigel. The animation in this series was the best and the hard suits were also cool. But the show also has a great voice cast like: Chris Patton, Jason Douglas, Christine Auten, and Hillary The Hague, and more. So if you like this show on the action channel, then you have to own it on DVD. It's the best and you'll see what I mean.
