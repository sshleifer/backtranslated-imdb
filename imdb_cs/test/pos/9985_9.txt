This is especially a good, exciting story with well-developed characters. But all the other details are well created, leading to a wonderful movie. Don't let Disney make you think it's dumbed-down or just for kids - it has something to offer to all age groups, whether you like golf or not. One of the most impressive things is that the movie will make the game really exciting. And talking as one of the many who can't play golf on TV is not a little performance. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film does a good job of setting the basic characters with their motivation and background, just when you end up when all the important competitors like you. Sure, you will take root for Ouimet's character all the time, but his primary opponents are sympathetic and interesting in themselves. The background layer is important when a golf game becomes a match using both mind and golf clubs because you have a good understanding of what each person's strengths and weaknesses are during the game. <br /> <br /> Computer effects are flashy, but they help the story more often than not. The director has a variety of clever golf shots and period costumes and sets are truly excellent. There are a few small quarrels - many tiny characters seem too stereotypical to cast a class of warfare form, but it is forgiven with the main characters so well drawn. Shia LaBoeuf plays Francis Ouimet is, as usual, calm and compassionate. But the real standout is Steven Dillane, playing Harry Vardon. He seldom moves his face, but his intense, often sad, eyes and minor changes express so much. Ouimet's cadre Eddie Lowery, who plays Josh Flitter, steals the scenes he is in. See the movie, Google find the current photo of Ouimet and Lowery at the tournament, get an even better appreciation of how incredible this match was really.
