If Western Union is not exactly the real story of building a transcontinental telegraph, it will certainly capture the spirit and dedication of the people involved in the project. Dean Jagger is the man in charge One day is thrown out of the horse and holding his broken ribs. A runaway thief, Randolph Scott, finds Jagger and is ready to steal his horse, but changes his mind and brings Jagger's help. Later he is hired by Western Union and works for Jagger. Jagger also hires a young eastern player, played by Robert Young, who is an engineer. Young makes one of his few loan films away from MGM for the 20th century fox. Both Young and Scott become friends, but rivals for Jagger's sister Virginia Gilmore. Western Union has plenty of action, enough to satisfy all Western fans. The telegraph crew must deal with the perpetrators, the Indians, and their work problems in the garden. Slim Summerville as a shy chef and Viktor Killian as a boundary figure to protect him have some of the funniest scenes. Both provide some good comic relief. Fritz Lang got good performance from his cast and kept the movie moving. Western Union is a solid Western pastime.
