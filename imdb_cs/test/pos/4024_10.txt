The depiction of Valerie in this story of Barbora Bobulova was both charming and heartbreaking. It has been a long time since I have seen so many hidden passions and mystics that every actor has presented just by using face features and using her eyes and mouth as Barbora does with this character. She was absolutely believable as Valeria and I got rid of her characterization of this role. Suddenly, the film was real life and imagination, and the clever use of what was a limited dialogue left me stunned. I was forced to read between the lines and each of the key players used the art of body language and emotional intentions to tell a strong story. Above all, Barbora was visually inspiring in an almost asexual and sexy way. This comment can easily relate to each of the many emotions her performance has shown. He underestimated in terms of dialogue but powerful in terms of presence. I was captured by this actress delivery and eagerly looking for much more of her work.
