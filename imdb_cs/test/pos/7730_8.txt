I really liked this movie - not so much for the story (which was fine but it was a bit slow in points), but moreso for the incredibly beautiful scenery of Greece and the Greek Islands! Susan Sarandon is totally committed to the carefree love interest of John Cassavetes - a man "on the edge". But the scenery! Oh oh oh!
