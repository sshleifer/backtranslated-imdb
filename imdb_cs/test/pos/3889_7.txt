Any movie offered by Bonnie Hunt, Sarah Silverman and Amy Sedaris in a side-by-side show must be well worth watching, and comedian actor Jeff Garlin takes advantage of the amazing talent he has recruited for his directorial debut in 2007, a comedy about a sad bag of overweight a man who feels out of step with the world around him. Known as Larry David Jeff's manager on "Curb Your Enthusiasm," Garlin plays James, a still-fighting, 39-year-old Chicago actor who still lives with his widowed mother. His self-esteem is so low that he can't meet women, but it's a comical way of seeing his only status doing his dilemma. If that sounds a little familiar, it's because the film is partly a homage to the 1955 classic Ernest Borgnine, "Marty", about a lonely butcher Bronx who lives with his mother. In fact, Garlin uses "Marty" as a play which James is desperate to do because he is so empathetic to the character's situation. Naturally there is a love story of the species in this new version of the millennium, and Silverman plays Beth, the sexual, greedy server of an ice cream parlor that takes him on to shopping in his underwear. Their best scene is in his favorite store, where they improvise various characters in different aisles. Hunt plays a lone primary school teacher who shares a passion with James for jazz musician Ben Webster. They meet randomly in a record store and then again on the day of her career at her school, where she happily exposes her sexual neuroses in front of a class of first-class classmates, including his best friend Lucy, penelope daughter Penelope (played like Dakota Fanning). Nurse Elle). Sedaris in a wedge-shaped portrait and looking quite like Jerri Blank plays a school advisor who talks to James after his inappropriate monologue. David Pasquesi plays Luca, home retirement manager, and his Garlin scenes have an easy relationship that makes their friendship easy to believe. Almost steal film is the character actress Mina Kolb who plays James' pixilated mother with tear and heart. There are also unexpected portraits of teen idol Aaron Carter and Gina Gershon (don't ask 'setup is funny), as well as sharply played pieces by director Paul Mazurski (as a serpentine director of the spectacular show "Smear Job") , Tim Kazurinsky (as unsuspecting victims of this show) and Dan Castellaneta (as a heavy trade owner). With his furious bouts of insecurity and self-defense, Garlin's comical senses resemble Albert Brooks' feelings, and the informal dialogue in his best sense reminds me of "Modern Romance" and "Defending Your Life". One lasting problem I've had with the movie is stimulation, because some scenes stretched longer than necessary. The problem is more evident in the first half when Garlin tries to create the right pace and the lack of real conflict contributes to slow development. Regardless of what it does well, it is to capture that ugly feeling of despair that one feels to reveal that life is not what it should be, that a significant other can be out of reach, and that a steady diet of unhealthy food eaten on a car hood is the only certain thing in terms of pleasure.
