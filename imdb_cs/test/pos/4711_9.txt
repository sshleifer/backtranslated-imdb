I'm afraid I will have to add my name to a long list of people who have been paralyzed by the fact that this movie is not released on DVD. It is one of those mysteries that makes the mind boggle, especially when you consider that the amount of DVD available today contains material that was supposed to be packaged a few years ago. I still have an excellent digital VHS copy in English with subtitles and Nicam Stereo, so my qualification is more a principle than a frustration that the film is not able to see. As far as the film itself is concerned, it is an excellent all-round model with good image quality, more than a satisfactory soundtrack, a live chart including tension, emotions, sadness, frustration, a feeling of good and exotic environment (for the European). How a true film fits into reality in Burma I have no idea that it is less important, it is essential that it is fun, it's a success. Soon he will join each of the main characters and admit that I had my heart in my mouth during the final crossing of the river. It's a pity that we hear so little about countries like Burma, and this film will at least explore the country. Has the situation changed since 1995? The events that will happen this month seem to answer this question with a loud "No" and the regime in place seems to be as brutal as never before, not even saving the lives of monks, let alone women or children!
