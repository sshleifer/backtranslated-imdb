"Japan takes the best of the world and makes it its own", although it may be true, it applies to everyone except one thing that is ..... Major League Baseball ... but don't worry "Mr. Baseball "is here to change it all. But who who changes who is part of a movie that really does rock! Tom Selleck is one of my favorite actors and shining in his comedy roles. The storyline can be true to life, however the subplot is dead-on. The Japanese are gentle, respectful people with ways and traditions very different from Western society. All these elements and obstacles come together to make one really enjoyable, fun movie. Certainly worth the watch!
