I saw the movie last night w / o know something about it (nothing else seemed interesting and I had a Buffalo connection to this movie - UB grad). It was a very nice movie. He liked the pace (rising after a slow start) and the story. A well-written graph and good character and relationship development. We highly recommend anyone who wants to see movies that have interesting stories. I later talked about this movie in a few beers - most of the discussions don't last longer than a few minutes.
