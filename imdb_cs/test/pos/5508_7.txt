Everyone told me that this movie was totally bad and sick, so I finally rented it and I was impressed. I thought torture would be much worse, but in the end it was shocking, but it was about it. I wouldn't say it with a horror movie, maybe a mystery or something that is in the category of lamb silence and / or a kiss of girls. Sometimes it was stupid, but the rest of the movie held me on the edge of my seat. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R - for Strong Torture, Violence, Language and Sexuality
