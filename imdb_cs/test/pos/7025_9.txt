I didn't understand what it meant ... Now. I didn't even want to see Dirty Dancing. I rented it, but I never saw it - and I did it today. And I thought it was a really fun, great movie that made you want to get up and dance. Well, sometimes it was cheesy ... but it's still a great movie. I can't believe Jennifer Gray was in this movie 27 - my friend and I thought she was about 18 or 19-20 most. I think it's attributed to her acting talent. And sometimes she really looked embarrassed. Patrick Swayze is also very good, but you can say he's in his thirties and he seems to be a little old. However, still very good. I like 80s songs so it really hit the chord with me, and the love story (yes, I'm romantic) was so beautifully done. I enjoyed this movie. He exceeded my expectations!
