I've seen this movie once, and I look forward to seeing it again and again. Dear David (from Beligia), why did you bother to write a comment on this movie? I just think we can think about you (after reading the commentary), is that you are a proven non-sexual person (like Erika in the movie) and you're not ready for the new cinema that comes. I think you're a little old and the sexual expression isn't part of your "vision". The Cannes Film Festival is by far the best film festival and it is a pleasure to say that this film won the Best Actress, Best Actor and Grand Prix. Isabelle Huppert is amazing, as always, who would have made this movie like her? One of her best performances ever. Music is fantastic and Michael Haneke re-introduces reality to the big screen. It's like the Dogma95 movie, because of the subject. Try to see it. <br /> <br />
