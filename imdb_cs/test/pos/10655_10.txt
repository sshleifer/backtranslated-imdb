When I watched this movie, I did something a little brave tonight. I tried to break away from the silent film scores. Certainly, when this movie was originally distributed, it was probably played with a piano score. Sometimes the director chose the score himself (Charlie Chaplin often scores his later silent films). But most of the music you hear on VHS tapes over silent movies is by no means the same music that was supposed to be played when the movie was first released. And then again there were a lot of silent movies that were played without score. I do not know the history of the Potemkin score, so I decided to follow the medium that this work of art was made in the film. Soon after I switched off the music, without any help (or I should say it was unrestricted) by musical interpretation of the emotions on the screen, I joined the film. Visually, it is easily one of the most stunning of all movies. Eisenstein was the master of composition. Cutting, maybe Eisenstein's film technique is best known (montage), it's extraordinary. The mood of this movie is anger and it upset me. Enjoying a silent movie, especially drama, requires a lot of effort, but films like Potemkin Battleship prove that this effort is worth it. Come on! You owe it to watch this movie! Your education is incomplete without it.
