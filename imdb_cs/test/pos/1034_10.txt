I can't remember the series, I believe it could be "American Masters," but it was aired on PBS around the 1980s. that is a pretty dry object. Anyone looking at this 7-piece series doesn't feel like it. You know the confusion in the mind of Oppenhemiers and how development has changed its life forever. You understand the tragic personality he has become and why. With 7 episodes you get to know the main players and intrigues and backstabbing. I contacted PBS about getting a video or a DVD, but I never received a reply. Too bad I'd like to see it again.
