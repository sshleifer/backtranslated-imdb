come, i love you! I couldn't come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it ends. My family hasn't seen this movie yet, but I know them too well; they will hate it. But this time I watched it myself and I found it very influential. Although the film is long, I was tied to the story and amazed by the end. At first I thought it was strange, just how it disappeared, but at some level it makes sense. But, as it said, this film doesn't make sense for reality. Instead, he invites her and the viewer to think about what "normal" means. It also gives you insight into personal thinking about what the end means, I can say that I loved how it turned out and I'm glad Mithi.
