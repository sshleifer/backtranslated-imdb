I wanted to use 'The German Scream' as a summary, but it was already accepted lol. It is well summarized by Anatomy. Assuming you can't read the headlines, Anatomy fits comfortably in the Scream / Urban Legend package. She is a teen-horror at a medical school where students are absent, then appear as experimental subjects in an autopsy lab. Cue one nude student examining herself and uncovering a giant plot. Assuming you are watching an original German movie (I can't comment on an oak when I didn't see an English edition) Anatomy is sharply written and cleverly rendered so that the tension never goes down. Compared to American counterparts, the secret is revealed much faster, which means that instead of appearing until the last revelation, anatomy evolves into a clever and thrilling thriller during a horror movie that comes with slasher-come-points. It's a great ride from start to finish. Participating actors will also attend the hats. Franka Potente proves once again that he's an intelligent, clever actress who can revive any role. Her central performance as Paula is a great foundation for the movie she is going to build on. Haunted tutors and their pet teachers are just as good, always sinister. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that the film isn't too tight. The tempo is fast and frightening, very similar to earlier legends of Urban Legend, which means there is always something going on to keep your attention high. If there is one disadvantage, it may be that some find too much anatomy for them, but if you persist in the first half of the credible graphic dissection sequences, the other half will be rewarded with an exciting thriller subtext. I recommend Anatomy to anyone who has a good teen-horror movie but is a little tired with the American take on things.
