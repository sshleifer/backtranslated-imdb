So here's a little background as I come to see this movie. As you probably know, this is an original French movie that was then reworked (quelle surprise) Hollywood as Wicker Park. I avoided the movie as a plague when it was first released, simply because: a) I knew it had nothing to do with Wicker Park and that she lives in Chicago, I didn't see why they called it - it was filmed in fricking Canada start! - b) I bother with the nonsense remakes that are made purely because Hollywood thinks we're too idle to read a few headlines (I'm afraid I'm afraid of a remake of Infernal Affairs by the way) and c) I can't stand Josh Hartnett , "Nuff said. However, WP came across television the next day, about half an hour, and I have to say at first, it didn't make any sense, up to half an hour from the end when it began to meet. By the end I was really surprised when I really found myself in it, and then that end looked so good - the perfect combination of story, passion and possibly ending with one of the greatest musical options I've ever seen (heard ??). Since then I have heard a lot about the L'Appartement argument. Wicker Park and when I look at WP I keep saying that it has everything to do with Chicago, but it seemed something about what I liked, so when it was again, I saw it again - unfortunately, the first piece is still missing I haven't seen it yet!) and I still thought it was pretty good. Damn, Josh Hartnett looked good too! But I was curious about L'Appartement and wanted to see what the fuss was about. I waited and waited for somewhere to catch l'Appartement. Netflix let go of me, so I quit and got a copy from some website in Ireland. And I watched it. It's really weird, but weird. Classic French film. Great actor, Romane Bohringer is an absolute gem - I'm sorry, but in every scene she plays Monica Bellucci. Vincent Cassel was a strange choice for the viewer, but he is working to the end. And I saw Jean-Philippe Ecoffey in a lot of movies and I love him - a scene where Alice throws him into a restaurant and looks like someone told him that his puppy was run over, it was unbearable! But I can honestly say when I saw WP and pretty much expecting it to be a scene for a copy of the scene (about 75% of the rest of the movie was - maybe in a different order, but come, a scene with coffee in glasses? you can imagine my surprise when I watched the end of L'Appartement !! I can literally say I was blown away - hmm, a bit like a poor old Lucien was really a cafe window! So be prepared, if you saw Wicker Park and you want to look at the original as I did, don't make a mistake when you expect an identical movie because you will be either disappointed or one-piece. History of French Film - A great example of how you can watch a movie, I think you'll watch a happy pithy end, and get a whiplash out of the total rotation in the opposite direction to the right. Definitely catch this movie. And when you're on, maybe not too close at the same time, but down the road, check out Wicker Park, it will also surprise you.
