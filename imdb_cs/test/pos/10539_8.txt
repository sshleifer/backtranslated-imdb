What the hell people expect in horror movies these days anyway. Is it supposed to be something awful like 'SAW' or is it just stupid ... ??? Now, I'm not saying I'm an experienced expert, but I'm about 47, I've seen and actually literally thousands of movies, and frankly I think this director really gave this movie a good, honest effort. Believe me, I was going to cringe as soon as the dialog box started, it was terrible and I was pleasantly surprised. It's not a Mamet script, that's for sure; ale PŘIJÍM !!! With all the HORRIBLE garbage outside, especially in the horror movie, I thought this was WAY closer to the top of the pile than most. The director used a lot of neat, clever camera angles; the soundtrack was excellent and moody, ideal for the atmosphere needed for this kind of film. Adjustment and timing were very good. And he didn't forget the weary, worn out cliché of violent violence; For example MINOR SPOILER ***** ***** During totally kind and totally gratuitous (but delicious ... uh, I think it's tasteful) nude shower scene. But, AMAZINGLY just enjoy her heavenly grace and that's it ***** END OF MINOR SPOILER ***** Also the tension was built very well, leading to a pretty ambiguous ending where you are not quite sure what is what. ***** SPOILER ***** Especially where in the scene where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and Pinnochio alone in the office; We see a doll who actually talks to her, but not in the video. Mommy also sees Pinnochio moving and being ugly; so, are both mom and daughter insane ... ??? Also there is the original 'killer' and what Mum decided about the possible influence of evil. But even with everything, we are not quite sure who is doing the killing. good ol 'Early Full Moon type style and with lots of restrictions on violence. And without any typical SLEAZE thrown for any reason (just a beautiful, innocent, beautiful shower scene I will remember until the end of my days ...) Compared to the absolute MINDLESS drive out there, DEFINITE, a powerful 8 / 10 !!!
