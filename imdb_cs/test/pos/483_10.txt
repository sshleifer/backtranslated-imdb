I first saw it on Thames TV and loved it. Subsequently, I saw a horrible record from someone who certainly didn't even watch or listen to him. So I bought a copy and then I bought another copy! The only sad thing is that it is not available on DVD VHS or Region 2 DVD. The Australian version is great, but this is better! I could buy another .............
