I loved this movie. My daughter is 3 1/2 and country girl in heart. There are no movies for young children. I loved this because the worst part was when one of the boys said "stupid". I applaud them for performing and making a real family movie. I rented it for the first time we saw it and knew we'd like to add it to our collection. My daughter can't stop talking about it. Along with our lifestyle. We live in East Texas. I hope to see more family movies like this. She even named one of our "Hokey Pokey Keen" calves !!! I can't say enough about this movie. I look forward to many other similar movies.
