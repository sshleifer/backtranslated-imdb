A man with a golden arm was one of the first films to have a tragedy of heroin addiction as its main theme (and in some ways a message). It is nowhere near the great film, but its importance lies in Otto Preminger's determination to feel real and on the edge of melodrama and naturalism. What I liked is that it's not so much the exposure of drug addicts (if you want the most popular guy to read naked lunch, even if you do, except that point), but the character of the urban environment Frankie Machine lives. He expects that after getting out of prison for going straight and narrow to become a drummer in the band and making it legitimate as a musician. But she has her "crippled" wife, Zosch, who can't work and needs money and often complains, and then there's an old neighborhood - she can't escape when she sees Louie (Darren McGavin) who still makes the card games in the room and, yes, push drugs. Like Mean Streets, it's hard to escape from the minutiae unless you leave. But then it's hard for Frankie Machine to work naturally in this neighborhood. It's just that he can't escape the temptation of junk (when he reserves a fake theft with his friend, he sees a junkie who gets scared and turns to fear of returning to a pure self). And the personifying Frankie is Sinatra, and I can't see anyone else who could play him, even the original Brando option. It fits in the neighborhood, and it looks like a man who should be one step ahead. But there is also a vulnerability to Sinatra to be excellently ripped out, and when we see the "cold turkey" in Molly's apartment, it's believable, though that's not what my "generation" thinks of heroin (Trainspotting and definitely a Requiem for a Dream). If for nothing else, you want to watch a movie to see what happens to Sinatra like this character. Defects, however, come in some of the other performances, though it's a little more complicated. Eleanor Parker seems to be overcoming a good part of the movie, fooling Frankie into being really crippled when he can actually walk and fool him for some reason. But then it is clearer as it goes - she is supposed to be nuts and nuts with jealousy, and at this level it gets better. Meanwhile, Kim Novak is good, though not Vertigo-worthy, as maybe a girl in the side, but more like a voice of reason in the story. Then there's Detective Bendar, who could be one of the most distinctive characters / performances ever. And also Sparrow, Frankie's stupid friend, and the characters of Louie and Schiefky, and everyone is playing as one might expect (McGavin is better than OK). When it comes to casting other talents around Sinatra, Preminger doesn't. And frankly, some scenes that look like flat. However, a man with a Golden Arm is fascinated not only as an old dated piece of sociological interest. It works as a compelling drama, and as a message that is transmitted without preaching or camping. It's a genuine article, just not exceptional.
