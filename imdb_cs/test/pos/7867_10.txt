A clever psychosexual drama about a wounded Union soldier (Clint Eastwood) who seeks refuge in an isolated Confederate school for young women during the Civil War. Slowly, Eastwood begins to seduce every girl in sight until the tables turn and he becomes persecuted in a disturbing, goth-tuned final. Never was the film so deliciously erotic, but at the same time alarmingly horrifying at the same time. This is undoubtedly the most beautiful hour of Eastwood (those who "Dirty Harry" will be really surprised), while the rest of the cast gives uniformly outstanding performances. Try to watch a movie on video, as TV prints usually remove key shots between Geraldine Page and Patrick Culliton.
