This is a really great and beautiful movie. The basic theme of this film is an innocent child (Heather Graham as Joline) who tries to make her naive wishes as the world should make sense while being constantly defeated by the real world. However, it is not an unfortunate film - just the opposite. It's a funny movie with a sad side, but just thinking about the movie makes me so happy. Near the beginning of the movie, beautiful, vulnerable Joline confronts an addict trying to break into her friend's car. The reasons with him persuade him to seek help and give him $ 30 as a start. At the end of the movie, she reappears to pay her back, explains that she's gone, does well and thanks her. I hear the cynics groan. Of course it would never have happened. This film does not take place in the real world. This takes place in a world in which we wanted us to live. The sad part realizes that we do not live there. The cheerful part is to know that there are people who wish.
