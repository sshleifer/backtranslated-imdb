Father Hood <br /> <br /> I can understand why many people hate this story of having a father kidnapped his two children and carrying them all over America, but I saw much worse, and - when I saw these years - I am he didn't think it was particularly awful. Patrick Swayze is a troubled father who takes his children to run with him for personal reasons and Halle Berry is a cop chasing them down. Overall, it's a decent way to spend a few hours of your life. Surely it could be worse - ever hear of the movie "Under People"? <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 of ***** <br /> <br /> Rated PG-13 for some traumatic scenes, adult content, violence and language.
