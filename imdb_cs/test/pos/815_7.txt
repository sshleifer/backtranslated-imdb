"Blind Date" is one of three stories-made-in-movie by Vida Hurst. Lots of famous faces in this oldie from 1934. Mickey Rooney as a little punk mouthy. He seems to be in the film for comedic and homely "family values". Jane Darwell again plays a strong mother, as well as in the Oxbow Wrath and Incident. Ann Sothern is Kitty, who goes with Bill (Paul Kelly) but meets rich Bob Hartwell, who is played by Neil Hamilton, who can be better for her. Certainly you can say that it was done at the very beginning of the Hays production code - in one place Kitty says he can't be alone with him if there is no one else in the house ... a change from one or two years when everything and everything was in okay. A good conspiracy, but lots of conversations and bushy love talks. It raises the question of what a girl should look for in a man; should she endure for a man of integrity who would treat her well, or find a man with great money because most of the films in the previous 20 years advocated ...? and how do people change when their situation changes? watch out for some violence in the strange dance marathon scene. The 1960s TV viewers will recognize Hamilton as Commissioner Gordon of Batman ... Also some strange drama in live off-screen movies for some of the casts in this one - Paul Kelly went to jail for fighting murder. the love triangle. Mickey Rooney had an affair with Norma Shearer, who was 20 years older; Rooney was married eight times. Tyler Brooke (Emory) and Spencer Charters (Pa) bounced in real life. Blind Date has been used many times for movies, TV series and even cartoons, but none of them has the same graph as this one.
