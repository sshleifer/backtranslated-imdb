The highly politically charged drama, which is biased, is very well done and is one of the most intelligent films ever made. It contains almost no preaching, but is followed by a naive television reporter who is gradually aware of the threat of nuclear power plants, not because of his own dangers, but because suppliers are more interested in the bottom than the safety of those affected. Many hated the film because they saw it as a political stretch created by ultra liberals like Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas, but if you see it simply as a drama, it's breathtaking, exciting, full of well-developed, distinctive characters and, ultimately, a truly thrilling contemporary thriller approaching home. Historical note: For some, especially those in the power industry and in the people of the Harrisburg metropolis, PA, an area that may have hit a bit too close to home because less than a week after the release of the film, a devastating explosion of three Mile Island nuclear facility. Updating, 04/08/2007 For almost a decade when I first wrote this critic, I heard a lot of comments about the movie. One thing I think really needs to be noted is that this film is not "ultraliberal" anti-radar tirade, which they often refer to as being. While creators and stars are (or have been) remarkable "Hollywood-based" liberals, this film is not the very idea of ​​nuclear power, but rather the idea of ​​human greed, corruption and fallibility that casts doubt on the potential dangers of something what nature has already made dangerous. Nobody who accepts reality can argue that human exposure to nuclear radiation is at least quite likely to be fatal. Close friends who had been working at a nuclear power plant for several years even told me about the employer's official policy on the maximum "safe" exposure levels his staff would have. You don't have to believe that corporations are inherently bad to accept that individuals are greedy and often corrupt in pursuit of wealth and power. And even if you disprove this claim, you can't doubt that all people are prone to mistakes. When it comes to exposing innocent people to nuclear radiation, we cannot afford any mistakes, and that is more than anything else an argument that this film is trying to make. <br /> <br /> Condemn it if you have to, but try to have a small perspective. We are currently dealing with a war whose ongoing results are completely different from those originally anticipated, which is an incredibly expensive endless war. And if you feel that war has been necessary to combat global terrorism, you cannot question the fact that length, financial costs and, above all, the loss of human life have far exceeded the levels that "experts" have secured us back in 2003. So even if no one is greedy or corrupt, "bugs have been made," and errors of fairly serious scale, implement. The same kind of serious error, if allowed in the nuclear industry, could make most of the Earth's surface uninhabitable.
