Kahin Pyaar At Ho Jaaye is a great family movie. Salman Khan looks nice and great than ever! There's even a scene where you take off your shirt! What a surprise!!! Rani Mukherjee is also great. Pooja Batra had very few lines, but I'm glad she was recognized for her role because she certainly has the potential. It's Prem (Salman Khan) and it's a wedding singer. He is about to marry Nisha (Raveen Tandon) but gets up. Prem goes to Nis's house and asks her why he was kicked out and it's because her brother is sick and she has to marry NRI, Rahul (Inder Kumar) to get the money to treat him. Prem moves on and in Priya (Rani Mukherjee). Prem falls in <br /> <br /> likes to Priya, but it's a shame he's getting ready to marry NRI! Who could be this NRI?! Priya falls in love with Prema while Rahul is with her. Prem gives Priyi an offensive comment one day and she goes away and goes to Agra for a wedding with Rahul. Prem? Watch KPNHJ to find out! <br /> <br /> The movie was very fun! The song was great, especially the song "About Priya O Priya" It's a shame the movie got to India and I don't know why?! Every movie in India is falling apart today !! This film deserves to be a hit. The only problem I found with the film is that they have an obsession with NRI! They think ALL NRIs are rich! The film deserves 9/10!
