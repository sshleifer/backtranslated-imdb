I can't say what's the source of this movie, but this is one of my favorite films by Mazurski (director and co-author). This is retake on Shakespeare's "Comedy", but completely removed from the stage. Without much text, Mazursky and the star Cassavettes make a visual crisis of medium passion and purpose. Desperately trying to concentrate again, Cassavettes retreat to a distant Greek island - where the locals and the island are fleeing some magic. Especially Raul Julia, Susan Sarandon and Molly Ringwald, this is a fantasy for adults that is emotionally satisfying and visually beautiful. And funny. It wasn't a big hit, but when it comes to DVD, it will sell.
