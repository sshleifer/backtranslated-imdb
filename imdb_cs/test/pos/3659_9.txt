The opening night for the "Southeast Asian International Film Festival" (SAIFF) in New York was an event that many of us have been waiting for. Finally I Want to Look at 'Hari Om' ?? I was tired of watching the "promo" on the loop and the lingering taste of Angel by Nitin Sawhney in the promo, letting me beg the rest. Was I impressed by the visuals? and tremendously curious about how a rough looking rickshaw car driver would win the heart of a stunning sophisticated looking French tourist! I remember being a bit interested in the subject when I read a line or two in the paper about what's happening in the age! Especially since a few years ago, I was personally very fascinated by how amazing the rickshaws were in Jodhpur! The snow and crowds in front of the theater only increased my anxiety. Once inside the theater, I found out that the organizers of the SAIFF presented the disaster. I was uncomfortable and embarrassed at how badly the event was organized and found myself in a difficult place, trying to explain and offer an apology to my friends (mixed nationalities) that I invited to the VIP guests list. I was hoping I could prove to them that the Indian cinema wasn't always about Bollywood? Finally, the film began sending fresh air through our path. Or did I think ??? Hari Om ?? he started with chaos and noise. Autorickshaws chase, traffic and lots of chaos. I found myself smiling when I felt the feeling of "home" fulfillment in me. So began the journey of Hari Om? car rickshaw driver in Jaipur ??? The director couldn't make a better cast with this character. From monsoon wedding to Hari Om? Vijay Raaz, despite his non-heroic appearance, carries this film solely on his acting skills and on his character, filled with all the rickshaw driver nuances in Rajasthan. It's a winner. But how and where he learned to speak English even fluently is a question! His character, however, portrays beautiful shades of humor and sensitivity. I love his innocent depiction of a simple village guy? who has great desires to be famous any day? yet he knows when to cut off reality. Camille, on the other hand, enters a movie that wears clothes that no one dares to wear in such a place. But it is funny that she does not seem to care for her too much. But it looks very dazzling! Especially in the second half of the film when it turns into an Indian dress. But her relationship with her boyfriend seems very vague. It probably adds a touch of reality to certain types of relationships. The film will guide us through the most beautiful parts of Rajasthan? What is surprising is that none of the places were portrayed anything but what they really are. Do you see dirt, see primitive houses? you see Rajasthan just as it is! Yet ?? is there only one adjective that will leave you? 'Beautiful'. This is the first director who probably knows how to portray India exactly as it is - with the dirt and noise and all the negative consequences India reminds of! ?? Still, it seems to be one of the most beautiful places to go. Kudos! for him. The only downside of the movie I could see is the pace? Did I find that in some parts it is quite slow? but be sure you will never get bored. Nitin Sawhney's results add a classy international yet very Indian flavor to the film. The song "Angel", which plays at a very crucial time in the film, blends beautifully with the visuals. I also heard that in addition to the main characters, in fact, all the other actors are just normal people. who has never been in front of the camera before! Is it commendable to consider most of our so-called Established Actors? still can't display realistic characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> All in all, watching this movie was a wonderful experience? It is a pot pourri of emotions. Is it romance, humor? realism?? beautiful visuals and places ..., great music, great cast ?? PACKAGE! When I left the theater - was I proud to be an Indian? A few days later I asked one of my Bulgarian friends who watched the movie with me if they wanted to watch another Indian movie? and his answer was ??? "Is it better than Hari Om? If it is, then I will go? Mr. Bala, are you reading?
