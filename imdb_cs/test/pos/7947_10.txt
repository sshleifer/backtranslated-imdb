I recently watched this film for more than 30 years and was very pleasantly surprised. I remembered the movie that captured the mood and the feeling of Britain in the mid-sixties without getting into the "Swinging Britain" cliché, which so many other films deemed necessary to spread, my memory proved to be correct. Those who feel it is like a TV game are not completely wrong, but while Andrea Newman has become famous for the risqué TV drama, this film is more in the tradition of "kitchen sink", such as Saturday night and Sunday morning with emphasis middle class than living in the working class. Rod Steiger is excellent as a Mediterranean angst-ridden lead, unhappily married to a repressed and apparently infertile woman (Claire Bloom). The advent of the "technological revolution" is the foundation of a drama in which old values ​​and security are questioned. This is the stage for the central character played by Judy Geeson, which was a shocking departure from the typical behavior of contemporary heroines at the time. The reversal of roles when a girl assessed her conquest in a small black book was the forerunner of the feminist movement and was criticized for promoting promiscuity among young girls at the time. The irony of these criticisms is to see both Claire Bloom and Peggy Ashcroft characters who are both reluctantly dissatisfied. Peter Hall has made several films and it is a great pity on this evidence. Steiger is exemplary and completely trustworthy, showing why he was so highly regarded
