I can be very tired of the secret of murder except for a few really great TV series. Otherwise there are too many of them. I don't like the theme of two overly clever, selfish young people who kill as an intellectual exercise, I have no interest in Hitchcock at all that seems to be related to it. . But you will not understand me, the theme itself is excellent, the whole movie is so good, and of course Sandra Bullock is superlative as always. Sandra's character (as with Miss Congeniality) is rated by the male team she works with, despite her obvious abilities, and the boss mostly ignores her thoughts, eventually forcing her aside and giving the case. your male partner. Of course, Sandra will understand what's going on and almost kill herself in a very dramatic denouement. It is interesting that a boy who has drawn up a murder plot does not allow his colleague to kill her - he has a sort of conscience and may possibly "save him while the other is a real psychopath". Sandra's hard shell is caused by the misery of her past, which is tied to the murderous case of murder, and her colleague, who realized that Sandra would solve this case despite being overruled by a dense boss, eventually finding out what happened to Sandra in herself. Teens that now have to face and expel and the last scene shows her start - we hope anyway - just do it. From a few more reviews I saw the time reading that this movie would attract a wider group - those who are interested in two spoiled boys who get rid of their time with their tremendously philosophical determination to deceive the police and leave with the perfect murder, the relationship between them so cleverly depicted, horrible references to the past of the hero, the police theme, and some smoke and mirrors - as well as for Hitchcock fans. For those who wondered why Bullock had a troubled past, I think it would be a much less interesting movie. If it were just a detective to try to understand what was going on with a helpful helper. and a chauvinistic boss man. The connection between the murder victim and the detective is necessary for the detective to become too involved or otherwise, how would he lose the trust of his arrogant boss and thus almost lose his life? This is barely an original theme, in fact, it is usually a very irritating theme, because this chauvinist boss man is brutally telling his frustrated but apparently inspired operative to leave the case and let someone who obviously does not have the skills to solve it. although it is sidekick. In the end, I was very worried about what might happen to Sandra's character because of her emotional involvement in the case and the special sympathy for the unfortunate victim of the crime that had led her dangerously to the case. I was not disappointed with the relationship between Bullock and her sidekick. This is interesting and sometimes very annoying. The relationship between the two boys is definitely interesting if you were interested. I felt that in some respects this was kept low because filmmakers didn't want to get into the boy-boy's friendship too much, or because we didn't think their relationship was driven by emotions. The film cleverly wonders which boy is in charge of the situation, and there are some twists and turns and the boys show their basic immaturity in different stages. One thing I wanted was clarified and that's what happens "after the movie" when Sandra's character comes to the yard .... you need to see the movie know why is there. Very well done by everyone. Certainly I cannot agree with those who complained about Bullock's conduct - it was excellent. The part suited her very well. The story is breathtaking, though mysterious murders are not your thing and they are often not mine.
