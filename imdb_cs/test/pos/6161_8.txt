Such a beautiful movie! Not only does it portray war, but also friendship and love. Slam's life is filled with sadness, every aspect of his life has fallen apart. I can only imagine how he would feel when his friend made the final sacrifice. I see a slight resemblance to "Pearl Harbor", which is also about two pilots who fall in love with the same woman. However, this film is much better because it does not draw a woman to be unfaithful and carefree. The friendship between the two men is also much more convincing and well built. I definitely recommend this movie to all people.
