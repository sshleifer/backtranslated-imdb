For anyone interested, I managed to get it on a Ebay DVD (I haven't got it yet - anytime today). <br /> <br /> I was desperate to get it, even though it's VHS quality on DVD Never Mind. So for all those interested, contact me and maybe I can help you. To be honest, it's ridiculous that I had to wait almost 7 years to see it again, but the boy will be worth it. desperately want to see as well. <br /> <br /> In any case, we will later publish quality information. <br /> <br /> Just search on Ebay if you want the guys. it's there to buy
