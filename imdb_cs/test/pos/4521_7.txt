This film is about the deadly poison contained in the small glass balls that are used to kill. This is apparently done to hide the spy ring intended to steal plans for the new American bomber. So much of this plot has been repeated in other Canadian films, JADE MASK and THE DOCKS OF NEW ORLEANS. In addition, it was first used in MR. WONG, DETECTIVE - all had exploding glass balls - a conspiracy element that was clearly exaggerated. This was interesting in MURDER OVER NEW YORK, but it was rather pass√© for these later films. Fortunately, the rest of the film was fresh and the plot was doing very well - with a clever conclusion where Of course, the culprit reveals himself. However, no aircraft could fly like that - especially in 1940. Such extreme dives and fast ascents were quite stupid from this obsolete aircraft. By the way, you will see Frank Coghlan Jr. in the small role of porter. - the same actor who played Billy Batson in the CAPTAIN MARVEL series. According to IMDb, Mr. Coughlan is 93 years old and left the film industry.
