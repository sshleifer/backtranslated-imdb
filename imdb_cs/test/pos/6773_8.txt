If you don't like subtitles, you like comedy and really interesting characters, along with the taste of something different from mainstream American movie, then take a chance and rent this movie. Two contrasting friends, one very neurotic sweater, the second strong, quiet loner, working for a shredded butcher in a smaller Danish town, decided to go out and open his own butcher shop. They are not successful initially having something new, what they are recipe and become an instant hit with the village. That is an interesting story in itself, this elegant humorous film is set with even more (friendship, romance, crime, death, personal tragedy) that makes this movie so entertaining, but riddled with subtle interests that make him so much fun, but warm and fuzzy. actors to be believable. You can have the best scenario, though the characters are not believable that they can sink the movie and with this, directing, playing, character credibility and story all ok so well that it is a very funny movie. So, if your mood stretch out lil, you want to see something very good yet done a little differently then I suggest you rent this movie while I'm on my way out to find more director Anders Thomas Jensen.
