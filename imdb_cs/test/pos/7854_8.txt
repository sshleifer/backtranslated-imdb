It's probably Clint Eastwood's best movie. Here the action is minimal, but with a lot of good action. Yankee soldier Eastwood is injured and impressed by the school's pupils and teachers in the south, where he is hidden and cared for. Shortly after his recovery, all the ladies wanted to have fun with him, and some of them succeeded, including the headmaster (Geraldine Page). Erotic scenes come in as long as the ladies find that their "macho" shares some of them, so they got angry and poisoned him for a farewell dinner. Geraldine Page, though somewhat old, was able to play a very suggestive role as a school director, a woman with more failure than luck in her life.
