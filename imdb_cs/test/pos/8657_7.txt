Annoying man is a clever, surrealistic movie that will help you re-evaluate what you are doing with your life and what forces you to do. When you see these people in zombies as trances do everyday events and realize that what we do and what we want in real life, it really hits near home. This is a surprisingly effective film that lets you end up asking questions about your direction and not so much about film. Andreas is the main character whose life we ​​gain from a third person perspective when trying to move to a new life. Initially, he seems to be the most popular guy in town, because everyone at work takes care of him and is invited to dinner, etc. A good example of this is in the scene with his new boss, who offers him an envelope of unspecified quantity. money say "here's a little something to get you started". He even gets a 20-minute girlfriend in the film that he finally gets. It looks like an ideal life situation, because his girlfriend is an established interior designer, attractive and never knows what he's doing. But Andreas is unfulfilled by his relationship as everything else in this world. He then begins the affair with a collaborator named Ingeborg who he finally leaves Anne for and claims he is in love with. After Ingeborg said how he feels telling him that she is also seeing other associates and says that all relationships are "nice". Soon after we see Andreas at the train station trying not to end his audience's suffering and disappointment. Still looking for salvation Andreas meets Hugo, who has found a hole from which to hear music. They go on a mission to get to the other side, will it be better or worse? "Annoying Man" shows us how society is obsessed with performance and a materialistic attitude. It does a great job of making fun of us by filling houses with IKEA products that characters spend every lunch picking up. I think he's mostly stung into a boring Scandinavian society and a high suicide rate. For example, there is a scene in which Andreas meets a man who jumped out of a building and on a pointed fence. Also Andreas wiped this world with her finger and later jumping in front of the train; This is one of the strangest / worst scenes I've ever seen. This world created by Lien is equivalent to purgatory, where there is no punishment or reward. In this world, after drinking, the drink was never drunk, sex was not fulfilled, and no matter how many times he tried, he could not kill himself. This movie reminded me of the "Fight Club" and how the two main characters were a bit unsynchronized with the world around them. In "Fight Club" Tyler Durden creates a second person who does everything he wouldn't do, and in this movie, Andreas is the equivalent of Tyler Durden. After a while, he wakes up and tries to escape from the bleak life that is now separated from escaping through a hole in the wall. Lien is doing a great job with continuity in this movie, which means the character has half a full cup in his hand and cuts off and returns to have a glass in the same hand and is not full or empty, showing that the shot was taken the next day. Nowadays, directors are more afraid of sound effects and overlook small things like the character who wears a bracelet on the same hand as yesterday's filming? Since I took television production for three years in high school, it is hard for me to look for the continuity or voice transmission that makes me. Lien makes little things good that she has great lighting in every shot, never lets you wonder why something is in the frame and brings an interesting topic. This movie really worked for me because it not only ridiculed Scandinavian, but also Western society and what's wrong. The only real problem I had was with a man who committed suicide by jumping on a pointed fence. Because in the end you will find that this world has no death, but helplessly forced you to assume it was dead, and in my opinion it will never get an answer. Andreas is the only main character, as others come and go and never do more than support him. His first girlfriend, Anne Britt, is an interior designer who seems to be perfect on the surface, but eventually turns out to be boring. This leads him to Ingeborg, who starts the affair and falls in love with her. She soon finds herself with a handful of other men and that what he felt is not real. In the end, Andreas meets Hugo in the bar bathroom, complaining that he doesn't like anything anymore and how he can't get drunk. He succeeds Hugo at home to find a hole in the wall with it being filled with baby laughter and birds chirping. Lien doesn't have much of a resume, but "The The Bothersome Man" is more than a leap to a great career, but a look at the director. Regarding any hint of his talent and potential as a storyteller, Lien has a clear future and we can only hope that his future films will not last long enough to be abroad for our viewing pleasure. So sit back and enjoy the ride as director Jens Lien takes you from the comfort of his home to the world of dreams, which is a "harassing man".
