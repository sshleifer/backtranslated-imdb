This is a very realistic film. It's the most realistic thing I've seen on urban youth. The actors were great. I'll see more Gomez movies. I've never heard of a movie until someone recently mentioned it. I bought it on DVD. I was impressed. I haven't seen anything close to life as I know it in Philadelphia. This is really close - in fact, one scene where there is an accident (I won't spoil and give details) reminded me of an almost identical situation in Philadelphia. At first I thought Gomez had taken the scene from this event, but then I realized that he had made the film several years before the situation. I also agree that this film has not attempted to expand its appeal by introducing Hollywood crap. Gomez also directed "Laws of Gravity" - I'm eager to see it.
