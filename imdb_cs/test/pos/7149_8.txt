The amateur camera works aside, I thought this movie was very different, and unlike all the blogs and posts I read, I have something completely different from the end. The idea of ​​the story revolves around a very religious family and their ties to their church. How they must follow all the strict rules and rules, but the daughter seems to have trouble keeping on track, what about the ugly ideas of others and how to use the wrong language. Yet she prays a lot, just like her family. Then one day they head for a picnic and are in an accident. From there, parents and her brother change; what about the fact that Jesus is eliminated and "saved". WARNING: MAJOR Spoiler ALERT. Or so we are led to believe. I think when you look at this movie from the perspective of only a daughter, then really pay attention to the end you will see that what we, the audience, thinks is a real occurrence with parents and son, is actually all Dream and from POV's daughter. That would explain the many actions that parents and son had shown, which was quite the opposite of how they lived before, especially the sexes, and also explains why Peggy escaped the murder etc is, but come back and look at the cake that Betty does. This means that Caroline will not remove all the evidence that the cake has been attached. And also the fact that the scene where she sees her dead parents has been put there in every other hand and her brother, all of whom seemed to die very peacefully, even when they are poisoned, fits into a succession of dreams.
