Less than Zero could be a film of the 80s that reveals teenage apathy in its farthest form if they were actually sticking to that damn book. But where not, this film presents work, leaving you with the strictest feeling when it happens until the late 1990s with Larry Clark's films "Kids" and "Bully." Social outcast teens face a somewhat curious dilemma (they don't treat him as one) when their estranged friend (Daniel Roebuck) boasts of killing a teenage girl near the riverbank in their suburban town . Keanu Reeves can be the only civilized character among the bunch, the only one willing to expose any kind of conscience, just as others either do nothing about the girl's death, or want to help their friend hide the body. I don't know who's sicker in this movie - Crispin Glover - who becomes almost obsessed and very paternal in trying to protect a friend and hide the crime by smuggling him from the state. Dennis Hopper, an on-edge drug dealer (who holds on to a female doll) who makes friends with teens (of course, as a dealer) and suddenly joins events. Or, Josh Miller, who plays Reeve's little brother, Tim. They seem to be the most apathetic of them, at least to the end of his emotional breakdown. Certainly not peppy 80s teenage fare, of course. And certainly this point is remarkably clear about the serious distance that these kids are dealing with (despite the bizarre series of events) thanks to the many great performances around them (even Reeves proved some acting ability). Help the comedy to recover if you kick too hard.
