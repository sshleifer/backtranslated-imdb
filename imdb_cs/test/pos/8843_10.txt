This is one of the most distinctive horror movies I've ever seen in my life. Forget the exorcist and all the other humorous horror movies out there. John Carpenter went on a tour-de-force horror epic with superb special effects of great performances by Kurt Russell et al. And a great soundtrack that will haunt you forever! The biggest thing about this movie after 17 years is it's has'nt dated it looks fresh and new and you don't want to get many movies like this. Back in 1982 it was against E.T. and of course it failed and it was a box bomb. Over the years, THING has been a cult following of video and t.v sales and so many new fans. In the end, this movie will kick your ass and I like it never loses the edge of scare your pants out of me and that horror movie. Long live John Carpenter !!
