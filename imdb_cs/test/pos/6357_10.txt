First of all, I have to say that I do not speak Spanish and I usually do not like Spanish speaking films ... But two coyotes are an exceptional film. There are plenty of action and hard dramas that don't matter that it's a Spanish-speaking movie. Subtitles were easy to read and didn't block action - OR drama! <br /> <br /> I would like to tell fans of Spanish-speaking films and non-fans of Spanish-speaking films to watch this movie. The action and drama is worth every penny. <br /> <br />
