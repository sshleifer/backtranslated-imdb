The Story for this game line is very jerky, where writers seem to have tried to find ways to justify how a character appears in certain areas of the world map in Soul Tales. As has been said, this is the only thing I have about the game. The beginning of the FMV is spectacular with breathtaking scenery and interesting new devices such as the ability to create and design your own character and your own Martial Arts Discipline. There is even a second story mode that is a substitute for the annoying Story design of Souls of Souls. The parts of the FMV during Tale of the Souls are also interactive where you can decide the fate of your character. a certain degree that is an interesting feature. <br /> <br /> With many character combinations you can create, different paths you can explore in Tales of Soul and Chronicle Swords story mode, this game will keep fans of Beatem up / RPG for a while!
