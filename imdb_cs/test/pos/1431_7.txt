But today it is quite dated. Otto Preminger made this film without a certificate of approval. It was extremely bold and risky because it could lose its investment and future. <br /> <br /> The film is not true to the beautiful book and is unfortunately hollywoodized. Frank Sinatra (and I've Never Been a Fan) to Play Frankie Machine, is amazing in his performance. One forgets that there is Frank, the level of realism he brings into the role of a drug addict must be seen to be believed. Kim Novak, eternally beautiful and talented, will not disappoint the role of a devoted outsider, always there for Frankie. Supporting roles, especially young, handsome and talented Darrin Mc Gavin, are flawless. Eleanor Parker, who plays Frankie's wife, is hopelessly inept. Swinging from irritating to melodramatic and too high. Forgetting performance. A herd of cheap and inexpensive environments is frightening, as if the gust of wind was on the horizon all sticky paper. Almost laughing in times of their foolish cheapness. The music was uncomfortable, sometimes unpleasant. As if any of the scenario nuances (example: when Louie gets Frankie's fix from the drawer) had to be highlighted at a high level of decibels. 7 out of 10. Sinatra really earned her Oscar nomination. Worth seeing.
