Notorious big budget flop when released. Inspired by Robert Altman, this comedy has some amazing moments and occasionally inspired casts. Although it goes on to long losing its focus entirely, there is enough humorous moments that will keep the curious viewer watching until the end. If you are a fan of actors and actresses, it will be a pleasure for you; You will get to know so many amazing little-known artists throughout this movie (you don't need to know their names, but you know their faces), the heck and the child of the Christmas story will appear in a small part. If you borrow from Netflix, if you read it, I bet you will like it.
