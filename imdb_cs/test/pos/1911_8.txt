Classical blaxploitation, this film was severely influential in rap music for "toasts" that Rudy Ray Moore performs. Toasts are long rhyming stories that are funny and bring a point, and you can see how they would naturally develop into rap. For more information about toasts, Rudy Ray Moore, and why this movie is important, go to Dolemite.com. <br /> <br /> Which allows us to talk about the film itself. This movie includes many "laugh-to-funny-outfits-and-hairstyles" bang for a buck, because almost every shot has some kind of outrageous element or dialogue. It starts when Dolemite is released from prison to find out who framed him and brought him to justice. I didn't know the prisoners were letting people out to prove their own innocence, but it's me, I'm a novelty on the prison scene. He is assisted by Queen Bee, who is the leading prostitute of Dolemite and ran in the brothel when he was gone. She also put all her prostitutes in karate school, so now she has an army of female karate fighters. This movie I watched in two parts, which is usually a mistake, but in this case Interesting contrast. The first part I watched at lunchtime during exercise, and I didn't really enjoy it. Did it seem like a particularly bad blaxploitation, with an absurd story, a greedy craft? Well, I think it sounded like it was SOME handicraft art and tons of outrageous sites, clothes and dialogue. But I didn't like it, in fact, I felt dirty. Let's face it, a white man watching something like this laughing at clothes and things that characters say is basically getting the joy of being racist: how ridiculous the blacks dress, what stupid things they say. I didn't feel it, I wasn't laughing and I was looking forward to the rest. Later that night, when I was in a "much more relaxed state," I watched the rest and loved it legitimately. Like Disco Godfather, which I watched a few days ago, this core has warmth and sweetness that makes it likable even if it's silly or violent. The Dolemite character has a parody that makes the whole thing fun, and the appearance of several actors who were also at Disco Godfather suggests that we are pursuing a group effort of a bunch of friends who want something fun. Even bad dubbing, karate fighting and everything else just makes it much more charming. What's interesting about Dolemite movies is that they have some moral ambiguity I don't see in other blaxploitation movies and certainly in a few mainstream movies. There's an African-American woman who talks about the (white) mayor and says, "He did more for the black community than anyone else." Later we find out that the mayor is, surprise, corrupt, but I like that the film would introduce this woman as basically misleading and not try to redeem her in another way. There is also a Hamburger Pimp character that is presented as a useless junkie, and no one is trying to find some redeeming, socially positive angle to what is, just is. The Disco Godfather Religious Character Lady Reed Plays is presented as just nuts for not wanting to pray for their baby, hopelessly lost to angelic dust. I like the fact that these movies would represent such a cruelly critical depiction of people in their own community without sugar coating or trying to redeem them to make them tastier. There are plenty of gloomy elements, such as when Dolemite says, "Move and let me pass, or I'll pull these Hush Puppies from muthatf ** **." There is Queen Bee reaching and answering the phone: "Dolemite is Total Experience." And you won't be able to skip (even if you may want to cover your eyes) a prolonged naked scene by the Mayor. I'm all for the muservioid pervy of the older man, but do I have limits? - And my limits are usually a few miles behind most people, so be warned. The DVD I had is clearly edited, as can be seen in some of the dialogue scenes, and at the end when killing the hero, Dolemite, with his bare hands seems to exclude the main event. Get DVDs, however, be sure to watch all three Dolemite trailers as they are hoot. I didn't want to watch The Human Tornado, but after seeing the trailer, I believe I am. Also there is a scene in a Dolemite trailer that I don't remember from the movie, when Dolemite is swinging in a Mexican-looking thief, apparently missing, and the guy turns to the nearby car trunk. After looking at the first half, I wanted to skip it and watch Disco Godfather, because filmmaking and the story have marginally improved, but after I really enjoyed the second half, I recommend watching this through Disco Godfather, as this one is even more exuberant, outrageous and good-natured? and it has toasts that, even if you don't understand the roots and nuances of the form, are still something to see. --- See other reviews on my website for bad and cheese films, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
