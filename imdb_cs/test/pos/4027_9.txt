Last night, we saw La Spettatrice @ at the Chicago International Film Festival and we were both impressed. This is a creepy story of loneliness and missed connections in which the desire for intimacy runs counter to our fear of knowing too much about yourself. The three leaders (Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are excellent and the dynamics between them are very surprising. After all the films that devalue older women, it is amazing to see Flavia (who is a professor of law at the University of Rome) presented as beautiful and sensual while seductive and powerful. We are convinced that when a younger woman enters a "mix", an older woman will be jealous of a younger woman, a man will leave an older woman for a younger woman, etc. However, the emotional truth of this film is much more complex. Highly recommended.
