Nazarin is a saint, he wants to live in life just as Christ taught man to do. But it's too late: now the Catholic Church is among the hands of a wealthy bourgeoisie, the bishops live in luxury and don't give a damn about the poor and the sick. his way to purity, he is attached some kind of Mary Magdelene and a woman who attracts him sexually (the scene between this girl and her fianc√© tells). In Spain (that was in the late 1950s), they thought Nazarin was a Christian film! With Luis Bunuel's consciousness, he was utterly inconsistent: all his work was anti-clerical to failure.Comparing Nazarin and his "holy women" to Jesus is nonsense. On Nazarin's path, only brambles and couch grass grow. His attempt to help the working men on the road is a failure, he is being chased as a striker. All his words mean nothing. At the end of the road he is arrested and offered to a Naples woman (Bunuelian sex symbol). Thanks to "Nazarin", Bunuel was allowed to return to Spain (where the censors had no idea) and drive "Viridiana".
