This movie was a new direction for Natalie Portman. A much more mature role, even if it comes from the child's footprints in the movie itself. Ann, (Portman) and Susan Sarandon, who plays her divorced mother, Adele, travels from a small town in the middle of nowhere to Beverly Hills. There, these tortured souls try to cope with their new life and their new relationship as Portman's character grows. Unknowingly first Adele, she grows up and becomes a better mother for it. Ann sees her mother saying she wants to be an actress or she thinks so. Adele uses this crutch every time there are problems in their lives. We see their struggle when their mother and daughter come to terms with each other and with their loneliness, leaving behind their old lives. The meeting is the highest in both cases. They seem to become the mother and daughter in front of their eyes. You can almost feel that there is a bond outside the actual movie. Although this movie doesn't really take us on any new grounds in these types of movies, the fact that acting is well done and the story isn't too faulty, let me recommend it. However, I will say that it will soon be over, I do not believe it can have the power needed for the big Christmas of the movie season starting in the week. Look at it before it happens when you like one of these actresses.
