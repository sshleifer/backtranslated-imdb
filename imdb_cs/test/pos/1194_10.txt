Totally awesome! Humor, up-beat music and anti-war reports make it the best movie I've ever seen. First, I love how clever this movie is, especially in Vietnam parts of the conspiracy. It is interesting to see how military officials advocate making them look ridiculous. Follow it with the serious situation of real war, and then the conclusion (which leaves me anger at war); and yet there is no violence on the screen. Wow. <br /> <br /> Music is also great. But what is unique about this musical (unlike Evity or Wizard of Oz, for example) is that the lyrics do not tell a story. Mood does (along with visual and inter-song-dialogue): "Donna" is a positive song that highlights a happy mood, while "Flesh Failures" has a driving, intense rhythm, in a smaller key. I noticed that the LSD scene wasn't too flattering. I'm not going to do drugs now (not that I intended to). <br /> <br /> All the things that are being considered are amazing movies. The only negative comment I could say is that it is sometimes difficult to hear a dialogue. But who cares? 10/10 Stars!
