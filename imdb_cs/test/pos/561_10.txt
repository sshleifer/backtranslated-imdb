Art imitates life imitates art. Atticus Finch is reincarnated into D.A. in this tragic and gripping documentary that plays more like the one who did it - and how it happened. The authenticity and sometimes reluctance of individual honesty makes this convincing story in many layers. Although racism is one of the themes, there are other elements, such as work ethics, integrity and grief management, which has led me over and over to view this film. Music goes, but not distracting; Stimulation and visual effects are such that you do not believe that they are real people who experience an authentic experience.
