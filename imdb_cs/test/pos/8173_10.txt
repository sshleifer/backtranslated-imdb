I have nothing but good to say about this tasteful and cordial movie. I think the director's / writer's efforts are both bold and inspiring. I loved this film not only for the fantastic story (which had to be said), but also for the way the actors added the story. This is not another shallow "gay movie" that captures stereotypical characters in humorous situations. This was an unforgettable and flawless effort to show people that love does not really know the boundaries, and love is still as beautiful and beautiful as ever. Another thing that touched my heart was how well I could relate to the emotions depicted in this movie surrounding one of the main characters. We all have to go through similar situations living in the society in which we live and feel detached from everything that is "right" and "normal." I praise this most beautiful and daring story.
