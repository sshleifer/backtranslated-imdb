OK, if you would judge the movie in those days when it would not fit well. If you watched FI now on stage and everything was pretty cheese (I agree) But it wasn't all the films in the 80s like this (Gilligan, Wonderwoman, aso). But even people born in the early 70s or earlier have cult status. Evertime plane was on approaching Tattoo would run up tower ring bell and its accent would shout "Da Plane BOSS Da plane" and you'd be wondering what everyone wishes to be.People who were born in the mid 80s or later wouldn ' t understand hippe because if you watched it now.It don't have Harry Potter, Jurassic Park Computer Animation FX.It was just a stage where you probably could almost see a wire attached to a guy who wished he was too capable of us during that time it was FANTASY ISLAND.
