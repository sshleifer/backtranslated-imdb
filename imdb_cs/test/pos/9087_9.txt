Cocky medical students play a chicken with a process that simulates death, in an effort to obtain (perhaps even a temporary) view of the afterlife. Some conspiracy and plot motifs are a bit off the mark and acting sometimes goes over the top. But the basic message - forgiveness of God and others for our real or perceived sins - is positive and unique in the cinema and the cast is very good. The last succession between Julia Roberts and her father is so effective that I still think about her for years after I saw her. Highly recommended.
