I was looking at The Reader at Sugar, which is not the best place to watch anything, and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well involved and it was clear that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and crews well. But it was a story and it's a van that really made this short shine. Duncan Rogers' narrow script was just what he needed to do "shorts" this evening. Nor did it occur, as several victims did, or they preached to us. The reader was a simple storytelling in his best form, well occupied by Rogers, and acted beautifully. Of course, Duncan Rogers is a director with the ability to put all the pieces together, looking forward to his next completed project. TO.
