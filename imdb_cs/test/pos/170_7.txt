We apologize for "extremely smart" summary phrases. I don't know what I was thinking about, but I really couldn't help it. <br /> <br /> I've long wanted to see 'Bloody Birthday' and I have to say that it was a nice surprise to find a copy of this movie by chance and at such a low price. And believe me, I live in a small South American village and these things are very unlikely. It's a pity that some of these 'gems' from the 1980s are almost completely forgotten. 'Bloody Birthday' is one of those films that age surprisingly well enough to remain observable today. It's not a masterpiece for sure, but still fun and guess what? ... it really doesn't have unintentionally funny scenes. I know it's a shock if we realize it's a low budget since the early 1980s about a group of bad kids who kill people. But believe me, the film will maintain respect and be largely observable. In Blood Birthday, the story revolves around three children who were born during a total eclipse. According to astrology, during an eclipse, the sun and the moon block Saturn, which controls emotions. As a result, three children who were born that day eventually became indomitable and evil. Since they have no feelings of remorse, these decades of children will basically compete against anyone in their way, including their parents and siblings ... and killing them! The number of bodies is increasing every day, and police authorities believe that a psychopath is lurking around the site. Meanwhile, Debbie, Curtis and Steven, do not hesitate to keep people who behave because no one seems to suspect those sweet angel faces (?) <br /> <br /> As I said before, 'Bloody Birthday' is Surprisingly NO funny. I know I said it before, but I'm really surprised. I was expecting some merry bad scenes, but the movie showed me wrong. True, it is not exactly what most people would regard as "serious" horror, but if I have to be fair, I would say that the story is fairly executed. One of the most important reasons why we would normally expect laughter situations (like me) is because in these kinds of movies, where the main villains are children, young actors tend to be utterly terrible and make the whole thing ridiculous. Let's face it: children tend to be horrible actors, which is understandable and we can't blame them. But to my surprise, the three young actors who played the ruthless murderers in this film looked very disturbing and not at all funny. The rest of the actors are also good and if you are a fan of George Clooney, you can see his uncle playing the doctor in this movie. Yeah, I know, right? ... who cares? Also Julie Brown, a great actress, singer, comedy and gay icon, gives a solid performance as a naughty older sister and if someone is interested in nudity: she also reflects and looks great in one of the scenes. Too bad she didn't have more time on the screen! Julie's 'absolutely wonderful': P <br /> <br /> So basically, this movie is fine if you're in the mood for some humble horrors of the 80s. My only objection to a "bloody birthday" would be a way to justify children's motives. This is perhaps one of the lowest points of the film. Let's see: if the children who were born during the eclipse end up being heartless killers, then how were the three who were the only ones who actually murdered people? I'm sure there were other children who were born the same day ... and on other days of total eclipse too, oh well! Overall, no big deal, it's just a simple observation, that's all. I saw worse, believe me. Take, for example, "Children" (1980), in which a premature killer gets evil after a spoiled zombie. No, believe me, 'Bloody Birthday' is much more respectable and if you like simple slashes, you'll enjoy it a lot. So now you know: children's birthday party ... and the hosts will offer you a delicious poison cake for you and other guests. Come on, you can't miss;)
