Finally, the gangster movie is worth watching! Jennifer Tily should be nominated for her role as a hard femme killer fatal! This movie flies like a bird, just a quick non stop Gangster Mayhem! Jennifer Tily is so beautiful and bad in this movie. I was shocked to find Faye Dunaway still alive! The cast in this film is so adapted to their roles. <br /> <br /> The real great soundtrack goes alongside you to the Spanish soul of this movie. The story is original deep and poetic. This film has a lot of stuff and never rests. The Spanish Fire Gang sets everything on the screen. Damian Chapa is a joy you can watch and film Star. <br /> <br /> Sit back and enjoy the ride.
