There's no doubt that Eddie Monroe's indie movie is one of the better independent movies I've seen for a long time. The highlight for me was Paul Varia's performance. First I saw Paul, or "Big Paulie" when he was called to India by Danny Provenzan "This Thing Of Ours". Fortunately, "Eddie Monroe" filmmakers did the same and used Paul's undeniable skills in a principled role. Performance (camera and voice utilization), which in the very near future indicates that it deserves a large budget role. It's refreshing to see a trained actor who is dedicated to business, proving the same to the audience. Maintain Big Paulie's good job and see you soon in Hollywood! It's not bad for a Canarsie boy, huh?
