In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about foreigners. Steven Spielberg is ET, and John Carpenter is the thing. Of these, ET was the one who won the hearts of people around the world, even though The Thing made his first debut. Since people were so excited with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feeling of extraterrestrial fables, they stayed away from The Thing in horrors. It is not difficult to understand why. Both are diametrically opposed. One of them is an optimistic story designed to warm the frogs of an ever-beating heart. The second is a rough, uncompromising film that paints extraterrestrial life as something purely determined to destroy us. I think the audience felt ET was a much more advanced prospect than Thing's tentacles and slim-coated saliva! It took some time, but Thing went on to win over a prominent cult audience. How should it. Because Thing is a rare example of excellent remodeling. Utilizing all the finest features of the 1951 classic, it revives them in surprising and imaginative ways. Indeed Carpenter is doing his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch equal to the showrunner genre, Alien. And that's even more rare! Carpenter's film follows his source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World. It keeps frigid waste of Antarctica as an environment because it is the perfect background when you try to create an increased sense of isolation. But even though the characteristics are a bit thin, the remake gets right into the actors' thoughts and intensifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them. Kenter Russell's co-worker often returns when he returns to success. Escape from New York, once again occupied as one of the eternal anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, a helicopter pilot at a research station in Antarctica (someone is estimating what they're researching). The problem begins when a Norwegian helicopter from a nearby station flies over MacReady, trying to shoot down Siberian Husky from the air. Finally, they die of their problems and when the camp tries to solve the problem of the secret of what happened, they take Husky and add them to each other. Except Husky isn't Husky at all. But the alien changing shape. The Norwegians found that they were freezing in the ice and slaughtered their crew when they thawed. Able to absorb your sacrifices as you wish, it can duplicate a living being to the smallest detail. Soon paranoia and suspicion work through a 12-man crew until nobody is sure who is human and who is not. The thing is one of John Carpenter's best films. In fact, I am tempted to tell you my best film ever. They even surpass classics like Halloween and Dark Star. The reason I am instead of Thing at the top of the Carpenter list is that she feels like the last of his film that could actually be called a classic. Then everyone else felt as if Carpenter had collected it. Films that did not run with cold sophistication and ragged intensity that prevailed in his earlier work. But The Thing had John Carpenter at his peak. He has never created tension to such an unbearable degree. Neither in a furious attack on Precinct 13. Since the second stranger is his presence known, Carpenter ratchets up a tension level tirelessly. And when he delivers his punches, he comes with a painful shock. The film is a mixture of pure atmosphere and visceral horror. An approach that can often seem to interfere with others, but in Carpenter's hands is beautifully connected. It brings Rob Bottin of The Howling fame and tries to carry some of the most remarkable transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror movie. Amorphous shapes. The half-created human features contrast sharply with the open jaws, the spider's legs, and the fully elastic tentacles. Indeed, the effects of the film are so amazing and deceiving, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic! This type of thinking is completely missing. This only shortens the film's values. And there are many. The carpenter merely states the effect when he needs it. It's a quieter moment in the movie where it seems to be especially tuned to the story. The thing is often the overwhelming story of shadows, whispers and consequences. Characterization has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works in his favor. Since we hardly know anything about casting, the current situation is much more confusing. We have never been sure, from one moment to the next, who is who. And thanks to that, The Thing keeps very good and keeps the mystery on the following views. Special mention should go for an excellent movie score from Ennio Morricone. A pulsating pounding sounds every two seconds. It creates a scary, scary feeling that is very hard to shake. The whole movie is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene in which they test each other to see who is punished with a human being with so much dexterity can find pieces of nail without realizing it. The thing is pure, pure classics. Even the end gives you a vague suspicion that not everything is solved. An underestimated film that is worth rethinking. And much better than ET!
