This is a great German slasher, which is often quite exciting and creative, with a fun story and solid performance. All characters are cool and Benno Fürmann is great as a psycho killer, and Frank Potente gives fantastic performance as the lead. It took a while to run, but it was never boring, as well as some good scenes of death, and the music is amazingly scary. I was fortunate enough to get a subtitle version instead of a dubbed one, and I thought all the characters were pretty nice, plus it's very well done and also written. It has some really good plot twists too, and the effects are very well done, plus the end is great. The finals are particularly exciting and, in my opinion, Frank Potente was the perfect casting choice, and I wish Arndt Schwering-Sohnrey (David) wasn't killed so soon because he was a really great character. There were actually a few moments where I felt uncomfortable, but in a good way, and I must say that this film deserves everything that is praise, and while it has a plot of hole, it is not enough to defend the film. This is a great German slasher, which is often quite exciting, and creative, with a fun story, and solid performance, I highly recommend this!. The direction is great! Stefan Ruzowitzky is doing great! Work here with great camera, very good angles, great close-ups (see introductory sex scene), great work of adding a spooky atmosphere and keeping the movie at a very fast pace. There's enough blood and blood. We get the corpses open, plenty of very cruel operations, lots of bloody stings, people are autopsy while we're still aware of cutting off your finger, suicide, gutting, bloody crevices, lots of ominous-looking frozen bodies, lots of blood and more. The acting is very strong! Franka Potente is fantastic as the main leader, was very sympathetic, remained under pressure, was vulnerable, easy to see, and we were able to take care of her character, the only time she seemed to suffer. some bad dialogue exploded here and there, but it wasn't very often, it was amazing! Benno Fürmann is excellent as a psycho killer, he was just cool, and wonderfully OTT, he really gave me the creeps, and was one effective killer!. Anna Loos played her role very well, like a clever bitch, I dug it up. Sebastian Blomberg was great as Caspar here, he was quite sympathetic and had a mysterious character, his chemistry with Potente was also at the end, and there were big twists at the end. Holger Speckhahn was good as Idiot Phil and did his job well. Traugott Buhre is good as prof. Grombek. Arndt Schwering-Sohnrey was great as David had a really great character and I wished he didn't kill him so soon. Do the rest of the cast well. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this great German slasher! *** 1/2 of 5
