I had to be a little skeptical when I entered the cinema to watch OSS117: French comedies now tend to be so happy that only the dumbest ones are at the national box office. But I was surprised that although humor does not always reach the level of monthly Python, many references to the French vision of the world in 1950, presented by OSS117, are cheerful and the director has managed to re-create the film style. at that time with amazing loyalty. In short, a little good surprise, not to mention the excellent performances of various secondary actors. And at least once, the Jean Dujardin style (which can get on the nerves of many people) perfectly matches the character he plays.
