It's quite surprising that this amazing movie was made in 1949 because Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand regarding the black and white issues at the time. The film deserves a strong way to engage this attitude, for it has exceptional gameplay from its predominantly lesser-known cast, and for a super-intelligent scenario that does not hurt the audience or make an easy way out when it comes to white racism. Plus, with a somewhat modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job! Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who has played supporting roles in many era movies) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south. The crowd could take care of the details in detail - they're just hellish curtains. And despite his commitment to the law, one city lawyer who agreed to defend him also assumes that he is guilty and really does not want to know the truth - just delay hanging up until he can try to condemn him and then have LEGAL hanging! Fortunately, a young white man (Claude Jarmin) becomes interested in Juan's innocence and begins to seek the truth. At this point, the best character in this wonderful drama is introduced - played by Elizabeth Patterson (an old lady who later played Mrs. Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY). The only hand steals the show as a white person who not only has a conscience but a will and determination to stand up for a black man. At one amazing spot in the movie, the crowd tries to push it around to get to the prisoner to kill him, but she stands very tight and makes them go back down. There is much more to this rather complicated but intelligently written story, but I'll let you see it for yourself. You will see it with your children if you have a chance - you will have an amazing dialogue on how far they have experienced racial relationships over the past 50 years. By the way, apparently, 1949 was a great year for Hollywood to finally tackle head prejudice, as Twentieth-Century Fox also released "Pinky" - an equally effective and powerful film about racism, interracial marriage and even rape! Check out both movies if you can.
