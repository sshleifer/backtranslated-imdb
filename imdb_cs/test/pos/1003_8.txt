Keira Knight is so ... So we will automatically compare this film with insult. In addition to being a war movie and its appearance unusual, these films are totally different. The actors work well, I think one good thing is that there is no memorable person, they are a team. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie in which things happen, then we advise you how the story of this film is about human interaction and their physics damaged by their experience and how their lives blend together. > <br /> This film has a real interaction, a perfect moment to pause, thanks to which you will hold your breath. It's not exciting, but it's a grip if you can empathize with these characters. At times, I wondered if this movie could be better than a play, rather than a movie. We expect a lot of movies, because everything is possible, yet we allow the theater to interact and rely on faith. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a blockbuster, if you feel nothing, there's something wrong with it. And let the film take you, move it, let you forget these stars and not judge them as actors, but let them become people you will really move around. Go for it! ! Give it a chance!
