If Christopher Nolan had done Memento before he followed, then all the follow-up errors would be fixed. In Mement, Nolan perfectly designed the switches. We were able to tell when it was the past, when it was up to date, etc. Nolan was experimenting with it and it just doesn't work. Although he had a small budget and couldn't use color (which is one way Memento worked), it was too hard to distinguish between time. DVD is a feature that allows you to play scenes in chronological order. After watching I wanted to write a review, so hopefully it will make more sense, but of course it did not work. You can't blame Nolan for not having come up with original ideas. The young man, Bill (Jeremy Theobald), is bored, so he decides to watch random people on the street. He finds one, Cobb (Alex Haw), that particularly attracts him. Soon, Bill becomes friends with Cobb and goes with him as he breaks into the house and robs them. Then a young blond (Lucy Russell) enters her youth and the film becomes even stranger. <br /> <br /> The End After is one of the most shocking endings I've seen. Sure, the Fight Club had an amazing end, but the way After's ended was amazing. I felt like somebody was on my head and gave me a concussion. Nolan has a good ending thing (well, maybe not, I could guess Insomnia from a mile away) and can really create a great story. The following may not be the easiest to watch or watch, but it's such a finely crafted, original story with a shock that will probably want to watch all 70 minutes. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> R rating for language and some violence.
