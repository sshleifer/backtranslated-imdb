I really enjoyed this film and I'm not a fan of classical music. The story of a tough street boy discovering classical music and changing his way was great to watch without being sentimental or too incredible, although some details scratched my head (Frankie and his dog can live in the school basement without any students or teachers who make him they discovered where he ate, bathed, sometimes changed clothes to feed his dog, the school owner didn't think it would be important to alert the police that she was missing. )). But we can let such unrealistic details slip and enjoy the moving, fun and slightly exciting (for me anyway) story and beautifully gifted children. I loved the scene with mothers standing on their shoulders on the stairs that prevent police from entering school: I doubt they would avoid it today. And I liked the nice touch about how a boy Frankie stole the tables on him (although it never went anywhere), and Frankie's friends helped him. <br /> <br /> All in all, a great movie for everyone!
