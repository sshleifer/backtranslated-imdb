He saw this movie when it came out and then a couple of times later. I'm watching it 20 years later and it's still a very good story. Is it a "lifelong film network"? Yes, but life has unfortunately not existed yet, so it had to be in the air. The cast was excellent. The story was a bit schmaltzy; two women became close friends and didn't even know a friend that she had an affair with her other friends' husband. She is invited to a house for a party where she learns that her lover is the husband of her best friend. She is horrified and tries to break the affair. Shortly thereafter, he is tragically killed in a traffic accident that is devastating to both women. Of course, the wife finds out by accident about this matter and wants Holly out of her life now, but their friendship is able to win because they need each other. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good story of great cast and performance. I really enjoyed it.
