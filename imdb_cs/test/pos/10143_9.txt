The man who knew too much (1956) is a remake of the film, which Alfred Hitchcock did in England in 1934 with the same name. In my opinion, his later efforts are far better. Many critics and fans of Alfred Hitchcock will argue that the remake is mediocre and does not have the backbone of the original tension with Peter Lorre. In both films, the storyline is essentially the same, except in the original it is set in Switzerland and a remake in Marrakech. It tells the story of a married couple {James Stewart and Doris Day} on vacation with their young son and a meeting with a suspicious man who is very curious about their past. It's just, he's an agent looking for a couple involved in a conspiracy to assassinate a world leader. Then he gets Marrakeck on the market because he finds himself a spy and continues to fall into Stewart's arms. The dying tells him the whole story of the plot of the assassination. Stewart and Day then find that the next couple they met was a couple who searched for and kidnapped his son. The film features Stewart and Day's outstanding performances, a straightforward dramatic role, as a troubled and frightened parent. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is top. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat every minute. The scene at Albert Hall is classic. The original is so slow and drab. I don't know how people can compare two. Just watch a remake and you'll get it.
