this movie has a decent story in my opinion, a very good battle scene, but at the end of the movie I was a bit disappointed. I think it was a better way if lydie denier knew karate also knew, or if she knew she would use some weapons. , her character has become even more interesting and she was a decent rival to cynthia.i thinks that when the director filmed the last 'battle' between cynthia & denier he wanted to finish the movie earlier so he didn't care how it would end in everything I think cynthia rothrock fans will be very satisfied and watch that this movie is not like 'yes, ma'am'! or sworn justice, but it was fun and cynthia looks amazing in this movie, so my price for this movie is solid 8/10
