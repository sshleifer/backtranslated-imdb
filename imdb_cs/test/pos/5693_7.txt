While on vacation in Northern Australia, Gracie (Diana Glenn), her husband Adam (Andy Rodoreda) and her younger sister Lee (Maeve Dermody) decide to take the Blackwater Barry tour in the swamp for fishing. Their Jim (Ben Oxenbould) guide uses a small motorboat and takes a tourist along the river to a remote location. When they stop, they are attacked by a huge crocodile who knocks over their ship and immediately kills Jim. Three survivors climbed the tree and, when they realized that they would never save their help, they decided to find their way out of their protected place. However, in muddy water, their ship is overturned and the crocodile traces the trio underwater. "Black Water" is a tense, realistic and dramatic low budget movie, and in line with the early warning, based on a real event. The work of the unknown Diana Glenn, Maeve Dermody and Andy Rodoredy is top-notch and gives this simple but scary story credibility. There are many similarities between this film and "Prey" but in different environments. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Medo Profundo" ("Deep Fear")
