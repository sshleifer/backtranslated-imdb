My husband and I both loved this movie. Initially, my husband was skeptical and asked how many points he got for sitting. But after several key scenes, he was completely sucked in and was convinced that this was one of the best films. Kathleen Bates has never been so beautifully loving and the rest of the cast is just fantastic. Thank you for this beautiful movie.
