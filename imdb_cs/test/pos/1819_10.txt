This gem captures the early life of the early 1980s. As a grad grader '83 <br /> <br /> alone, I have to say that Valley Girl (along with Fast Times at Ridgemont High) excels as a teenage film class <br /> <br /> genre. Characters are exact leaders of the era; vapid mall chicks, pseudo punk rebels, preppy athletes are all <br /> <br /> represented here. <br /> <br /> I've seen it more than ten times. The music in the movie was up <br /> <br /> notch. Unfortunately, these melodies have never been so popular in their era, as those in the arena like Journey, Styx or <br /> <br /> Loverboy. Before there was a soundtrack, I was looking for records <br /> <br /> and tapes (that's 80 years after all!) From Josie Cotton, Sparks, <br /> <br /> Plimsouls and Modern English. > <br /> This film deserves respect. It's not just a good 80's teen movie. It's a great movie. Time.
