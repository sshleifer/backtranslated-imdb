Every Batman fan will know how great movies are, they were a great success. Batman returns however is by far the best movie in the series. The combination of excellent direction, brilliant acting and setting is worthy of watching at night. good job. Danny Devito (a penguin) is a man who inherited a penguin as a child and grew up to become a nasty and ugly ... thing! Michelle Pfiffer plays an elegant and very seductive "Catwoman" after her cats gave her genes to bite. The result in both character changes is excellent and both Catwoman and Penguin man play a very important role in this excellent movie. Mysterious Catwoman is a great fun to watch - her classic sayings and the funny part she jumps with the whip in a jewelry store adds to the fun of the movie. Danny Devito also does well, his ability to impersonate some strange creatures was vital, and the film adds a great atmosphere that brings us back to the boring sewers where he lives. You can't forget Batman. Micheal Keaton is again attracted to comfort and shows us a different side to Batman. His affection is released when he confronts Catwoman at the end of the film, and his encounter with her when she is a normal man, Selina Kyle, which leads her to be misled in her own home. After they leave, there's a smart part and the movie is full of great scenes. It is worth noting that Bruce Wayne's Bat cellphone is not used as much as in other Batman films, because the close fight and story telling scenes make this film. The winter setting is created perfectly in Gotham City with most of the scenes taking place at night and the city is filled with snow. So if you look at this movie in the summer like me, it doesn't feel the same. Best to watch during the winter. Overall, it's a great movie. All the merits are dedicated to Tom Burton and the cast, they have done an incredible job.
