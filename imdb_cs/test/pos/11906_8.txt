The film was better than I expected. I worked on a short time film when Damien made this movie. Cannon shooting, stunts, and acting performances were pretty good at editing. Better music would have this movie. Some music sounds like hippie days. Damien remembers that you had gangster gangster antiques or hip hop. It was more realistic than blood in the blood out.The casting was chosen real well. \ TSuspectentertaint did a good job in this movie. The film brought back the lifestyle that I use to live. But in the end you will not always win. And in my history this is how it was. I am adapted to the film for the first time I watched it.
