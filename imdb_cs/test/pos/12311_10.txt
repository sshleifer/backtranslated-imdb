Naturally, in a film whose main topics are mortality, nostalgia, and loss of innocence, it may not be surprising that older viewers are rated more than younger. However, the film includes craftsmanship and the completeness that everyone can enjoy. The tempo is constant and constant, the characters are full and engaging, relationships and natural interactions that show you don't need tears of tears to show emotions, screams to show fear, scream to show controversy or violence to show anger. Joyce's story naturally lends the film a structure as perfect as a polished diamond, but the small changes that Huston does, such as incorporating a poem into a neatly set. It is truly a masterpiece of tact, subtlety and stunning beauty.
