A somewhat enchanting image of the European Union is beginning to emerge between the younger generation, with representatives of this group learning to live together in an apartment in Barcelona where they study international internships. The focal point of this story is Xavier (Romain Duris), who could live more with conventional life with his mother in France, but who quickly becomes a leader in the group, helping them deal with landlords and other problems. They learn about life and love quickly. Duris has a healthy look and provides excellent performance. The rest of the cast also plays well. Occasionally they disappear into English when they want to make sure they communicate, unsure about the ability of all their roommates to understand French or Danish or any language. Cinematography remarkable including beautiful views of Barcelona and its famous Gaudi towers.
