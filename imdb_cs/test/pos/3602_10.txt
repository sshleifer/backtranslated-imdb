These critics have to find a new job !!! This film is based on TRUE STORY, which has made history. It beautifully illustrates how love can conquer all in the mist of war and tragedy. The breathtaking Greek Chephallonia captured my heart and soul as if I was there. Blue Eyed Cage and gorgeous Cruz were amazing! Together, they perfectly portrayed how a Mediterranean couple can get closer in time of war. This movie touches your heart as it was mine, you have to go see it !!!!
