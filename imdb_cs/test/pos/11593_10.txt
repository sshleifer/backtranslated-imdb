This small, quiet, harmonious film grows into a masterpiece of human dignity. It is intelligently structured, filled with meaningful small details and important side charts. It tells the story of one man with great humanity without being politically opposed but supporting life as a rare right (not obligation) and emphasizing the right of the individual to choose. He enjoys the wealth of different landscapes (mental and physical) and languages ​​(important detail). An excellent performance by each of the actors, especially the incredible Javier Bardem. His presence on the screen has the power to forget that it's fiction. The film has a wonderful rhythm, is beautifully shot and extremely directed. It makes real talent to make a film on such a difficult topic with understanding, humor and heart. Six stars out of five.
