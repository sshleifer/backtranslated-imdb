Ah! When good actors take bland material! If you're thinking of this movie as a tight police thriller, you may be disappointed. While the situations are very true to life, the plot is on a very predictable clip and you can quite well see what the actors are facing. Indeed, many criminals and secondary personalities are just moving stereotypes. Most of the dialogue is just stupid. <br /> <br /> But! If you love to see good actors get up over this kind of material and do something out of it, then you'll love this movie! Sam Elliott is nothing less than brilliant to note that the character of Detective Falon comes alive with depth and pathos. Those of you who have never seen Elliott's emotional emotional attitudes will be thrilled by the extent of the emotions he captures in this film. And also in the early 1950s, this film looks fantastic! His bare chest scene gives hope to middle-aged men everywhere! Esai Morales does a great job that increases his role as Det. Falon is an eager beaver a new police partner. He could easily have played it as Robin Elliott's Batman, but instead he was breathing into this role with passion and passion. She does this despite some lame lines she has to say. Paul Sorvino is fun to watch! He plays an eccentric police captain. He seems to know he is running away in this movie and he has a ball. It also makes fun of us. <br /> <br /> This movie is very interesting, but it's a great performance! Sam Elliott fans should definitely get it because it's sucking a kick to see it spreading its wings and doing a lot more than it is usually allowed to do!
