I went to the "hunted night", I didn't know what to expect at all. I was really impressed. It's basically a mystery / thriller where this girl who doesn't remember anything gets a "rescued" guy who's past a ride. They both become quick friends and lovers and together they try to find out what's going on with her. Through some vague flashbacks and grim memories, they eventually reach the end and the end is pretty cool. I really liked the setting of this: desolate, postmodern Paris's background with lots of gray sky and tall buildings. Very metropolitan. Groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity. It was surprising in 1980; It seems some time ago. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 children.
