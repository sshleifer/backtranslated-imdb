This movie was fun from start to finish. Everyone in the cinema laughed loudly throughout the movie !! The best characters were Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing, Girl of Will and Grace) and Tanya Manicurist (Debi Mazar). They had the best lines, the best attitudes, etc. Jada Pinkett playing lesbian was really funny, she really played her well and was very convincing. The only bad thing about the movie was the fact that the other two main characters weren't so funny even though the movie focused around them ........ All in all, that's a great movie to go and see with your girls (yes guys, this girl movie through and through!). Enjoy!!!
