Steamboat Willy was not the first cartoon featuring Mickey Mouse. The first American friend movie was "Plane Crazy". "Airplane Crazy" was released on May 15, 1928 in Hollywood, California, in a silent movie format. "Steamboat Willy" was released on November 18, 1928 as SOUND (also released on July 29, 1928 as a silent film). So do "Steamboat .." the first SOUND movie Mickey but not the first movie for a small American mouse. While many game shows used the question, "What was Mickey Mouse's first appearance?" The real answer is "Plane Crazy", not "Steamboat Willy". This data can be cashier on IMDb under "release date".
