Too bad that bad reviewer who didn't like this wonderful movie. What a sad life must lead! This film has more to say about life and relationships than I've ever seen, but it's not dark or preaching as a movie of ordinary people. This is usually funny, though not technically, comedy. The whole thing feels a bit like a fantasy, maybe Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream". Beautiful, intelligent women are plentiful, with wonderful cinematography and a non-offensive script that doesn't miss any rhythm. I look forward to seeing him every time this movie is re-run on the cable. It's like reading a favorite, prized book.
