Finally!!! A good movie created on the most expensive serial killer in history. For those less familiar with Ed Gein, he was basically a madman who was known for stealing graves and moving his victims (which most of the horror fans tore). A contemporary-style film that reflects the bleak plains of Wisconsin perfectly, it's perhaps the most enjoyable horror movie that still shows Gein and his terrible murders. Kane Hodder (Jason of the Fifth Series 13) and Michael Berryman (Hills have I & II's eyes) bring chilling performances in this serial killer, who easily leaves earlier attempts at Gein. I think this is one of the best horror movies released this year (Turistas = 0).
