To be perfectly honest, I was intrigued by the original Sleeper Cell concept. When I watched the best part of the series on FX Channel (UK), my Sky broke, which means I missed the final finals. But what I saw, I assumed it was a great story, a good acting performance and not looking at '24' I thought it was great and it was confirmed for the second season ... > One of the best TV programs I've seen. More realistic and credible than "24." Excellent character development and conspiracy. It is not a bash of Islam, but it gives a thoughtful and thoughtful approach that shows the difference between radical terrorist Islam and true Islam. Everyone should see this show! <br /> <br /> String xx
