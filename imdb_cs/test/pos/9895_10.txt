A wonderful story to be seen by all families. The values ​​of the story, playing and production are the first speed. I highly recommend "Checking Out!" Peter Falk is amazing as an aging actor who wants to decide when he dies, so he can continue to know how things will end and not be "a member of the audience." His three children rush to New York to confront him and try to change his mind. There are, of course, unresolved family issues that need to be addressed, and the script and actors treat them well and with great humor. The story is about a Jewish family, but it could easily be about another family. Maybe it's not a WASP family. Siblings have problems with themselves and with their father. I loved writing and directing as well as acting. All in all, a funny and moving movie.
