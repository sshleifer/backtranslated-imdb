I loved this thing. The most amazing thing about the Pink Flamingos is that it is desperate to be in terrible taste, but it has truly won a cult cult around the world. He says a lot about us (we are people) not. Pink Flamingos succeeded because Waters made the movie he wanted to do. The film may not be disgusting for success, but it may be. When you watch this movie, you see things that are disgusting, but they are ultimately brilliant because they are freely displayed. What we have here is honest personal expression. This film should be watched by anyone who cares for success as an artist, whether in film or in other media.
