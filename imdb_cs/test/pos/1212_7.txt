WrestleMania 6 was held on April 1, 1990 at the SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Rick Martel vs. Rick Martel Koko B. Ware - For what it was, a very solid opening match. Koko was always very popular with the fans and at this point Martel was still approaching the heel talent. Finally, Martel is able to capture a win in a pretty memorable match. Match 2: Colossal Connection (Andre The Giant & Haku) (c) (with Bobby 'Brain' Heenan) vs. Demolition (Ax & Smash) for WWF Tag Team Championship - Andre's Health really terrible, so his performance was really nothing special. The crowd is 100% Demolition in this match. Finally, Haku is chained and we have new champions. After the match, Andre sets out Haku and Heenan and turns to what would turn out to be his last WrestleMania. Match 3: Earthquack vs Hercules - Very short match. The big dominant heels were really popular at the time. R.I.P. both men in the match. John Tenta (the earthquake) did not go so long ago as Hercules. At the end of the earthquake Hercules pins for victory. Match 4: Mr. Perfect vs Brutus "Barber" Beefcake - The first really good night match. R.I.P. on Curt Henning (Mr. Perfect). Really solid action back and forth from both of these talented guys. Brutus will eventually win thanks to a lot of his main fan support during the match. Match 5: 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper vs Bad News Brown - It's not a technical classic but quite a decent battle for WrestleMania. Piper comes out of half black / half white, which is a very classic moment. Eventually, both boys fight twice without having a clear winner. Match 6: The Hart Foundation vs The Bolsheviks - Complete squash game. The Hart Foundation gets an easy victory. Surprisingly, WWE had a branded team at its disposal. It's not unforgettable, but it's good to go back and watch it later. Match 8: Randy Savage & Sensational Sherri vs Dusty Rhodes & Sapphire - A great team of men and women. Dusty Rhodes wears an uncomfortable polka dot outfit. At the end of Rhodes and Sapphire get a victory over "The Macho King" and the sensational Queen Sherri. Match 9: The Rockers vs The Orient Express - Surprisingly the next team's team match. The brand match was much better in this time period. Young Shawn Michaels and his partner, Marty Jannetty, are losing their countdown to the Orient Express. Match 10: Dino Bravo vs Jim Duggan - Duggan gets a decent response despite his American Patriot trick. Bravo, a member of Jimmy Hart's group, comes to the ring with Hart and the Earthquake. Although he has support, Duggan takes victory. Match 11: "Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBias (c) vs. Jake "The Snake" Roberts for the Million Dollar Championship - The First Major Night Event. Roberts was very excited with the fans. The match was pretty good for what it was. DiBiase is able to pick up the win on Roberts. But Roberts ends up owning DiBias' money and putting it away. Match 12: Big Boss Man vs. Akeem (with Slick) - One Man Gang a sad attempt at being an African dream named Akeem. A really short match that needed more time to make it a match. Boss Man wins with slam. Match 13: Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka vs Rick Rude - Heenan comes to the ring with Rude for this match. Snuka, it was never good at WrestleMania. He always seemed to be at the end of defeat. After a short 5 minutes Rude gains victory over Snuka. Match 14: WWF Hulk Hogan Champion vs. Intercontinental Champion Ultimate Warrior - Dubbed as "The Ultimate Challenge", we get a few interesting promotions from both men earlier at night. The match was actually very good because people tend to think that Hogan can't fight. Lots of nearby waterfalls that really got the crowd and the people looking at it at home. Warrior eventually wins Hogan and wins both titles. A stunned crowd watches Hulk Hogan suffer his first loss at WrestleMania.
