Rare lengthy Kinski role role as crazy Johnny sex crazy outlaw who is wanted in San Francisco. Kinski's character is obsessed with rape women by a sexual predator in the Old West who has nothing more than to steal, rape and kill in mind. This movie is perhaps a big disappointment for many Spaghetti Western fans, but not for many Klaus Kisnki fans. Overall, it meant two things for him, a great performance by Klaus Kinsky and great music by Stelvia Cipriani. <br /> <br /> Another story that needed a lot more work than being idle but still fun to watch! <br /> <br /> It would be nice to see this movie reworked in the future. Since most old movies are currently re-made.
