As a word explanation, Disney's "child" has absolutely nothing to do with Charlie Chaplin's 1921 classic of the same name. What we do is pretty nice, though unbelievable, we feel a good family comedy because only people in Disney can provide it. Bruce Willis, in a change of pace, plays the "Level Consultant" self-level stuffed shirt. It degrades not only its clients but also those who are close to it. You know he'll have to change before the final credits. In his life comes a chapter from his past in the form of Willis' character as a stupid 8 year old playing with cutesy convinced of Spencer Breslin cakes (Disney always finds these kids somewhere). This forces Willis to deal with his past and well .. you know the rest. Admiring as Willis' love interest is Emily Mortimer and Lily Tomlin as his executive assistant. Both have little to do, while most of the film includes inter-action between Willis and Breslin characters. "Baby", though not the biggest Disney movies is one nonetheless that you can sit down and watch with your family and leave with a warm feeling.
