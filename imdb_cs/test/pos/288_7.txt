One thing that happened to me while watching this movie is that it was fun / exciting for cast and crew; I felt that they were enthusiastic about dedicating themselves to budget constraints because they seem to love the people involved. I tend to be like B movies that are original and have a heart, and I think it's one such job. It seems to me that the actors put their hearts into it more than usual, perhaps because of some good direction from the main actress / director, and obviously in their parts clear enough to create a coherent, attentive work of art. . The criticisms of this film, which more or less say, "why not just rent a hardcore porn movie," point out why they don't like the movie. Going to this movie and hoping for a lot of T&A without patience with the conspiracy material is so unfortunate for them. It could be said that the film is more of a romantic job than an erotic porn movie, although I take it that the star has done its part in soft porn. I think she graduated. As far as writing is concerned, dialogue is not a big part of the film, as in Tarentino, but the plot is decent and the twists are original and sometimes fun. Especially the end is not a disappointment, but a pleasure with villianess / heroine and "leading man" learning from their complex network of feelings. <br /> <br /> I understand that the producer got 3 movies out of it. Hats for proving tens of thousands of dollars can go far if you have some artistic sensitivity and pride. Gabriella and other girls with nudity scenes were nice together with being hot, not just bimbo-fly, so as an erotic science fantasy figurine with some gorgeous nude art, even with B's B boundaries, no disappointing.
