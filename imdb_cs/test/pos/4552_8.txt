Well, on the day Rob Schneider dives further into the black hole of notoriously bad movies by playing in a totally uninhabited "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo" (hmmmm .... there was no movie And then there is Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo s followed by Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo ....... Smell of pattern, maybe Spiderman: European sites are Hotter ..... or not) I write about this very malevolent (at the time of release) movie. I must admit, I was one of those malignants. I turned to it, although Chris Farley thrust cocaine into his nose and SNL cast fought one of the worst periods in their history in the '94 -95, regardless of the Norm McDonald's Anchorship. Films like Happy Gilmore, Tommy Boy and Black Sheep came out a few years after this period and we realized that it was a dark future for the Spade-Farley-Schneider-Sandler caliber. But I watched this movie the next day, ten years after and 8 years after Chris died and couldn't stop laughing. Yes, it's not particularly sophisticated. Farley does what Farley does (not unlike Manny's Manny) but his "Van Down at the River" motivational speaker shtick in which he laments that while he may not "wash enough" or "wear well-fitting clothing" or "use deodorant" more than twice a week "translates here well as always a self-realizing figure who realizes he's not the brightest, most beautiful, and can lose a few pounds." He also tries to do what he has to do. And David Spade just throws his poisonous shoes off as he did for "Spade Hollywood Minute" and basically stabs Farley's confidence. There really is not much more to say than that. I love one scene when Farley catches Spade's slap of his monkey and then a few people take care of it. He can't remember what's first, but the other one is in the hotel beds and Farley tells Spade: "Do you like baseball?" Spade mutters something inaudible in response, and Farleys says, "New York YANK-ees?" Farley makes his awkward, painfully sensitive, frat-boy shtick. If you like it, you like it. I couldn't stop laughing.
