"Tipping The Velvet" is one of the modern television productions that show that some television can be just as good or even better (as in this case) than what you see in your local theater. <br /> <br /> To read the chart, read this and skip to the next section for more details. This is an unforgettable portrait of an unconventional young girl named Nan, who works as a naive oyster until she discovers her suppressed homosexuality as she falls in love with a successful woman named Kitty, who dresses like a dog for her stage profession. The young girl soon joins the act as another male impersonator and is a big hit. Soon they will both start the selection process. Kitty eventually becomes shrouded in marriage comfort and ravages the young heart of Nan. Since then, Nan has been working as a male prostitute to men who want to have sex with boys, then she becomes a private sex slave to evil and sadomasochistic Diana where Nan experiences severe emotional abuse. When it ends badly, Nan is on the streets again, remembering a young woman named Florence; a good-natured socialist who has a real potential to be a wonderful partner. Tam Nan reveals the power of socialism and learns how to return to fame. Transmission in Region 1 has exceptional image quality, a very good selection of scenes, an eloquent photo gallery and an entertaining conversation between writer Sara Waters and film writer Andrew Davies. Sets, costumes, cinematography and music are wonderful. Acting, writing and directing are extremely powerful and filled with realism, class and originality. I loved the movie and the novel. Section III in the film is different in the film than in the novel because section III in the novel is superbly written, but it's not on-screen material. I will be brave and say that I love his interpretation much more. This stunning historically ingeniously combines Drama, Comedy, Erotic and Romance with vivid perfection in a way that is deeply moving and spiritually uplifting. For every adult and open-minded adult who has ever felt pleasure, pain and strength to fall in love and live life, it's all right. Revolutionary production; absolute need to see!
