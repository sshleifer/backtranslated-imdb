Wildman's Chief Advisor Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray at the top of the nut form in his first lead role) chairs various hacks in the North Star Summercamp. Tripper befriends the sad and lonely kid Rudy misfit (nice and affecting Chris Makepeace's performance). Director Ivan Reitman is distracted from the walls of the comic book at a constant pace. This movie tremendously rests on Breezy'n'breezy summer essence: making friends, first love, pulling pranks, competing in sport with rival camp, campfire singalongs, and, of course, the inevitable scary urban legends about escaping psycho killer with hand. The sense of joyfully hoarse entertainment this image creates is positively infectious. In addition, humor is always goofy and sometimes rude, but never too ugly or bad. Best of all, there's a winning surplus of pure heart that goes along with this humor (the warm relationship between Tripper and Rudy is really moving). The cast has an obvious ball to play their likeable characters: Murray's famous gonzo and galvanizing presence keeps things constantly humming (his crazy PA announcements are absolutely sidesplitting), plus there are audio contributions from Harvey Atkin as the unfortunate owner of Camp Morty, Kate Lynch as Tripper Sassy Old flame Roxanne, Russ Banham as friendly Crockett, Kristine DeBell as sweet, fox AL, Sarah Torgova as Candace feisty, Jack Blum as buzzed bespectacled nerd, Keith Knight as tubby single Larry Finkelstein, Cindy Girling as charming Wendy, and Matt Craven as hip hardware. Donald Wilder's film camera gives the film an attractive, sunny look and handy napkins. Elmer Bernstein's lively and melodic score also makes the trick. A real revolt.
