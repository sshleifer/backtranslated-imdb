I love this movie. Tension with big characters. The "Sandlot" child is excellent, just like Corey Feldman. When kids storm the bank, it's pure adrenaline. Inside the bank it becomes a bit like a "Lord of the Fly" situation, when they turn to each other. Justin Walker of "Clueless" is amazing. I saw it on "Showtime" while surfing the canals. It was a pleasant surprise. James Remar is also quite good here as a city sheriff. Taylor Nichols, whom I love from Barcelona, ​​also has a good job as a Federal Agent. I recommend this movie to all fans of bank robbery movies with lots of good characters. I was shocked to find out that Roger Corman was a producer because the film is not film B.
