I honestly didn't think the movie would make me laugh like hell and admire the great gore effects, boy I was wrong! From the very beginning to the very end, the film showed some great gore effects accompanied by spoofs from other titles like "Evil Dead" and "Gremlins". This film could be compared to the works of Peter Jackson, although this film is not as cruel as "Braindead", but I will surely wait for these guys to make another splash movie.
