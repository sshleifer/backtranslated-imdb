Good work! He was very exciting and had great pieces. The show that really shuddered. It was a great job of all who worked on it; and especially acting on the role of Bobbie Phillips. That would be great on the big screen. Would you like to see more of these movies of the week or maybe a weekly series. That was great fun and I'm glad I was watching! By far the best of three. Keep up the good work of UPN and Bobbie Phillips. I'll be looking for more.
