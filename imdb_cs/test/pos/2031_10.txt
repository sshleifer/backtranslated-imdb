If you like 80's rock, you should definitely see this movie! I only saw it recently and I fell in love with it! <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is very entertaining, giving you a great deal of rock tunes, not even one second of the movie. find boring! It was a great idea that some of the musicians in real life were in what they do best. I was glad to see Zak, just like Blas Elias. I tend to agree with a lot of people who say the first half of the film was much better than the other, specifically in the script. One thing that bothered me was Jennifer Aniston's performance. I thought it wasn't the real person for this role, I just couldn't see her as a rock star girlfriend. But as the movie goes on, you realize that she did a good job with it. sincerity and sincerity that will bring you to live. To sum up, a good and humorous movie that doesn't go deep into the characters but gives you good fun, nostalgia, and of course mighty vocals by Jeff Scott Soto and Mike Matijevic!
