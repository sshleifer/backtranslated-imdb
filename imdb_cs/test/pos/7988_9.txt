When I first rented Batman Returns, I immediately thought it would be less than exceptional. Undoubtedly Jack Nicholson was the best part first, so without him could he be a good movie? Simple, throw in Danny DeVito. Batman returns is probably a darker movie than Batman. There are more villains, less real dark comedy in many aspects, and other issues that are more striking. However, music is similar to the first, if not darker. The scenery is definitely more depressing than the first, every detail up to the season. This film is based on the same comic book format we fell in love with in Batman's first. <br /> <br /> Now for the show. Fortunately, Michael Keaton returns as Batman / Bruce Wayne. He was great in the first film as well as in this sequel. Keaton, like Batman, didn't have enough time on the screen, maybe more in the world! Danny DeVito has awarded The Penguin, the most exhausting, repulsive, kind, angry, evil, sad, miserable, miserable villain who has filmed a superhero movie. You hate him so much, but at the same time you feel so bad. And it explains it to the last detail, which is all the more conflicting. Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent as Catwoman / Selina Kyle. Two completely different personalities in one. In fact, she had come back well enough. Christopher Walken did not disappoint as Max Shreck, a greedy, incriminating, selfish CEO of a power company. Fortunately, Michael Gough returns as a dear Alfred, and he was just as good here. Pat Hingle also returns as Gordon, though I feel he has never been in the spotlight. Batman returns with lots of great twists and sub-lands. 9/10
