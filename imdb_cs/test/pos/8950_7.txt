Again seeing this kind of movies turns me more and more into English humor, not too often seen on screen from Monty Python and Man About The House. Damage. Brenda Blethyn (For the first time I saw in Saving Grace at the beginning of the year, another one has to be seen by the way.) It's just as Alfred Molina does. The rest of the cast, though virtually unknown to me, is also turning to great performances. The film starts slowly and gradually gains momentum and amusement - I had tears in my eyes from laughter. All in all, a witty English movie, a thousand times better than supposedly "funny" garbage comes from Hollywood. <br /> <br />
