Assy McGee is a detective who is out of control, a hard nose, based on countless examples of late 20th-century police dramas. The twist here is that Assy is literally walking the buttocks. Inexpensive, low-front facade of the belies show its cleverness and hidden satire. This does not mean that Assy lacks fart jokes, only that toilet humor is used sparingly enough to produce consistent laughter, not moans and eyesight. The title sequence of the program shows the clever, gentle humor used throughout the text. The succession consists of panning pictures of the city set on the theme of the jazz 1970s. One photo shows a police cruiser and the "camera" approaches the front license plate holder, which is empty. An insignificant zoom-in satirizes the production of a typical drama of the 1970s and 1980s and, by the way, makes me laugh. All Typical Characters Included: A frustrated chief of the police who can't control Assy; a loyal, minority partner who acts as a foil for ruthless Assa; Regular cops who hate Assa's resources ... all are counted and all are cheerful satires of a typical police drama. Assy's voice - wind and grumpy with a bit of drunk slur - is so clever and unique that it ranks alongside all the time greats like Stewie Griffin (Family Guy) and Homer Simpson (Simpsons). Although the voice is vague, the diction is some clear and easy to understand. This is a nice change from other Adult Swim voices that often require closed captions to understand. <br /> <br /> In addition to fantastic production and voice play, the screenplay is also fun. Assy is a non-nonsense directness fuel most of the humor, especially in his interaction with citizens outside the police force. <br /> <br /> If you have access to Adult Swim Comedy, Assy McGee is definitely worth watching. Each clock episode in just 8-9 minutes, so you really have little to lose.
