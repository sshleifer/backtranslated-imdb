Thanks to the IMDb's helpfulness, I managed to watch this movie for the second time in almost twenty years and I can honestly say that none of his kicks have lost. I can't believe Channel 4 left this without a trace, because it's an extremely powerful, moving and moral approach to the consequences of wrong loyalty. Focuses on a group of friends over ten years and their relationship to two "outsiders" from school; specifically how they use one and mercilessly torment the other. As events from the past and the present unfold, the tension gradually densifies, which is not different from the excellent Dead Man's Shell Meadows. Playing, writing and directing are very daring for 1983 and still pack murder despite the fact that the central characters have top accents. Yes, it could be in a public school, but it is a world apart from everything that Merchant Ivory interpreted; I got a state education and I can still draw countless parables from the story. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you'll remember for a long time if you see it - except you probably won't, because Channel 4 (or FilmFour) has decided to bury it. On their own official website, they describe it as an "inexplicably overlooked jewel of the early days of Channel 4" - an overlooked by? It was one of the first films of Channel 4 (which would later become FilmFour due to the success of films like Trainspotting), so someone else has to have a master print somewhere. These days, when you can get an expanded DVD collection more or less, it's a bit moody that they can't give the film as good as the promotion they deserve. So if one of Channel 4's production channels reads this, stop doing programs that show people humiliating themselves in the hope of securing tabloids, chasing this movie, and solving a nice special anniversary of the disc or something , please!
