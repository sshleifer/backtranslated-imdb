This movie was even better than 'Waiting for Guffman'. The great strength in these two films lies in the brilliant character played by the guest and Levy's second secondary city ensemble. If someone finds this film boring or absurd, God will help him, they just didn't get it. It is the mockumentary to which the guest and lions have genius. At the end of the movie, where the guest's southern pet dog tells us that to rest after the show, he went to Israel to work on 'caboose' or when he tells us that ventriloquism is ancient art and we see hieroglyphic <br /> <br /> ancient The Egyptian, who holds a small ancient Egyptian hand in his hand, realized that these are the moments worth living. I thank Mr. Hostes and Mr. Levy, and God bless you.
