This is an excellent documentary about a story I have never heard of before. The first solo, continuous sailing race around the world took place in 1968-69 and took part in several racers. It is a truly fascinating story about man against nature and man. The story focuses on Donald Crowhurst, a tragic figure in this story. The film elegantly combines interviews with shots filmed by sailors aboard their ships. The story is very exciting and sad when we learn about Donald Crowhurst's history. This is one of the best documentaries of recent years. He has real human emotions in him because men face this almost impossible task of navigating the world on their own.
