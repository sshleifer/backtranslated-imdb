Sister Betty was definitely one of the most creative films recently released. It was funny, but it also had many moving moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear, and the rest of the cast did their incredibly weird characters seem real. The story took such twists and turns, making it incredibly enjoyable to watch. If you're sick of recent movie films, see Sister Betty for something completely different. Watch this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out!
