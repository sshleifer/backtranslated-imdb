Wow. this film is the voice of the climbing generation. Director Sam Keith takes us to the darkest depths of the human soul, where we find love, life, and peak. The world-tired Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) follows his heart and anchor through the brain path to find common sense in the post-apocalyptic Colorado. Instead, Telly meets confrontation in Don (Jason Bortz), performing machismo and zeitgeist humanities foibles. The epic film comes to climbax in a thrilling top-level competition that will make even the most spectacular spectators who want to be amazed at dizzying heights. <br /> <br /> This movie has it all: Top-roping out, Top-pass in the gym, Cut-off shorts and sleeveless flannel shirts, amazing climbing shots (some so good you see it 2 or 3 times!) , Bear and Snake Attacks. <br /> <br /> I gave the movie 8 out of 10 because I wanted the romance to develop a little more. The film seemed to lead to a spicy, top-notch sex scene between Telly and his new lover, but unfortunately, it doesn't fit into the already tense hour and half of exciting driving. Cliffhanger Fans and Mission Impossible II find this movie to be a rough diamond. Overall, if you're ready to challenge your world view of humanity and climbing, it's a movie for you !!!
