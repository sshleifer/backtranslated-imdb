This is a passion movie. The passion he depicts is largely misdirected, even for the leader. But that is the incredible power of this film: it shows us that what we believe can be contaminated with nonsense and can even lead us to do things that are destructive - for ourselves or for others. In addition, those who seek to escape passion (watch the druggie who visits the studio) also risk self-destruction. <br /> <br /> The world needs to hear this movie more often.
