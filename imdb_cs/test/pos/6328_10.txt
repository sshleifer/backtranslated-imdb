Fun full of fun, full of silly, if not sometimes cruel jokes. It's not the best of movies, but it's definitely worth watching. David Niven and Stewart Granger are their usual charming self with Granger as a particularly beautiful and sophisticated master. Ava Gardner is as wonderful as ever, with such a wonderful character that is absolutely irreversible. The story is typical but full of jocular surprises, especially when it comes to unconventional relationships between Granger, Gardner and Niven.
