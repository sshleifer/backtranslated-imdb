An interesting and entangled film about "rescuers" who tries to live their days calmly. Elements of the main character appear in later films by Michael Mann, like Thief (1981), Heat (1995), and so on. You can see this in the UCLA Instructional Media Laboratory - one of the only places in the country that has copies easily accessible to the public. It's great!
