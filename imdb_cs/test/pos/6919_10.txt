The first one - what do you think? This is the best movie I've ever seen! Secondly - I don't think it's a British movie set up in Dublin and has mainly Irish actors - Moran, Gambon, Aisling O Sullivan (Rita), Deirdre O'Kane, etc. Third - I thought Moran was excellent. He was cheerfully funny. Micheal Caine seemed to be there just to get Moran's context. Every character he has taken over has perfected. Abigail Iversen I thought he was better than any other child actor I saw. She was believable as a clever child and also as a child and an adult (yes, I know it sounds weird, but hey ...). She even managed to get Caine out. Iversen and Moran worked very well together and were very entertaining in the set-up scene. Barreler (Gambon) was very funny in his insensitivity.
