Uzumaki has a very unique story and I never look at spirals the same way. It's not really the backbone of horror armor, this movie has a dark morose, sour trip to it. During certain parts was it just me, or did you see vortex visuals? Camera shots are interesting and the movie allows your imagination to run. The bizarre supernatural feeling of this film will draw you exactly as the name suggests. Negotiations are going well and setting the city itself seems bad to get started. <br /> <br /> It may take a few glances to sink. Big trippy movie.
