-That's almost the whole soundtrack for this movie. I saw the kid at the Munich Film Festival and shook the house. Director Doug Pray is never seen in this document, nor do I think he is even heard, but has made a very intimate insight into the life and history of the "mixer". He divided his films into eight chapters, and then his diverse group of enthusiastic conversations will spice up to what he is talking about. I've never been so big to "scratch", but the film does a great job of keeping elementary for those who know little, and joking for those who are experts in the field. Mix Mike from the Beastie Boys is in this movie, but after the movie I could name a few heavy hitters in the industry (DJ Shadow, Q-Bert, etc.). The extreme fascination of the turntables of these talented and unpredictable DJs is evident in their explanation of what their music means to them. The film also casts some gratifying light on these boys (and one woman) to be classified as musicians. Pray will not leave his film idle, and if there is a slow scene, it is soon recharged with almost never continuous music. If nothing else, this movie will increase your slang dictionary. I have to go back to "digging", so I'll close this review. We'll see, it'll be interesting. Good things, man. Good things.
