It belongs to their highest level, although there have been others, such as Micro-Phonies and Punch Drunks, that was more deserving of an Oscar nomination than this. But if nothing else, a repetitive speaker announcement, "Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard," followed by Curly "Woo woo woo woo woo", is a classic on two levels. First it symbolizes all that Stoog represent; My daughter loves to repeat the announcement when she's doing something stupid in the middle. Second, the absurdity of these three as hospital doctors; I imagine the horror I'd feel if I were a real patient in a real hospital and I heard this announcement through the loudspeaker. During this brief moment, you will hear this announcement and know that something terrible will happen and the speaker's voice will remain with you for months afterwards.
