Basically, "Campfire Tales" is made up of three creepy stories that a group of friends say after they get into a car accident in a forest after a concert. The film begins with the classic story "Hook" and then we are introduced to a group of friends who go home from the concert. They break the car, spread out some flares, and start the fire in a small, abandoned chapel, waiting for someone to come in with the help of the fire. To pass the time, they decide to start telling classic horror stories, about the honeymooned terrorists, the girl who becomes the prey of the internet predator, and the motorist who turns to the haunted house. As the scary stories tell, every story becomes ever more frightening, but the real shock that awaits them is just the coming ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the last story it tells is probably the most frightening and probably some real, scary effects. The first story was fine, and the succession of the caravan at the end was a bit scary. The second story put a lot of tension, more than one of the others, but it's a non-original plot it was a crash. I remember watching this movie a long time ago when I was eight years old on HBO and the third story scared me, even though it's not scary for me now. You will probably recognize some cast here, especially Amy Smart from the opening "hook" interlude story, and Christine Taylor as one of the main actresses in the film. The end of the twist was also a little interesting, I know I didn't see it, I thought it was all cleverly put together. <br /> <br /> To summarize things if you are looking for a horror that is worth renting, you should be happy. It is a great anthology of some classic urban legends and the whole movie was tied neatly. It is much better than one would expect. 7/10.
