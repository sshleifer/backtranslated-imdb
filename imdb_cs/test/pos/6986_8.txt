It opens with your oversized ship's cliche flying through space. The only thing I thought at that moment was "Spaceballs" and hoping that there would be a sticker on my back saying "We'll break for No one." The film then shows some cryogenic freezers with Vin Diesel narration. I always thought his voice sounded cold because I saw Fast and Furious. From the moment I found myself criminal, I thought the movie would be a cliché. It was. It was very cliché and fate seemed to be against them at every turn. Black every 22 years. Happiness is that they will land that day. Strangers can only be in the dark, hey, it's a solar eclipse. Just as I thought it was too easy and just cliché, the movie stretched and kicked the main @ss. I even went out and bought a copy of Pitch Black after I saw it. I really can't wait for the Chronicles of Riddick.
