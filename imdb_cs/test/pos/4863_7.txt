There are times when you don't want those deep drama series. If you don't want a series of heavy stories or you have to watch every episode to stick to. There are times when you just want to watch a simple series with lots of actions and great characters. For those moments you have Cleopatra 2525. <br /> <br /> I was one of those who really enjoyed Charlie's angels. Critics said it was supposed to be superficial and stupid. But the thing is, it's the right point! People who could not relax and expect a serious film hated him. It's exactly the same with Cleopatra 2525. It's superficial. He has silly and unrealistic characters. And that's why I like it. It's not like any other series. The first season wasn't very good. Cleo was irritating and a little too much. The story was a little lame and you didn't know the characters much. But hey, they only had 20 minutes in each episode. In the last 5-6 episodes of Cleopatra 2525, they eventually gave a series full of 40-minute lengths. And here it began to love. The series finally began to grow into a very qualitative series. Too bad they had to cancel the series. Because the last episodes of Cleopatra 2525 were very good. I will never forget Hel, Sarge and Cleo. Unique characters that only Xena creators could create!
