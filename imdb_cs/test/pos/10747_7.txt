Project A II is a classic Jackie Chan movie with all the kung fu, crazy pieces and slapstick humor you expect. It's not as good as a prequel, but it's a great movie if you want to watch something fun. The story is simple, Jackie Chan versus evil men. So if you want a movie that you don't have to be defending, I would suggest this.
