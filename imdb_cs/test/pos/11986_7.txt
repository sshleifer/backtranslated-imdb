Martin & Lewis must take salt and pepper. Why did Martin and Lewis reconcile? And again, why all women in this movie like Jerry? Because he's innocently likable! Martin sings several good songs (at least once rt-sync'd) and Jerry manages to kiss more girls than in all other movies. In general, I find that I can take so much Jerry's antiquity before they become aggravating. But .... in this movie, watch when Jerry stuck outside on a submarine submarine! EXCELLENT! Buster Keaton was supposed to be proud. Film I Give 7.
