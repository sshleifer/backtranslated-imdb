This movie worked for me because I see this movie as the exact opposite of 'Gone With The Wind'. Farm owners instead of plantation owners. Scarlett fights and konnives for what he wants; Ada is depressed and turns in until Ruby (Renee Zellweger) appears to save the day. A little, around. Deserters instead of officers trying to get back to their families, the lists go on and on. Even the love story was the opposite. If the producer and the writer try to overcome it, it did with me. I didn't just like two things on the movie, the rest I thought it was good, and I liked it enough to recommend it to friends. First, I couldn't see the attraction between Inman (Judaic Law) and Ada (Nicole Kidman) because she was strong enough for Inman to go back to her. Inman told her that he had only written to her several times where Ada had written almost constantly to him. Second, something or someone who killed or died in almost every scene was a bit more. I have to say it was full of action, but after the second scene I knew something or someone died in the next scene. I'd like to be surprised by the next scene, I don't know what's going to happen before she does it. <br /> <br /> I thought all the acting was very well done, with the best Zellweger. She deserved the credit she got for it. I thought she played a part of the Hollywood girl very well. She has to do her homework. Zellweger even said in the film that he is smarter than people think. I think it was true. The law succeeded in returning to Kidman. It must have been a much stronger love to go through it than I thought. During his attempts, he showed a lot of emotion on his face. Kidman's part may have had something to do with picking her performance after two more. Except she was depressed, she didn't show much emotion, I don't know if that was how the part was written, or if it was. Still doing a good job, I just thought the other two were better. I liked the scene with Zellweger, Kidman and the Rooster, although it was one of those scenes I mentioned above. I thought the 'home guard' was exactly the way it had returned. Although we don't hear much about them, they were part of that time. I thought the scenery was beautiful. The film had everything that was good for a historical romance.
