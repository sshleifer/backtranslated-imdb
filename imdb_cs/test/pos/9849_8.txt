Peak Practice was a British dramatic series about a general practitioner in Cardale? a small fictional town in the Derbyshire Peak district? and the doctors who worked there. It ran on ITV 1993â€“2002, and was one of their most successful series at the time. It originally starred Kevin Whately as Dr Jack Kerruish, Amanda Burton as Dr Beth Glover, and Simon Shepherd as Dr. Will Preston, though a list of physicians would change many times over the course of the series. The <br /> <br /> series was set in 2002 and ended in a verbatim cliffhanger when two of the main characters of the series set off from the cliff. Viewers wrote ITV in their thousands and the petition for one last episode was based on the Peak Practice Online website. However, all the reasons were unsuccessful and ITV said they would do no more episodes. Peak practice has been replaced by Sweet Medicine, another medical series based in Derbyshire. It took a few episodes before it was dropped from the plans. Cardale was based on Derbyshire village of Crich, and the series was filmed there and at other nearby Derbyshire towns and villages, most notably Matlock and Ashover. After the end of this program, ITV attempted to launch a sequel series called Sweet Medicine, which extended stories of various characters from the original show.
