Black Water, a co-director and written by David Nerlich and Andrew Traucki, is very simple in its implementation yet effective. The film is a low-budget Australian film that, unfortunately, does not get the recognition it deserves, because it is one of the best in terms of the features of creation. The setup is quite simple; Grace, her husband Adam, and her younger sister Lee travel around the mangroves in the northern territory as the saltwater crocodile flips its boat and lets them get stuck in the trees. The whole movie is about their survival, while the crocodile lurks under a waiting strike. Unlike Roge Greg McLean (another croc killer movie that was released earlier in 2007), Black Water is not about a viewer who has fun arguing who is going to eat on, it's about hope and prayer that the three people will safely step out . Three unknown actors are doing a great job with very demanding roles, since they were filmed on site with a real crocodile instead of CGI. The characters behave realistically in the situation, and the dialogue seems natural and unnecessary. Tension is built throughout the film, we don't see a lot of creature, but just being close is pretty scary. This is the edge of your belongings and highly recommended if you like the original (and most importantly) scary horror movies. <br /> <br/> 4/5
