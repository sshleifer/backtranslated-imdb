Apparently Michael is too cutesy for most action movie fans and Hollywood for intellectual crowds, but I found it extremely funny and very moving, though it is both cutesy and wording. When three skeptics are sent to investigate a man who claims to be an angel who accompanies him on a grand tour of the middle west side to find out that it is each of their own hearts in need of investigation. When you take the film, it differs from each other, as with most films, there is not much new material today, but when taken as a whole, it has a refreshing original approach and is white enough to entertain it all the way. Although not a "family" movie, it is suitable for all ages and a good movie that you can share with your whole family or someone else. "Michael" is not a great movie, but it is definitely a good movie, a moving film and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> KWC
