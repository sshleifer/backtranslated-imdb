The film is about the Battle of Stalingrad. For those of you who know nothing about it, it was the worst battle in World War II. More than 1 million people died during the battle. This is the only film I have seen that seems to have really captured how bad things were in the war between Russia and Germany. I liked the fact that two ideologies (Nazism and Communism) were nowhere in the film. Unlike most American movies, the Germans are not seen as blood thirsty killers, but what was the average German soldier was human. The film revolves around four soldiers fighting in Stalingrad. They were taken there to try to take the city. The film follows these men from August 1942 to early 1943. During this time they learn about the horrors of war and try to find their way out of the battle. despair of the whole battle. Unlike the "Gates Enemy", filmmakers did not try to give some love story of love or to dress up the actual occurrences of battle. This film can be a fiction, but it expresses what happened in the bloodiest battle of World War II.
