For the first time I saw this movie in the mid-1980s and thought it was a funny movie. As I got older I watched this movie for various reasons. I like it when I feel sad / nostalgic for my "lost youth". I was a teenager (14) at the time of this film, so I can identify with many of the same problems / dilemmas that campers / CIT have in this movie. I enjoy seeing the clothes that were worn at the time, and hearing the same old urban legends that were said on the night voyage. The movie is also full of funny one liner. I highly recommend this film to anyone who was a teenager in the late '70s in the early 1980s.
