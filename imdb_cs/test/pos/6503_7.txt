This film is basically for those who have had little or no introduction to hip-hop, specifically turntableism, as it did with the director before this movie began. It was great to focus more on the bay than expected, because NY always gets all the credit, but Q-Bert worship is a little out of control. This movie didn't introduce anything new to me, but it changed my mind that I was superficial about the prospect of giving the tables the difference that they are bona fide instruments. This movie should convince someone that he is there with the viola and the clavichord.
