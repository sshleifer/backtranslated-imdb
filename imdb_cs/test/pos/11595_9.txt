Again salute from darkness. Director Alejandro Amenabar creates a life against all the pitfalls, based on the true story of one man's struggle for control of his destiny. Big Javier Bardem is fascinating to watch Ramon in his role. His eyes and head movements leave no doubt as to what's going on in his mind. Dreams and fantasy sequences are not exaggerated, so they have proved very effective in explaining why they want what they want. Instead of forcing us to answer the question of euthanasia, the real question is: What is love? At every step we see people in love looking for love or dying to be loved. The scenario is tight and keeps the movie moving, although it is mainly shot in one room. The supportive cast is amazing and we feel their pain and how each family member deals with Ramon's decision. This is a gem and deserves to be seen.
