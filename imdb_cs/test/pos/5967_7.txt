I missed the beginning of the movie. I came when the guerrillas were in the farmhouse. I can say it was scary. Moral consequences are overwhelming. My fear of pain and torture leaves me no different than a coward. I see a power similar to Christ, which was portrayed by a brave patriot, and I can only pray that I might or may have moral nausea to follow his example. I see that the main theme of the film is to show the weakness / strength of the tortured, but what offensive decision has to be confronted. All because the soul of man can be distorted in such a way that the pain and suffering that is brought to man is somehow satisfying. It's mental or physical. I considered the film provocative.
