I have seen and enjoyed all the Chameleon movies and I have to say that they are getting better and better with each of them. Bobbie Phillips is fantastic and my granddaughter wants to be just like her. I'm glad they brought the "brother" character to Bobbie (Kam), so we can expect to see another exciting show. Bobbie is beautiful, sexy and sweet and at the same time independent, and all that every woman could want to be!
