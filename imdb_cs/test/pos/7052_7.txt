As a young teenager, when it came out, I was totally related to him. As an adult in contemporary American sex-obsessed culture, she doesn't have enough nudity to be called tame. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an American pie type of obscenity, vulgarity or farts and feces, meatballs will disappoint with impunity and guarantee. <br /> <br /> If you like Bill Murray and you like good clean fun, you'll love this movie. Like Stripes, Ghostbusters, Caddy Shack, etc. <br /> <br /> They said enough, just look at it and stop the intelligence. It's Meatballs, for loud calls! Why read the review? Enjoy it and have fun. And ignore what others are talking about. Films, like many other things in life, are subjective. Everyone who owns it. Always take care of an expert who will reduce the taste of others.
