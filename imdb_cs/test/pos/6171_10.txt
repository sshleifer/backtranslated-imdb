It is a beautifully crafted film, delicately balancing fragile human stories (both before and after 1945), as well as the indistinguishable struggle of war. The use of outtakes from the Battle of Britain (a film that does not nearly as well portray the 1940s!) Increases, rather than humiliates from the whole. Deeply impressive work, it lived in my memory for 2 years since I saw it, and I bought it to explore the production of accessories. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie (movie). Just as "Aces High" alternates between viscerally exciting (or scary) air combat sequences, where the viewer could experience the real loss of the characters he cared for, but also the unpredictable interactions on the ground where skillful writers and realists of life experience report on some events. This also underscores the fact that for many people, 1945, not only the end of one conflict, but the beginning of another, and even today we do not recognize the loss, bravery and sacrifice of so many nameless heroes, or worse, worship them from a distance without allowing them to be human beings with all the emotional weaknesses they carry - which makes their victims braver. Watching this movie is an experience that takes you from the heights of friendship to the depths of jealousy and back to love that lasts after death. If it were all war movies, we would never have to fight again. Did I mention it's worth watching? ;-) <br /> 10/10
