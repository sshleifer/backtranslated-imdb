I'm not going to say anything about music, because this topic can be so deep that it can become one huge single revision, so let's focus on a movie that's brilliant ... No doubt one of Forman's best works. A simple story about love, friendship, freedom and ideals ... oh yes, the ideals for which pacifists are ready to go to war ... <br /> <br /> There is no single false word, one false character, one false feeling in the story, because love, freedom and friendship are nothing complicated for the characters of the movie. These things are not something "everyone could see from a different angle." These are not things that need a lot of thinking to understand ... their love is simple, their friendship is simple, their ideals are as simple as the word "simple" itself and that's why these characters are so deep. Berger, the hippie leader played Treat Williams is the man who lives to live and that's the greatest luck for him ... he's got his ass - (as he sings in one of the movie scenes) and that's enough to be happy with his property ... Berger never accepts that something can not be done ... and his If he wants to go to a banquet of rich guys in his dirty old clothes and huge long hair, he'll do it ... if he wants to go to another state to see his friend, he'll do it ... he'll never think twice ... he'll just do it. <br /> <br /> How? why is she so strong? the answer is simple: because it's FREE. Just watch as the wind makes a wave of hair in this movie and you understand it all, maybe you will be alone for free.
