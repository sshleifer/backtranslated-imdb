A good story, well done with unexpected twists, such as the vicious murderous gangster Bryan Brown teaches his son macrame. Even if it works like an action drama where you hope a good person (Ledger) and his gilrfriend succeed, he also has some jolly ironic black humor, for example, bank robbers who will become "winners" of radio competitions and their reactions, revenge on busker etc. It is worth watching.
