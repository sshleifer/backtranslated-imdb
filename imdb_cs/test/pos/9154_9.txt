Excellent silent version of Francois Villon's story. Although it was rebuilt in the 1930s when I was KING, with director Frank Lloyd, scripting by Preston Sturges and Ronald Colman, this version is even better. Barrymore, with a comic cohort, plays a comic fool and Villon depressed wine with a vortex that Colman couldn't wrestle. The photo is surprising with its beauty and innovation and game support, especially Conrad Veidt in his American premiere, the incredibly beautiful Marceline Day and the supporting Slim Summerville and Hank Mann comics, who steal every scene they are in. It's a shame that Barrymore has done so few first-class comedies. His sound films can only be compared to his leadership in TWENTIETH CENTURY and his supportive role in MIDNIGHT, and they will only stand up for their excellent voice. In this silent movie, Barrymore has to tell his story without the use of words and does so, alternately cheerfully unknowable as the King of Fools and tenderly like Villon in love. Even gets skipped in the spectacular style of Fairbanks, most convincingly. He also leaves his supporting cast to have his share of fame, capering in this set to work as any talented comedian era. Finally, a brief word about Alan Crosland, a director known today only for directing the first talk, JAZZ SINGER in the same year that this release was released. Crosland was a meticulous, innovative, beautifully original director and it is a pity that more of his works are not known. Perhaps this film, more interesting than a film than its most famous work, will be your introduction to his other talents. If so, you can do it much worse.
