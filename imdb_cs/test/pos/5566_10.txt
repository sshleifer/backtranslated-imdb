This series is greatly underestimated. Like many others, I came to Farscape after the series was canceled. Bought Season 1 and was surprised to find an elegantly written drama filled with a balanced mix of tension, romance, wit and, of course, science fiction. Right on the bat, 10 thinks it is the first series or movie that will satisfy us as our hero - and every stranger he touches - speaks English! Okay, a few others avoided the problem, but Farscape did the best. The point is that writers pay close attention to the details to make the show as credible as possible. Get enough exposure and recognition to stay in production. While we enjoy the four seasons and fortunately the four-hour miniseries, maybe we can make enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show.
