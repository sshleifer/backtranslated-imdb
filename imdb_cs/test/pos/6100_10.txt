Spoiler Alert I worked as an extra on this Lifetime Television Film (filmed in Seattle). It is really interesting when you are involved in making a movie because they are usually still in the process of folding parts (as in the present case) or making cut adjustments and substantial changes from the final parts. My husband and I both worked as extras in this movie and I remember how they discussed on the scene, how it was still determined whether or not the girl would die in the end. Frankly, I never thought Margaret Colin's character had a really good punishment for her crime hit and run, lying to the police, covering up, etc. Can you imagine how the end had to change if she ended up and killed the hit and ran away sacrifice instead of ending her coma all right? Just something to think about. By the way, I play a police detective you can see for a fraction of a second and my husband plays another detective you can see quite often (we counted four times). Margaret Colin was great at work and on the ground, although Lisa Vidal (now Lifetime regular) was booked. Overall, it turned out that the film is about 7/10, but as another poster commented, it is still a real tear-jerker and makes a great Saturday afternoon cable swing.
