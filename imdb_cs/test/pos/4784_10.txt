Cartoon Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE. STEAMBOAT WILLIE, the malevolent little rodent, neglects his pilothouse and frolique his way into film history. On 18. On November 1928, a young genius man made his debut with the first successful world caricature with synchronous sound. Apart from Walt Disney or his alter ego, Mickey Mouse could not be looked back. Financial struggles remain, but basically the world was their oyster bed and Mickey would eventually rival Chaplin as the most iconic cultural icon of the century. As fun, STEAMBOAT WILLIE is still fun to watch, featuring the subtle work of animator Ub Iwerks and showing Mickey with all the passion and indifference of a little child. He has to deal with a tyrannical commander (Pete, without his peg, appeared in Disney cartoons since February 1925), a wiser parrot (in a few years it will be a duck) and a cute mouse named Minnie. Rather, both rodents are relentlessly releasing music on the living bodies of goats, cats, geese, piglets and cows (Clarabelle's predecessor) who were aboard the steamer. The audience howls for more and the pattern has been set for the following Mouse cartoons for the next few years. <br /> <br /> ********************** ******** <br /> Walt Disney (1901) -1966) was always fascinated by pictures and drawings. As a boy in Marceline, Missouri, he sketched farm animals on pieces of paper; later, as an ambulance driver in France during World War I, he drew comic characters on the sides of his vehicle. Back in Kansas City, along with artist Ub Iwerks, Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and small cartoons for local cinemas. His ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series has always been an innovator. Business twists sent Disney and Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923, where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager and advisor. When a slightly successful series with Oswald Lucky Rabbit was caught by a distributor, Mickey Mouse's character was reflected in Walt's imagination, thus ensuring Disney's immortality. The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's debut on the screen, STEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928), a spectacular success for viewers using synchronized music. SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared, and Walt's growing crew of amazingly talented animators quickly conquered the new territory with full color, the illusion of in-depth and radical advances in personality development, the arena in which Walt's genius was unmatched. Mickey's wild, naughty behavior caught millions of fans, but soon other animated companions joined him: the lively Donald Duck, the intellectually challenged Goofy, and the energetic Pluto. All this was in preparation for Walt's most noble film - feature animated films. Against the blizzard of judges, Walt endured, and in the next decades pleased children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi & Peter Pan. Walt never forgot that his wealth had begun with the mouse, or that the child's simplicity of the message and a lot of hard work always paid off.
