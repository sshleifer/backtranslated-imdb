Let's start by saying that when you expect gentle humor, you are in the wrong theater. It's low eyebrows and strong hitting. But he's not tickling your funny bones. He pushed out a hammer and drew a bead on the side of your head. But don't worry. As movies go, it's a fairly gentle education. Oh, also heavy on the oath, but again, Mike Judge, not Fred Rogers. Was this film called "intelligence"? F *** No. Jewel, the essence of Mike Judge, is that he has the ability to get people to laugh at themselves. Beavis and Butthead were the most popular with teenage boys, people who were always having fun. With this in mind, I don't think humor in this movie is focused on super intelligent. Maybe you're too smart to do it. But he's not pointing at you. He focuses on your average Joe. And he has a message: together with you and for God, study botany! It's a little dissatisfied and the narrator is a bit irritated after a while, but again this movie is for people who need a lot of narration ;-) It's funny. He has a message that he wants to make sure we all understand each other. Ask about the casting of Luke Wilson as a 100 IQ man. Sometimes he is unable to play down (what he has, like 104?) At his character level. From time to time slightly forced. Kudos at Dax Shepard in this. I remember seeing him in Zathu and thinking, "This kid looks like an idiot." He makes a great idiot in this movie. Maybe I'm psychic. It took a while to warm up on Maya Rudolph, but I gave her a little space. After all, she had to play the whole planet straight. But once she gets some time on the screen, she made a solid contribution. Terry Crews played the same psychotic, aggressive character he'd played many times before, but still makes a first-class president. Another bonus is that the place was virtually empty. I count my girlfriend and me, there were literally six people in the theater. We could have a barbecue pit and a mariachi band. So, no annoying people are talking as it seems to be the norm in 'talk-to-the-tv' age. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good premise and competent delivery, given the intended goal. Lots of laughter sprinkled all over. What made this movie scary was that when we came out of the theater, it was kind of like the movie was still playing. We've seen a lot of idiocy in the people around us, maybe the more obvious dose we've got in the theater ....
