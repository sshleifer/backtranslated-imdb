Ahhh ... 80's. In 1982, I was thinking about the really crazy time we faced in America. Fresh from "Do What Feels Good" in the '70s, "The Last American Virgin", comes like a wolf in sheep's clothing as another "teenage comedy" of fame. Sure, there's sex, but I can't think of another movie - OK, this and "Fast Times on Ridgemont High" - it really wasn't killing time between topless teen scenes - there was some pretty good stuff here between clippings. The film follows three hormonal friends. Gary (wanted to lose his virginity), Rick (incarnate stallion) and David (overweight, but inexperienced) when he desperately tries to get Gary to join the manhood world. But the funny thing is going on the way to the kegger - Gary falls on Karen (a pretty brunette who loves bad boys), and she doesn't seem to follow any sexual conquests that David and Rick can make easier. The only problem is that Rick and Karen are hot and heavy and Karen jumps. It's Gary who's on her side when she goes to take an abortion, and it's Gary who's really old. But who is Karen dancing with the film ending ... Rick. Subtract "R" and add "D" where necessary. What separates this film from the rest of the 1980s that we think is that God, they're trying some real drama here, and no "my parents just dragged into the driveway. " And you know what? I bought it. It wasn't careless. It wasn't far. And when Gary sees Rick dancing with Karen at home at the end of the movie, I was really sorry for him. Our teen Romeo really believed in unrequited love - and when his heart broke down, it touched me. So all T&A aside, there is actually a pretty believable and engaging story here. Oscar Worthy? Not a mile, but I don't know that I would unpack it into the "Let's Lay" category. Just like "Fast Times in Ridgemont High", in fact, they tried to make a real movie here, leaving hi-jinx between the fall where it can.
