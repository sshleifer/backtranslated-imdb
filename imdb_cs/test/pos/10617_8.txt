The "piano teacher" is about the character of Hupper; a classical middle-aged piano instructor with a stoic facade, for whom a powerful aberrant personality lurks. Unsatisfactory as a story, but interesting as a character study, the film follows Huppert's character through the term of her close relationship with the pupil, who performs excellently in this process. Not for everyone, "Piano Teacher" will play best with those who do foreign movies and character-driven dramas dealing with dark issues. (AND-)
