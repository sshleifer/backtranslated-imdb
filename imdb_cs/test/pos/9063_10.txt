Many movies are trying to be ambitious. Few succeeded. This movie is one of them. Although billed as a black comedy, this term seems too restrictive to express the true nature of the story behind Max and Grace. Multi-hyphenate Michael Parness was able to combine elements of an absurd comedy with incredibly real human emotions. Pretty remarkable performance to be sure. Although the comic aspects are certainly present, the heart of the film lies in its leadership: David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. The delicate balance of the film - really crazy versus true love - falls to them and they reach it, transferring it from the opening scene to the heartbreaking climax and to the pleasing end. David Krumholtz, in the titular role and as a narrator, anchors the picture and does extraordinary work. We see the world through Max's eyes, and Krumholtz gives them a miracle and hope that one cannot expect to be believable when he comes from a character who has previously attempted suicide. There should be no doubt that he has indeed achieved the leading position of a man who has earned more than ten years of unforgettable support roles. Natasha Lyonne could be something of a revelation for anyone who only saw her in less demanding roles. The role of Grace is extensive in scope, requiring she to show both great anger and great tenderness - sometimes within seconds of herself. He can convince us that Grace has a deep despair that lies just below her alternating torpedoes and mania. It's not a laugh that is a type of comedy, so the film doesn't see strict humor from the start. complete. You think the drama is more than comedy. There are some very dark moments as one might expect with regard to the theme of suicidal individuals, and some strange real moments delivered most notably by Emma Adele Galvin as Max's sister, Sis. The most humorous scenes are those that fill a myriad of actors in supporting roles. While Lorraine Bracco and David Paymer lend their scenes the most realistic aspect to other support characters who settle in the institution where Max and Grace meet, they are a real experience. Guillermo Diaz is a thief of a helpless scene like a wonderfully frenetic weirdo, Hector. Ralf Moeller, like Bruno, behaves like his straight man, but he has his charm and attraction. Rosanna Arquette fully occupies the role of Very with crass vitriol from an angry truck to stop the waitress. Even her stubborn figure will eventually melt, just as anyone who touched Max's literally undying love of Grace. He may love the conquest of everything that might be a question behind the film, and although the realist says there is no, the movies are about escaping from reality, even if only for a few short hours. I recommend seeing this film as an antidote not only to reality but also to cynicism, which says that such a love story never happens. Spend a few hours immersed in a world where you can and does wonders to the psyche. <br /> <br /> (Seattle International Film Festival - June 2005)
