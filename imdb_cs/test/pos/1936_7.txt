This pre-production relic and Hays Office is good fun, it's not great but fun. Based on Rogers & Hart, which was a huge hit at the time, the story revolves around the girl of Barbara Stanwyck's dance hall, who is romanced by rich businessman Ricardo Cortez (who was indecently handsome) but whose heart belongs to her book neighbor Monroe Owsley. Owsley and Owsley got married but remained secret while she refused Cortez, who still holds hope. She helps managers get a job in Cortez company, but took bliss quickly turns sour, as Owsley develops a taste for high life and steps with college darling and gambling in a high-stakes bridge (Yup! I know it's pretty funny ..). .). In the end, he betrays $ 5,000 from Cortez and is about to go to Lama when his devoted wife goes to Cortez .... and I won't find anything else, although the ending was definitely a surprise. Stanwyck is the best thing about this movie; in one of her earliest roles she is quite successful. Owsley is a weakness; is uninteresting and torturous, while Cortez is amazingly amazing and sexy, while his performance is serious but extraordinary. While apparently drama, it's full of laughter, many unintentional, as some of the elements of this movie have aged. poorly. But there are a lot of good humorous lines; at one point Stanwyck tells Cortez, "My brains are in my feet while yours is in ..." That's damn suggestive for 1931! There's a lot of crazy and suggestive stuff in this movie, in the last few days before the code crashed and whitewashed everything. A fun antique, a good reminder of how far we haven't come in 70 years .... this story is very easy to change to fit in 2003, but could keep the basic plot with the original ending on the spot.
