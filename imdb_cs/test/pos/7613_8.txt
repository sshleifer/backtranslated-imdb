Never Was Kissed to Play Drew Barymore as Reporter Josie Gellar is a sweet, very contented and sometimes quite painful story of a shy woman named Josie Gellar who is brilliant but calm and shy, and has never been kissed. She is assigned her first major news story for a newspaper that works pro-go secretly as a high school student to befriend with popular cool kids and get a scoop of what's really going on in the high school world. The only problem is that Josie was never popular. In fact, high school was a traumatic experience for her because she was quite a lot of teasing and cruel jokes. Josie catches this role, just as he finally "fit in" to get the scoop-what he finds is the main premise of the story. Never been kissing is one of those movies that are so happy and schmaltzy at times, especially in the few scenes at the end that the trust limits are highly tested and many cynic do not need this movie. But it is very sweet. Drew Barymore is perfect like bumbling, yet beautiful Josie-breathes the breath of fresh air into the character and makes her look absolutely realistic. I also enjoyed Leelee Sobiesky as an intellectual student who treats Josie on his first day at school. I've never been a kisser, she has some really funny moments when Josie unraveles in her frantic effort to be cool. Example - scene of a reggae bar. I also loved the look of Josie's brother Rob, who also returns and enrolls as a high school student. At the same time, as Josie's pitiful story of her early years in high school shows up in flashback, it is extremely painful. You don't have to have similar high school experiences with Josie to influence her story-Drew is amazing about her character having a personal relationship with the audience and we adore Josie from the start. There's a lot of "average girls" out there in 2004, but in this movie, that means girls were honestly more expensive. Never been kissing becomes a very romantic pic, as Josie develops feelings for a certain man and the question happens to get along. I liked this movie. In some areas it was really beautiful. The movie is in some places arched yes, the last scene-realistic-no way - does the film manipulate your emotions in the most obvious Hollywood way? Yeah yeah yeah baby! But with beautiful controls, there are a few lessons to learn. The film never sermons, but it is possible to paint a precise picture of what a high school is like for a few. In fact, I met people who have similar experiences with Josie - I met people very much like all these characters - I think many people just don't know or can't understand the cruelty that can exist in the high school world, and how It can be harmful, but it's there. It is not unrealistic at all. What I was thinking about was Drew's speech at the ball when he demonstrates a "sheep mentality" that can be as prevalent as Hollywood and is made as many think it can be, it was good and very true. <br /> <br /> I've never been a kiss sound much harder than it is, in fact it's a perfect movie to pick up when someone wants a sweet feel good light pleasing picture. It is engaging, sweet and Rufus only. I'd say it. 8 out of 10.
