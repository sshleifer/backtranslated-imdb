I remember seeing this film for the first time with a friend on vacation in Anaheim, California in October 1976. We saw the advertising film "ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX" while driving the city's tourist streets. Before looking at Disneyland's version of Lewis Carroll's classic half a mile away, our curiosity won and we ventured into this film boundary. I remember before the movie started, as I was surprised to see this kind of movie that appears in the old, ultra-conservative Orange County. Thirty-two years later, I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND in a local video store. I was wondering if this was the same movie before I looked at the back of the jacket and saw the picture of the beautiful Kristine DeBell starring and decided to revive some memories again. Subversive video, to its credit, released two versions, X and XXX in the same package. As it turned out, the version of my friend and I saw in Anaheim was rated X despite the original XXX ad on there. When I saw it for the second time, I realized what an adorable director Bud Townsend brought to the screen. As an example of this male behind the scenes behind the camera in his salad days he directed two episodes of the TV series DEATH VALLEY DAYS. Miss DeBell, who appeared in April 1976, is ideal as Alice. It brings fresh all American innocence to the role of librarian in her first twenty years longing for a better life. When her boyfriend is refused to take her relationship to the next level, Alice reaches her breakpoint. This is a "musical comedy", but the tunes are quite catchy with appropriate strings and brass to compensate for generally suggestive lyrics. Miss DeBell has a pleasant singing voice when shivering about being free. So begins magic. The stimulation of this film is surprisingly fluid, given that the genre and supporting cast of Wonderland are here to allow Alice to blossom into womanhood. Special mention goes to the television veteran Larry Gelman as the White Rabbit who seems to be the only person who is not obsessed with sex because he is always late at the meeting or something like that. Special features include comments from well-known feminist advocate Lena Ramone, who grants her looking at this film while attending college, influencing her in choosing an adult movie actress after graduation. What makes ALICE IN WONDERLAND such a wonderful toy is its garden setting. The film is partly filmed in the lush, natural beauty of Stanley Park in Vancouver B.C. You won't come with the feeling that you watched the skin soften. I did not miss this triple version of XXX while writing this. Extraordinary sexual footage deployed later would most likely disrupt the overall flow and remove the light, fresh atmosphere that is evident throughout the world. Of course, the Lewis Carroll version is the best way to turn around and explore Alice in Wonderland. However, for a time capsule representing the 1970s adult film archives, ALICE IN WONDERLAND is worth watching that white rabbit for a rough ride full of cheerful chaos.
