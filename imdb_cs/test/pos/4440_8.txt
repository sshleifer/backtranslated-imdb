My impression when I saw this documentary is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up having more questions than he had before making the film. It took five years to do it, the work of love and desire. I can only imagine the confusion in the editing process, what to leave, what to take. His father, renowned architect Louis Kahn, comes as a person who is too selfish and self-absorbed to be emotionally available to a woman who is not alone in three. But like many men of his nature he attracted women who were stunned by the remoteness and bias of creativity. One of his mistresses said she was "accessible", but she would never be explored. Other comments of people who knew him well suffer the same fate. Damage. The tension between the three half siblings in the Louis home's room is also tangible. The unspoken pass over the conversation. The only traces his father had left were in the buildings he had left, some great, some not so great. I was fascinated by the music ship and the Salk Institute. Sad mothers of mothers who were forever captured by his insensitive impregnations than he had told the director's mother when she was told of her pregnancy - "no longer!" <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, beautifully shot, original. At least in this case, the son does not seem to be the father of a man.
