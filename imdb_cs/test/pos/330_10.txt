To tell you the truth, I don't speak Tamil and I didn't understand the movie. My good Tamil friend, Kaneswaran Kumarswamypillai (wow, what long name) explained everything to me. What a great movie !!! After watching this movie, I felt I was supposed to watch many other Tollywood movies (Tamil Film Industry). War scenes were amazing, great camera work and beautiful land. Actress "Simran" what beauty. Give her the prize for someone who is the most beautiful. Ding, Ding, Ding, come on, I feel the OSCAR winner. I didn't understand the songs, but they were excellent. Mani Ratnam is a great director and I hope his next film will be successful.
