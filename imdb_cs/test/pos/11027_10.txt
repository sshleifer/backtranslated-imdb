I watched this movie in 75 and this movie was an open mind to me, how important it is to care for Natura and Wild Life. When I got the dog in 83, I called him SHOULDER (In the movie ... Avakun's dog) to never forget this movie. By the way, I have a copy of this movie, but it is in Portuguese and the quality is not as good as a DVD or a new VHS (I recorded almost 20 years ago and in SLP fast. ) <br /> <br /> If someone wants a copy .. will I try to convert to a DVD and can send you an OK? Ot's great movie and I agree it's a movie that will always be watched. Waldemar Braz - Sao Paulo / Brazil
