This entertaining, sometimes enchanting look at the Hollywood detective genre of 1940s and 1950s star Robert Sacci as an unnamed former retired cop, uses his life savings to pay for plastic surgery to turn his image into his idol, Humphrey Bogart, then establishes a store as a private eye under the name "Sam Marlowe". Robert Sacchi, by the way, is one of the few few Bogart imitators who got the lisp right; More to the point, the body and language of the language are there. For a moment, "Sam" is the only client's his landlady, who wants him to find her undersized friend, and his only conversational film is his secretary, simply called "Dutchess" (Misty Rowe), who, in his own words, "looked as Marilyn Monroe and made the same sense as Gracie Allen ", and she has a passion for breaking bananas. Then she meets Elsa (Olivia Hussey), a simple, sweet, virgin daughter of retired officers who have been murdered for no reason. murder investigation, Sam briefly goes over: Gene Tierney lookalike daughter (Michelle Phillips) Anastas, a greedy, obscene-rich Greek ship tycoon (Victor Buono, turning into a trusted Sidney Greenstreet), his unhappy, long-suffering second wife (Yvonne deCarlo, who can play various put-on emotions without saying a word), his two charming followers (Herbert Lom, channeling Peter Lorre and Jay Robinson, kt they are doing reasonably accurate Lionel Atwill) and Anastas "The sinister, amoral Middle Eastern power fighter (Franco Nero), who comes with a glamor and wisely loyal lover (Sybil Danning), all of whom could get" The Eyes of Alexander ", two huge, perfectly matched star sapphires. When Elsa is murdered, Marlowe's interest in resolving the case becomes personal, and he embarks on a labyrinth of Los Angeles landmarks, including the Hollywood Bowl, Hollywood Boulevard scatological and esoteric attractions, and the Santa Catalina Island, trying to get to them before one of the two rich competitors. Throwing in the portraits of Mike Mazurki and the diverse other, traditional silent-but-sympathetic ally of the police force, and a plethora of nicely drawn character turns that provide a dimension to virtually all players, despite the unfortunate title track you have, my mind, thoroughly enjoyable film experience.
