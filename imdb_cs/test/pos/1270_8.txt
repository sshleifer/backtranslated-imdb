Christopher Nolan's first film is a black-and-white "no budget" film about an unemployed writer who begins to follow a stranger, which in turn leads to robbery and violence. It is very good. As in his later film, Memento does not present the story linearly. Instead, he jumps a little bit, so you end up really sucked and try to get it all together and soon, probably random, shots are gaining in importance as the film progresses. This style also means that twists are much more effective. Definitely worth seeing if you get a chance (especially if you like his later work and / or Film Noir)
