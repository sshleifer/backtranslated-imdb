The film had no help at all, promo-wise: if an advertising promo appeared on TV or radio, I didn't see it. The only newspaper advertisement I saw was on the opening weekend: a dirty, sleepy B & W head-shot photo of Andy as Val-Com, behind the prison bars, with the title: "WANTED! Runaway Robot!" (which was also a poster in front of 3 theaters I saw on a --NOT nice little color poster on this site, with all the actors' heads and a Crimebuster cartoon - which wasn't that good - - OUGHT to use the action scene from the movie itself - they don't the beginning of the photographer - the poster is intended to help the future audience decide whether they want to see the film - there were so many people who couldn't get to their sold out choice and wanted to know what Heartbeeps was about - and the poster didn't help! delivered to the papers were so indistinguishable in B&W that there was no trailer for the movie: only a single theater picture, consisting of the word "Heartbeeps" inside the heart shape with which the Amor's arrow was with the beast, and the one that was an entirely black picture : Only Andy and Bernadet's voices say "Val-Com!" So it's mine, do you think we should tell our owners? " During the shooting, Andy told reporters that he couldn't eat as soon as his artificial lips were used, so he would "load up for breakfast and quickly" shoot during the day. "I don't know what Bernadette did: but in that I was wondering why not just drink protein drinks with long straws or ate food tube astronaut pur√©es? The baby robot Phil-Co seems to have been the forerunner of Johnny-Five Short Circuit with the same face-like eyes. I tried to find out if they had the same designer but no help. I have magazine articles about the magazine, and the design team was extremely proud of their work and went to a special award for an innovative device that would create an expressionless "smoke" for Catskill cigars. Just shortly afterwards, LucasFilm did not make this device, though they OUGHT have, for the Return of the Jedi Scenes with Jabba Hut: a man created a "pair" around Jabba, by blowing cigarette smoke into a tube, joking it all he needed \ t he would be a happy man. I thought LucasFilm was using real tobacco products insensitive to people who were angry with smoke. John Williams, who recently succeeded, a great Arthur Fielder as a Boston Pops maestro (who was rated THEN, but never lost from Fielder's death, and is now the shadow of his former glory ), used a show to promote films he added to music. There he premiered "The Empire Strikes Back"; and you would think he would help Heartbeeps when he plays a few numbers there? One thing critics of this movie liked was Williams's score - yet it wasn't available to buy! I saw one vinyl album, in 1982, with half Heartbeeps, half another movie - but it disappeared. I just saw a CD on THIS this evening and ordered it. If I can get a scanner and time to write articles, I'd like to create a Heartbeeps website. I liked the movie and I don't care what the dissidents say! The only problem with the film was that it was coming to an end, it was confused, logical: robots escaped from the factory to be free to decide their own destiny, to make their own choices; when the junkyard owners tell them that Phil needs to go to the factory to program a "purpose" to it, they do not doubt it; they just look at each other meaningfully and go. Along the way, each adult loses battery power and "dies". They aren't really dead because they're robots, and they only need new batteries, yet they're treated like "death," with little weeping over them and rolling. What kind of POINT was that? Phil never returns to the factory and gets a "purpose!" And, of course, the owners of the COULD'VE dump were driving them, or giving them all the battery chargers, with backup batteries; but the real point was that this scene, where all the robots wear, is down and Phil is crazy. In the end, Val-Com is a golf instructor and Aqua-Com is - I'm not sure what. Catskill is ENTERTAINMENT - what should ELSE be? I'm not sure they explained it clearly. The junkyard owners seem to take it easy, lying on deck chairs, drinking Phil's lemonade, their "bartender". Valova and Aquova's new "daughter" Philsia - I think the name is - maybe it's Sylvania - it doesn't seem to be much more than a table lamp. No shots, which is sad - from the photos I believe the missing stuff contains a sweet scene where Phil has Christmas, and Val gives him the wheel of a car; Aqua supplies corner; Catskill took the fire helmet to put Phil as we saw; and have Christmas trees. I don't know if any missing shots provide better logic, or if writers can't think of a better crisis / solution. The film was cut to 72-75 minutes to pair with other failed movies. No other reason. On the DVD, LOVE would like to be created because I want to see interviews with actors / crews and John Williams and interview with Merv Griffin. Creating records; and re-creating and restoring missing shots to make it better.
