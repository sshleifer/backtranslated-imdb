Even if it doesn't give more than previous posts here (as well as very good Ruby Liang) I wanted to share my own opinion. I hope my English is understandable. Bonfire is a rhythmic, light but deep presentation of a French unorganized arrival, but also courage and magic. All the time in brilliantly restored France in 1940 with many details (from the luxury Bordeaux hotel occupied by the government headquarters and attacked by unnecessary French tip, to Parisian coffee near Le Pantheon / rue Mouffetard and 1930s cars) Attal gives their second roles a brilliant taste;) Isabelle Adjani and Virgnie Ledoyen are very trustworthy in their drastically different roles, and Grégori Derangère does a charming performance :) focused movies on civilians, Bon voyage shows a lot of things about French issues (even a French guy like me), some of them quite deep.
