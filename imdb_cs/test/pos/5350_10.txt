In 1989, Aardman's animation introduced two heroes in Grand Day Out. In 1993, they fought the evil penguin at The Wrong Trousers. In 1995, they had to save the sheep from the evil robotic dog in A Shave Shave. They came back in 2005 to fight something that was cute and cute in the Curse of Were-Rabbit. In this feature film, Wallace and Gromit work in Anit-Pesto, a pest control agent. It will be a huge competition, but rabbits eat neighbors. Wallace and Gromit will take care of this problem. But Wallace had an idea. He will wash out the bunnies with his machine. After doing this, something suddenly eats all the vegies around and it's big. It's up to Wallace and Gromit to save the day. As a fan of these two characters, I was impressed. It kept what the previous three chapters had, and instead added a lot of Hollywood actors for voice calls, put in no name and boys, did a fantastic job. Wallace and Gromit have not changed. Wallace is still a cheese loving freak like always and Gromit is a silent reader of news. Also, the script wasn't too shabby as other family movies. There is a twist who Were-Rabbit really is. Nick Park's director (director of 3 previous chapters) does a really good job with the story. Instead of adding a Hollywood formula to it, he took the style of the previous chapters and added a little dark fantasy to it. All right, Nick. Rabbits are also funny and delightful, but the funest rabbit in the movie is the one who has a Wallace blend in it. The characters were not bad and were not annoying, but they will never be Wallace and Gromit. The animation is really fantastic and amazing. I've never seen an animated movie that's so amazing because of Chicken Run. Overall, fans of two knuckleheads (including teens) will love this fantastic movie. It's a well done movie that should get an Oscar next year. Hooray, Wallace and Gromit. 10/10
