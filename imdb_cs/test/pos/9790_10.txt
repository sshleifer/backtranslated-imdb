Bobby and Mikey are two little boys who, with a divorced mother, move around the country and start a new life. Soon after the family settles down, their mother marries a "king" who ends up being a rough stepfather, especially Bobby. So Bobby decided to "fly away" from abuse in his birthday gift. This film was hard to trace, especially abuse scenes. It was hard to look at the innocent, playful little boy who had been abused and turned into a grumpy, frightened and withdrawn young man. The game is excellent. I cried in the last half of the movie. There were some funny scenes in it too like Monster Brew and a dog who finds pop bottles. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend letting young children watch. It was a movie that looked painfully and yet really flew away.
