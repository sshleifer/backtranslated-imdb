I watched this series after I saw Naked Gun movies. I found it much better than movies and I thought movies were great! This series will literally stick to your TV in anticipation of the next pun, gag, or funny situation (wicker nights, club flamingo). I don't think I laughed so hard in the TV series in my life, even after I first saw movies, so I got to know some jokes. I think it's a shame that only six episodes were made, but I agree that writers would be very hard pressed to keep this level of comedy for more episodes. Overall, the show has to be seen for those who like puns, bad jokes and slap.
