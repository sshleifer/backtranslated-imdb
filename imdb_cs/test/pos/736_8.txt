Of course my assessment for this is not to suggest that it compares with posh horror likes Argento, but with other 70s low budget, fare riding and this department is really a classic. Lack of money shows (Is someone too worried?) Acting is sufficient, rather than professional, (makes it more realistic?) But unlike so many other films, and not just those that are low-level, that doesn't mean a moment. Crap can be, but non stop bullshit, in the face of crap and though inevitably a little campy at times, it is necessary to see for anyone who has any idea what I'm talking about. Sometimes quite crazy, this crazy little movie filled with crazy characters is clearly made for fun and fun to really watch them.
