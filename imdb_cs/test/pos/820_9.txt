When I first got the wind out of this picture, it was just called "Shepherd" and was supposed to be a movie that would put JCVD ​​back in chances of a theatrical shtuff. I was very excited about the whole work. At the time of the name "The Shepherd: Border Patrol," I was excited in this excitement for dancing. With Isaac Fluorentine at the helm of directing, and JJ Perry pulling the stunt coordination, I almost threw the pants in anticipation. The pics were released from JCVD ​​digging 8 different kinds of butts as well as Scott Adkins playing what I thought was a villain, and I was impressed in the excitement. I thought it would be another epic martial arts situation like Lone Wolf McQuade. Then it worked out. I ordered it online for $ 20 and was ready for anything. The review from vandammefan.net has changed my ideas a little, but I have prepared myself. Mail arrived on day 4 and I unpacked the package. My first plan was to run up, rip the face out of the cardboard box, then break the case into the right dynamics to land on my DVD player. However, I was looking at the case for 10 minutes, then placed the disc in my player and watched the movie. <br /> <br /> By the time it was over, I was cool like a crazy man in the pool. Shepherd is definitely one of my favorite movies that are popular in live video, and because of being derailed, it looks even more than what it is. Sure, some of the fighting led to a brief battle, but they were still very amazing. Shootouts were excellent, just like Scott Adkins, who should be a villain, unlike the forgotten Steven Lord. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. Seriously.
