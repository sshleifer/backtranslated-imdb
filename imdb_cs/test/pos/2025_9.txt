I was very excited to see Rock Star because I'm a big fan of Mark Wahlberg. I was surprised that I liked it more than I originally thought. The screenplay left something to be desired, but the showing of the film made it for it. There were a few moments when Spinal Tap was coming back, and I can't help but think this movie would be even better than mocumentary. But I'm leaving. Wahlberg continues to demonstrate his talent by playing with the credibility of an ordinary guy whose greatest dream is being fulfilled. He does it with astonishment and innocence that not only believes you, but also really worries you about his character. Jennifer Aniston, who has not yet impressed me in movies, is surprisingly good as a girlfriend. She shows more real emotions than I have seen in her last few movies together. But above all, it's the music in this movie that really pulls you in. - Bon Jovi would have all his 80th music fans swinging in place), a really rock movie with original Steel Dragon songs and Wahlberg performance. <br /> <br /> I plan to see this movie again, but first I will go and buy a soundtrack!
