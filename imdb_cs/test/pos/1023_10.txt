Although I don't like cricket at all and I saw this movie 13 years ago, I still think it's one of the best movies coming out of age ... I remember the day I came home from school and sat down I got my lunch, I saw the opening titles of this movie and then .... I was so immersed in the fact that I felt I was there, it really affected me personally. I still remember how I felt when I first saw it, I felt that the poor boy was my friend, going through the same teenage experience we had in those days. what I really liked about the film is the main theme of the "shy" fantasic boy about "kissing" his dream girl, no offense, but if it was an American movie, you would definitely see at some point - mainly the top - "shy" boy "making love" with his girl, and I really can't understand this conflicting concepts until now ... I have a simple request, if anyone knows how to get this movie on a DVD by post, please give me a know because I need a shot of memories. Thanks
