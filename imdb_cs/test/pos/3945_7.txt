Another round with monkey king in the west .... kind. <br /> <br /> Starting in the middle of an action, the movie moves from the first frame to the next. And the monk and his three disciples go to the city to receive the sacred suras, which will bring peace to the world as soon as they are translated and spoken to the world. But the evil force hit and kidnapped all the children in the city. An evil force wants a monk, because if you eat it, you will live forever. Holders fight against the forces of darkness before forcibly sending a monk out of safety (The monk thinks he can win simply by thinking with bad guys). The monk ends up with a lot of goblins lizards who plan to eat him at some point ... but bad guys come and he's gone odyssey with the ugliest of the game. <br /> <br /> Can a film that starts from rails leave rails? Don't Get Me Wrong I really liked this movie but its so scattered shot and everywhere that plot and logic just fall away because some scenes just pick up middle action without a way to know how we got there (Last Battle to Save disciples is completely out of the left field). This is one of the most unpleasant movies I've ever seen, but it made me laugh and smiled like none of them. The movie starts and you have no idea where things are, and then what's on screen either interesting or funny and you just go with it. How we get from thing to thing is often behind me. Its full of odd sides and strange links as we go from heaven to ocean into space to chest cages of some mythical beast to God knows where. This movie floats all over the place, helping to keep you entertained because you don't know where it will end up (and the reason I keep the details to a minimum) and its fun. <br /> <br /> And the action is very good, though a good piece of it is a fearless CGI animation (which provides some cool pictures, golden staff, spider attack formations, angel in flight ...) And its very action and comedy side it is actually an amazing love story, it's a story of an ugly imp and monk who ends up in love (and has other complications), it's an interesting look at the nature of love and what's true. You're going to move. Nevertheless, I was very excited to be still angry with my scattered shooting design, movies unable to hold my thoughts together and tell the whole story really hurts the film from the enjoyment every time we hit the road, bumps They will take you out of the film and make you as much as you can see from other sources. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth seeing because it has many choices, be prepared for some bumps and you'll have a good time.
