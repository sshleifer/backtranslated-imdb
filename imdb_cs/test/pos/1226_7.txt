This film is about six men who are assigned to transport money from bank to business. Ty Hackett (Columbus Short) was in Iraq for a war serving his country and is now being helped to feed his friend Mike Cochrone (Matt Dillon) to make sure he doesn't lose his house. Mike tells him that it wasn't the life his parents expected, and that he should live a better life than he is now with his brother Jimmy Hackett (Andre Kinney). He tells you that he and Jimmy have always been his family and will do something to help them, Mike tells you about a plan to make a ruse. Money would be distributed among the other men in the transport of about 43 million in six ways, although You do not like the idea of ​​telling his friend Mike as long as no one gets hurt. a well-being about how to put her brother in foster care and give him a dilemma to lose the most important thing in his life. Although the plan sounds safe at first, greed is not all about life. When it comes to robbery, whether it's what you have or that out, so when you don't go with planning its hard to play a hero and stop the greed-driven people when it comes down to that large amounts of money. This movie comes with a star studded cast to keep you interested in playing Jean Reno, Laurence Fishburne, Amaury Nolasco, Fred Ward, Skeet Ulrich and Milo Ventimiglia. Shortly I remembered him only in "Stomp the Yard", which was about a boy who lost his brother and lives his dream of going to college. It was probably one of his best movies that I saw him, and the one that fits the character so well is great to see him again on the big screen in action.
