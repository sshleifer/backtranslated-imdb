This movie was amazing, it was extremely fun and moving. Damien O'Donnell and Jeffrey Caine have made a great movie that will appeal to all ages. James McAvoy and Steven Robertson made this movie great. Their actions were excellent, and there was a real feeling between them that you really believed they were the characters they were doing. Romola Garai is amazingly beautiful and brilliant in her role. The story of these two physically fit people and their caregiver is fine, and they begin to know and feel about the characters as the film goes on. I would recommend this movie to anyone who really loves the heart felt movie, alerting the more sensitive viewer to make sure you have the tissues you need. <br /> <br /> Great movie again !!
