One of the most striking testimonies ever committed against the death penalty, quite a frontal attack against the most disgusting way of justice. The final succession, with the parallel between the crimes committed by the convicted Poncelet, and his own execution are only excellent. No, what about Sean Penn's and Susan Sarandon's work? Leaving you breathless, they are two giants and their performances reach the highest level of emotion. Tim Robbins has made it clear that he's not just a good actor, he's also a nice director. > <br /> * My rate: 9/10
