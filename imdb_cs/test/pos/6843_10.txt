The efforts of a new group of young talents backed by Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, 2 extremely talented actors, contribute to an exciting and entertaining evening of entertainment. And maybe I'll add that Hal Holbrook shines like a senator. This movie deserves five stars. I give her ten to weight. And the end is PERFECT. I am constantly amazed by the ability of British actors to handle our American accents. I was convinced that all the actors were born in Louisiana. And what's better for a secret than New Orleans! Big Easy, also known as Crescent City, penetrates every scene. As a writer and director, Sebastian Gutierrez deserves high praise.
