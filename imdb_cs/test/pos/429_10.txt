It seems Hack has been described as unrealistic ... but that's what TV is. Television is meant to escape from everyday life and I feel that Hack is doing a great job in this regard. Add to this the slow process of exposing his past and captivating / intriguing conspiracies; you just can't get enough. Plus, with such great actors as David Morse, Andre Braugher, and even a little Mathew Borish, what more can you want. So if you are looking for an experience that is interesting and should be happy for "pitch" characters, I suggest that Hack get a chance, especially now that it gets out of its feet.
