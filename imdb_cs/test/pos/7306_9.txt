I think several others have already commented on this film, but I liked it so well that I wanted to say how good the movie is. I gave him a rating of 9 out of 10. It didn't get 10 because it is a very slow start. I almost stopped it, but I'm glad I'm not. Hang there, it's a good wait. It is mainly a film about relationships: illusion, trust and betrayal. Michelle Pfeiffer, Jessica Lange and Jason Robards all do the work in this movie. Set in a midwest country farm, Jason Robards character is a farmer whose grandfather first settled there. Jason's character is aging and has decided to create a trust that divides a thousand acres of farmland among his three adult daughters. That's when the plot of this movie really starts cooking. Sisters turn against each other because of misunderstandings rather than greed over the earth. They also make some discoveries about each other's childhood, and their present marriages, including adulterous matter, while father becomes more offensive, challenging and paranoid - until the terrible truth about each finally comes boiling. This movie really appealed to me emotionally, I got angry with some characters and sadly with them. I felt their pain because of the excellent performances that were given. The end was a little surprise for me, but in line with the growth of the characters. <br /> <br />
