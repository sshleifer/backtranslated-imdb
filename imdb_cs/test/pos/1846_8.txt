This particular movie was the one I wanted to see in the theaters, but I never got to it. When I finally rented it in the summer of 2001, I enjoyed it so much that I bought a DVD soon after. Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake have done a great job with the script and it's great to listen to the audio commentary included in the DVD. They've done a great job in creating characters that you really care about. I could feel this movie including sadness, anxiety and joy. The film also does a great job of showing the meaning of the family (today a rarity in the film) that reflects director Bonnie Hunt, based on the comments she made on DVD. David Duchovny showed me here that behind Fox Mulder is a life that has great performance with some nice scenes. I highly recommend that you view this movie. I am really grateful to the creators of this film. They gave me a wonderful movie experience that I would recommend to all my friends. I've seen a lot of movies over the years and it's very rare that after watching a movie I'm leaving with such a sense of satisfaction. I'll watch it over and over again for years. A return to me reminds me that there are still moviemakers who know how to sincerely please their film audience. Thanks !!
