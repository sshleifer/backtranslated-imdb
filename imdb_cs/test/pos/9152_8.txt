Beloved Rogue is a wonderful time. It tells the story of Paris from the 14th century in a spectacular Hollywood fashion, but at the same time offers a bleaker side to the existence of the poor. And snow. It's constantly swirling around, which increases the severity of the setting - brilliant! This setting is enhanced by a special cast of characters, including beggars, cripples, and dwarfs. Great performance is demonstrated by John Barrymore, who has surpassed only the magnificent Conrad Veidt, who portrays a degenerate, corrupt Louis XI to perfection. And yes, Veidt deliberately chooses his nose and pushes his portrayal into beautifully dwarfed limits.
