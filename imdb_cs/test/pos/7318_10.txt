This is one of the best Stooges shorts. Only one of their shorts was nominated for an Oscar. In this short Stooges, doctors play some trouble as usual. This short has non-stop sight-gags, puns and jokes. Part at the end where the Stooges break the machine. This is definitely a classic. I highly recommend these three Stoogs short.
