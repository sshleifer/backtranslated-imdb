Brad Pitt shoves his index finger into Diane Kruger's wound and holds it there until he gets what he wants. Funny, awful. The invented yarn takes "The Dirty Dozen" for a ride and sometimes leaves it to pay tribute to other films. Lots of fun. Even "Paris when it sizzles" is mentioned in the wonderfully organic part of the dialogue. I was excited about Christoph Waltzer's character and his sensational performance. Brad Pitt creates a genuine original. I love the actor's lack of vanity. There's a joke in a character that's pure Brad Pitt. Tarantino visits the new universe, but. Fortunately, his hand. his brain and his heart are visible everywhere.
