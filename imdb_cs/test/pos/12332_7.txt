I was a little surprised by the PG rating on the back of the DVD case. I certainly wouldn't want my kids to watch this. I think it would frighten the bullshit of ten years. Plot: A girl trying to fit in a handle is shrouded and troubled "in the crowd." They tell her to spend the night in this haunted mausoleum (which reminds me of Phantasm ...) and they are troubling her at night. Little do they know that a recently deceased clairvoyant returns to life and lifts the dead around him! It sounds awfully shabby, but given the age and budget that was undoubtedly quite small, this film is fun on many levels. Beware of the morning EG Daily as one of the crow's brats. I liked it and my girlfriend was scared. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 children.
