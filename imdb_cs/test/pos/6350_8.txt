This story of a teacher who has a relationship with a student is told in a subtle way, which distinguishes him from most films with this plot. Mr. Lam (Jacky Cheung) has a relationship with Choy (Karena Lam, who was also so good at "Koma") in what initially appears to be an inexplicable situation. He is married for 20 years with Ching (the great Anita Mui, in his last role before she was cruelly taken away from us) and seems to be a loving relationship. When Ching offers care for her and former teacher Mr. Lam, Choy and Mr. Lam have the opportunity to be together. What makes the film so good is director Ann Hui. It takes a while to reveal Lams' secrets and it all makes sense. The film is very dramatic and moving. You feel no repulsion about the situation of a teacher / student, something that this film raises over many with the same plot. He moves slowly, but stay with him. Also, enjoy the wonderful, unpretentious but wonderful performance of Ms. Mui. Somebody was really strange and the last time you fell in love with this movie. It is worth to be witnesses and to be with her.
