Sony Pictures Classics, I'm Watching You! Sony has rights to Harry's records - you have to distribute the film and get a radically increased sales of its back catalog! Anyway, it's a great study of a fascinating musician, woefully unfamiliar, full of great stories, more music, and it could be 3 hours longer and I'd love it. He saw it at the American Cinemateque Mods & Rockers Festival at the Aero Theater in Santa Monica, where he played a packed house. They turned the people at the door! I went to many films from the Mods & Rockers festival, and let me assure you that no other movie got to sell, let alone people. Check it out in the theater, buy a DVD and make sure some slow company [* cough SONY cough *] picks it up ASAP!
