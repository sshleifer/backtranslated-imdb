For many years, Samuel Goldwin tried to bring his friend Jasch Heifetz to the screen. One evening, when Goldwyn and his wife Frances attended a dinner with Heifetz and his wife, the silent star Florence Vidor, Goldwyn suggested that the Heifetz star star in the movie. After some persuasion, Heifetz agreed that his actions would be kept to a minimum. A movie, originally called "Music School" was born. The story itself is somewhat stocked: streetwise boy (Gene Reynolds, best known as producer "M * A * S * H"), runs away from home and ends up in a financially troubled music school led by Professor Lawson (Walter Brennan) While trying to raise funds for the school, the boy and other children become over Heifetz in Carnegie Hall.After a lot of ado, Heifetz ends up appearing at a school concert and sponsoring the school. <br /> <br / The story, although predictable, is surprisingly well written, although the film contains several smaller gaffs where different scenes have been corrected together, the most obvious being the young cellist who is sent out of the orchestra room errand and is seen sitting in the orchestra for a few seconds The studio was then usual for studios and surrounded an inexperienced star with the talent of veterans: Brennan, Joel McCream, Andrea Leeds, Porter Hall, Marjorie Main (later Ma and Pa Kettle fame), Arthur Hohl, Paul Harvey and Who Who Who character actors. Actress Diana Lynn and singer / actress Kaye Connor made their (uncredited) debuts in this film, as did Long Nelson Eddy singer partner Gale Sherwood (as Jacqueline Nash). Also appearing are actors from childhood veterans Reynolds, Walter Tetley and Terry Kilburn. Goldwyn hired Peter Meremblam, a highly acclaimed youth orchestra from Los Angeles to appear in the film. Most of the children in the orchestra were not actors, but they were excellent musicians, as were professionals (many of whom later became). Many children in the orchestra continued in notable careers: Kaye Connor and Diana Lynn starred in theater and in movies, Richard Berres was producer and director, Mitchell Lurie founded a well-known company for music supplies, Elliott Rapaport continued to be a prominent cardiologist, Lewis Elias was the leader of the group, Thomas Facey conductor with various symphonies, Channing Robbins prominent instructor at Julliard School, his sister Joyce Robbins instructor does not know, SUNY Stonybrook, and many of the children in the orchestra chased the musical. Careers at the Great Symphony Orchestras. While Heifetz's acting was kept to a minimum, his salary was not. For seven weeks he commanded $ 70,000. When some scenes had to be re-shot later, he got another $ 50,000 for the next four weeks. What fortunately was not kept to a minimum was his musical output. The score was taken by composer Alfred Neumann (once conductor of the Meremblum Orchestra). Heifetz performs "Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso" by Camille Saint-Saens, his own arrangement of "Estrellita" by Manuel Ponce (with Teddy Saidenberg's off-screen guide), Dinica's Devil's Heavy "Mount Staccato" (from Vitaphone, with Emanuel) Bay by Piano ), an excerpt from Tchaikovsky's "Melody", an excerpt for a violin solo by Tchaikovsky's famous "Adante Cantabile" from his opus 11 string quartet (played during the opening titles at the beginning of the film) and a closing movement by Felix Mendelssohn-Barthody's E Lesser Violin Concerto. During all these performances, there are many Heifetz's closeups of performance, including some very close shots of his fingering and bowing, something that would have value for violinists longing to study his technique. The Meremblum Orchestra also shines here, performing the arias "Caro Nome" Verdi and "Casta Diva" Bellini, (both with Sherwood singing), the overture arrangement from Rossini's "Barber Seville", a short extract from Mozart is "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik", and the previously mentioned Mendelssohn Concert (with Heifetz). Diana Lynn can be heard in the background of one scene, performing as part of Chopin's Nocturne in B-flat Menor, and five-year-old Mary Ruth performs Chopin's popular "Minute" Waltz. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an excellent movie. AMC showed it regularly until the beginning of 1992. In recent years I have not seen it on TV, but it's hard to get a copy. If you have a chance, I recommend that you read the movie.
