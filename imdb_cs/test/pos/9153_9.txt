And there's nothing wrong with that! I warmly support the comments of boblipton and Snow Leopard. I'm thrilled to find that this movie is available on an American DVD - I've ever seen it - I convinced the Goethe Institute here in London to show it in their Conrad Veidt season a few years ago - and long to see it again. Barrymore is radiant when dealing as much as in this movie, perhaps because of the prick to have a reputable German actor as a film. And Veidt is such an amazing scenter of scenes (does it take a nose at one point?) This is one of the key films that combine 'Dr Jekyll' with '20th Century', 'Grand Hotel' or 'Midnight'; and "Cabinet of Dr. Caligari "or" Student of Prague "with" Spy in Bladk "," Contraband "and" Casablanca ". <br /> <br /> Look!
