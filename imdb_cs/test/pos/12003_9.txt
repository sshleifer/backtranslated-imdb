Columbo is a guest lecturer for criminology. Students invite him along with their after-class meetings. Crossing to a nearby parking garage, they discover their regular teacher next to their car, dead from a gunshot wound. (No, Columbo wasn't behind male work.) As a Columbo class project, he includes students in his sleuthing. Two students, pre-identified by the viewer as culprits, were in the classroom lecture hall. In addition, the tracks of the parking garage monitoring cameras show that no one else but the professor has entered or gone after being last seen unexpectedly leaving the lecture hall. Reverse normal routine, Columbo is the one who is poisoning the evil (?) duo, craving news of progress and ear for their theories. There is almost no forensic evidence. The solution to the case depends on some possible and interesting happiness. At first viewing, it seemed that Columbo had swallowed the whole guilt of the culprits; however, on repeated viewing, small details showed that it was not to be the case at all. <br /> <br /> This reviewer still has "Columbo Goes to College."
