This is one of the most fun movies I've ever seen. 14-year-old boy Jason Shepherd wrote an English paper called "Big Fat Liar". When his skateboard was taken, he had to use his sister's bike to get to college in time and hit the limo. When he went to the limousine, he met a famous Hollywood producer, Marty Wolf. When he left the limo, he forgot one thing: his paper! So Marty Wolf took it and turned Jason's English paper into a movie! When Jason admitted he had left the paper in a limousine and Marty took it, his parents and his English teacher didn't trust him! So Jason and his friend Kaylee had to fly to Los Angeles to go to Hollywood to confess that he stole his story from Jason's parents. When Jason told Marty to call his father that Marty had stolen the paper, Marty burned it and burned his paper! Jason was so angry that Marty burned the paper, so Marty called security to get Jason out of his site! Jason and Kaylee realized Marty wasn't going to accept the truth. In order to get into Phase 2: Takedown, Jason and Kaylee put a permanent blue dye in the pool and when Marty jumped in, his body turns blue and doesn't fall out! Then he puts a permanent orange dye in Marty's shampoo, and when he uses it, all his hair turns orange, and it doesn't fall out either! Finally, they put a lot of glue on Marty's handset to call him Jason's father, and when Marty uses it, he holds on to his ear! It was funny when Marty's hair and body turned to blue and orange, and his handset was stuck to his ear! After that, they fooled Marty by telling Monty, who is Marty's assistant, that Duncan moved to the house where there is a party going on. When Marty went to see Duncan, he was in the wrong house and all the kids at the party beat him! When Marty was in the house, Jason and Kaylee switched their car controls. When Marty drove the car, he knew that all the controls were switched and didn't know which button to push. He's stupid enough to fall for it. When Marty hit the back end of the mashera, the maser destroyed his car! It was so fun. So Marty starts calling Jason's dad and tricking him again! He was on the phone, but he wasn't his father. After the security system got Jason and Kaylee out of Marty's place, they suggested they go home. Monty will be on the side of Jason and Kaylee because she knew Marty was a liar and a jerk, so she told Rocca, who is one of the security guards to take care of the kids. Jason told his father the truth about his last 2 days and his parents arrived in L.A. When Monty came to the children, she would help the children move into Stage 4: Return. Jason divides the crew into 3 teams for stage 4. One team disperses and tricks Marty until Jason's parents get on the scene. Marty first went with Frank Jackson, but his car broke up so he drove with Jaleel, but he took him to the desert and left him there. When Marty was in the desert, the helicopter came to save him. Then one of the blades gets stuck, so Marty and the pilot got out of the helicopter. After that, he was on his way to the set and when Jason saw him, Marty stopped and saw what Jason had: his monkey! So Marty followed Jason and Kayle and when they saw Lester, he let go of water and when the water came, he pulled Marty away. Marty was still a kid, and when Kaylee went in the opposite direction, Jason led Marty to the top of the apartment building. Upstairs Jason urged Marty to admit that the truth and Marty would never tell the truth. When the crew caught Marty in surprise, all the people, including Jason's parents who were in the ensemble, knew what Marty had done. Marty was about to kill Jason, but the only way to escape Jason is to jump off the top! Then his parents believed Marty had accepted his story. When the people on the scene left, it's Marty's end. In the end, Jason's story, Big Fat Liar was a movie. I can't get enough.
