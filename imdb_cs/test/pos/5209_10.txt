This film is one of the most historically accurate war films ever made in displaying the reality of soldiers in battle, as well as the specific circumstances of the Battle of Stalingrad, which are evident when compared to the work of Anthony Beevor's. "Stalingrad". Unlike the better known "Gates Enemy", where the storyline is divided into a sniper / hunting story, this film shows what war can do to individuals. Though filmed by the Germans, "Stalingrad" is something but a nationalist apologetic film. It shows that war movies can be anything outside the flag-wave, jingoistic distortion of the grim truths of war, as so many Hollywood "war products" seem to be. Scripting, Gaming, Direction and Other Film Techniques in "Stlingrad" Are Highest Caliber. It is a necessary film for anyone who is considering entering the army and obeying orders of any type of "Fuehrer".
