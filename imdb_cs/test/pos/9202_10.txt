Frankly, I just like to watch James Caan. Beautiful actor. With such simplicity, you know exactly what they think. Real professional. I've been watching the show from the beginning and found it different - that's something that's unique in Hollywood - a new idea - not the third version of the current hit show - <br /> <br /> I also like a fun show and exciting - I like stimulation - I never get bored - especially I like the mystery in every episode - the way it develops. I am a big mysterious fan and I have read a lot of great mysteries, but I have written the stories well in the show and the result is rarely obvious. Particularly interesting to me, probably because I'm not a gambler, are the various disadvantages that "players" come up with - I was fascinated by the number of programs people came with to rob Las Vegas. Music: I like the music at the top of the show. Perfect for show ... Adjusts the tone and atmosphere. Just amazing. And of course there's James Caan.
