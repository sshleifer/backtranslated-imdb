I could never imagine starting to love movies like that. After I saw "Hero" Yimou Zhang, I decided to check his other movies, maybe look for something similar. Yimou Zhang's second film, which I watched, was 'No One Less', after which I realized what movie I am now. No wonder I immediately got 'Keep Cool'. It's a simple, moving and brilliant cinema, I respect the director. This film shows that it is not the amount of money that makes the film good. It's all about what the director wants to show and how successful he is. The story is a very simple, typical extract of typical everyday life, moreover shown in a very simple way, camera movements also enhance the film's feel and feel. This film gives me the highest rating and I am eagerly awaiting Yimou Zhang's next films.
