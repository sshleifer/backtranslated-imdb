The greatest period of cinema began in post-war Europe with the neo-realistic movement of Italy. Over the next two or three decades that followed, all the French New Wavers captured their attention, and somewhere there was Bergman on a deserted Scandinavian island. But in 1971, Luchino Visconti brought an artistic form into a complete circle, geographically speaking, with his miraculous work Death in Venice *, which could also be called * The Death of Europoean Cinema *. After the 1950s, the great European filmmakers who, with a few exceptions, grew up and handed over the torch to the new American generation of Brats (Coppola, Scorsese, & Co.). This film is totally felt as a great summary, not only from Visconti's special obsessions, but also from the general effort of European filmmakers to achieve an aesthetic ideal in films. And be sure you won't see any stricter task-master than Visconti. He doesn't play to the crowd, to the people: you either follow him or follow him or leave you. Stimulation is a challenge: slow but never without emotional weight. "Incidents" are very few and far between, but each of them is symbolic in the "robustm-und-drang cosmons" cosmos. We will probably never be in such a rare film company: one of the greatest writers of the century who inspired the story (Thomas Mann), one of the greatest filmmakers who drove it (Visconti), one of the greatest actors starring (Dirk Bogarde), and swelling almost constantly in the background, Gustav Mahler's 5th Symphony. Visconti took full advantage of Mahler's ability to inspire romanticism in the most cynical breasts. It turns the main character of Aschenbach into a dilapidated composer from his original personality as a writer, even to Bogarde to LOOK as Mahler (a geeky mustache, specifications, hairy hair, duck walking). By the way, Bogarde adds what is probably the greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies: it's pretty quiet performance, and the actor must bring a blow to meaning in a gesture or look - a difficult trick without Chaplin mugging or just as an animated corpse. The cinema just isn't better than this. I will ignore Ritalin's addicts out there who say it's too slow, but even a more legitimate gripe regarding some Aschenbach flashes with his hostile friend is wrong. Memories of shots fit neatly into the thematic areas of the film (ie, Which is a Better Way to Aesthetic Perfection: Passion or Discipline?), And the sudden and quivering of these interruptions serves to prevent sleepiness among viewers. (Of course, some viewers will sleep over this movie.) Mahler's nonstop stream and the beautiful dying Venice would be nothing more than a nice picture; but this movie is about something. And what it is most about is suffering: especially the romantic (main R) suffering. As a suffering romantic, Visconti himself knew where he was talking. <br /> <br /> [SPOILER. . . I think] If for nothing else, see * Death in Venice * for its amazing introductory credits. . . And for his unforgettable ending, with Bogarde's jet-black dye hair drips from his sweaty, dying head and on his chalky white face. Meanwhile, in the distance, the young ocean of Tadzio, the object of Bogard's dying desire, stands in the ocean, heading for the horizon like a statue of Michelangelo. The climatic succession sums up with the painful economy everything that film is about: love, lust, beauty, loss, the end of life that stands at the beginning of another life, and the cold death amid the warm, sunny beauty. Death in Venice is a miraculous work of art. <br /> <br /> [DVD Tip: As with the currently released Visconti * The Damned *), I recommend that you turn on English subtitles while watching this movie. It's seemingly in English, but the DVD sound seems muddy and there is a lot of Italian in the movie.] <br /> <br />
