I read a few movie reviews and thought it wasn't as good as the previous Karate Kid installments. Although my favorite is still Karate Kid II, I felt that this fourth series of the series was in line with others and had some important lessons to share. Unlike previous versions, he is a karate student who has a different way of learning than a male teenager. Maggi considers it a bit more challenging, but it is rising to this opportunity. Plots are plausible and predictable. I found that the parachutes are a little one-dimensional, but this weakness is present in all installments in different degrees. Working with the camera is impressive and from time to time there are several beautiful scenery. The Zen Monastery is both austere and charming. The woman's monks add some humor and lightness to the narrative flow. I liked the "Zen Bowling" scenes, which are a funny counterpoint to the more serious scene of Zen Archery earlier. The quality of the film is like a good TV series. The music chosen for the background is very good, especially with the Little River Band playing "Listen to Your Heart". Clocks in film are valuable and worth learning. They feel loyal to the spirit of karate and make sure that the fighting part is not praised. Overall, I enjoyed it.
