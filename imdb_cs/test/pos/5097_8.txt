"Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is a superbly written and photographed musical version of the classic movie from 1939. In addition to the beautifully directed performance of Peter O'Toole as a pedantic teacher who finds love and is changed, the film contains hundreds of stunning visuals, from Grecian ruins to side streets in London to the extended landscape. The music and lyrics of Leslie Bricusse have been criticized as boring or not-up-to-par for film musicals, but they are used to improving the story rather than saying it. Many songs are used to underline assemblies or scenes; those few who are not included in the "show biz" numbers. In this way, the songs do not affect this delicate story, but they increase what the characters think or feel. "Where did my child happen?", "Walk with the world with me" and "you and me" are particularly effective. An immersive, brilliantly played, directing and written film.
