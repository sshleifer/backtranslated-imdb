Look ... I came here to expect this performance from William Macy ... the guy's just doing amazing performances ... but MEAT LOAF? Just as his Loafness decided to leave Jim Steinman behind and throw his definitely lower weight in the amazing world of Stanislavsky? Well ... what can I say? I'm very impressed. To paraphrase the old saying, "It's not meat, it's an emotion" ... and the loaf rouses its late-stage chops silently. perfect here ... great work in costumes and hair departments ... David Paymer is an outlaw, but right on the money. The fixed camera operates throughout the movement. The plot line recalls the "gentlemen's agreement" (anti-Semitism after World War II). Well worth your time ... especially for the growing Legion Bill Macy acolytes. <br /> <br />
