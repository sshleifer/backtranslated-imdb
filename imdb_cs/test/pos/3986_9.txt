This is a great movie. The story begins in Romania, where Billy Crystal acts as an agent who can talk to anyone. There's a really funny scene where Crystal is a child, and he talks to his father, who is a rabbi to eat pork (you may know it's a parody of Crystal's religion). He is mainly a talent scout and tries to find a suitable villain for his latest film. After discovering that the whole movie has a terrible crew, it accidentally falls into a small river. I believe he's dead, so huge hands came to him. He later thinks he's in heaven. He finds out he is not, but he is in the monastery. He believes that God saved him, becomes a monk, who seeks to save him. He later finds 7 ft 7 in human, who he throws as a perfect villain (he also recites Shakespeare!). Watch the movie and find out the rest!
