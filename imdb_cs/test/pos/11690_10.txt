First I must admit that I had some doubts about the director. He has made several films (with Jarkovsky) about recent "Czech" Eastern history or, more precisely, about families (individuals) as they survived some historical moments. But it was always like sweet sweet food. This film was completely different. It was pure, showing the bones of life, showing variations of human nature. This film is an excellent art (story, play, picture, music), but it shows you the life around you in a much brighter light that we don't want to see. By the way, I saw it on DVD (with English subtitles), but I'm afraid I won't be able to get it in the US.
