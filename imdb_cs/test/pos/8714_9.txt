Bridgette Bardot, who looked sexy, plays a spoiled but innocent daughter of the French ambassador. She is with one of her father's top assistants (womanizer MICHEL) to marry her and it turns out to be the best thing for both of them. Michel is soon flirting with his old friends, and to teach him a lesson, Bridgette is flirting strongly with his married PRINCE CHARLES. Michel is surprised at his jealousy. A game for cats and mice follows between Brigdette and Michel ("I'll have an affair" ... "No you won't" ...) And finally, Michel realizes that she could and promises to give up all the others. ladies in his life. Bridgette and Michel comfortably settle into their happily-ever-after, while Prince Charles jets home to England. It's undoubtedly a lightweight piece, but it's incredibly charming. While some may commit to be a product of time, I found it pleasant. Worth renting.
