It is characteristic that this film is unknown. This obviously lacks most of the elements that a successful theatrical film needs: heroes, villains, conflicts and solutions, romantic love interest. sad, angry, hurt and hungry, and no one has a solution for anything. In short: it's a war and it's a hell for everyone involved. People try to do their best, but interests, devotion and so-called duty intervene. The image brings us back to civil war in time with the intensity that is rarely seen in today's cinema. Direct sincere pictures of intense beauty. Actors are very well cast for the story and make characters come really alive before our eyes. <br /> <br /> Silver Dollar in a Pile of Nickels!
