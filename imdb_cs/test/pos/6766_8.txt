This film is a combination of dark comedy and drama, two guys who worked in a butcher shop and wanted to build their own. When they finally fulfilled this dream, they faced a new problem: there were no clients! One day, by chance, one person dies in the refrigerator and starts a new kind of butcher? Will they start selling human meat and telling clients it's just chicken? and their business is getting better: The human body is selling well! Oh! Did I forget to say something? These guys aren't normal! Something is missing in your brain! The film has nice dark humorous scenes, but in my opinion it's mostly drama. The one who shows us what is inside the psychopath's head, what are his motivations for what he is doing. I have to admit, I was a little surprised at the end of the movie because I never expected to do it without discovering it, but that's probably because I see too many Hollywood movies? I mean, in Hollywood cinema, we always expect the punishment of the guys doing "bad things." "Good values" always protect morality, even though we all know that in "real life" it doesn't happen too many times? I liked this film mainly because it fits into a cinema that is true, frontal, without false morals, and which "sees" what is on the other hand, behind "conventional morality"? It only happens in an independent cinema (especially in Europe)! Besides, there are excellent performances by Nikolai Lie Kass and Mads Mikkelsen (especially the first) in the roles of "disturbed guys" ??? Very nice Danish movie!
