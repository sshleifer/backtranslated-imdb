I just wanted to say that I'm watching National Velvet on TV, it's now February 2006 and I've been looking at the details of the data, etc. Surprising that it was in 1944 and Rooney was 24 years old while Liz Taylor was just 12 what perfect English actress is. <br /> <br /> If you want some Americans to contribute correctly: There are no Irish villages in England. Ireland is a completely different country and has nothing to do with the English countryside. The scenes depicted are reportedly received on the south coast of England between Brighton and Arundel (county Sussex). Unfortunately, such a scene does not exist. Like many places, roads and buildings were built on the hills and beaches. <br /> <br /> So please, you all like Americans, don't confuse Ireland with England! we take a big exception to this. As confusing Texas with Coney Island.
