For the first time on TV, I saw the opening of the movie "Porgy and Bess" by Otto Preminger, probably in the early 1980s, and my younger one found it a little slower, despite timeless music. I turned it off <br /> <br /> Last night, a very rare one, tiled together the print projected on L.A. Cinematheque and that was a little revelation. Performance is strong and unforgettable. Dorothy Dandridge brings to her part a great vulnerability, strength and subtle (at least according to today's standards) eroticism. Sidney Poitier is said to be uncomfortable with the movie, but his performance is amazing, as is Pearl Bailey. Even better are Sammy Davis as amoral, feline Sportin 'Life and Brock Peters as villanious bully Crown. I'm still not a Preminger fan, leaden - and much easier. see - "Carmen Jones." Porgy and Bess "are much better than the less controversial film - although it may have to do with the fact that the source material is also much better. <br /> <br /> As you can see last night, it's robust, But Not all of these moments come to life, and the film mixes the apparently stylized Catfish Row (beautifully made by Oliver Smith) with real places, even on my somewhat untrained ear., Some short parts of the score seem too popular. In addition, when it doesn't hurt the success of the filmmakers - Preminger's decision to film almost in wide-angle, detail-free and occasional medium-sized shots, they undoubtedly made him unnoticeable on television "set and scanned" and can spoil it on widescreen discs DVDs, if it deserves to be restored on small screens, are crucial to the way Preminger introduced the movie. <br /> <br /> Also, mi x sly el last night was special. Many of the vocals, especially on the opening "Summertime", seemed to be too soft and were overwhelmed by instrumental music. Maybe it can be fixed in restoration. There is a question of the film's racial policy. Personally, I see nothing wrong with it, at least in the current context. At a time when so few movies depicted strong African American characters, it might seem an unfortunate choice for a big-budget Hollywood movie. And while there is not much "empowerment", they are recognizable human beings that are not racial stereotypes. These are opera characters that are badly chosen because that's what tragic characters do. That in itself made a huge step forward at that time. <br /> <br /> In a modern context where strong and heroic African-American characters are less rare (though still not enough), these characters seem no more or less than humans. Indeed, poor and deceived people could be of any ethnic origin. Postponed politics, the original work is undoubtedly one of the greatest achievements of American music and (secondary) theater. Poitier, Davis, Dandridge, Peters and, yes, Pearl Bailey, were all amazing artists we'll never see again. This less than perfect but still solid movie clearly deserves to be seen and valued.
