Although this film changes reality to become more heroic and fun, sometimes fantasy is more fun than real life, and nothing can be more real than Errol Flynn playing Custer. This is the best movie about Custer. Max Steiner's music is magnificent and also thanks to the Irish song "Gerry Owen", which was a popular Custer. The film should have more villains because it tries to focus all the bad guys on Arthur Kennedy. The relationship between Flynn and De Havilland is similar to that of other films, and director Raoul Walsh with his outdoor experience with a lot of actors is at his best.
