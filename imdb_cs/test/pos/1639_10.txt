Well, that was just brilliant. I wish the rest of season 1 was so strong. It really needs more episodes like this. The cast worked perfectly, though it was all noble days. Writing was fantastic as well as editing. Great work in all accounts. The episode was exciting, exciting, and just got you to the very end. What is what most MOTW episodes have tried but failed to the present. <br /> <br /> The first five-piece episode for me. Really good, almost like a movie. I didn't even remember that it was good. I think it's even better than the great horror movie The Thing.
