Michael Radford, director of "Venice Merchant", is doing tremendous work in opening the game because it is more accessible for everyone to have a great time on movies that follow this ugly story of a terrible time in history. The seductive production of Shakespeare's play is a feast for the eyes with a rich detail of Venice XVI Century. This is a story of revenge, prejudice and justice, as William Shakespeare imagined. When we saw the game several times, we weren't ready for what we expected. Radford makes sure that the story is presented in such a way that everyone can easily understand it. Also, he used a version of English that makes more sense, rather than relying on the original text. In fact, as Shylock speaks in the film, there is no shock at all that he is a member of a minority that has been marginalized by the Venetian authorities and the Catholic Church. Al Pacino's vast picture of Shylock shows a man who is vulnerable, arrogant, vindictive, average and totally human. Mr. Pacino sheds light on the character of a man who is defeated in court by a technical solution. His own daughter left him and his whole world seems to look at him. At the end of the film we see a person who has been reduced to the goal of hatred and ridicule of everyone. Lynn Collins, because Portia is a happy discovery. When she saw her in a lighter fare, she not only surprised but made the best of her role and time in front of her camera. It shows us that she is a high-intelligence woman who comes to help her husband and her best friend who risked his own well-being in trying to help Bassani's hand to Portia's hand. Jeremy Irons plays Antonio, the man who seeks Shylock for "Bridge Loan". After all, he knows that his ships will soon return with wealth from abroad. Antonio gets a lot more than he negotiated when he agreed to Shylock's loan terms. Antonio has the best plans to get lost when he fails to fulfill his duties. Mr. Irons gives a gentle performance. Joseph Fiennes is a good look like Bassanio. His good looks and charms make Portia feel a soul mate in this young Venetian people because they know it's for her. Also in smaller roles, Kris Marshall, Zuleika Robinson, Charlie Cox, help make the film a pleasant experience. Finally, it is Mr. Radford's triumph thanks to the vision Venice and his citizens give us during the terrible time in human history.
