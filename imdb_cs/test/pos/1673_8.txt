This film is a clean class work from start to finish, forget the famous 28-minute dialogue line for a moment, remember it's in Paris and forget Noir. The film itself, the premise and the performance make it a pure golden experience. It is a sharp intelligent and thoughtful detail, just like the robbery itself. It depicts real characters who are not only credible, but with whom you feel. It's a movie that doesn't deceive the notion of robbery, but it shows what it is .. theft. This shows that robbery is hard work and ultimately not worth it. Now all the things that are considered the best to be a bold 28-minute succession that doesn't say a word, and that takes place in gorgeous Paris with really great attention to detail and fantastic cinematography and the last scene ... if you look up You see the trees. amazing use of raw and basic shooting techniques ... it's in my opinion a masterpiece and i'm glad i saw it.
