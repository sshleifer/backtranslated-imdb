One of my favorite childhood movies. Chipmunk Adventure packs incredible entertainment focused on both young and old. The animation is lively and varied, and the film itself boasts some of the best songs ever put into the animated feature. Who could forget the dynamic "Boys / Girls of Rock n 'Roll", the exciting "Diamond Dolls", and the heartrending "My Mother"? This should be considered a nostalgic classic animated jewel of the 1980s. It's too bad they don't do it like that anymore. Most of the animated films now resort to violence, humor or sentimental mash ... with the exception of the Pixar people. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: An amazing and unforgettable adventure for all ages.
