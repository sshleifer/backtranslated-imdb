Daisy Film Review From James Mudge From the Nazi Film <br /> <br /> "Daisy" is on paper as the dream of an Asian film fan, director of "Infernal Affairs" co-founder of Andrew Lau and playing favorite sassy. girl, popular Korean actress Jeon Ji Hyun. Unfortunately, despite the talent involved and the fact that the crew flew halfway around the world to shoot in Amsterdam, the film turns out to be a little disappointing, it is a cliché of a romantic drama that sway in misery and self-confidence. The story follows Hye Young (Jeon Ji Hyun), a rather naive Korean girl who lives in Amsterdam and lives in her grandfather's antique shop and makes portraits for tourists. One day he begins to receive flowers exactly at the same time from a secret admirer who believes he is a mysterious man from the past who once built a nice little bridge for her. One day she meets Jeong Woo (Lee Seong Jae, also in "Holiday" and "Public Enemy"), who is without her, is an Interpol agent who watches Asian criminals in the Netherlands. With Hye Young Assuming Jeong Woo is responsible for the flowers, they both very slowly fall into a chaste romantic relationship. However, it turns out that a man sending flowers is actually Park Yi (Jung Woo Sung, from "Sad Movie" and "Musa"), a murderer working for a Chinese crime syndicate. Inevitably, a love triangle becomes tragic and both men find themselves on the opposite side, while poor Hye Young tries to find out which one is the love of her life. "Daisy" is reportedly a love story, it has a funeral feeling, with a slow, dark pace and conspiracy that accumulates on poverty. Half of the time of the film is occupied by the scenes of the characters staring out the window from the window to the rain, the silence interrupted only by bouts of confident narration. Director Lau appears to be under the impression that the film is a serious Shakespeare tragedy, rather than another grim hit-love love story. As such, the controls have somewhat challenging air, despite the fact that the plot is inherently predictable and is based largely on the glaring cliché borrowed by the Liberals of the "Fulltime Killer" and John Woo "The Killer". Almost every aspect of the film is riddled with anxiety, while the three main characters suffer as if the weight of the world were on their shoulders, and they steadfastly refuse to do anything to continue their romantic inclinations. Especially Park Yi, as a kind of overly emotional, socially retarded murderer, a popular modern cinema, is faintly ridiculous, from his incredible inability to work to his merry attempts to discuss Impressionist painting with Hye Young or his fondness for flower growing. This inconspicuous passivity causes the film's central romance to be somewhat hard to swallow, and Lau's attempts to make it feel like the fate that brings the characters together are more than indulgence. Jeon Ji Hyun Fans She should notice that her character is much closer to her role in the supernatural drama "Uninvited" than "My Sassy Girl" or "Windstruck", and while she is trying her best pull a few crazy faces back and forth, its performance is definitely more silenced. The film benefits from shiny production values, and Lau makes good use of Amsterdam's scenery, playing in contrast between the gray, almost Gothic beauty of the city and the innocent blue sky and flower field landscape. Unfortunately, it tends to overuse the slow motion of some emotional scenes, which, along with some visual postcards, give the film the feeling that they sometimes appear in perfume advertising. There are a few scenes of surprisingly violent action, though these are few and far between, and though well staged, appear to have been thrown as an idea and do little more than briefly raise the pulse. Despite his shortcomings, "Daisy" does for engaging viewing, and the story grips almost in spite of himself, mainly from the morbid fascination to see not which of the men Hye Young ends up with, but to see who will be lying dying in hand . Melodrama's own indulgence works well enough to break all genres for all the chips, and the film works perfectly as a pleasantly shiny romantic romance. It is worth noting that the DVD includes a film director's cut that once shows it to be substantially different from a theatrical version that not only adds 25 minutes, but also rearranges some scenes, making the story less linear. Although this new version may be too long, it is certainly better because, without these changes, the film would certainly be even more conventional and suffer even from the darker development of the characters.
