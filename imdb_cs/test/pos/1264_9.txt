He saw it at the Hong Kong International Film Festival, more than three years ago. I went unexpectedly because Christopher Nolan was unnamed at the time, but it sounded interesting and it turned out to be one of the best things I saw at this festival. It worked well on the big screen, with the technique of cutting scenes from the mood-adding sequence. Mr.Nolan at the end shared well how he did it, so that any one of them would be a filmmaker! I liked it better than Memento, though it was probably due to lower expectations. And the fact that it was rather an artistic film.
