Watchers is a fun movie if it's not very serious, the Dean R. Koontz novel is of course much better, but the film itself is fun in its own way. The film has a lot of changes for the novel Watchers, one difference is the main character Travis. The book was an adult and retired Delta Force soldier, while in the film he is a teenager. The Rangers have their good points, the film has some cruel scenes in parts. I'm a fan of Micheal Ironside and it was cool to see him in this movie, he always does a great performance in all his movies. The OXCOM costume seems to be a bit cheesy, but the camera never really shows the face completely until the end of the movie. Einstien was impressive because he was well trained. The film sees two genetic experiments that escape from the lab, dog, and monster. Both experiments are telepathically coupled because both animals are part of a military project where the dog penetrates the enemy base, then the animal is attacked and removed. The dog finds a teenager named Travis, who takes him home and finds himself intelligent, so he appoints Einstein, while OXCOM is wandering around killing people and blackmailing his eyes. the incident gets out of hand. Soon, Travis learns that his is not safe because OXCOM is attracted to the dog and stops at nothing to kill him and no one in the way, so Travis and his mother are going to rescue their girlfriend who is being held by two agents in the hospital . They then hide in the forest, while government agents and OXCOM are not far behind. The Rangers isn't a great adaptation of Dean R. Koontz's novel, but it's a thrilling horror movie, some fans of the book may not want to watch it because it's not a loyal book, but fans of cheesy 80's horror movies may want to check it out .
