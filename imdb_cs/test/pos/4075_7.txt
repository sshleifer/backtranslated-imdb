I don't understand why so many people didn't like this movie. Robert De Niro was at the top of his game, bringing his lines to that way, one must believe that this is his everyday behavior. It is true that the film seemed to be collecting a lot of camaraderie conventions and trying to make fun of this concept. From a police dog to the fact that Eddie Murphy didn't bore me from my poison, this movie is a real breeder. Rene Russo also perfectly matched the rest of the cast, setting her role to not interfere with the promising relationship between De Niro and Murphy.
