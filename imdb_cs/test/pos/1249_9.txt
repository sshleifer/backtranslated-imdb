Imagine you have the opportunity to see yourself again as a child. Think about what would happen if you had the chance to talk to your younger self or even change it. Would you try to influence or try to change your younger self's belief in the light of your future experience? Or could it change the perception of the life and reality of your older self? Walt Disney's The Kid is trying to incorporate this complex idea by introducing "older" Bruce Willis into a collision course with "younger" Spenser Breslin (The Santa Clause 2 and The Cat in the Hat). The result is sometimes a funny, sometimes touching encounter that makes you think about your own past, present and future - and really believes it's never too late to change course.
