Pedaling Water is a very beautiful movie. I'd put it right under the fabulous short film Cosa Bella from Fiona MacKenzie. It's not just about getting out, but about tolerance and acceptance in general. I look forward to further work by Laurel Himmel in the future. Actors, Angie Redman and Nina Landey are pretty good. The relationship of the main characters could be strengthened a bit, as we realized there was a very strong bond between them, but maybe it might have been a little explained. I'm surprised that Angie Redman doesn't appear too much in other films. A great first step as a director for Laurel Himmel, I'm sure her skills are more visible.
