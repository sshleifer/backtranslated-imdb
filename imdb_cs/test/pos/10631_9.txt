As with all Haneke movies, decide for yourself - don't pamper yourself with what you read, and if you are interested in someone who uses film medium for their own unique endings, look for yourself. Isabelle Huppert is overwhelming in this film - in combination with Hanek, the two never pull. Haneke is following us with a golden boy bait, Benoit Magimel, but this is an anti-romance just like Funny Games was an anti-thriller. You will have to force yourself to look at it a lot, and catharsis is much more in the range of permanent anxiety than any kind of emotional release, but it's an incredibly nervous and provocative mindset; Haneke still keeps a mirror on how desensitized Western civilization is or has happened. People can turn to it, but it's just what Solondz did in Happiness a few steps away. Even though Erika (Huppert) is based on reality, she can be considered an emotional metaphor. I do not recommend, but I would not discourage you ... definitely dividing people, but since this is largely about repression - this is no surprise.
