The League of Gentlemen was the most worrying British sitcom to be on TV, and how a funny movie can be so badly rated that they just don't taste this movie will want to watch you over and over again and it's still funny. it is surprising that it did wrong, but it is the British who will spoil the film most of the time, but this time (in my words) will encourage the giraffe comedy that has emerged over the Lady, it's the top of the British comedy and better than dodge-ball, so do it and it won't show you wrong because i don't really laugh through movies, but this movie was amazing over the best comedy characters but i was a little disappointed how much edward and tabb was there for back to writing this one film and it will not disappoint you.
