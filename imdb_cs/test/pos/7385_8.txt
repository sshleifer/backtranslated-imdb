Rickman is sexy and good, but "stranger" is less persuasive - Reedus is a bit sexy but not a consistent actor - in this case it may be a director's mistake - we should find him in tempting extreme because he is "nice" - but that's not enough. The frustrated wife is almost convincing - marriage 7 years and she and Rickman's character should be more equal, whether their roles are to be incompatible or not - they must now have patterns. I have it, though I think the wife is a bit stiff in her role - and she is not convincingly attracted to the "stranger" - so it's a failure - the unspoken link between Rickman's character and "stranger" is better even if we're not sure what It is. I miss Rickman's sexy English accent (fortunately he slips into it and the American pattern). disappointing, but with some great acting.
