What is worth mentioning, which is omitted in other reviews I have read here, is the subtext of how the law shaped the lives and behavior of homosexuals in the era depicted in the film. While Courtenay's character is obviously gay, he's not the only one: often spoken of by Mr. Davenport-Scott is different and the reason he never saw him, the reason he mentioned disappeared. was detained by police for homosexual activity - a crime in England at that time. Below the surface we can read that this recent event has disturbed Norman, Courtenay's character: and we can also see in passing the note of Oxenby, the character of Edward Fox, a quick renunciation of any connection to such a person when the law is included: fear the connection affects many characters, and is part of the portrait of the film color of the time and the people who inhabit it. The abolition of Courtenay at the end by Sir was envisioned all the way if this subtext is included: it also makes sense to an otherwise inexplicable omission of his Dresser from the list of those he thanks to him. Combined with fear of exposure, Flamboyance creates a combination of desire and fear that Courtenay must "enter the lights" as he does when making a notice of impending raids, a scene that would otherwise be unreasonable, but that is both symbolic and literal depiction of inner suffering man. So while the drama is a downfall of Finney Lord, a great deal of film and game tragedy comes from "fatal error." "Courtenay's homosexuality, and it makes a film about him, as the name suggests. <br /> <br /> The film's artistic direction, pace and film style seem to have come from a different time than the 1980s and, in some respects, World War II: Implicit portrayal of a society that is still sticking to the older moral order, and the sympathy of the character carried and destroyed by the cruelty of this order, the necessity of being imprisoned in the closed world of theater, and the knowledge we have of how many of them would be destroyed after the war , makes this film more derogatory for all its shortcomings.
