"Only Valiant" qualifies as a brave good western. This Gregory Peck cavalry versus the Indian Oater is a festive suicide mission with no trace of humor. Veteran director Gordon Douglas has attracted a grim, rough epic outside with the ideal cast of hard guys under considerable pressure; Even Lon Chaney, Jr., registers as a powerful Arabian soldier. Seemingly, screenwriter "Colorado Territory" Edmund H. North & "The Sun Scenario" Harry Brown drew his screenplay from the tense novel by Western filmmaker Charles Marquis Warren about a group of hard hard riders cut off from an escape route that must prevent murderous reddish roots to launch a devastating attack against the helpless white settlers. North and Brown stick to most of Warren's novel, and at the last moment of revelation - when there seems to be no way our heroes could survive the next onslaught of Native Americans? This turn of the century story develops an effective claustrophobic feeling in the second half of the event. Douglas and the company take studio bound sets and make them look convincing during the night hours. Sharp black and white photography of cameraman "Going My Way" Lionel Linden engulfs this western gloomy look that emphasizes its tension and atmosphere. Actor Michael Ansara, who later played the main villain in "Guns of the Magnificent Seven", is extremely effective in a small role as the hated Indian leader Tucsos. <br /> <br /> "Only Valiant" opens with over-vocal narration by Army Scout Joe Harmony. "This is my floor plan. I am an Scout for the Army. If I had been cut off for a long time. The whole nation is behind this pass" Pache of the Nation. (There is a graphic of the territory with Flinthead The mountains stretch across the canvas with a narrow passage.) Once they used to swarm from the pass to kill everything in the sights, then we built Fort Invincible that set the passage as well as the cork in the bottle. It's okay for a while, but "Paches is smart. It turns out that the burning remains of Fort Invincible with the dead man pinned to the wart wall and the spear from his belly. Captain Richard Lance (Gregory Peck of "12 O'Clock High") and his men are riding horses and capturing Tucsos (Michael Ansara) and Joe Harmony (Jeff Corey of "True Grit") wanting to shoot him on the spot. Harmony points out that Tucsos is the "fella that started this whole business." Captain Lance interrupts, "The army doesn't shoot prisoners, Joe." Predictably, Harmony is horrified in this perspective. "It's not an ordinary injun. It's as close to God as a fella can get. If you shoot him now, things will calm down. Without Tucsos shuffling them, the other Indians will be rational, just as fast as they do. You'll have every 'Pache in the area after him. We've had three years of it, you can stop it.' Just as foreseeably, Captain Lance refuses to kill Tucsos and Lance's decision to marry an Indian back sets things up. <br /> <br /> Colonel Drum (Herbert Heyes of "Union Station") surprises Lance when he tells him he should As it is, they need to get Tucsos to another place, each of the soldiers to Joe Harmony knows that taking Tucsos to Fort Grant is asking for death, the Apaches are ready in the mountains and the fortress is under the fortress. Eversham, Cathy Eversham (Barbara Payton of "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye") and Young Lieutenant William Holloway (Gig Young of "Shoot Horses, Don't The?") A significant narrative complication. Lance wants Colonel Drum to let Lance take Tucsos to Fort Grant because Drum can't save Lance, Drum changes orders and Holloway gets the last minute mission and everyone is shocked. In addition, Lance saw Cathy and Holloway kissing in public, and everyone thought Lance shifted Holloway out of jealousy. For one officer notes that rewriting commands is about the possible rewriting of the Bible. Predictably, Tucsos escapes and survivors and Harmony bring dead Holloway. Although Drum expects to receive 400 relief columns every day, Harmony points to Lance that Tucsos will attack. Tucsos saw the fortress and knew their lack of power. Lance asks to be 6 or 7 men of his choice for Fort Invincible men and prevent Tucsos from rallying war parties. A narrow place in the mountains keeps the Indians in power; instead they have to go once in a while. Lance believes that their men can thwart them when the relief column arrives. Drum gives him permission and Lance chooses the worst man. Everyone hates him and willingly kills him. <br /> <br /> "Only Valiant" is an example of a new breed of Western military after World War II. This is not gung-ho John Ford western cavalry. Indeed, Lance's own men want to kill him, and this signals the attitude of the soldiers during the Vietnam War when they crouched their own officers. Lance carries onus all? In addition to those few who know about the circumstances that caused a change in orders giving Holloway in charge of detail. Black and white photography increases the terrible nature of this Western world. "Only Valiant" equals the last stand in the West until the last minute. Reportedly, Peck hated this film, but then it is not a spit-and-Polish western in Technicolor. If anything, "Only Valiant" lives up to its origin Warner Brothers. He is small but significant and is free with a lot of dramatic and disgusting characters, practically "Dirty Dozen" western.
