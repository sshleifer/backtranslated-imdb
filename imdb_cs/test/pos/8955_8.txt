There is, as many reviews observed, a strong dark streak to this film. The director who reminds me most is John Landis (yeah, go ahead and howl I am a peasant). Arcand has the gift of exploring frivolous things in a dreary, gray way, then turning and exploring the horrors of life with a slight touch. <br /> <br /> The cast is above average without exception. Thomas Gibson, like David, is excellent as a moody and self-deceitful center around which the rest of the characters turn. He talks about a good nihilist, but his actions reflect more love in his character than he is willing to acknowledge. Gibson was a strong and subtle actor in 1993. It was hard to look at him and see Greg Montgomery, let alone Agent Hotchner of the criminal minds. It may not be the best scene, but the one I love most is my "rewinding" scene, where Candy awaits the visitor, and one uninvited person after the next appears at the door. When Candy's interpersonal environment swings farther and farther away, David just grows bouncier, perkier and more enthusiastically, like the skinny Gen-X "Tigger".
