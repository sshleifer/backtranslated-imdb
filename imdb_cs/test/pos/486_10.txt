Today I watched it for the second time and I have to say with all my heart that it is probably a damned time when they made a film about us as people who are not spiritual beings. Such a loss of human life, as this story may have, will result in some good will. And Eric is warmer than ever. Often, in the movies, the people of the first nation are perceived to be different from everyday people. We are always portrayed as chieftains or medicine people. Hey, we're just like everyone else. And this film showed it. We hurt when we do injustice and we can win in the search for justice. It's really bad that big movie companies can't see it. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD. Thanks to those who decided to show this story the way it was.
