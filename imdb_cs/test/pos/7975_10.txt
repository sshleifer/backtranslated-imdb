This is an excellent movie and I would recommend it to everyone. Mr. Drury's performances are top-notch as he always is, and he mixes well with other film actors. There's no tension or drama in the movie. Hell to pay you need to see the movie !!! The story was very exciting. I'd watch this movie over and over again because it has all the elements of a great Western movie. It was very authentic in how they portrayed the components dealing with this film, which includes weapons, horses and clothing. The soundtrack is pleasant and adds flavor to the film. James Drury has the right touch when he chooses a movie to engage with. This is another winner for the Western genre. !!!!!
