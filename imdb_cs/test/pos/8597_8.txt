Why is there such anxiety among IMDb reviewers who hate this movie? This is not a masterpiece, but when we looked at it twice, it's like an impressive drama in the world of network television. Robin Stone is the epitome of every Dan Rather, Phillip Stone and Brian What's-his-name on NBC. A man of a man who is not capable of love who succeeds professionally but fails in his personal life. I've been working in network news for eight years and Robin Stone's DO EXIST! The support cast works for me from Cannon (which may be annoying but not in this movie) Greene (who plays the pathos) to Wexler (who has scored as a young model in love with Prince Charming and can't reconcile the picture with true ugliness inside). Also the note is the end which some IMDb reviewers claim is kick-out. It is not! Listen to the song "He's Moving On" for clues on how Robin Stone's character travels that he finally faces his problems. He realizes that the answers are unrelated to the life in which he lived, and a symbolic walk from those he is associated with, at the end he is perfect.
