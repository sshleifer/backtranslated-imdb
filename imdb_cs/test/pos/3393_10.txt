This film is VERY LONG, but it's worth splitting it into several nights. He has all the stars, and if you are a Patrick Swayze fan, it will make your heart pulsate! :-) My mother is a promising civil war and history teacher and every summer we watch this movie (we shot it off the TV), several nights when we get through the whole thing. We had every line in the movie memorized, lol. Pop some popcorn, sit back and enjoy the action and romance. It's a great movie for those who like action, war, blood and guts, but also for those who have a subtle, romantic touch. The clothes women wore were GORGEOUS! Sometimes I think I was born in a bad era, lol.
