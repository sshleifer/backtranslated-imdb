Even if I never saw or heard about Georgetown, CO, this would be a nice little movie. But my father was born and raised there, and these are my uncle's horses that you see pulling on the sled! So this movie is very special to me. Lots of interiors are shot in buildings and houses I recognize and are very realistic. The story is a bit hockey, but Georgetown is such a magical place where things can happen. John Denver was a better actor than many people who trusted him. Mary Wickes plays a "common sense lady with lots of sass" she has played so well in many other films, especially "White Christmas". I usually don't get there in the winter, so I enjoyed seeing this movie at Christmas to bring me to the next trip!
