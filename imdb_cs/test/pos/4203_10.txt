As a fan of the old Warner brothers gangster movies I had to check it out, his second best movie in the classic DVD adventure set, which also had one of my favorite movies, Scott Antarctica on it.This was made in 1939 by a good year for many Warner Brothers movies, It boasts a great cast, John Garfield, Claude Rains, Ann Sheridan, and kids dead end who would later be known as the Bowery Boys for Monogram Pictures. the well boxer gets garnished for the murder he didn't commit and is on the run and is watched by a tough new york detective (Claude Rains) he ends up at a fruit picking place run by a pretty woman (Gloria Dickson)) and an impasse child Leo Gorcey, Benard Punsley, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan, Gabreil Dell) later returning to boxing but trying to keep a low profile. It was directed by well-known director Busby Berkley, who directed timeless classics like 42th street, 1933 and 35 goldiggers, footlight show and many others.i would like to give a scream of platinum DVD / video for having released a lot of good DVD prizes like Classic Adventure (see my Scott of the Antarctic) Review) I give it a criminal 10 out of 10, great movie. The sick must point out that I have only seen two John Garfield movies, this and the body and soul. I thought he was a very good actor.
