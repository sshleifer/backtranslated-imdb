Paul Naschy as a haunted guard in this area is more frightening than most of his werewolves. The story is not unknown, lots of kids go to a party in an abandoned school. The thing is, one of these children's fathers did the same thing years ago, but now he's dead, and the last group of kids seems to be experiencing an event 23 years ago. This is quite well done for movies of this type, and there is air secret to what is happening, because apparently what happened to the kids earlier is somewhat of a secret and perhaps the truth has not been revealed. So no, not just your standard slice and dice. It moves on a pretty good clip and won't let you lose interest like many movies, and the strange story is pretty convincing to be of interest to you, too, and there's some tension missing in many movies these days. The end is somewhat sudden and I suppose it's mostly left to your imagination, but then it won't last again. 7 out of 10, check it out.
