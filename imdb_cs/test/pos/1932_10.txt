This is a description of the events that have been covered by the press several times and I have read two books - "Cruise for Madmen" and "Strange Last Journey of Donald Crowhur" - before I saw the film in Sheffield just before Christmas. I must say that in her story of the Sunday Times Golden Globe in 1968, she had exceeded all expectations. These men set out on something that had never been done before, without support vessels, wooden boats, no satellite phones, GPS, and just their wits and skills to get around the globe in one piece. Not to mention the months of loneliness, the thunder of the Southern Ocean, the little sleep and the ships that literally crumbled around them. <br /> <br /> This document is, in my opinion, well-designed, well-groomed, well paced with excellent narration. Archive footage and interviews are fascinating and revive the story. Clare Crowhurst's interviews are particularly revealing and moving when it comes to the events that led to her husband, the departure of Donald Crowhurst from Teignmouth, the doubts and fears in his mind, and her reaction to the subsequent events. By the time the credits began to roll, I was moved and even threw a tear or two, and overheard other people who expressed similar feelings. The two books I mentioned above are useful for more details and a back story that couldn't be deployed within 90 minutes and I would recommend you. This is ultimately the true story of human courage and human fragility. He must see everyone who is interested in sailing, adventure, human endeavor, and real lives of the heroes.
