Alfred Hitchcock has done many brilliant thrillers, and many have continued to be celebrated as some of the greatest films of all time. One movie that tends to get somewhat lost under Vertigo's and Psycho's this film; Foreigners on the train, the most convincing movie Hitchcock ever did. The story follows Guy Haines, a tennis player and a man soon to be married to a senator's daughter, if he can get a divorce from his present wife. One day he meets mentally unstable Bruno Anthony on board a train on his way to his wife and soon gets into a murderous plot that he cannot stop or stop; and one who could eventually become his life. Interview on board the train between Bruno and Guy is one of the most interesting and most provocative films of all time. What if two people "swapped" murder, resolving any suspicion of a crime and their motive was irrelevant? Could it really be a perfect murder? What makes this film all the more scary is that the events in which Guy is led can happen to every ordinary person. Everyone has someone they want to get rid of, so why don't you meet a mad man aboard a train that makes your murder for you, and then forces you to do it? The chance that this is happening is unlikely, but it is the idea that someone could be the killer who is at the center of the message of strangers on the train; and in this situation someone could. Is there an actor on Earth who could portray the character of Bruno Anthony better than Robert Walker? This man was just born. He manages to capture the right mood for his character and controls every scene he is in. Bruno's character is mad, but he's not a madman; it's a costing, human being, and Robert Walker makes the character credible. His performance is extremely malevolent and yet underestimated enough to hold the character firmly in the realm of reality. Unfortunately, Robert Walker died just one year after Strangers was released on the train, and I believe this is a big loss for the cinema. No one in the cast is glowing like Walker, but it's worth mentioning his teammate Farley Granger. Granger never impresses so much, but his performance is good enough to hold his own against Walker. Also notable for his performance is that he characterizes his character as a very normal person; and so it should be. Ruth Roman is Guy's wife. In fact, there is not enough in the film to make a lasting impression, but it does the best it has. Alfred Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia, has the ultimate role of four major roles, such as Barbara, sister of Guy's fiance. She is suitably beautiful in this role and tends to steal a lot of the scenes she is in. Alfred Hitchcock's director is always noble and so much in this movie. There is one shot that sees the murder of a movie committed in the reflection of sunglasses. This is an absolutely brilliant shot that creates a great atmosphere for the scene. Hitchcock's direction is whimsical throughout, and largely agrees with the noir style film. The top of the film is both spectacular and exciting, and I don't think anyone other than Hitchcock could pull him into the big effect that was shown in this movie. It's really exaggerated and from the rest of the movie; but it works. There is a reason that Hitchcock is often quoted as the greatest director of all time, and the reason for this is that he does not only use the script to tell the movie story, but also uses it to camera to do so. Foreigners on the train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made. His story is interesting and provocative, and will certainly please every movie fan. Masterpiece.
