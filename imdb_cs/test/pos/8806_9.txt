Human transport is a look at the average weekend for a group of friends, it's a view of the wall in their lives (and minds) that will show you how this group of friends relates to each other. There are many moments in which everyone can relate to being like a skull at parties and talking about total waste with strangers. Characters are all people you can relate to and are believable in the roles they play in the movie. The situations in which they are are all the situations in which we all find ourselves, and that is where this film succeeds. Sex and drug themes are greatly addressed in terms of not getting into the relationship of characters. The story to the film is not everything, but it is not criticism. It's a movie about people. This is a well-written film with a sound track to die on. Pete Tong D.J has made a great selection of songs for this set, all of which have become one of the best movies I've seen in 1999. After watching this movie, I felt like I was at a party all weekend. Fantastic movie! Jo Brand as the voice of reality - I need to say more! <br /> <br />
