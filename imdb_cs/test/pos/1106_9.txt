This DVD came from ACCENT, a label that specializes in art-house flics, released Irreversible and a number of Bergman's opus. The thing that captivated me with the strange movie Alexa Frayna MODERN LOVE It's a perfect movie that breathes perfection and vision, a film that takes us into the mind of Mr. Joe Average, filled with voices in his head, visions and madness. It's set in rural redneck Australia, a film not trivializing or praising people like so many Australian movies. ie our movies are full of "loving rogues" or people with a "golden heart" etc. etc. <br /> <br /> It's not in this movie. Stanley Kubrick's spirit emerges, is not flawless, but has a charming attention to details, a romantic stripe and a mood that extends if not available. Minor Questions ... Transmission Looks Defective - Front credits sliced, don't fit in frame. <br /> <br /> One of the short films is also damaged, stopping halfway.
