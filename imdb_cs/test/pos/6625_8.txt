Sure, it's a great job. In fact, there are some of the best cinema scenes in this film, or at least Bergman's cinema. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow are as good as you'd expect. Do these two bad performances? Sven Nykvist passes some masterful, though unconventional, cinematography. The script is pretty good, especially in individual scenes. Sometimes the film is lagging behind and the pace is uneven, though probably intentionally. <br /> <br /> What's the problem? Well, the film is too bleak for its own good. Other Bergman films are similarly bleak, but nowhere near this cruel. I finally gave up and started to be a little irritated. I was very hit during the movie, but I didn't feel at all. It's a great movie, but I doubt I would ever watch or suggest it to friends. Or, if I suggested it, I would certainly warn them what was ahead of us. 8/10.
