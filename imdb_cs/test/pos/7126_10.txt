Most of the time I laughed so hard that I was staring at me because they didn't hear me through my laughter. I literally dropped out of my place in a certain place. I'm a bartender and a bouncer for real life (note that I use the term real world, but must always come first) and whenever I tell someone I play RPG, one of two questions usually follows: 1 What, D&D? I played it back in Junior High. <br /> <br /> 2. Really? I was looking for or forever a group! Do you have room for another? Very rarely do people know what D&D and games are. That almost every person watching this movie has been told can get something out of it. Even if you are not a player, chances are there is something in your "Geek Out" life that can be fun in a light heart, and that alone means you can relate to the hijinx in this movie. It's just a light heart of happiness in an hour and a half.
