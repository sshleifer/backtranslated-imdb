Yes 1939 / Robert Donat-Greer Garson version was the best ... Perfection .. Donat won the Oscar in a very hard year..Gable in GWTW & James Stewart as Mr. Smith. there were 2 of his competitors. .wow it was a rough year. Most NY critics hated this version. so.didnt to see in the theater! Finally I saw this A.M. on TCM & enjoyed..Peter O'Toole was excellent and glad that Oscar was nominated for this, & esp pleased Oscar finally gave him a special award last year ... I felt badly typed ... Some good songs esp. You and I ... sung Ms.Clark and later recorded by many others, including T.Bennett / S. Bassey & Carmen MacRae .... b & w version was more authentic .. but that's a good movie beautifully photographed in & panavision ... nice to see and Bravo again, Mr. O'Toole!
