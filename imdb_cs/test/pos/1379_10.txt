I tried to figure out why I enjoyed this movie? It's not because of the money spent on it for sure !! Did I see a painted gun there? Maybe they don't have the same type of visual effects in Scotland? Or maybe they don't have the money? Making clearly shows a gang of very hairy guys making a movie against a chance. Amazing! But what I liked was the performance miracle. Mike Michell and Patrick White play the lead role as 2 normal boys. There is no Hollywood history here. OK, so the effects aren't very good. Spaceships just don't look as good as they should in today's FX world and I've seen much better stuff on youtube for free. But the film holds very well as soon as they reach the planet. Was it filmed in Scotland or just a Scottish crew? Or is it just a better effect? Have they adjusted the water? By the end I loved this movie and was disappointed when everyone died.
