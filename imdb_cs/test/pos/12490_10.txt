Above all, there is a detective story: "légitime défense" by Belgian Stanislas André Steeman, whose "l'assassin habite au 21" Clouzot has already screened in 1942 when Pierre Fresnay and the same actress Suzy Delair.Steeman complained about the adaptation of Clouzot for both movies. The 1942 film was excellent, but the "thriller" page was preserved, so why complain? As for the Quai des orfèvres, Clouzot was now in a new phase of his brilliant career. with the director "le corbeau" and was blacklisted, he had a lot more to say than a simple whodunit. \ tSteeman basically complained basically about the wrong detective end, which of course I won't reveal, but Clouzot focused on social medallions, his characters psychology, and he didn't give a damn about puzzle à la agatha christie. By becoming a true predecessor to CLaude Chabrol, who was always closer to him than to Alfred Hitchcock, whom he admires to power. Suzy Delair has a great presence on the screen and you will love the song she really sings (she was also a singer) "avec son tralala" .Bernard Blier gives, as always, saving gestures and verbal performance and really removes it Two characters are especially interesting and distracting : First, Dora, Photographer: Taking pictures of female models, and Clouzot, by gentle touches, reveals to us that she is a lesbian. Of course, the word is never spoken (How can it be in 1947?) The police chief (fabulous Louis Jouvet) tells her: "You and I, we are not lucky with women." a lot of things about him that are not necessary with the Delair / Blier fence: he is a widower, with a son who adores and who gets into school difficulties, especially in geometry. So we know all the characters in depth. One of the most important manifests of the post-war French film.
