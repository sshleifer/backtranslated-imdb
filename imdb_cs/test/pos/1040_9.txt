Has anyone else found a way to make copies of this series? I see many people asking, but I can't tell if any of them were successful. It is hard to believe that today's series cannot be seen by people, especially on the basis of the real problems that real people encounter in times of tense and exciting times in our country. How can it be true and what can we do to change it? As a party, I agree with any comments made by other authors about this series on this website. It's a great story about events everyone should be aware of and know about. Many of us have seen this series when we were in college or at the same time. We want to share it with our kids ... but we can't? If this is true, what would be any good written material to share the same information?
