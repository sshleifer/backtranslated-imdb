"Pearl Harbor, buddy." This movie is great! Of course it's not exactly what a multimillion-dollar comedy does, but jokes that are always thrown are incredible. I'm the one who goes stupid, like "Dumb and Dumber", "Airplane" and "Wet Hot American Summer," and I have to say it's easy to go up. With this kind of sporadic comedy movies are no longer written. Too many jokes in this are so surprising to the viewer that it is sincerely amazing to know more about this grotesque masterpiece and praise it! When you look at it, you will easily find that you will find more than 20 quotes that you will find when you quote the consequences ... and once you look again, you will find even more!
