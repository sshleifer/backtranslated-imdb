There are very few movies that are capable of telling such a complex story on so many levels as Mishima: Life in Four Chapters. One of the most difficult aspects of telling stories is the ability of flashback and forward without losing the tempo of the film. This movie not only glimpses back and fourth with the greatest of simple, but also flows through some of Yukio Mishima's greatest stories. This film overcomes in every respect and it is a pleasure to watch. Not to mention the incredible Philip Glass Soundtrack.
