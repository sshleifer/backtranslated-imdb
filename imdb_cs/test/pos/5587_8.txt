For the record, the 1949 version of the "Blue Lagoon" is not an original film, as many have said. This story was shot in Great Britain, in 1923, just after the novel was written. Just as I would like to see the 1949 version, I would have enjoyed the opportunity to see the true original version of this story on film. Awarded, a 1980 film by Christopher Atkins, Brooke Shields and two youngsters were filmed with beautiful cinematography. When I first looked at this film, acting did not seem so great, but after having looked at it several times, it is clear that two children growing up on an island without adult advice would actually have a simplified way of approaching lifeâ€¦ no matter what in their language, appearance or everyday activities. Although some of them were fortunate enough to see the 1949 "Blue Lagoon", I can't help but see if there is anyone who recalls this story by 1923.
