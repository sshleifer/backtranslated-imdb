Tim Burton is basically an expressionist filmmaker, not interested in character dimensions and obsessed with the Gothic range, who has decided for style over substance throughout his career. However, when his style is so steadfast, I forgive, like so many viewers, all the countless mistakes that can be found in many of his films, and which are immersed in what is essentially a hundred million films in art. It's almost embarrassing for me to see the poetics, the emotionally embracing spirit in the second installment of the average franchise, especially when this target franchise group is half-witty 15-year-old boys. Batman is coming back to be every bit as commercial as his predecessor, ensuring that the box office and cheap (in fact, very expensive) excitement are fun without actually engaging your audience. If that were the result, then Tim Burton would certainly have to manage the third installment. Instead, Burton adds something that can only be truly defined by the phrase "out there". From a melancholic opening in which a couple of high society throws a prison bassinet containing their newly born deformed baby It is clear that Batman is back, it's not a picnic at Buckingham Palace. Thirty-three years later, during a political speech by the evil business magnate Max Shreck (ominously portrayed by Christopher Walken), Red Triangle Circus Gang attacks Gotham City. Batman (Michael Keaton returns to the role) makes his first appearance a sporting new logo, saving the day. Shreck is soon kidnapped by a circus gang and black-mailed into agreeing to the child's political return, now a fully grown Penguin man (Danny DeVito in a terribly perfect make-up), whose motives for return are suspected only to Batman. Meanwhile, Shreck attempts to shut down his rude and unpleasant assistant Selina Kyle (played by Michelle Pfeiffer perfectly, who honestly deserved more recognition for her performance), which turns into a deliciously sexy and psychotic Catwoman, out for revenge and harbors , for some inexplicable reason, the deadly vendetta against the dark knight. Batman returns is bleak. The production design is breathtaking and delivers the cold spooky Gotham City with an even more apocalyptic impression than its predecessor. Danny Elfman's score supports the film brilliantly, from encouraging to tragic. The tone and direction of the film is intensely tense, shot like a sad nightmare, Burton's direction obscures what is justly a devilish scenario with almost absolutely irrelevant plot and perfect for Burton's visual style of filmmaking. . And while Burton's action sequences struggle for excitement, the real excitement lies in directional decisions depicting the fall of each of his main characters, the penguins, the extinction of Catwoman, the mental state and the solitary fate of Bruce Wayne. Warner's brothers hated him, while the critical and spectator response was mixed. After all, they wanted Batman's sequel, not a weird, somewhat horrible horror movie in which a deformed psychopathic orphan attempts to abduct and drown the children, all while vomiting, which can only be described as green mucus. The production company wanted an audience friendly feature, something for the clan McDonald's to promote their happy foods with, not the film dire irresistible characters, including the sexually repressed secretary who is pushed from the skyscraper and animated by a cat gang to wake her from unconsciousness by chewing her bloody ice cold toes. It is easy to understand the mass disappointment that followed the release of Batman Returns. The film never felt like a blockbuster of Batman. It is questionable whether Burton really knew who Batman actually was, or even if he cared for the character just as he did for the film that fit into his usual themes of beautifully spooky art and poorly interpreted, lonely characters who they rarely meet company standards and expectations. That's why Burton couldn't create a great Batman movie. But he did; create a nostalgic and stunning movie piece that remains a personal and nostalgic favorite. This may not be a great Batman movie. But it's a great Tim Burton movie.
