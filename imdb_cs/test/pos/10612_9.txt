Marigold is by far the best "outsider" I've ever seen. (I haven't grown up with Bollywood, but I've seen a few hundred now.) I'd say Gurinder Chadhu, Mira Nair, and even Merchant and Ivory (Bombay Talkie) are almost in the dust. Willard Carroll, the director, really loves Bollywood and has the confidence to let us know - there's humor, but no arc, ironic distancing, not "of course I don't mean". As Jerry Lee Lewis would say, "he gets it," so he can have us too - the joy of the Bollywood movie experience, along with the touches that the Western European enters into the role of narrator. It's a tale of caustic, bitches, beautiful American actress B movie (she was only in movies with numbers in their titles, like Fatal Attraction 3) that finds herself in another Bollywood movie from that she went to India to be in (Kama Sutra 3 folded tents while she was on the road, apparently because his producers are now in jail). Salman Khan, a real-life mega-mega-star of Bollywood, is a dance master of a wonderful movie that is now outstretched ("is it before or after I'm blind?"), And despite the sweetness of his mildly mentally gifted character, he learns More than how to find her inner ecstatic dancing skills. A strong start gives you both Bollywood - a super-energetic set of dancers in front of the Taj Mahal (both witty known to the Western viewer, as well as providing high-speed musical excitement we love in Hindu film), and Salman on the screen from the start - No Bollywood 20 minutes to wait for the hero. She has an Indian costume adorned with the Western Kit Carson (all in white). Ali Larter's actress is pleasing to the Western viewer - he's a blonde who's "traditional" for a "white" person in Bollywood film and a visually understandable cast - but he's a sturdy girl, not an ethereal kind of blondie which we are usually familiar with, and it is more or less a three-dimensional total bitch who devotes herself to profane and offensive conversations with a cell phone with a friend and agent in the US. We also have scenes of women having trouble with them, going to the bar to deal with them - the capacity for people who don't get along with related and emotional talks is traditional in Hindu movies, but seldom we see many of such things happening among women (except for a discussion between a mother and a daughter about choosing a groom by a daughter), let alone "strangers" - unrelated people - let alone bar-going. So the spirit is the same, the details are fresh, and I was absolutely pleased with it. I saw it only once, on a preview that attended the director, a great speaker and a questionnaire he and Salman must be "brother-like" good friends through making it, he loves India, he has plans, to make Wizard of Oz movie in India. I can't get too detailed about songs when I only saw them once, except I liked them all. Ranging from a happy parody to a Bollywood number in film-in-the-movie - women's costumes, with Leghorn hats and shells-cased bodyices (it's a beach scene) to blooming dresses - worth the price of tickets alone - to a wonderful reflective romantic song which is very sad and serious in the film. A mixture of Hindi and English in music and works. Salman Khan has a lot of credit from me for being open to unusual projects - this and Jaan-e-Mann - and good judgment about which of them to be. Carroll said he was full of ideas and ideas all the time and absolutely fine (ie not narcissistically) whether Carroll accepted or rejected them - clearly just a pro who loves engagement and cooperation.
