Previous reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better recap of the film details than I could. I especially remember that it was so beautiful, in every sense - emotionally, visually, editorially - just wonderful. <br /> <br /> If you love to watch movies that have emotional content that is important, I think you'll be glad you saw this extraordinary and unusual work of art. <br /> <br /> On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give it 8.75. The only reason I'm avoiding 9 is that it's mood. If you're in the mood for a really artistic, very romantic movie, then it's 10. I sure think it must be seen, but none of us can be in this mood all the time, so overall 8.75.
