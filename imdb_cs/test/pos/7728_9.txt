There are several ways to misunderstand this movie and some of it has been mentioned in some of the previous comments. This is a movie to be analyzed as a free recreation by a well-known subject, so it must not be compared to the opera, book or other Carmen films you have seen before. It's just for myself and I have to say that Carmen does it very well. It is a mistake to compare because it is the first step to deny the films the chance to be autonomous artworks. Vicente Aranda is a master of atmosphere and artistic direction, costumes and photos are well connected to achieve a pleasant aesthetic experience. Let's take it as it is. And that brings us to another misunderstanding. Someone complains about the typical Spanish cliché in the movie. Well, historically, the film has been extremely well researched and you can see the results of this very serious work in every scene. It is not just the exact portrait of the "black Spain" of the knife and espadrille, which Goya portrayed so vividly, but it is also that part of the history that a stranger saw fascinated by the folklore side of this society. Frankly, anyone who doesn't want to see any clichés about Spain shouldn't buy a ticket to see Carmen, but in this case, these clichés are presented before they become one, and the way we see them gets rid of our own prejudices. Another important requirement for a proper understanding of this film is to speak the language. It is not acceptable to criticize the performance of any actor for not understanding his lines. If all the other viewers, the problem most likely lies somewhere else. Paz Vega has an immaculate diction with an Andalusian accent, and everything he says is understandable and credible. Her Argentinian partner, Leonardo Sbaraglia, also gives a convincing portrait of a Basque officer who has become a "bandolero", and her accent is very well taught. <br /> <br /> Equally important is to have at least open access to the material. To say that Paz Vega is "terrible" suggests that the author of the sentence entered the theater for bad reasons. In Spain, we already had criticism in one of the most prestigious articles that recommended pictures that he found homosexual without explicitly mentioning. And that wasn't fairly just for the rest of us, especially for those who didn't find a man writing with parts of his anatomy that many readers didn't have to worry about. I'm not even saying that the reviewer had the same motivation, but the expectations had to be different from the expectations of those of us who went to see a talented and beautiful actress who played almost a classic role because that's what we got. Paz Vega is Carmen, and excellent, in the film Vicente Aranda.
