Eric Bogosian gives you such great performance as you have ever seen in Oliver Stone. His character Barry is an assault rifle disguised as a man and blows away anyone, whether in the air or outside, that offends him. Adapted from Bogosian's play, "Talk Radio" is a cruel and frightening ride that won't leave you until it's too late. At that time, you became acquainted with the rim of racists, rapists, paranoids, wannabe murderers and mere jokes who listen, talk and lurk in the darkness of Dallas nights. Stone behaves alone, if at all possible, let Bogosian dominate every scene, from Barry's humble beginnings to the breaking point when his radio show can reach national syndication. The rest of the cast is just as great as lovers and / or associates who have all been used to throwing Barry together. The only thing I would change is the repetitive music of "Bad To The Bone". I used "Not Fragile" by Bachman-Turner Overdrive. A better song I haven't heard in film and ride yet, a relentless tune whose sinister riff is like a real Barry life soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Listen if you dare!
