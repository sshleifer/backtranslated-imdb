I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of enthusiastic film enthusiasts and Indian ex-pats. The film is amazingly beautiful and smooth for the first movie. The direction is confident, especially for locals who have been hired in flight for extras and bit parts. While the plot and story is elementary to non-existence, the pleasure of watching the show and the scenery compensated for the lack. The soundtrack for this movie is a great attraction for world music lovers. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different place every day, check out Hari Om for inspiration. It wasn't published in Q&A, but I think Hollywood could learn from making a movie by learning from this director.
