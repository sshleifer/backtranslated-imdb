The 80's comedy (especially with John Cusak) is amazing. Almost all are hillarious and instant classics and this movie is no exception. Lots of nods to other movies (ie Godzilla and Jaws) through the movie that is so hillarious you will laugh for hours. Some may complain that the movie is sometimes a little spoiled, but hey, it was the 1980s and things were always a bit cheesy. Throw the young Demi Moore and even louder Bob Cat and have a laugh on your fans. If you haven't seen it, soon soon !!!!!!
