I think it's a fabulous movie ... I've been watching it ever since I was 4 to about 8 years old. Especially I got them because of who was always like "the other world" and his friends. I'm 12, and I still have nightmares about it. I can't sleep now because I think about it. I love this movie, but it's so scary! I'm sure I love this movie, I have very good memories of it. Kate is very good at this movie. Surprisingly, I never realized it was her! I also think the graphics were very good, unlike what other people think
