Sister Betty is a really interesting movie. I think we all know someone who is so convinced that the characters in the series are real, that you can't explain them by any means that are just actors and not real people. Nurse Betty is not a nurse at all. In real life, an ordinary housekeeper is working in a restaurant. To escape her terrible husband and the problems in her miserable life, she became a fan of soap opera. Having witnessed her husband being murdered, she goes into some shock and loses all the grip of reality. He thinks he's in love with one of the soap opera characters, a doctor, and decides to visit him and start a family with him. But struck men think he knows too much and kills her after her. As I said, the theme is completely recognizable (if you leave a professional man and a murderer out of it) and the movie was funny. The story was well directed and the actors did a great job. She had everything I always wanted to see while watching a comedy. I give him 7.5 / 10.
