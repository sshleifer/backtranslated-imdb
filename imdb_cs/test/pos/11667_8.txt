"It's easy to kill a monster, but it's hard to kill a human being." <br /> <br /> Set in a housing project in St. Thomas and Angola Prison in New Orleans, "Dead Man Walking" is the real story of Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon), sister of Louisiana's sister who took over Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn), the murderer and rapist for a lethal injection machine to kill a teenage couple? Sister Helen agrees to help the convict and stay with him until the end? At his first meeting, Poncelet swears a nun that his accomplice was the one who shot both children and declared his help a new court to persuade the board to save his life. ?? The film invites the audience to truly think about the human consequences of the death penalty, but gives the voice to angry surviving parents whose children were shot, stabbed, raped and left in the forest to die. sama ?? Because Poncelet's performance is approaching and closer, his character is visibly deceptively complex and contains doubts about the correctness of what they do to him? At one point we hear him sensitive and ask for a lie detector test to let his mother know he's innocent, in another we see him furious playing victim, blaming government, drugs, blacks, children for being there? Poncelet never understood that he had robbed Percys and Delacroix that nothing would hurt them? Will their children never see them again, not to hold them, to love them, to laugh with them? In the scenes that led to his execution, will the death prisoner drop his terrible facade in the tomb and reveal his identity? Fortunately, both Sarandon and Penn are exceptional, who are successfully performing the excellent, tangible interplay of souls? Looking at Penn, Sarandon projected sympathetic eyes that swarmed with tears? Asking him to imagine her when she dies? '' I want the last thing you see in this world was the face of love '' at the moment, we really believed that she would face the love of him?
