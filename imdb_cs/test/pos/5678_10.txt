He went with my friends and saw this movie last weekend here in London. We didn't know what to expect, the poster gave us something away, and I'm not going to say no to spoiling the plot, but we found it to be a great movie with great acting, compelling conspiracy and fright. Like Hell! After doing some research on filmmaking, I have to pass it on to film, filmmakers, actors, writers, etc. For making such a film with such limited resources. Also postproduction very well. For everything I give them 10 out of 10, and I hope they continue their fine work. Hold it, guys. You're rolling!
