The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can anyone tell me how to get the songs from this movie? He even does the soundtrack. If this is not possible, can I at least get the song names with the respective singers? I tried searching for amazon.com but not there. I tried a CD baby, not even there. I went through Google to get some details, but there were none. I would appreciate it if someone could answer my question. I know the songs belong to Country Music and they sing them country artist. I just need names of names along with the singer. I would recommend this movie or rather songs for all lovers.
