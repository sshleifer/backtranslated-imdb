I like the show, but to figure out the writers, get some action in it! Stop dragging on and on. You have a great concept and it could be much more. Miles (Jenkins) is great and acts as a child who should act in a situation where he finds himself. The actors in the series are very good and convincing. Miles' parents seem to be too little meaningful, but they're doing it, come on! you have great seeds here, and next season can be a whole new twist with lots of new characters and creatures and all kinds of sci-fi stuff. If they could do a series of witches, then you should be able to do one on these creatures and children.
