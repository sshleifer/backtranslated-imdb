A wonderful movie before his time, <br /> <br /> I think so, was it a victory in the 1980s, is Greed good? Remember that? I've seen this movie more than 20 times, it's really a desert island movie for me, I'm still watching because there's always more to know about these bad characters I love, Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronin, they're just awesome And also Beverly D'angelo, Beau Bridges arrive for a second, don't make me sick that there is a lot more great performance in this movie and it's also the way he wrote it, I hope you, the movie you want to see again and again, I think, that TV shows like "Northen Exposure" and now "Earl" owes a lot to this movie. But remember, it's not a Tom Cruise movie.
