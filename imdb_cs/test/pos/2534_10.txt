"Pixote" is the strongest, shocking and moving movie that comes from Brazil. It's about the lives of the kids on the streets of Sao Paulo and Rio De Janeiro, and that is about ten years old boy. The camera follows them in almost documentary style, from the detention detention center (where most staff are as corrupt as the police) and back to the streets, and never turns away from the city's horrors. These young people are witnessing prostitution, drug use / drug trafficking, corruption and murder; but it's something they're used to. Director Hector Babenco used the real children on the street as actors and added brutal reality to the movies. Although not for everyone, I highly recommend the movie. An emotionally devastating film. <br /> <br />
