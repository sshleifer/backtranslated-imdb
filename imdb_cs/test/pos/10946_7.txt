This film, as my Chinese friend told me, introduces two famous Hong Kong pop stars. While it may make a movie a mere marketing stunt, I found that acting acceptable, and they are both cute. The story is pretty poor overall. Vampiric features and weaknesses are however, used in humorous ways, and created some uniquely amusing bits. The quarrel between the two girls made me laugh and gave a gentle balance along with well-executed action scenes to create a fun movie.
