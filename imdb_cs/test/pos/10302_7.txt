This film is based on play and is the second adaptation of this work. Paul Sorvino plays the basketball coach of a team of players who took a championship 20 years ago against all odds. Everyone met for reunion. Terry Kinney plays James, the junior commander-in-chief, and gets nervous with all his whining and apologize for me. Vincent D'Onofrio, like Phil, plays an unpleasant merchant with the right amount of money. Tony Shalhoub is George, the current mayor of the city, and seems to be on the verge of some collapse. Gary Sinise plays Tom, a writer, has become an alcoholic, and in my opinion is excellent in the role. While they all assume they will celebrate their mastery, conflicts, jealousy, and fight. As men cope with what has been and is now, they are forced to look at their lives in an unpleasant way. It is unusual for a group of men to talk and cry about what might be, and I find it interesting to see how they relate to each other. It's not the best movie I've seen, but it's definitely good enough to watch.
