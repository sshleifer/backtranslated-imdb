Four or five episodes of Johnnie Socko and his flying robot edited together. An amusing giant robot fighting a giant monster story focused directly on children. Of course, parents will go crazy because the action is violent with a robot / monster battle reminiscent of a professional struggle and a man of human violence, what kind of things you would find in Al Capone Valentine Day School and Gangster Training Academy. I liked it, but then I grew up on the show again. If there is any problem other than the "men in suits" effects variety is that the movie plays as a series of episodes sewn together, with a climax coming every 20 minutes. Recommended for those who have exhausted Ultraman or Godzilla
