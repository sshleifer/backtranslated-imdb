Leonard Maltin gave this film the feared rating of BOMB in his 1995 film and video guide. What movie did he watch? Kid Vengeance or God's weapon are bombs. This movie is a pleasure. It's fantastic. It's literate. It is well mounted. It is beautifully photographed, making great use of colors. Right from the opening scene, the film will captivate you and show you that this film is a well done satire of the whole Spaghetti Western genre. The film is played for laughter from start to finish with homage to Douglas Fairbanks, the 77 Sunset Strip and the famous Good, the Bad, and Ugly Showdown. Edd Byrnes, George Hilton and Gilbert Roland work brilliantly together to do satire. It's bad, Mr. Maltin rated this film as badly as it is undeserved. One can only guess how his reason. I think he missed the point of the film completely and waited for something more serious than this movie should be. Kudos belongs to anyone involved in this project. This film is a small gem waiting to be discovered by people who take care of literate films and appreciate satire.
