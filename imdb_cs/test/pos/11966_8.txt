I was wondering if I could go through the whole musical comedy from Russia or East Germany or other countries, which for almost decades published almost always a propaganda film, anti-fascist films, anti-war films (as documented in this document) that just reflected the dark, exhausting times below Stalin and the life behind the Iron Curtain. It is then fascinating to see the other side of the coin, clown types and insurgents with music on their side, to try the masses more often than to get stuck in the socialist way of life. One movie actually looked somewhat impressive, called Jolly Fellows a pioneer of a very small group of filmmakers, Grigori Aleksandrov. From the clip I saw the movie, I bet it was one of the only works that actually got out of it and entered the wild, manic, make-you-laugh mode. But as this film shows, if you were a filmmaker who wants to have fun, he should rather be a "message". Through interviews, some occasional quasi-dramatizations (the type of movement Russia / Germany / etc.) image association) at the censorship table and clips, he gets a complete picture of what it was - both behind the scenes and even on screen - to make the masses just fun. Some of the films (well, most of them, as only 14 screened over 40 years ago in those countries) seem to have made a good deal of change, but for what purpose? It also gets into a culture of everything that differs greatly from the American way "if it works, do it while they are hot". But at the same time, maybe from this repression, some interesting, funny, and (out of what I saw) up-beat movies were made. They could be quite typical of what was asked to show themselves to the masses, under Stalin's, but challenging conditions like life with tractors. However, it gets even stronger, although it shows us what it was like in the 1960s, the last wave of comedy, when rock and roll and pop melodies finally hit their waves. <br /> <br /> In short, some good things ... but only in case of interest. I showed the film in a class on documentary films and half of the class fell asleep. So be warned on the one hand, although on the other hand, if you are looking for it, it can do it for a truly rewarding journey into European film history.
