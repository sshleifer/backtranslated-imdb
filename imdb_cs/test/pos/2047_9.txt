Rent it, your own DVD, I got it for $ 9.99. Stealing is so undervalued. Sure, there are better movies. Movies with smaller or no holes in drawing or action. BUt I have no problem with this movie. For me, if the film remains true to itself, honest and exploiting its shortcomings (and virtues, of course!) In the name of entertainment, then fulfilled its purpose. I got into care because his creators took care. The whole film is nonsensical from start to finish, but its creators took the whole commitment seriously, and I didn't feel the film could deal with it seriously. And that's true, because I want to make every movie really so much, oh so much, let me go. For all its absurdity, this movie is almost perfect and fun! In view of the events that took place in September 11, it also became very important. In no way do I try to minimize losses. But this movie contains a WTC collapse business before it happened in ways we never see if the film was created after these events. <br /> <br /> "... it's either gone or stay here." "Do you agree?"
