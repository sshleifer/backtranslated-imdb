What makes this low budget production one of my favorite movies? I'm not kidding, I've been watching it 10 times or so and I wasn't tired. Is it an offer of melancholy in the whole thing? Is it similar to a classic like "Niagara"? I've been thinking about it for a long time. And figured out: I think it is: there is no hero, they are just people. Some are trying to be good. Some have given up trying to be good. Some of them are hopeless cases, but they still have the courage to be human inside. It's the story of a catastrophic night at the motel at the end of the world. One way of disaster is nothing but the end of the coincidence chain. Otherwise, this night reveals the logical consequences of these nations' lives because they are cut off from the rest of the world in a certain constellation. He has something about Dostoevsky's story.
