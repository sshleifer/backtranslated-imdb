I agree with Andy, it's a good movie. Kevin McKidd's character is believable throughout the film. We are forced to hate him and later sympathize with him. Paula Sage, who plays Robert, also has a good performance. It is provocative and emotional without excessive production. This was awarded by director Alison Peebles and writer Andrea Gibb. Very valuable viewing. The pace of the movie is fine, it only raises enough interest in the theme to throw you away, instead of bombarding you with facts in the documentary style. Nice little soundtrack to go with the movie too, again used sparingly to distract you from happening. Recommended.
