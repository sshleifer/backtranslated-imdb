This movie is really sick and fun. I made my friends crouch and describe it to them. I saw it about 8 months ago and I still have the song 'Shall we Gather at the River', which sounds like a head. what you would expect. Let's say incest, child harassment links, gore (of course), but unfortunately it has some lucky ending ... sort of ... it's weirder than happy. Cappy Capulet was great! He has this kind of intellectual snobbish tone, is offensive but civilized. He quotes more Shakespeare than anyone else in the film ... and at the same time he deals with his sadistic role as husband and father. He was Julie's fianc√©, deeply infatuated with her, and soon broke her heart because of Tromeo. And Tromeo, a real romantic. He is a handsome, really nice guy, desperately looking for true love. "She's doing torches to burn her!" Unfortunately, the three had to resort to this terrible false green vomit and other antiquities. Sometimes they get this stuff. But hey, this film made a great impression on me. How often I refer to it in real life situations ... wow, which is pathetic. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
