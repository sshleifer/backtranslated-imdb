1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Director: Jaume Collet-Serra. One more classic horror movie that has been remade with a young conductor, despite grizzly and creative death. Based on Vincent Price's 1953 film House of Wax, where maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into invaluable wax figures. Still with a fantastic design to make the whole house wax film is a typical classic horror remake, like Tobe Hooper in the 1974 classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre later revised, despite creativity and so-so playing the movie was still just a gore picture. Director Serra has shown a slight enthusiasm with her direction, but still worth watching. My final rating 7/10.
