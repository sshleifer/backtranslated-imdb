Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways the modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensitivity. The film's success depends on the cast of Sydney Greenstreet as Alexander Yardley's character. Yardley is the modern equivalent of Dickens' Scrooge in the way he controls his employees - until the Christmas spirit survives. The role is a "walk in the park" for Greenstreet, who was one of Falstaff's biggest stages when he was part of Lunts. Greenstreet only entered the movies five years earlier when he was screened at the age of 61, John Huston's first and best film, which he ever directed: "The Falcon of Malta". 'Cuddles' Sakall was probably never better in his traditional role as the epitome of Central European gemutlicheit. The attractive set used in most movies is a glamorous gem.
