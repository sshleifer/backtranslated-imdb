I've watched the movie several times. And what I mean is the only thing that made this movie a high rank was the incredible performance of Burak Altay, absolutely nothing else. Even those silly models named Deniz Akkaya and some of these popular names in the movie ever ... Burak is definitely very talented, I've seen a few jobs he created and passed. Although it is a horror movie, it does a really good job in comedy films and also in drama. I bet most of you all saw Asmali Konak in the movie and TV series, the two would go for example ... All I say is that you watch out for new works coming out from Burak, then you'll see. Keep good work bro, a lot of love.
