Much more than any other movie from this period, The Demon Night presents a helpless and extremely enjoyable horror pastiche. It's fun with lots of ugly makeup effects, beautiful looking (and horny) teenagers and cute clich√©s. A group of party animals, led by an alternative Angela, goes to celebrate Halloween in an abandoned burial house that carries a terrifying urban legend. It all starts with a typical and "innocent" dance, drinking and occasional flirt between young people who can't keep their hormones under control, but soon the bloodthirsty demon will have a hostess. In most of the sophisticated ways you've ever seen, the rest of the cast is beaten cruelly just to come back as nasty creatures that have blood. What makes this film better than most of the horrific films of the 1980s, finds a good balance between light camp and atmospheric horror. Some sequences are really creepy and the burial house builds Night of the Demons with a great tone. Director Tenney makes great use of pieces (coffins, crematoriums, endless dark corridors?) And his young, enthusiastic enthusiasts seem to love what it is. The great makeup effect of the whole team of artists and designers are obviously obvious aspects of love and horror fanatics will absolutely love a large number of separate limbs, stuck out their eyes and crushed skulls! The ultimate highlight, however, is the Linn Quigley trick with vanishing lipstick! This nymphomaniac bimbo shoves the entire lipstick tube in his nipple and continues his spree sex murder! Amazing! Demon Night received two sequels during the 1990s, and although they are still worth checking, they focus more on comedy than chills.
