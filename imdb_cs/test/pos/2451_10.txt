I have to agree with previous author's comments on excellent performances and conspiracy. I started watching this movie by accident ... (lazy Sunday afternoon by clicking on the channels to see if there is anything good) ... and was fascinated by Martin Sheen and Emilia Estevez. Wow! Gut exciting! Kudos to everyone (always admiring Martin Sheen), but Emilio was especially impressed! Excellent work acting and directing ... just great! So why have I never heard of this movie? I'll have to spread the news.
