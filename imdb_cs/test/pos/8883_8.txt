stars: Danny Devito, Billy Crystal, Anne Ramsey, Kim Griest, Kate Mulgrew, Oprah Winfrey and Rob Reiner. Teacher Larry (Crystal) wants to die as a former wife and Owen (Devito) after her class after school. ) wants his mother (Ramsey) to die. When Larry finds out that he wants his wife to die, Owen knows what he has to do for him to help Larry in return to kill his mother. Devito is absolutely cheerful in this as a dead brain wannabe writer who has dreams of poisoning his mom and sticking scissors over his head. He has a childhood role that makes him a more confused man than a murderer. Ramesy was actually nominated for an Oscar for it because her wonderful performance means old lady Lift. Along with comedy, the film also has a heart. One scene between Devito and Crystal seems to be a joke, but it goes deeper, in fact a little sad. Danny Devito directed the film and did a good job of getting a dark tone into his direction. I recommend to all comedy fans. <br /> <br /> My rating: B plus. 84 minutes. PG-13 for language, sexuality and violence.
