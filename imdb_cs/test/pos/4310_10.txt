A unique blend of musical, film and noir and comedy - with a few sexual scenes that are fine. The only other film I think is quite a wild and insane mix of themes and clichés, is the French film Billy Ze Kick - but it has a more surrealistic and unpredictable approach. Not that this film would not be surreal or unpredictable. Humor is sometimes quite subtle, sometimes shamelessly on the face - and often crosses the border to insult. Example: in a postcoital chat with a prostitute, hero Max Müller encourages us to discover who is responsible for the recent murder, using the words "Schiess los!". Literally, this phrase means "Shoot!" in German, and that's exactly what a hidden killer does. In other words, this beautiful lady was sacrificed for a pun. Müllers Büro is also one of the very rare examples of movies with funny sex scenes. Larry's romance is accompanied by the song "Ich will mehr" (I want more) - while the song perfectly supports the action, the meaning of her words changes several times, suggesting that at the end of Larry's inability to provide any other service. The main film scene between Max Müller and Bettina Kantová lacks such subtlety - that is something that goes down, especially when Bettina singing slowly turns into moaning, of course, all to the rhythm of music. <br /> <br /> Unacceptable if you are not one of the slightly offended.
