This anime depicts the story of the Battle of Mamodo King. Every 1000 years, 100 Mamado children are sent to Earth to fight to determine who will be their next king (in the original Japanese, the animals are Mamono, which literally means a magical / evil object). Every Mamado is paired with a human partner and has a charm. One can use this book to dissolve the incredible forces in Mamodo, and when Mamodo is defeated, their spellbook is buried in flames (alternatively, Mamdod's book can be captured and burned directly). Then Mamodo returns to the world of Mamodo. The title is Zatch (Gash in Japan), a six-year-old mamod with power. He is paired with Kiyomaru Takamini, and a 14-year-old genius. Zatch is initially reluctant to fight, but to learn that some Mamodo are evil and to decide the battle for the king is bad, he decided to fight to become a "kind king". Zatch Bell drew a comparison with Pokemon, but a better comparison is with Digimon. Like Digimon, Mamodo and Man have a one-to-one symbiotic relationship. Also unlike Pokemon, both shows have a real plot. Zatch Bell represents the growth of characters and evolving relationships, and some pretty adult storylines (like love vs racism, slavery, mind control, etc.). He even has some decent plot and mystery.
