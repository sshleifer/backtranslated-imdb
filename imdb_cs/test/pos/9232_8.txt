Someone has once defined what is the definition of an INTELLECTOR as being: "A person who can listen to" The William Tell Overture "without thinking about LONE RANGER!" In this, we warmly agree! Certainly it would be high if we did, and the one who Leopold Stokowski, Arturo Toscanini or Leonard Bernstein would prove they couldn't do. And there is no shame in it. The radio series and television series, along with some movie series, feature films, syndicated newspaper comic stripes and comics, all made their part do the "masked man plains and his faithful Indian companion, Tonto" a deeply mounted element of our collective psyche and our literary folklore. As with most legends, it all began gradually, first with a series of radio games written for local use in Detroit via Radio Station WXYZ. The creator was George W. Trendle and the main writer on the series was Mr. Trendle's brother-in-law, Mr. Fran Striker. The year 1933 was when the Ranger first set out on the "Plains of the Early Western United States!" Lone Ranger, Tonto and Radio Series have successfully led Depression Era Americans through the mid and late 1930s until World War II. But the post-war era found the country in the midst of a super nova explosion of invention and technology. A new communication medium was prepared in the wings, but it could not go off until VE Day and VJ Day were reached. Once these goals were met and the World and America were ready to settle in peace and prosperity. "New Technology" was of course TELEVISION! And we would definitely need something other than "Roller Derby" and "Wrestling From Marigold Arena" to fill the broadcast hours. And although at the beginning, when the TV station had anything but this Mohican Chief (test pattern, Schultz!) Was very early and after the hurry, the networks began to try to use their existing natural resources, their existing programming! Virtually everything would be ripe for adaptation to the TV screen. So the people of Lone Ranger, Incorporated were very interested when the producers Jack Chertok, Harry Poppe, Sherman Harris and Jack Wrather approached them. deal to give a Masked Man and a Tonta on a TV wave as well as a radio. They went to work immediately and gave us the first season, which took advantage of Radio's high-end diary. Dramas, all possibly adaptable to television dramas. They cast Clayton Moore, a gentle actor in many feature films and about a decade of experience. He also did some work in Serials over at the Republic Pictures "Thrill Factory", which would be an invaluable experience in doing "LONE RANGER". As a "loyal Indian companion" and a partner in bringing Justice to different parts of the Border, we were absolutely perfect in acting actor Jay Silverheels. Moore went and was replaced by John Hart. After the season, or so, Mr. Moore returned. Back to our story !! The first years of shooting gave episodes the appearance and sound of all of their own. They made good use of the Narrator screen, which gave them a sense of authenticity and an individual, unique series. All the actors were all veterans of late silent era films in the 1930s and 1940s. Many of them were just about the "Cowboy Movie" players. A good example of this is the casting of Glenn Strange (Sam Bart on "GUNSMOKE") as an evil, murderous Gang leader, Butch Cavandish. And that was the Cavendish Gang Texas Rangers massacre that led to John Reid's origin (thought he was killed with other Texas Rangers) as "LONE RANGER". <br /> <br /> In addition to the old timer in cast, you'll find many new and up and coming talent (then) in the cast. We see people like Phyllis Coates, Dwayne Hickman, Denver Pyle and others cast from week to week. All this together with the ever-desired fair-play, justice and peace in the Western world. The last few seasons have brought big changes. The first was using Color Filming. This did not make any difference because the color TV was far from our home. The second was a new set of musical themes and queues. (Other than Rossini's finale from "U NO Wutt!") New music has never been a big deal for us because we preferred "old radio" in stock. With this series and two feature films During this period, LONE RANGER (Warner Brothers, 1956) and LONE RANGER AND LOST CITY GOLD (United Artists, 1958), this character was permanently and indelibly impressed our identity as People, we Americans!
