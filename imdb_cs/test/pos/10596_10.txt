This movie had everything I need in the movie: - Women, skateboarding, violence, music by H.I.M and Tony Hawk !!! The artwork and camera effects in this movie are amazing. Music in this movie is the best I've heard in another movie. Every track goes so well with its scene. I thought acting was really good, because none of the Bams crew members were in the script. Although the whole film concept is the story of Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend (Glauren), who sleeps with Hellboy behind him, is a predictable and old story. Their way of acting is very unpredictable, for example: Falcone and gas tank, Raab himself, Dunn breaking bottles behind wawou and all scenes Don Vito. These movies must be seen!
