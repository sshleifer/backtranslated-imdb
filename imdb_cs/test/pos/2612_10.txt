Assy McGee is an example that you really have to be a certain age to appreciate. Otherwise, it is likely that you are missing links to 80-year-old movies and you simply think it is a running gag about a walking anus. Do you think this is meaningless humor? Watch Stallone 'Cobra' and see what I mean. In fact, this show has a very subtle humor that says a lot, both for the show that aired on adult swimming and for the show on the walking ass. All standard clich√©s of genres are in place that made movies like Dirt Harry and Cobra so big and mature for parody. Sanchez is a partner of Assa who, according to the genre, is at the head level and constantly apologizes for his partner's murderous behavior. Police chief is, of course, a fire-heavy case that lives to shout "I want my badge on my desk first thing tomorrow morning!" An over-the-top, and sometimes completely pointless way in which the '80s' Renegade Cop' movie is parodied suits things well. For example, when a bus robbery breaks, one of the criminals stops and asks Assa: "Hey, where are you going, asshole!" What does the title title tear off one line: "I'm going ... to shoot you." We highly recommend it to anyone who loves 80's action movies and has really looked at them enough to understand humor.
