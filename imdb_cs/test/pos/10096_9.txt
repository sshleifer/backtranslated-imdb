If such a thing is like a beautiful horror movie, this movie is one of the best in this genre. It is a horror movie that, despite not being neglected by the scene, relies more on psychology and masterful tensions to create excitement. And it is one of those films that are shot so beautifully, where every scene is a full world of symbols and details, all of which serve a range and genre that can be called but beautiful. It's not an easy story, with two sisters returning to their father and stepmother after spending some time at a psychiatric institute. They barely deal with the death of their mother and try to protect their world and defend them from the adult world. So it seems that the film is in its innermost layer. In fact, the film is slowly evolving to something very different, at a slow pace, but no frame is lost to convey a sense of exciting beauty, so I won't say more. Watch it, it's one of the best in the Far East horror movie genre that recently captured world cinematography, and it really shows that they did it for good reasons.
