I think this movie has it all. He has really great music he never gets out of my mind. He has cool looking figures. It's really funny (you know, the kind you're going to run on the ground and you'll always say funny games every day for three weeks). after the robot), its really cool. It's one of those movies that you and your whole family can watch, meet, eat pizza, laugh like crazy and watch it twice more. There are so many funny parts like when Kurt was trying to get Edison's attention and put his finger on it, and then threw a gun at him to play paintball. In this section, I kept saying, "Remember, remember?" To my cousins ​​who saw it and showed them what had happened. There was also a really funny part when Edision ran into the room and Kurt was there (just before they fought) and Kurt talked about his "Weird Dream" and how he was "Superman". I loved the part, even though it had been a while since I saw it, so I don't remember that part. Everything the actors said was funny, as Kurt says, "I worship you as God!" Although there were some bad things, it was a big movie in everything. Man, I can't stop laughing. I wish I had the movie. );
