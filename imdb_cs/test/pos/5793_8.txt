There was a lot about Little Věra that was special to me. Overall, I enjoyed this movie, but the many ways the characters behaved were not what I was used to. For example, the environment in which Vera's family lived was very tense. Almost every time a family was together, they either drank, fought or screamed, and often it was a combination of three. After seeing the film, I felt tense because of the whole confrontation. However, I was very interesting when I watched the story when it was a Russian family of this middle class. Throughout the film, we are alerted to the industrialized state of Russia due to repeated train shots around the screen. It gave the viewer a sense of mechanically lived life. The characters seemed to focus on living through work and drinking after work. There was no feeling of happiness in the whole movie. The only time the character did not scream was when Vera fell in love with her fiancé Sergei for the first time. It was very short lived because the viewer later appears (after Sergei locks Vera's father in the bathroom and Vera leaves him out, after which the father continues to stab Sergei) that is offensive. At other times, Vera learns that the only reason she was born is for the family to get a bigger apartment. It is very interesting to see how Vera and the family managed to cope with their behavior. The film is definitely worth seeing because of its idea of ​​how life could be in areas of Russia.
