Sharpe's Honor for the Uninitiated, is the fifth entry into a series of television films focusing on the English Army rifle during the Napoleonic Wars and on the books of Bernard Cornwell (which I recommend). If you should start by following this particular one, you would have the impression that Sharpe is not so much a soldier as the very centrifugal force that the rest of the army is spinning around. If that is the case, I recommend starting with earlier chapters such as Sharpe's Eagle or Sharpe's Company, but this is a good choice for a second viewing. The story this time is about how it's spying things. With the French army retreating from Spain, Major Ducos, a slimy spy master sees the opportunity to turn the situation around. The fragile British-Spanish alliance begins by pinning the murder of Spanish Marques on Richard Sharpe, the hero of the British army, and things turn around again. When Spanish nobles come to Wellington to cry for Sharpe's blood, the English general is less than willing to hang his best soldier to fall to his death, and soon finds himself on a secret mission behind enemy lines to find out who sponsored the story. Surprisingly enough also for the film Sharpe is a beautiful woman who is supposed to be rescued on the way, that's a fantasy. Of course, the result is more adventure. The concentration is smaller on the operation of the English army with Sharpe as a puppet and focuses more on his country escapades, avoiding French patrols, noble stoves with Spanish guerrillas and engages in daring escapes from fortified military positions. Sergeant Harper, his faithful true man, naturally accompanies him, but the rest of the guns remain in the camp without knowing their leader is still alive. Surprisingly, they actually get more attention than usual when they dissolve in their own subplot, which includes the delivery of Harper's baby. long term. And one should be afraid that the standard battle will culminate at the top, because the poor old French have the right kick. In addition, Ducos makes a fantastic successor to Obadiah Hakeswill as a bad guy you love to hate. He is a polite, dangerous and utterly evil son of a female dog and is also strangely reminiscent of that black guy from the robbery of the lost ark. He comes as a person you would like to deliver to his first birthday, even though he looks like a member of Iron Maiden, who accidentally catapulted back in time. In short, another strong chapter in the Sharpe line. Sharpe remains as heroic as ever, but this time considerably bitter and angry at the events of the previous film. It's not the best introduction if you haven't seen any of the other chapters, but it shows the Sharpe side that we normally don't get to the witnesses: the action hero rather than the professional soldier. And if it's not enough to tempt you, it's also worth watching just for a rather surrealistic look at the furious Sean Bean swinging a live chicken in a group of nuns.
