This is one of my favorite movies. The story is so fantastic and the characters are so good. Unlike other Disney movies of this age, this movie never bores the audience. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, were all good, but they lacked what we have here. This is funny, creative and always on target. This film has something more to learn in textbooks. However, this is not the best animated film ever made. This title belongs to the story of BRILLIANT toys. But this is a respectable second, followed immediately by The Lady and Tramp. You just see it and enjoy what is one of the greatest achievements of the film. And by the way, I'm not a small child, that's for older viewers who want to capture their childhood. Absolute necessity!
