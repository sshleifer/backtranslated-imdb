When I entered the theater for preliminary screening, I knew little about this film. I learned from the ads that it was a thriller. <br /> <br /> What we have is like "Compulsion" meets "Matlock". Two teenagers decide to commit a perfect murder. The victim is chosen randomly and then carefully made so that no traces of real killers are found. Then there is a pile of false conductors that point to an innocent viewer. (Even innocent of murder) As an investigative officer, you enter Sondra Bullock. (IMDB says he's an FBI, but I don't remember it. I thought he was a regular cop) He's disappointed with the inconsistency of the assassin profile ("Profile doesn't fit in profile!") And the powers and influence of one of the boys' fathers. It also has its own demons, which are prominent in their decision to become a cop. But this is the only character that is really more than one-dimensional. All the others are quite flat. <br /> <br /> For a thriller, there are really no great thrills. It's mostly a cat and mouse game like "Matlock" (which looks at one place in the movie). The twist is that the two are involved in the killing. Who's the real killer, Justin or Richard? It'll cost you eight dollars to find out.
