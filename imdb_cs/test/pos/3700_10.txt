This is one of the best TV movies you've ever seen. The values ​​of acting, writing and production are excellent. Performances are passionate with Beverly D'Angelo excellent because older woman with teen daughter and Rob Estes just perfect as a young boyfriend. But the best work of this film was how she showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of following the usual happy ending. Abuse can turn out to be in good families; engage good people; and the life of the wreck. It's a provocative and fun idea. Congratulations to all who are dealing with this exceptional film. <br /> <br />
