As with many Wong films, many people consider them boring and confusing. I like them and I like this movie too. I went out and rented it on the DVD and watched it three times. It is a very fine film that provides a heady experience. for those who didn't use it ..... you just spent 2 hours of your life unnecessarily ... too bad ... muhahahahaha.
