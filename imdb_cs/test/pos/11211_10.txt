I am very grateful that the small college town of Abingdon, Va.- near Bristol, TN. and the home of the famous Barter Theater, where Gregory Peck once worked, managed to get a togather film festival and show this film here. Abingdon is two and an hour away from where I live, but the way behind it was in every sense. UZAK / DISTANT is an amazing, brilliant, unpleasant, emotional, captivating movie. As a Turkish-American film, this film was not just a testimony to what life is like in Turkey; but on a larger scale, he tells the world what it is like to be Turkey, whether he lives in Istanbul, Berlin, Montreal, New York or Omaha. It can be two hours apart from five minutes, but it is actually our Bob Marley song. There are so many beautiful scenes in this movie. It is very difficult to select just a few random ones. However, one scene takes place in the Beyoglu cinema (the center of Istanbul). The title character, played by Mehmet Emin Toprak and who, unfortunately, died in a car accident shortly after the film's completion, is followed by a very attractive young woman down the stairs to the main cinema hall. She goes to see "Vanilla Sky". As Tom Cruise's image is reflected from the glass, we feel that Turkish men compete with Tom Cruise for their own female affection, although Tom Cruise in Beyoglu is nowhere to be found. Scenes shot across the shores of the Bosphorus are also quite revealing because they symbolize the beauty, but the desperate empty abyss that is a painful fact of life in Turkey. In this film, the gap separates lovers and families. A simple, empty cigarette pack of Samsun (Turkish brand) and a dying mouse jumps out of the screen as seagulls did in 1982 in Serif Goren-Yilmaz Guney "Yol." Many of Guney's films, including "Yol," "Surud's Herd" (1978- Completed Zeki Okten) and "Baba-Father" (1971) were considered by many to be the best Turkish films ever made. Without Guney's sometimes overcrowded socio-political anger (especially in his latest film, 1983's prison drama "Duvar-The Wall"), "Distance" captures the essence of Turkish life remarkably. This is for a director who, in my opinion, can already be declared a Turkish equivalent to directors like Tarkovsky, Bresson and Ozu. I can't wait to see his next movies!
