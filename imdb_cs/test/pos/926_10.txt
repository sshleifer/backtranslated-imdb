Master Kieslowsky came up with an idea in 1993, the idea was to portray how human relations in the world today are from Blue (created by a visual masterpiece of women's life) by White (a visual film about a marriage comedy) and finally to arrive Red (a masterpiece human interaction). While I will not spoil the move, I can easily say that red is the best film of the 90s because it has one of the strongest news in the scenario I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The movie starts a little slower, but finds that it's a rhythm fast enough to impress you with the film. The performances are perfect, sublime. Since the characters are absolutely realistic and by no means clich√© and nothing less is expected from the actors and no one is disappointed ... I seriously believe that Jean Louis Tringtignat deserves at least an Oscar. Zbiegnew Preisner's music is amazing, it's one of the best musical scores ever. Piotr Sobocinsk Cinematography is also excellent that he won Oscar nod (and deserved to win). Overall, the film is perfect 10 and will love people who love foreign cinematography and the people who do it. Don't miss it. How that scary Pulp Fiction beat this masterpiece in Cannes is beyond my understanding
