I saw the film at its North American premiere (July 14, 2004) at Fantasia. I was a little disappointed because I was expecting more epic, casting of the movie in the spirit of Musa Warrior. Instead, the film focused on a much smaller number of characters. Yet the film was solid, thoughtful and visually interesting. There was a slightly quivering tone from the dominant thoughtful and realistic tone of confused loyalty, intrigue and blood, against lighters, lighter, more spectacular, martial arts sequences. The filmmakers seemed almost unable to think about whether the film should be a "martial arts film" or a historical epic. The story touches the question of the need for loyalty versus the need to adapt to new situations. Is it really worth your life and those of your friends be loyal to your own lord or come the time when one has to submit to the wind of change? Is there more courage to keep the old ways new? How does one decide? These questions are raised in this film, and ironically, there is a suggestion that the answer given can actually be wrong!
