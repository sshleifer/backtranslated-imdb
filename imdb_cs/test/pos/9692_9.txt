First of all, most people who don't have this bad review don't like this kind of comedy, the movie is great if you have an open mind and are not afraid to laugh at some stupid things. This movie is shot just like a TV show with many short video clips made into one long movie. Some scenes don't even have a dialogue when someone comes out and does something unexpected and it's funny! The only negative I have was that I felt I was wasting my money on my Popcorn and Ice, in this movie I couldn't eat or drink anything that I was constantly laughing at. I was sincerely nervous about drinking some Ice and I saw something that made me laugh and shoot it everywhere. , and viva la bam, then for YOUR SAKE to go see this movie. And if you don't like the first movie or TV show. You don't see it, and if you see it, don't give a bad review. Hardcore Christians who see it and bash it just don't seem right to me.
