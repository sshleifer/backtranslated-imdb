Shame on you if you give this movie a low rating. How do you not like the movie that has Doug McClure, Peter Cushing, silly rubber monsters, fights (and for boys, the woman who was a baddie perpetrator in Spy who loved me, and one of the seventies Sinbad who isn't wearing ) very much of whom my mother said: "She was not selected for her eye color"), lava, silly wigs and silly Victorian drilling machines, as well as the one used in the old Thunderbirds series? Whoever watched this movie and pulled it off watched it for the wrong reasons. It may be stupid, but it's definitely a good shit. Don't make 'em as if they got used to, sigh ......
