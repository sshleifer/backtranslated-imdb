As in "Columbo," we see mortality at the beginning. There is an escalating network of lies, sex, blackmail and murder. The investigating officer, Adam Arkin, is even somewhat stupid, not unlike "Columbo". This is William H. Macy, as a film critic who carries the film. He keeps spinning and spinning, plotting Macy deeper and deeper into the trap of his "perfect crime". Fans of William H. Macy will enjoy "A Slight Case Of Murder" as well as those who like criminal capers with all kinds of delicious choices. Add some well-timed comedy, and it's very similar to the subtle episode "Columbo". Highly recommended. - MERK
