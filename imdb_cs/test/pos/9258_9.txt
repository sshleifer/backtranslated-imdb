The film was excellent, except for some scenes with Esposito. I liked the way it combined all the detectives on the series, and they wrapped up some conspiracy that was never resolved during the series (thanks to NBC ...). It was great to see Pembleton and Baylissa together with their most human and basic people. Braugher and Secor did a great job, but as usual they overlook. It hurt to see that it was the end of the murder. Memories, tapes, and reps on CourtTV are just not the same as every Friday. But the film did its job and did it very well, featuring a great depiction of life after Al left and a family relationship that existed between the unit. I enjoyed this a lot.
