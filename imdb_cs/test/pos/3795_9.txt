Telling a story wouldn't make any sense, did it? Barnens ö, written almost as "booné aww", is the title of this brilliant late 1970s novel, which shocked many people, including myself. Children's Island is the name and island. In Raine, the main character is the Guiness World Record Book as his own Bible. And he's interested in new records. Especially the youngest person under water for three minutes. The story is how most Swedish films and books of that time, deep, consciously provocative and exciting. Bergman started his final film, and Cries and Whispers barely spoke. the expectations of any Swedish film were pretty high. They then taught us that the great theater, great actors, excellent writers and talented directors have created a true team of perfection in the cinema. All of this has been said, Barnens is a story of discovery. It is also a story of alienation: cities are alienated and live in one of us to make us aliens to the majority of the population. It is a story of revelation and sudden encounters with our own destiny. It's a film of overwhelming hope and despair. From the feelings buried under the layers and layers of isolation and isolation from a world that has not been less interested ... <br /> <br /> This approach is in itself a very difficult way to combine a convincing story. The mastership of Kay Pollaka on Ola Olsson's PC Jersilds novel will change this not only in the possibility, but in one of those cinematic masterpieces. Maybe I disagree with someone who said this job was just forgotten. It's not. Even though I write it in 2009, discussions about the P C Jersild story are conducted around the world and the film is screened at many film schools and small theaters. Why? Waxing philosophical on all this would be difficult and many have already done it scientifically through writing and lectures. The reason Barnens Ö has been and is a special story is the cozy feeling that you get from the beginning when you realize that everything is said by the eyes of a small child. And it also ends. Maybe it's a clinical view, as someone else pointed out. But deeply disturbing, moving and satisfying. The concept is deep: as long as we do not have pubic hair, we can still live another day as an angel. Then we become what Raine reflects as a colophon of his experience: "Men are pigs". He fears when he is not afraid. He finds love when the world falls apart. They will find out why they do not behave like adults because they refrain from committing crimes. He left his inner purity and trust in others unqualified, only to learn how the soul of man could be corrupted. <br /> <br /> He hates where love is expected. Where compassion is needed, he finds suspicion and cold heart. It's a movie of metaphors. The film reflects and questions that are difficult to answer, but is more difficult to answer. Finally, satisfaction with the testimony of such great work (which really grew by an ante for any other Swedish film after) is a ride of joy and hope. Be aware that it is a film full of the dark side of our nature. But, unfortunately, the film of hope and deep joy. Reine will still be an island in Stockholm, but there is a great chance that she will live to the fullest today, even though we have found our first signs of sexual maturity.
