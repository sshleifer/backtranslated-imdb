I saw the film at the Nashville Film Festival on May 1, 2003! It was amazing! All the things I read about Stuey were incredibly well portrayed by Tony Vidmer (writer, director, producer, editor), Michael Imperioli (incredible work as a Stuey) and everyone else involved. I'm glad he (Vidmer) didn't go to the "Leaving Las Vegas" routine with Stuey's bad habits, but instead put us in his life, his family and his gift. Tying the story from the motel where he died was a great vehicle and it turned out to be a screenwriter. Big "thumbs up" for this!
