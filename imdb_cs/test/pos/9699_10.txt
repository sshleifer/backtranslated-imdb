This movie is cheerful. I'd say much more painful and disgusting than the previous movie. The entire cast from the previous film and series is present. These movies are great to watch in MovieTheater because the entire audience is crying with laughter, especially in the terrorist section that was damn disgusting. I wish they made more of these films. <br /> <br /> A strong stomach is required! This time they have some crazy pieces. Warning: contains many snakes! I'd like to write about it, but I can't spoil the fun. Go see it !!!
