Indeed, the above summary is not meant to be a slam against this film because the series followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templar ("Saint") meets a lady in need and comes to help. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who was ready to take a bribe. Along the way, he meets some interesting support characters (this time Paul Guilfoyle as "Pearl" Gates) and during his unraveling of this extremely persuasive secret (none of them really) the Templar is extremely erudite and cool! Again, George Sanders is a perfect sophisticated British do-gooder, and once again he is able to produce an excellent B-detective series. Nothing particularly special but well-known and fresh product will surely delight fans of the genre.
