Im usually cautious movies hovering around 6/10 mark on IMDb. I think people know what they're talking about, and they know what they like. I think the trick to reviewing is to make an approach "Hi, when I like movie types like these-I would give it a higher score than I am going to give it because I don't like these types of movies" Then again people judge differently based on a higher value of acting, eventually story or direction. By the way, landing the plane here - I rented this movie out before and didn't have time to watch it, this morning I did. <br /> <br /> Wow! Check out this movie. I am personally interested in paranormal / I have read something about death experiences so I was automatically dependent. I'm not sure about some of the comments that say quality has been wasted here - I disagree - the acting performance was excellent of all - I think this is the only time I didn't mind Julie Roberts, it was good to see 24 years old Kiefer Sutherland (At present The time at the time of this review, serving prison jail for DUI), and Kevin Bacon sports an interesting hairstyle. Overall, I liked the direction, atmosphere, acting and story most - especially the idea of ​​karma, and quote Nelson Wright "Everything That Matters" So True. <br /> <br /> 10/10!
