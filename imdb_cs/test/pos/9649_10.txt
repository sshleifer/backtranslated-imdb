It's a really long movie. But it's quite a beautiful and good example to show why cinema can be considered an art. A story that is easy to explain is not to be expected at Les Amants RÃ©guliers, but every scene, every silence, tells a lot more than a hundred dialogues. Touching, different, perfect in his pictures and soundtracks, which shows why the approach that the cinema brought as one of its main features has become the greatest novelty in dramatic representation. Someone who is accustomed to this kind of movies, where everything is said, and the action happens all the time, will find it tedious. But it's worth a look, find out more ways to feel the story.
