"Two Hands" is a hilarious Australian gangster movie that takes place in a really vibrant Sydney. I bet the tourists never imagine Sydney and Bondi looking like they did in this movie: all sweaty bodies, heavy night and gangsters in nylon shorts and jandals. Heath Ledger plays an amateur boxer with an eye to become part of the local King's Cross boss. He looked quite magnificent in his green sheikh and blue patterned andulce smugglers. A sweaty tattooed point happens to him. I always had him as a boy "Home and Away" and he was in the soap that is a little warmer than Weetbix-insipid "Neighbors". The film is worth watching its combination of sardonic humor and ugly violence - it is expected that the drowned scene will soon become a nightmare. Totty Awards: Country girl love interest city brother and tattooed streetkid.
