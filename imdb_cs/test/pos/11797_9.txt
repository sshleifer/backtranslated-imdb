At more than one level, I can relate very much to what's going on in this film. And all I can say is that it's true what Dexter's mom tells Eric at the end of the story: in fact, he "cured" his son by removing his sad feelings and loneliness. <br /> <br /> This film emphasizes philosophy, which I can very well agree with. We all die one day sooner or later. Ultimately, it's not the time we live, but the fun / good times / happiness we have at the time. This is not the quantity but the quality that counts. <br /> <br /> I think all the other words you use here will only keep you from getting to this movie if you haven't already. I really would like to see that it is released on DVD. Surely it would be added to my "classic time" now!
