"Thoughts are dangerous." One interviewee's comment. Rating DVD: B + / 4 of 5/8 of 10 / It's worth time. Great story for adults / or teenagers, but not for kids. None of those stupid violent crimes so often mistakenly labeled Hollywood for "quality work". And it can be used as a coaching film about what proper boating training is about, or not, before "seven-sea cruise". The film starts a little slow to develop the story, because most documentaries do it, but as the viewer draws it into the saga, the emotions begin to penetrate the head! Emotions include anger, sadness and distrust. Era: late 1960s. That solo cruise around the world is dangerous is not surprising. All the twists that the audience did not expect were surprising. It's not your average group of guys in a sailboat! Each ship was different, as the race rules allow. Each solo sailor has different skill levels, as the race rules allow. Among them were well-known sailors and a few known ones. One was considered a mysterious man because no one seemed to know about his abilities at all. Each ship could fly as long as everyone did not finish by a certain time. And that, of course, was against modern electronics that allow boatmen to communicate with the coast about bad storms, etc. The current video and audio recordings are scattered with interviews with family members and other stakeholders. Despite the years that have passed, the interviewees' mood is always dark. The main character, Don, is the center of attention and how his journey relates to those who not only wanted to defeat, but because of the circumstances of his own creation, to defeat the HAD. Won. The story was about what this circumstance made his life when he moved across the Atlantic in the southwest over several years alone on the water. <br /> <br /> DO NOT review the "Special Features" section of the DVD once the movie is complete. The whole saga is not fully understood if you are viewing "bonus" things. Finally, once you watch everything on DVD, you'll probably just shake your head and scream, 'Wow.' And keep in mind that this is why the story has stayed alive for the past 40 years. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: Once you've finished the movie, DO NOT review the "special features" section on DVD. One sailor who headed back to England after circumnavigating the globe, decided not, he went on another spin and the film records his husband's views on this decision. The opposite story is based on another sailor wishing the race to allow two on board to marry his wife, and their photos prove a very warm connection between them. Burley's ex-parachutist, who actually went over the Atlantic with a friend before a solo sail race, was incredibly witty by describing that he didn't know how to sail and who thought the bad things happening to him were "normal â€œ. "Too many people think that sailing in the open sea can be a romantic adventure without an accident.
