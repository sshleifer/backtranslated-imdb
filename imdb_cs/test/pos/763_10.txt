This movie is a great movie. The film shows so many topics in one amazing movie. The driving lesson focuses around Ben (Rupert Grint), a shy 17-year-old who is approaching age. The film goes on how Ben is ill with his dominant mother and how he wants to be himself. Ben then meets Evie, with whom he ties very much. They both embark on a journey, and Ben finds himself in the process and the relationship he shares with Evie. This is a movie you watch yourself or with someone else. It doesn't matter what Ben goes through in the movie. It's a very warm movie that just wonders if your driving lessons were sometimes as emotional or as a lot of the way Ben's lessons.
