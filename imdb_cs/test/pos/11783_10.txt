I haven't seen "hardware wars" in years, but I remember it as one of the most astonished events of human experience and it was too early. Every aspect of this movie was jolly, and it was even better than "Star Wars". I laughed. I cried. After watching him, I asked a family member for three dollars to kiss him (joking about the last one). I love it when Ham Salad is sidekick / co-pilot tries to eat Princess Anne Droid's cinnamon hair buns, and Darph Nader's character is just hilarious! This movie would be great to look back with "Thumb Wars", and I sincerely wish it could be "The War of War, Episode II: Umpire Out". (He was there?)
