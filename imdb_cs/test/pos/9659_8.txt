It is a film about love, violence, illegal affairs, and Romanian magnolias. A Romanian story combined with occult adaptation, which has resulted in a modern international film that can be understood by both Western audiences and the Eastern European audience, which have focused on the conservative communist regime over filmmaking. A film full of violent fighting scenes that are very numerous and create more and more tense situations as the film continues. A story that impresses your view of the tough neighborhood life. Two young men doing illegal car races. They work together as a team and thrive on their jobs, but when a local mogul is asked to lose one race, things start to be messy and the bomb's insurance lights up and creates a very tense movie that will keep you close to the screen when the You will still ask yourself many questions long afterwards. Brilliant acting by both Dragos Bucur and Dorina Chiriac along with high quality directing and screen writing by young but talented director Radu Muntean also gives Furia a unique charm. All this and many other elements that can be seen in watching have created a film that must be seen by all filmlovers all over the world, and its message is clear to all who are not dependent on race, the language we speak, or the earth. It is a real hope for Romanian cinematography because it is trying to keep up with advanced cinema. <br /> <br /> I hope you like it because I'm sure all people who have seen it like it and understand it.
