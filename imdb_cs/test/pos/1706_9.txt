To paraphrase Thor Birch: "I'm like this movie. It's the exact opposite of everything I hate in the movie". This dark movie was too low a key and intelligent to make theatrical releases, no chance of success would be the need for costly promotional campaigns. And the arrival of an age story where nothing happens - where instead it focuses on character development, it has a limited target audience. Who heard of a mature teen movie? But if you can see it, or if you can participate in a few DVDs, you can do much worse. "My Wife Teacher" is nothing revolutionary, but she has a lot of work to do repeated visits. Jason London (as Todd Boomer High School) is a star and fits this character. as well as its parts in "The Man In The Moon" and "Dazed and Confused". His extraordinary work from his auxiliary cast helps him. Tia Carrere in the title role is revelation (she can act) as Todd's Calculator tutor and love interest. Christopher McDonald as a teacher in nice self-engaging performance. Zak Orth and Alexondra Lee as best friends Todd and his father Jeffrey Tabor. As someone remarked earlier, it's a "mature" teen movie because romantic relationships are generally unsuccessful - at least according to the traditional standards of a happy ending. Even Todd's parents are indifferent to each other, with his father grabbing the character's name, and his mother (Leslie Lyles) literally on the phone during her all time on screen (a device that provides increasing comedic relief with each subsequent look). London romance - Carrere has an unexpected charm and is much more credible than any other older woman you can find. But the real strength of the film is the evolving relationship of three friends. There is no overcrowded melodrama, just three immature people who alternate between testing and mutual trust, subject to all the dynamics that three young people can bring to this sort of thing. In fact, they manage to break the "trustworthy" three-man relationship, perhaps the first in cinema history. Then again, what do I know? I'm just a child.
