Let's face it, Australian television is largely horrible, but this is a real diamond in the rough, not being watched by enough people. The Chaser crew, who makes satirical newspapers and CNNN, will try something new by mixing live comedy, pre-recorded parodies, and political satire into one show filmed in front of a live audience, sorta like Rove, but funny. They love to cause controversy, and this causes some of the funniest shows, especially Chris, who tells his wife to "f-- off" live on a television breakfast and Julian handed a newspaper check signed by Saddam Heusein to AWB's head. It must be one of the funniest Aussie shows from the Micallef program.
