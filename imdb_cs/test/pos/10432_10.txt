This is the best movie I've ever watched. At the age of 12 I was late and ran through the movie. It was on the US channel, Gilbert Godfrey's Up All Night. I will never forget. At that time, my friends really struggled with various sexual problems. You know, 12 is a very rough and weird age. Looks like you're between being a little girl and being a young lady. This movie really helped me answer a lot of questions. Now I have a daughter who is 12. They were looking for a few years for this movie. If it ever came out on DVD, I'd be the first to buy it. He would advise any parent to look with his child when they reach a very rough and difficult age.
