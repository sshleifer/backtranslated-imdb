The film follows four friends since the 1950s (when they are in high school) until 1981. They are Danilo (Craig Wasson) a Yugoslav immigrant; Georgia (Jodi Thelan) "Free Spirit"; David (Michael Huddleston), who has no personality and Tom (Jim Metzler) a big, strong, handsome, rough guy. All three are in love with Georgia, but Danilo loves. The film focuses mainly on the two - it records their lives, love and attraction to each other over the years. It also gets to Danilo trying to get the love of her hard-fledged father. I love this movie, but it's not without its bad points. Thelan's tall, whistling voice is unpleasant (but you get used to it); the story jumps very fast; The life of Tom and David is never explained (Tom appears with a Vietnamese woman and children and David has a woman we never meet until the end); some important scenes are poorly written, and there is some obvious pre-section cutting (probably to keep the movie in 2 hours). But everything else is so good that you can easily forget the problems. The story is convincing - you really recognize and understand characters and always find yourself in life. With a few exceptions, the scenario (Steve Tesich) is good - in fact, Tesich himself was a Yugoslav immigrant, and much of his script was based on his own experience. All the performances are great - especially Thelan and Wasson - and Reed Birney also plays in a strong, sympathetic performance like Louie, classmate Danilo. And Lois Smith is very interesting in her role. And take a quick look at Mercedes Ruehl and Glenne Headly! Basically it's a really great story about immigrants, about age, love for America, and it perfectly covers 50-80 years. This film was (unjustly) spoiled for its release. The studio didn't know how to promote it (it's a tough movie on the market) and the critics stepped in (Pauline Kaels in "The New Yorker" was particularly harsh). It was hard to play in theaters (I was lucky enough to catch him in 1981 in a short theatrical run) and just disappeared. It is a pity. It's a movie that's ripe for re-release. I don't stand for it - but you never know! Definitive 10 all the way!
