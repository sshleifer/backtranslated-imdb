Well to start with Rajkumar Santoshi is not a comedy filmmaker, and it is really unfortunate because the only comic movie he made is a masterpiece. This movie is really funny. Voice in bits, overacted in several scenes, but still r dialogs really laugh at riots and r characters really full of fun. The story line in a simple Billionaire daughter comes to India for marriage and two young boys r behind her, the story has a twist also with a Gangster connection. The Aram playing the street clever guy Amar played his part with brilliance and Salman has played the role of an innocent stupid to perfection. Raveen did well, but Karshima really bothered in some sequences. But the real show stealer r Paresh Rawal and Shakti Kapoor enter the frame and start laughing automatically. Overall, such a nice movie that u can watch it no no. times without getting bored.
