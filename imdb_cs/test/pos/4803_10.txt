Running from time is probably so close to the perfect movie you've ever seen from Hong Kong. All elements click: an amazing scenario (by the French writers Julien Carbon and Laurent Courtiaud), which can even subvert the odd clich√©s, reliably imaginative directed by Johnnie To and the excellent central performances of Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan, showing his great comic timing for amazing effect without would ever cross the line into parody (especially in his irritated reactions to his hopeful negotiation skills). The support cast is also fine, with Yo Yo Mung a strong impression in a small role, and even often histrionic Waise Lee (notably, and very aptly, like Bald Andy Lau) reining it in good effect. Is It Best To Know Too Much About The Plot To Go Beyond Basic Settings? With only a few weeks to live, Lau engages in a criminal game with Wane cop with no apparent motive? and just sit back and enjoy the ride: it's definitely worth the fare. He also has one of the most perfect love stories in recent films and has played in just three scenes (the second bus ride is one of the most beautiful moments of filmmaking I've seen in age). Also Raymond Wong has a good score. Funniest playing cats and mice in movies in years.
