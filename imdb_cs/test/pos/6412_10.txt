This movie, one of the best I've ever seen, talks about incompatibility. This plunges into a lively Taipei, colored in cool colors, where the rain falls constantly; DAMP World. It shows us the story of two people living in this world, men and women. coincidence, or fate, connects their existence, but they are unable to open themselves to others by words. The characters mirror the difficulty of our society in terms of interpersonal relationships. Incompatibility, which reaches its limits. all characters exchange only a few words during the film, dialogs are almost absent, and when some words are spoken, they are often weak and empty, far from describing the real feelings of people. The course of the story, the revelation of the feelings of the character is developed (a brilliant idea!) By musical turns, only manifestly insignificant, which project the film. The continuation of the sentimental event and the drama of the female protagonist will lead us to a wonderful end, strongly symbolic. The film is completely different from the usual, clever performance of a great talented director. PS. Forgive my bad grammar!
