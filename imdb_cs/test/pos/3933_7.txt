Lots of people charm this film for the Paris Hilton presence, but that's not a fair reason to object to the film. The fact is that Paris has a relatively small part, spending most of the film off the screen. The film also makes fun of her on several occasions, usually involving a camera and at least once in night vision. For those who enjoy the Paris Hiltons theater performance, it can be a movie you can see at home when it's released on video, because we all laughed at the disaster through the film at the show I was on and she is portrayed as " a woman of dubious value ". The film itself was quite good (as opposed to the recent flood of faint horror fluctuations), it has all the good horror; a haunted villain, excessive violence, acts that make the average person crouching ... this film hit all the basics.
