Sharky's Machine is one of Burt Reynolds' best efforts. It is also one of the best contemporary dramatic acts. Erotic and violent, the film is characterized by setting a story in Atlanta, and brings a chaotic detective case to you (the viewer) on a silver platter. Sharky must be devoted and determined to stop the murder of Dominoe, a beautiful lady of the night who is a client of something other than ordinary. Before long, Sharky's criminal war machine reveals a Supreme Order plot that threatens to spoil Atlanta's inner body. As a resident of Metro Atlanta, I remember the excitement of the city during film production. Sharky's machine goes to great lengths to provide an accurate view of Atlanta. Twenty years removed and 2,000,000 people later, the film stands a test of time. Trust me, Atlanta hasn't changed. One of the highlights of the picture is the daring piece of Dar Robinson (the classic symbolic end). It has even been featured on This is an incredible, ABC reality show period. It's just bad that Hollywood doesn't do enough movies like this. Kick back, each of your popcorn, and watch the silver silver action.
