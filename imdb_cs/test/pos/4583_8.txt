This must be the stupidest film I've ever seen, so it deserves a special prize. Okay, so it starts pretty good, logical, humor and then quickly turns into a complete and utter stupidity @ rt, @s, f√∂ck stupidity that makes complete sense. Strangely, I barely laughed, though I think it should be funny, with a very serious message. After a moment of thinking why I wasn't allowed, the answer was pretty clear ... this movie is more realistic than I want to be. So it's extremely stupid, but very wise if the goal was to reach people who aren't "blessed" with lots of neurons and synapses and electrolytes (huh, electrolytes?). In fact, this film can be understood at a certain level by a large audience! Although they probably just laugh. <br /> <br /> Ah well, nice try ... <br /> <br /> I am now editing (well adding) my comment because I have read some of the other comments. First, I noticed that some people see racism in this film. When I looked at it, I didn't mind. However, I can imagine if you look from this perspective, you will see some. Of course we could discuss the connection between intelligence and race, but I don't think that's where we can do it. I wonder if we should evaluate the Huxtable family here, would you complain that they are all black? I don't think so, but I think you might ... (except that the two wisest people in the world, half, woman, I don't seem to be absolutely Caucasian, so 'what kind of a problem?') Second, the film gets a very mixed rating; from 1 to 10 and all in between, but a lot of polarization, which means the movie does its job very well! It develops people, makes them speak and judge. This means it's a good movie, whether you like it or hates it. After 5 minutes it becomes very predictive and boring even, yet you watch this sheer bullshit. I hope that's not the case. Or maybe it's our sick way to look at terrible accidents. Well, this doesn't matter.
