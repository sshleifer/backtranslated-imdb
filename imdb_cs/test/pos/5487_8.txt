When I worked, I remember that I had a really unpleasant client who would deal with the one who insisted that everything be on a personal basis. I told him the things my agency could do, and he couldn't do it, and he firmly believed I was personally to make him what was rightly his. I swear, but I was thinking about this guy watching John Malkovich and Clint Eastwood in their battle for wits. Clint Eastwood as a secret service agent veteran in Dallas as a young man when John F. Kennedy was murdered. Since then he had his doubts and was given a drink and his life suddenly was a real shock. He went back to the detail of the White House and when the potential rats from the tenant raid on the secret service, it was Eastwood and partner Dylan McDermott who drew the case. case. He is a professional in his work, trained and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. That year he lost to Tommy Lee Jones for a refugee that year, and I'm not sure, but I think Malkovich was better. Oddly enough, Malkovich could have been better, but he saw Eastwood as an agent. in charge of entering his apartment while at work and insisting that the whole thing be personal. He calls Eastwood throughout the film and taunts him. And after a while, what Malkovich says, causing Clint to get a real personal life. The presidential killers we had in our history were happy amateurs if you don't believe in some of the conspiracy theories about some assassinations. A man like Malkovich, a professional with real or supposed grudge, is the most dangerous kind of enemy. Others appearing in the cast are Fred Dalton Thompson as Chief of the White House. to be president in real life), Rene Russo as another agent in the Eastwood male spell, John Mahoney as head of the secret service, Gary Cole as head of the White House secret service, Gregory-Alan Williams as the next agent, and Jim Curley and Sally Hughes as President and First Lady. But when Malkovich is on his own, he owns In The Line Of Fire. The peak with him and Eastwood is unforgettable.
