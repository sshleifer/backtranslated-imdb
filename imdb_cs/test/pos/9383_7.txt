I can honestly say that "Death Bed: The Bed To Eats" was a much better film than I expected. Let me clarify the story if the film's title is too vague - there's a bed that eats. Bad bed. It eats people. A few unsuspecting women on a "trip" of some sort, hit the sinister "bag" and eventually fall prey to it's hungry. The absorbing process consists of a yellow foam soaking people into its inner ... stomach acid; all are accompanied by chewing sounds. This is a very strange cult film and the only George Barry movie that has forgotten that he did it until the word from his newly found cult status returned to him and he decided to release it on DVD. It's not a bad movie at all, if you can look around miserable acting and enjoy hockey effects - the most ridiculous is the person whose hands are ingested, and he is left with sculpted-looking skeletal fingers ... as well as coming as a very unreal and abnormal - Mainly the whole thing that concerns the artist behind the picture and the demonic back story of the bed. If you like a bizarre no-budget, weird flick than sure to look for "Death Bed".
