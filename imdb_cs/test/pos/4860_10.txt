Most people who take part in this film will have no idea of ​​Arthur Miller's great novel, which is his foundation. It is a novel that should be read by more people to see how prejudices affect and change people's lives. In the beginning, Lawrence Newman is an ordinary man. His boss's glasses make him change everything he worked for, and his whole world is falling apart around him, piece by piece. He couldn't be an actor better suited to bringing an intelligent performance to the screen than William H. Macy. Not only is he a talented stage and film actor, he projects honesty for every character he plays. He is the everyday man he has caught in his insecurities. His anxiety intensifies when he stands up and leaves work. All of a sudden he has to face the problems he tried to avoid his middle class existence in Brooklyn in the 1940s. He's Jewish, right? Cinematography in this brilliant and atmospheric movie, directed by Neil Slavin, still reminded me of Edward Hopper's paintings, especially the succession at the beginning of the film, when Newman stepped out of the building and shot at night when he and his wife were followed by long black shadows behind threatening and anticipating confrontation with the rapists. Laura Dern, David Paymer, and especially the Meat Loaf, which pours incredible depth on the tyrannical door, are brilliant, but they are all pale compared to William H. Macy's star turn (H must stand for HONEST ..) If you haven't read the book , I would sincerely recommend it because nobody wrote more truthfully and convincingly than Arthur Miller.
