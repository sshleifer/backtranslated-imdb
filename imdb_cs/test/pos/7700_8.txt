This story takes place in Wisconsin. When I heard the name Appleton, I watched the tape halfway carefully. I wasn't sure where it was going until I heard them say Green Bay & then I thought it was Wisconsin. The observation further confirmed this. Impatiently waiting for the result, I really felt Corrin's frustration. I didn't know it was based on reality until the end. He left me, but sad and I wanted to know more.
