And so the most beloved skunk he ever loved the silver screen was born. While the plot has an abused cat painting itself as a skunk and unintentionally attracting Pepe Le Pew (called Henry here), Pepe certainly steals the show. There is no doubt that Chuck Jones realized that this member of the Mephitis family, who is looking for love, had this special need to be a star in his own right, and four years later he occupied Pepe in "For Fragrance Immunity." presence on screens everywhere. So, while "Odor-Able Kitty" may be the place to be, otherwise I'm trying to imagine that it might be the first time in 1945. Could someone guess that this support character would soon join the Bugs, Daffy, Porky and others? Whether someone has done it or not, Pepe remains one of the most sympathetic characters to this day. C'est l'amour!
