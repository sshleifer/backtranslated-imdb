It includes spoilers I had recorded a while ago when it was on PBS, but they never had a chance to watch it (probably because of the prejudices that they had to sit for 5-6 hours of the Masterpiece Theater, with the BBC created for (no) music production) setting everything in one room, without outdoor scenes flat TV view ...)) But after watching the movie Traffic (which I thought was pretty good at that time) I couldn't help kicking the Traffik tape to see what else would be they could throw in an extra 2 1/2 hours. Boy, it was my prejudice about this TV series. It's much more engaging than Traffic. Characters are improved to make their actions more believable. And the whole subplotation involving Pakistan complements the whole view of everyone throughout the supply chain, from the farmer to the end user. In traffic, Pakistan's story was rewritten and reduced down to a good cop against a bad kick plot. There was much more meaningful discussion and debate about alcohol and other forms of the drug, while in Traffic they mostly became referral links without meaning. As with the social issues that were trafficked, they were realistically transmitted without the preachers echoing. While in Traffic, the characters jus t veiled it like a statement like the way it did in those for television "edition of the week" movies. <br /> <br /> There was no bad guy vs a good guy in Traffik, even a dealer is portrayed as a junkie who sells to promote his habit instead of "no one with me" type of person in traffic. The only part below is that since I watched Traffic not before I watched it, it was not difficult to compare the scene to the scene, and although the scenes were not the same, I knew what the result would be. Thank goodness for the Pakistani story, which is so different that it allowed me to enjoy it without thinking about what scene to deal with. Although I was fired, I was thinking that the drugs were melted into the pottery statues in which Helen brought back to Germany (as in Traffic History). Thank God Traffik wasn't so hockey and appealing.
