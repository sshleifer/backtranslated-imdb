I thought I had witnessed every wrinkle that a crime / gangster had to offer, but the combination of Garrett-Marcin-Hammett would bring some real excitement and surprise through Mamoulian's inventive strong direction, Lee Garmes atmospheric photography, plus remarkably sharp film editing and flawless special effects. Brilliant acting helps too. Coop gives one of his most compelling performances as a retentive hayseed-turned-fearless bootlegger (a sort of character progress he had to repeat in other roles such as Sergeant York). Miss Sidney (pictured in the middle) in her first starring role is also eyes. The principles receive great support from Paul Lukas, Wynne Gibson and Stanley Fields as in heaven, and even from the hard-core detective Robert Homans. Apparently, the film was built on an extensive budget that is brilliantly deployed in its realistic, crowded sets.
