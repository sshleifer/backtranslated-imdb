They were alternative than there was an alternative, The Residents are a band like no other, and I love them. This has all their classics, from 'Hello Skinny', 'Third Reich and Roll' to their tribute to the great James Brown, arguing that this is the world of man's man. But that's just the beginning. As a bonus, even Renaldo & the Loafs has terribly beautiful 'Songs for Swinging Larvae' and even elements of The Residents. Needless to say, I highly recommend buying this DVD, I would also recommend buying their last album 'Demons Dance Alone', it's fantastic. Uncle Willie Eyeball Buddy # 502
