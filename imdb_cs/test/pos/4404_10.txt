Thank God for Coen brothers. Their success brought them more budgets, but did not deprive them of their creativity. I planned to see another movie, but it was sold out so I went to this place. When it started, I forgot what movie I saw there. I was surprised by more ways. This movie is merry, but they don't make any cheap jokes just to be allowed. Writing is brilliant and George Clooney added it with great skill (after this, no one can say it's just a pretty face) and the rest of the cast. This can be appreciated on many levels, whether you remember Odyssey or not. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that's been smart. I saw others that I would describe as beautiful, interesting, funny and charming, all of which also describe "Oh brother," but this film reminded me of older episodes of seinfeld where all subplots eventually joined. You feel their way to something, but you don't know what. And the Coen brothers will not disappoint us, the end is definitely not disappointing. It's surprising, and connects all the loose ends neatly without a story out.
