"Subconscious Cruelty" must be one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen. "Salo" and "Cannibal Holocaust" didn't bother me so much, but "subconscious cruelty" is a strange psychological element. This movie challenges your subconscious with shocking taboos, surrealistic visuals and one of the most disturbing movie scores and sound designs. Occasionally repulsive; Yes, but its visual atmosphere can be compared to Avant Gard directors like Alejandro Jodorowsky, Dario Argento, Du≈°an Makavejev and David Lynch. Take the most extreme elements of these four directors and throw Luigi Fulci's film into the graphic violence and you may be able to guess what you are. The film is divided into four parts. The first part of the "Ovarian Eye" is real short. The narrator tells us about parts of the brain and its functions. Then the naked woman gets her stomach open and the eyeball is pulled out. The second part of "Human larvae" is something like "Eraserhead", but with incest. He deals with the sexual obsession of man with his pregnant sister. Where is Frued when you need it? The third part is my absolute favorite. It reminds me of "Begotten" and Jame's Broughton short film "Dreamwood". In this segment, people have sex with the earth. Men hunching bloody holes in the ground, girls masturbate with tree branches. Branches are bleeding when they break. Look in horror when a man puts fellatia on a knife that protrudes from a woman's vagina. These people really know how to get in touch with nature. The last part of the movie is most disturbing and sometimes bordering on hardcore pornography. This part of the film made me think of Jodorowski's "Holy Mountain", "Sweet Movie" and "Cannibal Holocaust". I've never been disturbed by what I witnessed in my life. Business man gets his privates pulled apart by a fishhook. Yuck and Ouch! Two women urinate on the figure of Christ and continue the cannibalistic enjoyment of him as a social bread and sodomize him with a tree branch. Poor guy. The last part was so extreme that if I watched the film again, I would close my eyes or move forward a little. Karim Hussien and Mitch Davis are obviously very talented. Hussein continued to direct Tarkovsky's influence "Ascension" (2002), which is a much better film and along with him wrote the script for Nacho Cerdu after the dark horror film "Abandoned". "Subconscious cruelty" is a fascinating and disturbing journey; with images that come from the unthinkable realm of everyday human minds. Somehow.
