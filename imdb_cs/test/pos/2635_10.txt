This film is such a good example of a size that is 80th fun. Don't get me wrong, most of the music sucked. I always liked the metal bands of the 1980s. Bands that had some balls. Forget the stupid keyboard and everything that is "terrible and I want to die" garbage. But the 80's movies are the best. They were all nonsense and just having fun. This film illustrates it! Party! Naked! Put it down! WOOOOOOHOOOOO!
