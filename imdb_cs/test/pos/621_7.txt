Mute Witness is a modest but very solid thriller that has never received the attention or good comments it deserves. Film? wrote and directed Anthony Waller completely? is a tense, action-packed thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences. No pointless mumbo-jumbo or endless plot of twists - right on the point secret. Mute Witness deals with the cruel theme of "snuff" movies and is effectively based in Russia. *** SPOILERS *** Since production costs are cheaper there, the US film crew will temporarily move to Russia for filming a horror movie. An old hangar is used as the location of the film. The team's female makeup artist accidentally locks up overnight and tries to find a way out, witnessing recordings of an authentic snuff film! She caught herself and tried to escape, but because she was muted, she couldn't cry for help, nor could she explain what she had seen in the police. Girl's life is now in real danger, because behind this snuffing is the whole hidden network and do not want witnesses to be alive? *** Spoilers ***. Mute Witness contains several high-pitched action sequences and is rather bloody. Some of the mystery clues are effectively kept secret until the very end. As for a similar subject, I would say it's definitely better than the more famous "8mm" directed by Joel Schumacher and starring as Nicolas Cage. Acting in Mute Witness is not great, but the leading actress (who is Russian) looks really cute. Sir Alec Guinness also makes a special look. I can say it's very cool. We definitely recommend with guaranteed fun and fear.
