It is true that there are some who want to find them. It's not important, though. <br /> <br /> The primary feature of this movie is watching veteran experts do their craft. Kristin Scott Thomas is beautiful and plays the role of a strong woman, but who has been hurt. Same for Harrison Ford, who is as beau for ladies as Kristin is for us guys. Their injuries in the hands of their adulterous spouses connect them in an awkward way, but one of them. in which they find support. As they evoke their wounded feelings and their humanity on the same screen is why they are such sought-after artists. The viewer cannot help but feel what he feels or can help when he wants to encourage them. Yes, there are some action scenes that involve angry cops, but they just spice up a little, and they're not a major part of the movie. <br /> <br /> For a music lover, Dave Grusin provides excellent background jazz, featuring trumpeter Terrence Blanchard. Grusin, as well as the actors, shows why he is one of the most sought-after music consultants in the film industry. Blanchard shows why he is one of the premier trumpeters on the scene. It's not a film for enthusiasts of guts, blood and gore. But for those who want to see a lot of what makes us feel inside, look at a beautiful English actress with big expressive blue eyes that can behave like Harrison Ford, to the endless reassuring accompaniment courtesy of Dave Grusin and Terrence Blanchard . move with someone you love. With advantage in bed. I thought he deserved at least 8.
