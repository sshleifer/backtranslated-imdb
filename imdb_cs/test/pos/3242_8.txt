I'm an independent film fan. Dialogue-driven, character study pieces are where it's for me. Some other posts are right: "Wannabes" will not compete with "The Godfather" for the best mob movie ever. On the other hand, "Wannabes" is a well-written and well-directed image that has surprisingly good performances from each actor / actress. My problem with one of the other reviews: Conor Dubin performs as the only Italian Irishman <br /> <br /> - Dubin is a Jewish surname, and as such has dark skin, not a traditional red from the Irish. It doesn't stand out at all, it brings great performance. This has not won many awards, but deserves a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn. I found it for 7 bucks on a blockbuster and at least I was pleasantly surprised! Highly recommended.
