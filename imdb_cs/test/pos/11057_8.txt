It is a forty-minute film that will introduce us to the character of the butcher, who will later be examined in detail by Seul Contre Tous. This film follows the early years of his life from 1965-1979, but focuses on the late 1970s. The first pictures are from the defeat of a horse, then the birth of a child, a butcher's daughter, which we see quickly every year. The Butcher (played by Philippe Nahon in both movies) is a bitter man with the world. He hates many things. His anger comes to his head when a man attacks his autistic daughter. The butcher then angry with the bad man and finds himself in jail. This film follows the life of a butcher just after his release from prison and from there Seul Contre Tous takes over. First I watched movies, Seul Contre Tous. Try to watch if you can.
