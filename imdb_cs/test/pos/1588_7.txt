Luchino Visconti is famous for the world after his amazing LEOPARD production. Film fans have become acquainted with the style of the director who has presented himself as one of the post-war new realists, an aristocrat who has developed his individual free thinking and subsequently expressed it as an artist. But when this film relates, MORTE AND VENEZIA, based on Thomas Mann's novel, is a little different story. The whole film is at first glance so unique, so psychological and so powerful influenced by the different ideas of the artist (director and main character Gustav von Aschenbach) that it seems to be "unknowable" for many viewers. Such views on the film seemed "too slow", "unbearable" or "endless boredom". Why? Nowadays, this reason seems to be in a distinctive perspective: "GOOD FILMS ARE PARALLELLY UNLIMITED." Here it should be said, "GOOD FILMS ARE NO ACTIONS." In fact, everyone could say one sentence about the content of the whole film and that would be enough. Everything we find in the MORTE and VENEZIA has a sense of vague reality filled with both deepness and shallowness that seem to be important for every single moment. And it is when we notice the psychedelic scenes in Venice when we see Gustav at the railway station when they give us his intensely emotional memories. The insight into his dilapidated mind is sometimes so intense that the only way the viewer watches the film is to do the best to feel and experience than to see and think. Everything is doomed to dry as flowers in the meadow when their time comes. In other words, they all feel loss and death without many events or even dialogues. As a result, it is quite unlikely that you will have an idea of ​​a movie after one viewing. It must be seen more than twice with a mind that is constantly open. If you like it or not ... that's another story, very personal. <br /> <br /> Artistic values ​​are a factor that is visible at first sight and remains with us throughout the world. Beauty as something very important to the main character who seems to come and go; rest as something that is so bad and comes unexpectedly to him; the feeling of being in a teenage boy who appears to be a model of all dreams and desires, as a forbidden fruit of homosexual lust that disappears. Costume designer Piero Tosi has a great job in this movie. With a lot of gorgeous wardrobes, he gives us a very realistic view of 1911 when the event takes place. Cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis provides us with an amazing visual experience that can be called a real feast for the eyes. And in the background comes the music of Gustav Mahler, a composer whose life inspired Thomas Mann to introduce the character. The performances are top-notch works, especially Dirk Bogart as the main character, Gustav von Aschenbach, who wants to relax after hard work and tries in vain to find her in crowded Venice. For most of the film, we have a great insight into his thoughts, feelings and acts of anger, exhaust and despair. Although sometimes depressed, he keeps us on the right track to the end so as not to lose hope for a less tragic end ... Tadzio (Bjorn Andersen) portrays a model of decadent homosexual desire, but also a model of beauty and purity that looks last. short ... "Adieu Tadzio, it was too short," says the main character. The great, though very controversial, work is done by Mark Burns as a "super ego" Alfred, with whom Gustav argues about such ideals as beauty, justice, hope, human dignity. Alfred is a beauty to the senses. How Freudian, but how dangerous an idea could be! Silvana Mangano, who is currently in Italian art films, here as an elegant lady from Poland, mother Tadzio. Commemorative moments truly represent the strengths of the film; but not all viewers consider them unforgettable. Like the whole weird film, they require a lot of effort to get on the right track in the director's individual ego and in the four walls of his psyche. Among these scenes, I consider beach succession to be very important, especially the way Gustav watches Tadzio. Physical distance accurately captures the lack of courage to approach ... I also appreciate the shots when Gustav sits in the gondola and the city's view moves in the background - how remarkably they can arouse existential ideas about transmission. We are not humans, a kind of "passenger" in the world, the way life is. Finally, I have to tell you one important thing. MORTE AND VENEZIA I found extremely strange, until I started to look deeper at what the director was really trying to convey. Each scene then turned out to be meaningful in its interpretation, with which you don't have to agree (barely what the main character does), but you should at least tolerate it as something the author wanted to say. Listen to his voice, give him a few words on one page of reality ... That's why the way to understand the film is long, because in 1971 not many movies were made, now. Paradoxically, we all seem to be obliged to have the right feeling of this film all the time, just as we are all obliged to experience one strange, inevitable, usually unexpected, fact that death is ... 7/10
