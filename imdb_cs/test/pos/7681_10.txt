The Gershwin family is sure to be one of America's greatest operas. You have thousands of fans of this opera waiting to be released on DVD. Please don't be so stubborn, give us a break. Think of the joy and wonder you can bring to the starving public for quality music by releasing this great GEM. Don't wait for the movie to be out of repair. Cast is the first speed, music is just amazing, in today's world we need beautiful music. It can never be filmed again with such a great cast. With today's home theater systems, beautiful sound systems and the need for great music, I turn to the Gershwin family to reconsider and release this amazing movie. Thanks a lot
