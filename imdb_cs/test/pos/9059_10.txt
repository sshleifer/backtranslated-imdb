On a scale of 1-10 "suicide heart" he got 11 from me and all the others in this show. The picture was incredibly funny. I told my wife, "It is obvious that this man is walking on the water, but over the fire bed, that is a little too much." This is one of the best comedy, satire and allusion cues I have seen from Mel Brooks's "Young Frankenstein". I can't believe this big studio didn't catch this picture. The characters are real and the combination of great script and great casting was obvious. Max and Grace are real people with real problems that are solved regardless of the chances of success. It keeps you smiling while you are serious and laughing with indirect humor that has been perfectly integrated into this production.
