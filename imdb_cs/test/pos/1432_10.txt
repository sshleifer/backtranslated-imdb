The director of "The Moon Is Blue" Otto Preminger dealt even more taboo in his 1955 "Man with the Golden Arm" controversial issue. While he incited the film movie America by his use of the words "virgin" and "mistress" in his mild 1953 comedy "The Moon is Blue," Preminger went far beyond what any film attempted with "The Man with the Golden Arm" because Dick Powell did his the law and ordering the epic "to the end of the earth" (1946) about destroying international traffic in narcotics. Based on Nelson Algren's novel, which won the National Book Award in 1950, this bold, uncompromising, 119-minute, black-and-white melodrama deals with heroin addiction. Initially, when Preminger's film came out, the American Film Image Association would not issue its seal of approval because filmmakers displayed addiction to narcotics. This groundbreaking film qualified as the first big film to handle narcotics from a drug perspective, and in fact showed that drug addicts are controlling heroin shooting. The Production Code stipulated that filmmakers must refrain from introducing characters using illicit narcotics. However, United Artists released this unique Frank Sinatra picture and it grossed over $ 4 million. The critical and commercial success of a "man with a gold arm" has provoked a production code. As a result, the MPAA has changed the Code so that filmmakers can immerse themselves in other taboo topics such as drug abuse, kidnapping, abortion and prostitution. The film won three Oscar nominations. Oscar nominations went to Sinatra for Best Actor, Joseph C. Wright and Darrell Silver for Best Art Direction, Black-and-White and Elmer Bernstein for Best Music, Dramatic Score or Comedy. Elmer Bernstein made a name for his jazz score. The producers were thinking about throwing Marlon Brand into the title role, but Sinatra beat Brando on the beat. Eleanor Parker, Kim Novak, Arnold Stang, Darren McGavin and Robert Strauss have played with Ole Blue Eyes. McGavin was particularly remarkable as a slim heroin dealer, while Eleanor Parker played the protagonist of a woman with a dark, deep mystery that comes as a shock. "The Golden Arm Man" refers to the ability of the protagonist Frankie to manipulate a deck of cards. Frankie issues cards for Zero Schwiefka (Robert Strauss of "Stalag 17") but has been out of Chicago for the past six months at a federal narcotic hospital that is recovering from heroin addiction. Not only did Frankie lick a habit, he also learned to play drums and plans to start a musical career. The optimist, as Frank is about his future, finds himself back in front of his past as he returns to his old stomping sites. Schwiefka wants him to deal with him again, and Nifty Louie Fomorowski ("Counter-Attack" Darren McGavin) tries to get him to continue using heroin. Meanwhile, Frankie returns home to his wife Zosh (Eleanor Parker of "Fort Bravo Escape"), who manipulates him with guilt. Frankie was drunk when he had a car accident and Zosh ended up in a wheelchair. Frankie appears with high hopes and a drum kit, but Zosh sees no future as a musician and urges his return to work for Schwiefka. Frankie plans to visit the musical support and one of his own friends, Sparrow (Arnold Stang from "My Sister Eileen"), rips out a business suit from the store for Frankie. After Frankie refuses to work for Schwiefk because she sees Harry Lane's music agent (Will Wright of "The Wild One"), Schwiefka turns Frank and Sparrow into the police. Meanwhile, Schwiefka gets a Brach department store to reduce theft charges. The suit was worth $ 37.00. Frankie agrees to continue trading with Schweifka. Shortly afterwards, despite his decision to avoid heroin use, Frankie breaks down and pays Louie $ 2.00 for the fix. Finally, Frankie meets Harry Lane and Lane warns him that he'll catch Frankie, who shoots nothing to do with him. What poor Frankie does not know is that Zosh has resumed his ability to walk, but uses his guilt about the accident that holds him. Zosh is also jealous of his neighbor on the ground floor, Molly Novotny (Kim Novak of "Picnic"), a former Frankie darling who drinks in a nearby strip bar called the Safari Club. When Zosh complains about the headache Frankie is doing on her drums, Frankie pushes them down to Molly's apartment. Schwiefka and Louie are planning a big poker game with Sam Markette (George E. Stone of "Guys and Dolls") and Williams (George Mathews of "Gunfight on OK Corral"), two big players who have heard about Frank. his legendary "golden hand". Schwiefka and Louie convince Frankie's reluctant to deal with $ 250. After an early victory, Frankie starts to lose and he can't reverse his bad luck. In fact, Frankie spends two days. Exhausted, his nerves fired and desperate for repair, the next day he falls apart, and Markette and Williams cheat him. Louie refuses to give Frankie a correction so Frankie throws it out and throws out her apartment for heroin. Preminger pulls no blows to "The Man with the Golden Arm" and the movie is quite disappointing. None of the characters here are remotely likeable. Basically they are either crooks or driving. Sinatra gives more dynamite, just like McGavin and Parker. Certainly, "a man with a golden arm" has lost much of its impact in between 50 or more years, but it still ranks in the film's landmark.
