This film is great, it has the same low-budget first movie "Pi" and "Clerks", but has the style "Memento" (also writer / director Christopher Nolan). Scores, sound effects, photos and cuts are almost "Memento" prototypes, and the story shows that Christopher Nolan is best at writing and directing. Don't be discouraged by the low-budget appearance and acting, nor by the short length of the movie, and watch it!
