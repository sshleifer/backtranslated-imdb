This is pretty good for a TV movie 'what if' variety. What if the terrorists exploded in a big city "dirty bomb", in this case London. Lots of jostling on people who say 'we're all set up in an emergency' then reveal that they're not exactly telling the whole story. And is anyone ready for something like that? You can't bet. This shows the material for smuggling bombs into the country, making bombs, secrecy and double lives that people follow, etc. It also shows public employees (ie Firefighters) who give everyone to save people, receive no help when the government does not want send anyone else to the affected area. It also shows how woefully inadequate "preparations" are for such a case because the government speaks everything, but then stands there openly as the tragedy unfolds. And could it happen here in a good old US? Well, if you have lived in caves for the last 20 years, they already have something, to some extent, and don't believe anyone would be ready for something like that. This is quite realistic and yes, even scary. It's worth seeing, but just hoping nothing like that will really happen. 8 out of 10.
