Deepa Mehta's fire is groundbreaking, bold and artistic. A masterful social commentary on the situation of women from conservative Indian middle-class households is a film that no one should miss. Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das give a stellar performance by cheating their characters as much as possible. A.R. Rahman's music is a work of genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film. Mehta uses Rahman's score and together they create such amazing sound sets that efficiently display world views around Radha and Sita whenever they seek each other's support. This film is not about lesbianism, because many of them have described it as significant. Lesbism is just part of the film. It is unfortunate that most people tend to write a film without giving it a chance and looking at its true meaning.
