Michelle Pfeiffer is ideally cast as a frustrated crowd widow in this colorful black comedy. Matthew Modine plays a clumsy FBI agent who has taken her fantasy to her. Dean Stockwell steals the show as a big shot he holds on Pesteriffer; Mercedes Ruehl is as dynamic as his jealous wife. It's the entire 1980s, but it just adds to the fun. Nice little movie, though not for every taste.
