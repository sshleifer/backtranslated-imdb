I just watched this movie at Advanced Screening. I didn't read the book and I didn't know anything about the story, but I went because the book was voted "Book of the Year" by two local dormitories. So I can't compare the book with the movie as others did. In short, I thought it was an incredibly moving story. Acting was believable and the insight into Afghan culture and political history was interesting and shocking. My oldest friend is Iranian-American, so I felt affinity with certain values ​​and traditions in the Middle East that were shown in the film because they reminded me of the times I spent with my family. The topics of friendship, family, human values ​​and courage under fire are universal and well developed in the film. I will not give details of the conspiracy because they can be obtained elsewhere. But based on the technical aspects of film, acting, and above all its heartbreaking story, I would definitely recommend this movie.
