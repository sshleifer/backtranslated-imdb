What you bring into the film affects your view of it. I brought 30 years in the Air Force and every time I see it, I'm touched by the end. Anyway, would a young man of 15 years have spent his life flying in jets? Yet I can only touch me. Jimmy Stewart gives a great turn - Jimmy Stewart. Since he was a pilot, and a general aviation general, he probably comes so close to being an expert on how a pilot would be like any man alive. One cannot commit his childbirth or his actions. He's a pilot who is a pilot, that's enough. <br /> <br /> --- Spoilers --- <br /> <br /> It's the last minute of a movie that's still holding my heart. Lindbergh flies without radio communication and has no idea if anyone is waiting for him. When flying to Paris airport, the landing field uncertainty will pull you in. The circles that look like cobblestones or corn fields must interest you, is it in the right place? They go on and on, flowing past their vision until it is low enough to see that in the Paris night they saw it was the light of the city, reflected from the inverted faces of THOUSAND people waiting for it.
