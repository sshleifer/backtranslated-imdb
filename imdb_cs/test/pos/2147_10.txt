I saw the Heaven's Gate in his opening week almost twenty years ago. Tickets were sold in advance on the great expectation that Cimino would see his long work in his "The Deerhunter". The review came and critics trashed the film with a flood. A prominent film critic of New York City led the way, and most critics followed and 3 hours. 40 min. the film was pulled out of distribution. United Artists had Cimino contract the film by an hour and it was re-released many months later to equally severe reviews and to the unfortunate trade. The film at that time cost about $ 40 million (now considered a low budget) to make it one of the most expensive in history and Cimino had a free hand on a project with endless repetitions despite being his only third film. "Deerhunter" also received negative feedback based on a perceived political ideology that was not popular. I mention all this to make a possible distortion of building against Cimino. At that time I thought the movie was very good, and when I saw a shorter version, it was still very good. The film appeared again in the museum in the early 1990s. They were supposed to show a long version but couldn't find an existing print. However, when I saw the film years later, I thought the celestial gate was a masterpiece. Finally, the long version began to appear in several selected cities, I saw it recently and it was worth a wait. The Heaven Gate begins with graduation at Harvard University. Two of the graduates are Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt and we have some of the mistakes in their characters early on. Despite his mandate, Joseph Cotton gives a speech to the graduate class to use his education to enlighten and improve his country, many graduates behave as if they were part of an elite country club. Film flashes ahead 20 years at Johnson County Wyoming. A stock-breeding company called "Shareholders Association" hired poor people to shoot 125 poor immigrants who claim to be cattle thieves. Kristofferson party with immigrants while John Hurt is part of the association. Although Hurt is completely against this crazy action, he's too ineffective to do anything about her. The massacre is happening, but immigrants are well protected. The United States cavalry comes to the rescue of the association allegedly arresting them after most damage was done when in fact they sanctioned mass killings. Kristofferson also suffers from a great personal loss, and the film ends with him a few years later as part of an elite class of his Harvard days who got married, bored, yacht, alive, but dead inside. This is a very complicated film that is brilliant in every department, such as themes, structure, direction, cinematography, writing, music, editing, scenography and acting. Kristofferson, Walken, Hurt, Huppert, Dourif, Bridges, Waterston, and Cotton are excellent images of very complex characters. Some of the main complaints I have read about this film state are ugly to look at, incoherent, too long, that characters don't make sense, and words are often incomprehensible. The Gate of Heaven has in its defense the form of photographs of that time, as "McCabe & Mrs. Miller" did. Some of the scenes are smoky and try to design an industrial revolution, or sometimes even horses, wagons around which people from all sides pass and create a sense of reality. But despite all this, the composition of each film and cinematography is perfect. The film makes a lot of sense if you pay attention to it. Everything is not specified for the viewer and one has to watch carefully how the motivation of the characters or their themes is motivated. In terms of length, it's a beautifully structured piece, sometimes moving, poetic, exciting or devastating with virtually one big scene after another. Sometimes some words are incomprehensible, especially in some busy scenes with activity. However, such a film movie could be understood by using film language, views between characters or their actions. One day, this film should be re-released in full length to give people and critics a second chance. Don't let Michael Cimino become another Orson Welles who is appreciated in his life and unable to do the best movies he can do.
