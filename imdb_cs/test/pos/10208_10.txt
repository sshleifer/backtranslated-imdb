Fritz Lang directed two big Westerns: "Western Union" and "Return of Frank James". Frank James movie equals "Jesse James". "Western Union" is one of Randolph Scott's great westerns. I've never seen Robert Young in the west; He's amazing as a telegraph employee. This is the only film I think opens up a telegraph company in the West. It is a story with a high focus on the telegraph in the West, the story of triangle love and loyalty. <br /> <br /> The support cast is excellent. Dean Jagger, who has done a few westerns, plays a telegraph manager. Virginia Gilmore, who plays Mr. Jagger's sister, is in love. Mrs. Gilmore had a short career in movies. She finished films in 1952 and became a dramatic coach. She is primarily known as Mrs. Yul Brynner. It's great to see Slim Summerville in a movie with Mr. Scott. They were in two other big films: "Rebecca Sunnybrook Farm" and "Jesse James".
