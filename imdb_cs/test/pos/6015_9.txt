and I think it's a good thing. I've never been a Rosalind Russell fan, although the original was my favorite RR movie. But I love Bette and I was glad to do it. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the production, I think it was a little less than the original movie. One of my favorite smaller characters in the original was Mazeppa with her scratched nails-on-the-board voice belting out "HEY! It takes much more than no talent to be strippah!" and although I missed it, I was glad manufacturers had the courage not to make a carbon copy. Looking at the stage, it makes you feel like you're in the theater, not just in the movies. the song "Let Me Have Fun" which becomes completely uncomfortable after about the fifth time you hear it.
