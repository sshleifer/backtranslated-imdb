I just got back from this amazing movie !! I can relate to him so much ... It reminded me when my sister had to go to college, we had to move from place to place, and mom behaves like Adele August! Boys may not like this movie because it brings tears to the eyes. One of the best real-life movies I've ever seen! and Natalie Portman Rules! 10/10
