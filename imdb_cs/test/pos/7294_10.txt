This is a very unusual movie that starts with a rich beard who's brand new sports car for graduation and decides to take it on a spin in a local town. A rich boy meets a poor girl in 'Mabels Diner'who's waitress, and a local friend gets very upset and the fight begins. There is a chase car and all kinds of problems seem to take place and Rich boy and Poor boy end up having to do community service as ordered by the city judge. The rich boy and the Poor are simply not getting in, and the rich boy returns to the heart and soul of the poor boy's girlfriend. There's plenty of walking in the woods and poetry is quoted and some very deep thoughts about life. The poor girl says, "Some people go through life and never find Love, I can say I found love and keep it". You'll need some tissues, if you're sensitive, there's a lot of romantic scenes and I doubt if this picture will end. The producer and the director came up with a good idea and ended up with a film. If you like eternal stories with poetry and very sensitive topics, it's your movie.
