Three words: Piece of art. This movie is just great. It is beautiful, sad, scary and provocative at the same time. The score remains in my head, acting is a wonderful scary and beautiful scenery at the same time. It was more by chance than the purpose I saw this movie. At that time, when I decided to watch this movie, I was bored and read lists of Asian movies that might be good. Well, I saw the title "The Story of Two Sisters", which sounded very interesting. Then I read the summary of the plot and decided: "You don't just have to watch this movie, you have to buy it". He said he did. I bought this movie and I was addicted to the first minute. The story kept me from beginning to end; the turn at the end of the movie made me scream. I really didn't see anything like that. And the final scene made me cry ... she just made me cry. It was so sad. Well, I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a movie that combines an interesting storyline with scary scenes and atmosphere. Although you should be aware that the end is, as I mentioned, very sad. But it just fits into the mood of the movie, right?
