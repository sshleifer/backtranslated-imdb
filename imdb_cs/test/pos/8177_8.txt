This movie is excellent (I watched the French version). There are many subplots (which generally repel the whole), but develop nicely and agree to "discover their own true" theme. In fact, the entire film (except for its background) is the way to discover one's (or someone else's) self. Is the king really a "good peacenic monarch" trying to lead a "war to end all wars", or is it just disturbed, blood thirsty hoodlum? After all, is he a real king? Is the Queen's attendant a mother just a lusty, career, headless sock puppet, or rather a sharp thought, a brave individual? Will she realize dame / concubine, who is the king really? What's between the King and the Old Chancellor? What secret everyone knows, but doesn't it? What is the real reason why the killer left his "job"? Subplots (something I am not particularly fond of) are processed well and keep an eye out for the end. The scenes are well crafted and CGI fits nicely without going overboard. Tension is properly maintained and actors are on this task. There's a lot of brain injured with a smile, but that's the way one should behave in the royal court (as dame / concubine complains). Realistic movie without superhero moments. This Chinese movie really builds Hollywood colossal hollywood (Gladiator, etc.) into shame.
