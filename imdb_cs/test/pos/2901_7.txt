This was the second Cinemascope show that Fox produced after Robe. Note how some of the Roman kits are being repaired for Egyptian kits. The film is produced with all the elements of the first class, beautiful photos, soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can determine which composer has recorded specific scenes). But the main act is a bit weak. It seems that Edmund Purdom has a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as a one-eyed slave and Polish actress Bella Darvi as Babylonian tempter "Nefer". This film generally finds strong on the land, which is rare for these large glasses made at the time. All in all, the film makes an interesting and entertaining social commentary about how Egyptian society looked.
