Hard Justice is an excellent action movie! The whole movie is really nothing but filming and fighting! For people who say they don't shoot em ups as they use. Well, this is a really hard core! David Bradley is really good and his character beats in the movie. A stick hit him in a dozen times, tucked into his back and three days in a coma, and then he wakes up and fights again, gets into play, resumes and is ready for more action! His character is incredibly tuff! Charles Napier was also very good and probably steals the show! Vernen Wells was good! Professor Toru Tanaka had a short and unrecognized role in Hard Justice! When it comes to action, it's really amazing, with all the weapons fighting and huge off off as the scene at the beginning has cars blown up and flipping in the air! There is so much that happens at the time of 95 minutes of running. For action fans you will be blown away by all the firepower and the struggle that this movie offers! Hard Justice is a movie that is not easy to find and if you are in a video store and you see it for sale to buy it because this movie is a great goalkeeper d plus box is cool! There is a ton of action that must be seen to be believed! Check out and see if you can find any good deals on Ebay, Half.com, Amazon.com From-Stores and Market Place Sellers! I highly recommend that any action movie fan who loves to shoot ems and fight movies and has been disappointed with other movies that are supposed to look like a real non-stop action movie but can't deliver it to get into Hard Justice!
