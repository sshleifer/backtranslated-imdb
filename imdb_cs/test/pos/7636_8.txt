It is true that this is not a realistic story, but a romantic comedy is not a genre I look at in realism. Importantly, the characters are nice and sexy as needed. Shalom is beautiful and relaxed and Jake Weber is nice cool. They have enough chemistry to make the story believe in an area that counts, sexual attraction. I'd like to see both of them in another movie. And yes, the clown is also pretty cute.
