I didn't know anything about this film until I saw it ... my brother actually suggested I look. Normally, his designs aren't too much a cop, but I'm stuck on something to watch, so I watched it. Well, to make a short story short, I give it 10/10. /> <br /> The film is spread around two people who meet at the same place. One is initially very dependent on the institution around him, the other is a rebel. One does what he likes, the other as he is told. <br /> <br /> From the very first moments of the film, we see the friendship between the two buildings quickly, and see how they run a bit on each other. It is a remarkable job that can tell a good story without twisting when turning, people jump out of a bath or superhero who are about to save the day. <br /> <br /> There's a fair amount of reality and reality out there, not everything can always go right - not all abysses can never be bridged - and this movie shows a lot. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie and aren't impressed ..... I would suggest you no longer see anything.
