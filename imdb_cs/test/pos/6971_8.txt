Francis Ford Coppola's first 'personal' movie, finished and released in 1969, was the last film he made as mostly unknown, up and forthcoming director before The Godfather, and is in stark contrast to both that film, and the rest of his uneven film . career. It is a seemingly road movie involving a detached young woman who is bored with her home life, and pregnant with her child is not sure she wants to, flees the traps of her dim marriage and beats the open path of seeking freedom. Along the way, he befriends a nice man, a former football player who has suffered brain damage from a traumatic head injury, played unexpectedly gentle fashion with young James Caan and decided to "help" him, even though his simple ways frustrated him. . Her efforts to get rid of him always fail, either through guilt or accident, and ultimately lead her directly into the hands of an emotionally wounded cop (Robert Duvalle) who has her own thoughts. The storyline is shabby, but Coppola does a great job in the detailed emotional life of these characters and uses editing techniques to pass on a back story that was not common in American movies of that time. The shots are simple but extremely effective, conveying both the moody disinfection of the open highway, and the emptiness of American suburban life, filled with subtle melancholy that provides a film score. Coppola also deserves credit for addressing the issue of domestic dissatisfaction from the perspective of a woman in the culturally turbulent 1960s. Overall, a relatively low-key film that is not what viewers expected from Coppola, but one that is less triumph in its own quiet, unpretentious way. 7.5 / 10.
