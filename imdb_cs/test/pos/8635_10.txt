I loved this movie because I was a little boy. I remember the night my mother brought me home. I loved it and I still do it. I think it's very funny and original. There are also some very catchy tunes in this movie. Lou is also a surprisingly good singer. Actors who portray Prince Arthur and Princess Eloise are all right, but Abbott and Costello are the best. Former heavy boxing boxing Buddy Baer, ​​also brother of former heavyweight champion Max Baer is good at this movie as a cop and giant. He had a natural talent. The beginning of this movie is fun as Lou Costello still runs into a car and gets into trouble with Buddy Baer. Also the grotesque in the house is good. I especially like the comedy in the Krkonoše Castle. My favorite parts are; that part was climbing on beanstalk and everyone is singing like parting. Jack sings them to come back. Lou Costello is a very good singer. My next favorite part is when Jack fights Giant. I like it when Jack makes an exploding egg and when they try to make a giant omelet they still explode. Abbott and Costello are the merry and greatest comedians of all time. This is just one of their great movies that I will love and love. Reviews for this movie are not very good and I don't understand why. This is a very good movie by Abbott and Costello. I also love how Lou Costello returns to reality and thinks he's in a dream when Bud hits him. He starts singing his song and leaves with an attitude as if no one is pushing me. Very good movie.
