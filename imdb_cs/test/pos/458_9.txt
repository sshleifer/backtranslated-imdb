This story takes place during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and has all the tension of a good Cold War book or film, because a multinational group of foreigners are trying to smuggle Jason Robard from Hungary to Austria. However, the story is complemented by three things, making it an extremely good film. First, the actors use the real languages ​​of their roles. Russian soldiers speak only Russian; only Hungarians; Germans only German, except to a minimum extent telling a story. Since Debra Kerr is English, she speaks only English, and of course, Yul Brynner and several others who are important to the story speak English. As a result, the empathy of the audience becomes paramount. The viewer shares all the confusion and tension that he is involved in illegal border crossing when he cannot understand any of the languages ​​spoken. Very strong feelings are aroused in the audience, and regardless of the heavy use of foreign languages, the audience never for the loss of watching the movie. No captions required. Secondly. I was in Hungary in 1995 and I tell you that this movie is right. Realism is incredible from gypsy music that has overwhelmed dinner to underground caves in buildings where most of the events take place in rural scenes. If I didn't eat in a real movie restaurant, I ate in my couple. I thought I was actually walking down the main street in that village. (Actually, the film was shot in Austria). The third and most important thing is that this film meets Deberah Kerr and Yul Brynner (after King and I) and magnetism between them, as the story unfolds, a qualified Oscar. Of course, Yul has already received an Oscar for playing this relationship, so Acadamy didn't give him another, but that's the quality of the movie. Don't miss this.
