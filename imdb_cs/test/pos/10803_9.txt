This film is more than the story of Danton. It was a joint Polish French production filmed at the beginning of the end of the Soviet system. It probably helped stimulate the trade union activity of the Solidarity movement. Rather, it is Poland in the 20th century than the French Revolution. Solidarity began the end of the system. The film itself is historical by its existence ... the rest is History. Robspiere, aka. totalitarian leaders. Danton, aka. Walensa. When you watch this movie, you have to remember the snowball that started in Poland. Actually, it might be useful to track the superpower fight in a single superpower.
