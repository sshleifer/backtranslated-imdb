Even for a 17-year-old student who loves history and saw the emotions and excitement of the childhood of this series, his arrival on DVD was a blessing of all time. North and South is really a series of friendship, love, honor ... you name your own list of feelings that you have gained while watching this series. I still remember when I first saw this series on television when I was about 8 years old. Although wow it looks exciting. The bad thing I have never had a chance to see a book one and two on television in the Netherlands. When the book three was widely cast as a late evening series in the Netherlands in the summer of 2004, I knew I had to see two more series. For most people, three books were very disappointing as far as I know. Since I saw the book on DVD, I have to say that so far it's the best of 3 books. There is a more realistic view of all young people watching fantastic movies like Patriot "Oh America for Freedom".
