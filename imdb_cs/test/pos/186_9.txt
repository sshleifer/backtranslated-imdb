This is a wonderful and in many ways impressive film. I saw it on TV as a little boy, with tears almost strangled by neck, and again today on a beautifully restored DVD Criteria. Cranes are the essence of Weepie's war. Imagine Cherbourg umbrellas without music and no color, or Waterloo Bridge without class consciousness. Tatiana Samoilova, a hybrid between Vivien Leigh and Bjork, deeply interferes as a pretty girl whose fiancé is united. Write or come back. The fiancé, Boris, dies at the front and his death scene is indescribably romantic. Very brave because so close "over the top". But this scene will stay with you. Although the Soviets were so defined by WWII, the film is quite unspecific and stronger for it. The prewar and postwar scenes have a very good feeling. There is no attempt in the detail of the period. The whole film is becoming more and more stylized up to the Siberian scenes that feel like a modern opera ensemble (that's a compliment). The Christian final scene is milked until the last drop - again comparable to Cherbourg. Production feels like a big budget (these stair scenes have to become a nice hill). Go for it. Don't expect a bitter socialist pill (though it is, of course, very sad). Cranes are flying is a formidable piece of world film, quite advanced considering where and when it was made.
