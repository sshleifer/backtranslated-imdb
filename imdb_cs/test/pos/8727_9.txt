The depiction of a simple young lady, Goldie Hawn, captured in a love triangle with an older man, a dentist, played Walter Matthau with such a taste that she received the best Oscar-winning support for 1969. But the film is another tribute to Ingrid Bergman. We seldom saw her in a comedy and literally kicked her heels like a devoted dental nurse who was drawn into the Matthau program to tell Hawn that they were married. so happy that Matthau and Bergman look at each other. It's a casual love affair in production. As a friend of Matthau, Jack Weston is also great as his partner. Rick Lenz provides rich support as well as the newfound friend Hawn.
