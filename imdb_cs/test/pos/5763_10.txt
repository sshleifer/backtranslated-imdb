I have not written a review on here at age, but recalculating all the bottom TV shows, live shows and I felt that I had to make my opinions known about this movie! I feel like it's a perfect comedy movie. She misses the lovely dove of stories (I'd really not call wealth enfatuation with the love of Gina Carbonara would you? Or him and Eddie go out there naked ... not love) that make the rest of the comedy go out of good crap, it lacks the usual dilemma that must to overcome in most other comedies ... unless you count guests to poison the guests and have to escape from the green vomit guests as a dilemma similar to other comedy movies ... No, this movie just comes out and succeeds in doing one thing ONE thing: One laugh. What do you need from comedy movies? Laughter. This movie just heaps of laughter after laughing without stuffing laughter with serious crap like other comedy movies! So I call it just the perfect comedy movie I've ever done, and I'll never stop watching this beautiful movie! I appluad rick and ade to such a fantastic genius!
