The only way to truly understand and relate to the characters in this movie is to experience the situations you have acquired yourself. For many people, this movie is almost a fake-biographical, sort of picture of one weekend in our lives. (I made about 85 percent of the stuff in this movie and witnessed another 15 percent, usually everything in the same weekend) I know for me and others that it is nice to have this movie backwards, because other than a few people's pictures, Nights that are patches and smudges, this film is our generation of "Studio 54", a piece that adds to our scrapbooks to look at and smile. Personally, I am glad that those days are past, but it's great to watch this movie and say "I remember when ........." Thank you Justin for doing this fake biography one weekend in my life.
