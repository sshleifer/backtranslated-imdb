I totally loved this movie. For me, the best reason to see how sharp the contrast is from legal dramas like "Boston Legal" or "Ally McBeal" or even "LA Law". This is REALITY. The law is not BS, won in some final argument, or through some ridiculous defense that you pull out of your ass, such as "Chewbacca" defense on South Park. stereotype who use all their skills to correct it. It will be more to restore your faith in humanity than any Frank Capra or KILLING MOCKINGBIRD movie. Most importantly, I cried. During the movie, during the show at the end of the DVD - it's amazing. Nádherný film; nádherně. Thank God the filmmakers did it.
