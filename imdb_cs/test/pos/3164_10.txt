It's worth a try. I saw it at the MLK 2006 birthday and hit me a lot of time. Sometimes it looks like we're all trapped and doomed to repeat the past no matter how much we try to change. All we can do is go on and talk. Just keep going. Don't think you should be worse because it's not the point, but maybe we have to get ahead of you before we see how much we need to work on ourselves. What happens when the best people call us MLK, what needs us to pull us out of our "impasse" but we do not listen. I know some of us are listening, but how can we get the rest of the world to see things as they are? Just keep going, I think. This film was thinking about it all, so I think he did what he decided to do. This is what I consider a good movie or game or book or poem or speech or anything: something that will make you think and move in the active direction instead of sitting stuck and bored and hopeless.
