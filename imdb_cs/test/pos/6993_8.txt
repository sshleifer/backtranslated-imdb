It was certainly a "sleeper" !! Much better than I thought! Never realized that it was a horrible film ..... and who was this wonderful, baritoned voiced piece, named Vin Diesel..preparing spices and intrigue to this otherwise unpopular movie ??? Monsters in this movie were quite unusual, not the same ol running mills to devour-you-up types !! The end was also great, for a change, not all "bad guys are bad" !!! I give it 2 inches up !!!
