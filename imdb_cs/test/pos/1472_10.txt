Okay, when I rented it a few years ago, I had the worst expectations. Yes, acting is not great and the picture itself is dated, but as I sat there it became strange. I like it. The action is great and there are several scenes that will jump you. Brion James, perhaps one of the greatest class B actors next to Bruce Campbell, is as great as ever. The story is not bad. Now I wouldn't hurry and buy, but don't waste any time at least watching this good b-post post apocalyptic western.
