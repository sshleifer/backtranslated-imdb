Aunt Cora was always tactical, and her well-behaved family ignored the remark she made after her brother Richard's funeral: "He was murdered, didn't he?"

I was disappointed with the changes made to CARDS ON THE TABLE - my favorite book Poirot. AFTER FUNERAL, my second most popular book is Poirot, and I was afraid the story would be destroyed.

All the actors were amazing, but my favorite must be Monica Dolan, who performs great as Miss Gilchrist, a companion for the late Aunt Coru. No doubt the best Poirot movie ever!
