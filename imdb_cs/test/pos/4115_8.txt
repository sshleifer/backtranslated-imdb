I really enjoyed this movie, it will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat. It was very well directed. I think it was important to show the life of the other couple as well as Terry and Bobby and show them as people with emotions. How this film needed to show Bobby as a cold and vengeful person. I agree with another review that it was sick love, not true love. He didn't have to go to murder to give his wife a baby. He should have been honest with her and told her she was sterile and decided to take the baby together. Some reviews say it was naive, I think it was when it came to adoption but the best actors all the time. Great movie watch!
