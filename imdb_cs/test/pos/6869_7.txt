There is a lot of plot to this movie. There is a wealthy owner of a baseball team who dies and whose wife will sue the negligence hospital. It's no more than that, but ... IT'S NOT MATTER! It doesn't matter because you have some real actors giving your dialogue life, and because of the cast you have some hysterically funny scenes, even if you don't laugh, you have a smile on your face. Matthau plays Charley, whose wife has recently died and has been the desire of several women in the hospital. He is pleased to be able to taste everything on offer. Then she meets Anna Atkinson (Glenda Jackson), who is initially a hospital patient (their first scene is very entertaining) and then again meets on a panel discussion show where they don't agree on almost every topic being discussed. Charley begins to like Anne, and vice versa, except she is very big about monogamy men in her life (her husband was a cheater) and they decide to give it - two weeks of loyalty. I'm not going to give out anything but I want to mention the chemistry Matthau and Jackson have on the screen. She is usually not the first person to think of a romantic middle-aged comedy, but her contact with comedy is very light and pleasant. It is adapted to every step of Matthau's journey, which is more charming than ever. He doesn't have to play Mr. Sensitive or Mr. Mach to get a girl, he must be alone. Art Carney is an uneasiness in itself as a practically senile physician. The scene where the baseball team owner's ash is buried on the home board is priceless. He also has a very entertaining scene in the parking lot with Richard Benjamin. Richard doesn't have much to do in this movie, and more often than Carney and Matthau, he's just an ordinary man; his role does not lie to his considerable talents, but he had to have a good time doing this comedy. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended ... 8/10 <br /> <br /> PS. FYI - Matthau introduced Jackson with her first best actress Oscar, and Jackson introduced the best actor Art Carney for his role in 'Harry & Tonto'.
