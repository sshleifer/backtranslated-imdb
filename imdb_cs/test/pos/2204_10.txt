Even if you're not a "theater man", I suggest you see it. Based on the play of the same name by Christopher Bond (which, in turn, was based away from old London legends), Sondheim did a great job of bringing it to the musical theater stage. The score is simply amazing - the best of Sondheim and probably one of the best scores written for the musical at all. The show was cast very well, my only complaint was Betsy Joscelyn's portrait of Johann. It's good, remember, and he's a very versatile actress, but he doesn't sing very well "Greenfinch and Linnet Bird". But besides, it's all phenomenal - Angela Lansbury * has done the role of Mrs. Lovet and she does it so well. George Hearn was a good substitute for Len Cariou in the title role, and Ken Jennings gives great performance as Tobias. The end will give you chills. The best signs for an amazing show.
