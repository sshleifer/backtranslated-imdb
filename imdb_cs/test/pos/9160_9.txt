American war movie fans might be bored with skulls by this film, but boredom is born out of ignorance. Partisan suppression operations are always such. Sit back and wait, get some hookers, get drunk at the base, behind the wheel and do business with the entrepreneur, kick in the prisoner, cover the killing of the merchant with the green private streets. Then, boom, there go two fuel trucks, and for 10 minutes a small-battle gun with one high-caliber machine gun. Then wait for the brass to plan a way to shrink its strength, and then end up killing several civilians in the process of doing it. If reality doesn't work for Western viewers, there is always Top Gun or Rambo (Top Gun Realistic? No). They had to do it because Carter and Reagan gave Mujahedin so many rockets. Also, the wave of the Mi-24 was an excellent, better attack on the helo now than the Apocalypse. The sight of their rockets that were falling and firing was a scene of approaching "death from above" for whom they were targeted. It's funny how the Soviets were able to shoot an Afghan film honestly within a year. their departure, but it took six years. Afganskiy Izlom is just as real if you use it for NATO occupation. Someone will always pick up a gun and shoot because you care more about the earth. It's a movie Western people should watch. Unfortunately, I don't think anyone ever made English subtitles; Maybe I'll have to do something.
