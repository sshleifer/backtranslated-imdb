When I started watching, I thought I was following a pro-Koresh amateur documentary. But I've never seen 3/4 shots they used. Interviews with people said that the FBI / ATF was encouraging all these things that sounded so far, but then followed the video and the FBI's testimony. I was impressed. The documentary followed the Senate investigation after the fire, and after seeing the interview and the video, you will be shocked at how the Senate and the Attorney General turn their backs on the Davidians basically to cover up the FBI / ATF aggression. If you start watching it, you have to finish it. Otherwise you will think that this is a propaganda of something like that.
