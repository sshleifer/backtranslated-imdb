Originally supposed to be just part of a huge epic of 1905, the Revolution of 1905, Potemkin is the story of the Potemkin revolt in Odessa. The film opens with a crew protesting the maggots of the mass and the captain ordering the execution of dissidents. There will be an uprising during which the revolutionary leader is killed. This crew member is taken ashore to lay in a state. As the townspeople gathered on a huge staircase overlooking the harbor, the Tsarist troops appeared and marched down the stairs that smashed the crowd. The naval squadron is sent to reseat the potemkin's retakela, but when the ships reach their range, their crews allow the rebels to pass. Eisenstein's non-historically accurate ending is an open-ending so showing that this was the seed of the later Bolshevik Revolution that would bloom in Russia. The film is divided into five parts: Men and Worms, Quarter Drama, Appeal of the Dead, Odessa Steps, and Squadron Meeting. Eisenstein was a revolutionary artist, but at the genius level. Eisenstein did not want to do a historical drama and therefore used a visual texture to give the film a journalistic look, so the viewer feels that he is being tapped in a thrilling and politically revolutionary story. This technique is used by Pontecorvo's Battle of Algiers. Unlike Pontecorvo, Eisenstein relied on typage, or casting non-professionals, who had a striking physical appearance. Extraordinary casting faces are what he remembers from Potemkin. This technique is later used by Frank Capra in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town and Meet John Doe. But in Potemkin, no individual is cast as a hero or heroine. The story is told through a series of scenes that are combined in a special effect known as editing - editing and selecting short segments to achieve the desired effect on the viewer. D.W. Griffith also used photomontage, but nobody did it as well as Eisenstein. <br /> <br /> Artistic shooting of the crew sleeping in the hammocks is complemented by a graceful swing of chains hanging on chains in the kitchen. On the other hand, the confrontation between the crew and their officers is charged with electricity, and the clenched fists of the masses prove their rage to injustice. Eisenstein introduced the technique of showing action and repeating it, but from a slightly different angle to proving intensity. Breaking the plate bearing the words "Give us this day our daily bread" means the beginning of the end. This technique is used last year in Marianske Lazne. Also, when a boat surgeon is thrown over his side, his pince-unknown hangs from rigging. These were the glasses the officer used to control and crawl the worm-infested meat. This succession connects punishment with the corruption of the Imperial era. The best-known sequence in the film, and perhaps in all film history, is Odessa Steps. The wide range of stairs is full of hundreds of accessories. Rapid and dramatic violence is always recommended and not explicit, but the visual images of the death of a few will last forever in the viewer's minds. cleverly stressed by the long menacing shadows of the sun at the top of the stairs. The pace of the sequence is deliberately changing between marching soldiers and several civilians who call for the courage to ask them to stop. Close to a woman's face frozen in terror after being hit by a soldier's sword, he is a direct predecessor of a Bonnie banker in Clyde and gives a lasting impression of the horror of the Tsarist regime. The death of a young mother leads to a baby stroller that descends the stairs in a sequence copied by Hitchcock in a foreign correspondent, Terry Gilliam in Brazil and Brian DePalma in The Untouchables. This sequence is shown repeatedly from different angles, which means that what was probably only a five-second event. not converted. It radiates fire and roars the senseless injustices of the decadent Tsarist regime. His greatest impact was on film students who borrowed and only slightly improved the techniques invented in Russia several generations ago.
