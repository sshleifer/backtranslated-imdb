Many years ago I saw this movie (maybe on TV?) And loved it. So I decided to rent a DVD the next day to see if it was still in my guess. That's what happened. Set in the notorious King's Cross (where prostitution, drug abuse and sex shops thrive), tells the story of "Jimmy" (Heath Ledger). Jimmy is a young man ... maybe a late teens or something who doesn't have a stable family background. He is on the edge of society, and works as a 'tout' for a sex club (encouraging people to enter the store). He realizes the character of the underworld called "Pando", who is the local grand master on the cross. It is Jimmy's hope of finding himself on Panda's radar and getting with him ... in short, upward social mobility, he hopes. One evening Jimmy meets a beautiful young woman Alexa (played by the charming Rose Byrne). You just know that a love story will play between them. On this night as well, Jimmy is first contacted by Pando (played by Bryan Brown). Pando has a job for Jimmy. It's a "foot in the door" Jimmy waited for! To reveal too much more, it would ruin the many surprises this movie offers to the viewer. Stylistically, if you like Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie movies, you should be in line with what to expect ... to spin and turn and black comedy. â€œ. It is not merely the knocking of Tarantino or Ritchie, but a real Australian contribution to the genre. The fascinating aspect of this film is how it all hangs. Sometimes you are familiar with the characters that interest you in what they do to hell. Finally, all these "free ends" are beautifully connected. It's like a celluloid Moebius strip. The highlight of the film is Bryan Brown's Panda character. Pando likes puzzles, and it's fun to see him play games with his buddies. It's just a little detail about him that is so nice ... his taste in music, for starters! Heath Ledger movies I've seen (The Dark Knight, 10 Things I Hate About You) This is perhaps his best role. It was not accepted with "10 things". If you're a Heath Ledger fan (Ledger recently died a tragic death), it's a chance to see him in his biggest Australian role, I think. There is great chemistry between Ledger and Byrne in this film-so, on one level, it works like a nice love story. This movie doesn't have some of the horrors of Tarantino and Ritchie's underworld movies, but it has some adult motifs ... scenes that will surprise you with coolness and beauty. In this sense, it is not an ideal film for very young audiences, but it is not a film that would be thrilled to be gore-hound. Finally, I must say it's great that Australia can do such movies. Usually the kind of movies my home country makes can be uniniviting. This film has strengths where many Australian films have weaknesses ... ie. has a great story, great acting and great script. We need more popular, quality movies like in Australia. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. Other Australian movies I loved include: Breaker Morant (10/10) Mad Max 2 (10/10) My Brilliant Career (not yet reviewed) Proof (nr) The Devil's Playground ( nr) Bad Boy Bubby (no. Great, Dark Comedy) The Dish (nr. Great, Charming Comedy)
