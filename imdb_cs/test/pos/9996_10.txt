This film gives golf high marks, it was well acted and well managed. It gives you a look at the history that some non-sports fans will love. The historical factor itself gives a high rating, the Brookline golf course was really good. I'm in the northeast and I saw Brookline as a fan and someone who loves the game. The film was well done at all levels. MUST SEE 5 stars. Acting was excellent, Disney has another winner in his Big Movies bag. If for some other reason watch a movie that gives hope and encouragement to young people who do not see hope in their lives. I would say the setting, while in the late 1800's and early 1900's it is very realistic. Costumes and dialect were also on the mark. Beyond the obligations for a golf film. A Must see with fans and other fans.
