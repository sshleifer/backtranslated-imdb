If you're like me and you bought a new Tenacious D album the day it came out, and went to the movie to know all the lyrics on all the songs .... then be sure this movie. Yes, I'm impressed as a huge Tenacious D fan, but I really liked this movie, which made me pretty laugh. This film was almost everything I expected. The comedy genius was based on great songs and some great portraits by Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins. I especially enjoyed Tim Robbins' part. But if you don't know the HBO Tenacious D series and the fantastic debut album, then it may not have the same comedic impact on you. I'd still recommend going and watching it because it still costs every penny of the admission price and will make you smile even if you're not in stitches all the time.
