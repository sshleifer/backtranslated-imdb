It's a war drama - WWII, with the French and the Jews and the Germans, but this is some fun, really. Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau wrote a screenplay for his well-received film Bon Voyage (2003). Unlike Bertrand Tavernier, "Safe Behavior" aka "Laissez-passer" (2002), wolf Rub Schubel's "Gloomy Sunday" (1999), or wd Claude Berri's "Lucie Aubrac" (1997), "Bon Voyage" is as a chipper as his name is - c'est la vie (anything) - and for that we have beautiful talented Isabelle Adjani. It is her wonderful performance as a center of attraction (and attention), the cause and effect of all that made the film as fun as it is. To hell, what is another derailment of her plan and expectations - it will worry once more. The backbone of the story revolves around a pair of young enthusiasts: Grégori Derangère as Frédéric and Virginia Ledoyen (from "8 Women" by Francois Ozon) as Camille. The incomparable Gérard Depardieu, the humorous Yvan Attal ("My Wife is an Actress") and the versatile Peter Coyote (juggling with French, English and German here) are some of the star casts. Many characters come and go in this movie plot, and as it is all juggled, it's a handy talent that requires no analysis - Rappeneau is just a genius. The story just follows up on itself, one episode after another, or even overlapping events, but never confusing - that's the pleasure of it all, every detail turns right on the screen and we just pissed it off as tasting the presented French Dessert, literally. There are excitement, trilly, tenderly hesitant moments and tense ominous escapes, all happening in front of our eyes. <br /> <br /> After reading the director's note about the official Bon Voyage site of Sony Pictures Classics' Rappeneau, he hinted that it was his most personal and successful work. The depiction of Bordeaux 1940 from his childhood memories is very close to his heart and he "worked and reworked the script for nearly three years." This film is a work of love all around, cast and crew complementing the director's passion and impressive script of collaborating writers along with director and his son Julien - adaptation efforts by Gilles Marchand, Patrick Modiano and Jérôme Tonnerre. Music by Gabriel Yared (different in tone from his previous movie scores like "The English Patient" or "Talented Mr. Ripley"), which provided a worthy motive to keep the pace and rhythm of the plot going - almost like a nonstop train , reflecting the vivid energy of Viviane's Adjani (though tired), keeping her running as she meets anything that comes, walking head-high with stylish clothes, without looking back, let alone time for regret. Oh, you must not forget the superbly translated, clever subtitles of Ian Burley, who also filmed subtitles for Italian movies: "Bread and Tulips" (2000) aka Pane e tulipani, "The Last Kiss" (2001) ) aka L'ultimo bacio, and Tom Tykwer's "Typower's Sky" (2002). If you find it too light a war relational drama, try Wim Mäx Fäberböck "Aimée and Jaguar" 1999, in German, based on the true story) with brilliant performances by Juliane Köhler as Aimée and Maria Schrader like Jaguar.
