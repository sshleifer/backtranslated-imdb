I love this movie. This was done before the LA punk scene changed to worse. It perfectly preserves the mood and attitudes of that time and place. I feel really happy to have been in the evening while filming four bands in Fleetwood. The only part that doesn't fit well is the Catholic disipline section and their socio-political commentary. I haven't seen too many people at all. The rest of the film shows attitudes that I have witnessed a lot; people who deal with hard lives or swing in the music industry and / or lousy hippies. I don't think I saw a document that captures both the subject and the subject it covers.
