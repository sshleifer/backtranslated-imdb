I watched this movie for Costas Mandylor and Lauren Holly. I loved them together on the fences, so it was healing to see them again. This wasn't the best movie ever made, but it was cute. Very predictable but sometimes thoughtlessly fun movies are just what I need. Desserts were wonderful and I wanted to eat all of them. I loved it when it fell apart. I bet it still tasted good. Costas and Lauren still had the great chemistry they had at Picket Fences, and I fainted when they kissed this movie. <br /> <br /> I won't watch it again, but it was a great fill for one night.
