An example of brilliant filming. An epic story of three major stages of a young boy's life with verbosity and raw fear. Rarely comes a movie that makes me say aloud during most of the track, "This is a really good movie ...." over and over. That's exactly what happened when I watched this movie. I really don't understand how nobody likes it. I was there when I was crying and laughing at the same time, I couldn't control how I felt on the scene. The activity is excellent. Eric Mabius - Why isn't he on all the screens? He was really extraordinary. His seemingly carefree onscreen screen influenced me with deep visceral ways. Thank you. In my opinion, Eric Schaeffer is one of the best filmmakers around and I hope he will continue to address the challenges he faces while trying to give us art in the face of wild commercial filming. <br /> <br />
