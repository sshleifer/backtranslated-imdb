No. I'm not kidding about this. He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave this film positive signs. And who can blame him? This is a charming, positive and somewhat funny Disney movie. Who doesn't love kittens? The music at Ev'rybody wants to be a cat's interference. That makes me want to pinch my fingers or something. Only a few years later, when the Cats Don't Dance came out, I saw a movie that was musically fun. What Aristocats lack in animation and story, it forms in magic. Plus, everything is moving at a relaxed pace, and even the villain isn't so scary. It is ideal for a younger ensemble without being so happy that adults do not like it. If Snoop were here, he would have said the same thing. Yeah. Kick those CRAZY cats, man.
