Or if you saw the "Evil Dead" trilogy and / or "Bubba Ho-Tep" then you should know that his films are total farce. With "Man with Screaming Brain" he returns. In this case, American businessman William Cole is visiting Bulgaria - when do we ever see each other? - when a woman kills him. The strange scientist Ivan Ivanov (Stacy Keach) replaces half of Cole's brain with the brain of a former KGB agent and lets him act as Steve Martin in "All Me". Yes, the whole movie is pretty much an excuse for pure nonsense. Much of the real humor comes from Sam Raimi's "Evil Dead" as Ivanov's almost brain dead assistant, Paul. Both men have a relationship more like Laurel and Hardy or Gilligan and Captain. So just understand that this is a totally stupid movie and you won't be a bit disappointed. Anyway, I liked it.
