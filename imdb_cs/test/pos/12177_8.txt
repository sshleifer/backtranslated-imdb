Aaliyah throws out all the female cast members from the water, including the official interest in the love of Marguerite Moreau. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see this movie play as Akasha Power Trip. Aaliyah is simply electrifying whenever he is on the screen. She makes sensual, beautiful and menacing for strength 10. Watching the bar full of vampires is a glance at the sight. Lena Olin is cast in the ungrateful role of "older woman", which is very unfounded. It looks fantastic and at 46 (by IMDb) it still looks stunning. The story unfortunately is a very limited plot, we've seen it all before, etc. <br /> <br /> The most heartbreaking is Akasha's death scene, especially considering what happened to Aaliyah after shooting. All in all, a remarkable vampire movie.
