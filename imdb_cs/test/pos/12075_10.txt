This film is based on the real story of Iowa Lucille Fray, a housekeeper who received breast cancer after the birth of her 10th child. She realized that the state would take the children from her inefficient, alcoholic husband, and spent the last year of her life traveling around the country to find new homes for each of the children. A great scenario that still lasts 20 years after it was first made. Adult children, many of whom have not seen each other since their mother died in the late 1950s, gathered for "It's Unbelievable" before the film aired in 1983. series, but during her adoption speech, she went out of her way to only Ann-Margret for her physical performance.
