The proud and defiantly working Perry porter (Mr. B. Cribbins) is ultimately superior to the upper middle class family on their luck. Father (Mr. Cuthbertson) imprisoned for treason - for which there was a death sentence these days - to be forgotten), mother (very beautiful Miss D.Sheridan) brave and resourceful, loyal and loving, and - mainly - older daughter Agutter shivered at the height of adolescence - hurt and confused about her father's fate. Mr. Perks, like many people working in his day, will have nothing to do with anything he regards as "charity," and that is the key moment in the film when he finally accepts that the gifts given to him by the children do. its principles. Although beautiful Miss Agutter has won all the honors, it is Mr. Cribbins and Miss Sheridan, whose performance is dominated by "Rail Kids". They both know how Edwardian society works from opposite ends of the spectrum, but among them is unspoken mutual respect and understanding. . But that's basically a family movie. At a time when a mother can kidnap her own daughter and hold her to buy and be considered "socially awkward" rather than unable to live in a decent society, and when two "human beings" can beat and kick a child to death without being accused of Murder, "Family" can be seen as an old-fashioned, elitist, racist even homophobic concept, but a century ago it was a glue that held society together at all levels. â€œMiss Sheridan's families are archetypal for this age. Strong and loving, stick together against external influences, unitary units with moral certainty ridiculed in the 21st century. It seems that Mr. Lionel Jeffries is thinking about being a boring, disciplinary political fate, in a joyful hymn of hope, faith, optimism and courage. That all these attributes were once considered a norm and are too often subject to contempt and cynicism is a reflection of our society and not of Miss Nesbit. No one with more than a passing interest in the human condition can be greatly shifted by this quite perfect film.
