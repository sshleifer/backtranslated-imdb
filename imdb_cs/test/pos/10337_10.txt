When I was in grade 7 (in 1977), I was asked to read a novel that was based on my English studies. I remember being very touched and excited when she released a TV version one year later. Kristy McNichol was a popular TV actress when this film was made and she was already playing a daughter in a dysfunctional family. on hit TV series "Family". It was clear that she had the scope and ability to withdraw from this section. I remember sometimes being a little "stiff", but despite all this, she does a good job. The film carries well. Esther Rolle is fantastic as a home that seems to be the only one who really cares about her. Barbara Barrie as a somewhat frightened and slightly neurotic mother is also good, as is the young Robin Lively (who would eventually appear as Lana Milford's black widow in "Twin Peaks") as a sweet younger sister who seems to be the focus of her parents. affection. Bruce Davidson is also as appealing as the German title soldier. <br /> <br /> However, best performance belongs to Michael Constantin. She is really powerful and deserves more recognition than she was at the time. The bitterness and coldness it expresses make scenes that seem difficult to watch, but it is much easier to understand the silent despair of the rejected daughter. Constantine gives all the right intensity and seems to understand the basic psychological motivations well. The film differs from the book in only a few ways. It's amazing and inspiring to watch, and hope to be released again on video or DVD. <br /> <br />
