Who is this man ~~~ what do I hear? Loud scream of Kevin? Well, if you haven't yelled at "the usual suspect," I'd recommend you change your prescription medicine. Anyway, it's not a first-class movie, just a very well-created story that's almost believable. Considering his stranger, you probably ask what it is? Everything is the best and also the first I saw a balanced, sarcastic Alien. Just fun is all I can say and almost for the whole family (if not for the scene later in the movie). SEVEN STARS
