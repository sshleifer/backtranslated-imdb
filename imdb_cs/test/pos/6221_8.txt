All Risto Jarvy's films are worth seeing. Some like "Jäniksen vuosi" and "Loma" are the best films in their genre and have achieved classic status in Finnish cinema. <br /> <br /> Most people have made the impression of Antti Litja through Jarvy's films. Litja has played a leading role in three of Jarv's films, which have become pits and movie reviews. It's nice to see that the idea of ​​"Jäniksen Vuosi" still lives in commercials (I think it was Sonera TV's tele-operator, where Litja went in the mountains in Lapland with a hare in her arms, Everibody, who saw the movie knows what I'm talking about ..) "Jäniksen Vuosi" It's a beautiful movie with great actors and good filming locations - like the famous little town in Lappland, Sodankylä, where the best film festival in the world takes place - Midnight Sun Film Festival. I recommend everyone to go there in June - but remember warm clothes and raincoat :)
