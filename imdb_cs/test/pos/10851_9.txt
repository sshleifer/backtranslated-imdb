A young woman leaves her country life for a new one in town and meets another woman she falls in love with. Their relationship is changing rapidly, and they both think they are soul-related until one day a provincial girl returns home to find a man in bed. Her lover then tells her that their relationship was just an experiment and she really likes men. Um, something like Anne Heche and Ellen Degeneres. Similarly, a provincial girl, broken, torn and broken by this discovery, emerges and begins to discover what the real world is all about, when it falls into the hands of all kinds of vengeful and wild men in 19th century England.
