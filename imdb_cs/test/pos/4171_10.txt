Wow. We watched this movie in the hope that it would have some decent climbing scenes. We were disappointed there, but it was still a great movie! It was soooo cheesy, it was great! I didn't smile in the movie for a long time. If you're in mountaineering, and you like cheese films, then this is absolutely for you!
