When I first looked at the trailer, I had to decide whether this series would be perfect for my collection. But after I heard about it, I decided to buy. When I bought the whole collection in the box, it was absolutely what I wanted to see. It was very funny and the characters were pretty cool. Popular characters in the show are: Marion, Carrots, Haze Knights, Big Momma and Dotta. I also liked the opening and ending thematic songs. The show also has some great voice talents from Tiffany Grant, Jason Douglas, and others. But this show is one of the biggest. So if you want to see something cool. Then this show is the only one.
