Not really sure what to do from this movie. very strange, very artsy. not the type of movie you are watching because it has a convincing chart or characters. more like the kind of movie you can't stop watching for the terribly fascinating things that happen on the screen. Although my wife had observed it for the first time, she couldn't handle it ... too worrying. running a little long, but still worth it for those who are interested in very dark movies.
