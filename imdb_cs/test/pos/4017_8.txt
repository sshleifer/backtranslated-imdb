The film is based on Jules Verne's book, which I read once, about ten years ago. I remember that I liked the book very much and this film has a good reputation in telling the story. The most important thing in this movie is not the story, but the very original visual appearance it has. The visuals are absolutely beautiful and apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors, stop-motion animation and sets that are painted to look like an animated movie. Combined with Jules Verne's own unique versions of Jules Verne's airplanes and submarines and a good director Karel Zeman, a very well-executed and convincing visual style is created that can effectively maintain attention until the end of the film. Some problems also, one of the underwater scenes at the end takes perhaps unnecessarily a lot of time for example, as the story in the first part of the movie is rushed quite quickly. But none of these matters is very much because the film is always very enjoyable. A gem that deserves to be well known for today's audience. Recommended film for the whole family.
