When I first saw the Premiere Episode of Farscape, I had no idea what to expect. I was extremely impressed and satisfied with "Premiere". Subsequent shows, however, caused me many shortcomings, which I initially lacked. "Premiere" is not a great Farscape episode, but it deserves credit for the successful and effective setting of the plot and for providing basic back stories to many ordinary characters. The episode begins with John Crichton (Ben Browder), an astronaut and scientist preparing to launch into space in the Farscape Module, a small spaceship Crichton and his friend DK have perfected. Crichton has a revealing conversation with his father, Jack Crichton, and then begins his space trial. Of course, everything goes wrong and Crichton is "shot through a wormhole" and returns to the "distant part of the galaxy." After leaving the wormhole, the Crichton module is pulled aboard the ship's living space. From there, the characters and storyline for Farscape series are presented in a fun, though rushed way. Regular characters are properly introduced during the first half of the episode. Of course Crichton is there, Ben Browder played well. It will offer the audience a sympathetic character with which it identifies. He's lost and has no idea how to do anything. In Premiere, Crichton has to choose between joining prisoners or peacekeepers. He knows nothing about any party, but with the help of Aeryn (captured pilot of the Peacekeeper) it is clear that he intends to help the peacekeepers. He would probably not end up with the prisoners if it wasn't for Crais, Captain Peacekeeper, who would call Crichton the killer of his brother. This gives Crichton an interesting situation: stuck in bizarre, violent, fugitive prisoners in a distant galaxy that he knows nothing about. Crichton's utter lack of knowledge of Farsape makes him a particularly interesting protagonist in Farscape's first season. <br /> <br /> The support cast is just as convincing. There's Zhaan, a blue delvian and a former prisoner. She is calm and sensible, unlike the co-founder of Ka D'Argo, a powerful and hard fighter. Virginia Hey is completely covered with blue make-up, allowing her to make Zhaan's character cool and convincing. D'Argo Mega Makeup, on the other hand, is lower than par. He looks a little silly with his giant tentacles and a strange nose and something special about his eyes. They seem to have an allergic reaction to his makeup. Farscape would make some improvements to his makeup in Season 1, but the overall costume would at least remain a problem for me until Season 2. The puppet / digital characters Rygl and Pilot are, simply put, excellent. Rygel is a small Hynerian Dominar who floats on some hovercraft. In "Premiere" he is given a good dialogue, but nothing else. The pilot almost stole the show as a link between the live ship, Moya and Moya's passengers. Even in the first episode, Pilot issues the appearance of being a real, alien alien; never appearing in a show to be a giant, expensive machine. Peacekeeper characters are also interesting. Peacekeepers are made up of a race called Sebaceans, who look like humans. The main antagonist is introduced in "Premiere" as Captian Crais, who believes Crichton killed his brother. In fact, Crais's brother's death was just an accident resulting from a collision with Crichton's ship. Aeryn Sun, a pilot who helps Crichton escape, tries to explain that death was an accident, but Crais just claims to be "irreversibly contaminated" and refused to change her mind. Crais's obsession for revenge, justified or not (it should be clear Crais that Crichton is not responsible) is mysterious in "Premiere" but will be explained later in the season. Aeryn itself provides an extremely interesting character. By being forced to leave the peacekeepers, she changes her whole way of life and is in a similar (albeit less serious) situation as Crichton in this regard. The real episode, as mentioned earlier, feels somewhat rushed and clumsy. So much is happening that not enough time is devoted to anything. Also, D'Argo (for now) looks like a stupid run in his average costume, trying to look menacing. Still, "Premiere" is a solid pastime. Special effects (like star sequences) are impressive. Most of the costumes and sets aboard Moya are original. Despite its shortcomings, "Premiere" is a must-see for Farscape fans. 3/4
