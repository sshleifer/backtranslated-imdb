Back in the 70s, a small-time Texas filmmaker named S.F. Brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent low-budget driving horrors that have evolved over the years into a small cult following. Before I missed my first movie, Don't Look Into the Basement, I wasn't too sure what to expect, but I'm sure the hell didn't expect it to be the only horror of Texas I thought was better than a chainsaw Massacre. I don't know, this could actually be my favorite horror movie. Initially, it seems to be a place where one can get mentally healthy, because all the patients can move freely and not as if it were their house (I think it is). none of them seem so dangerous, just vicious. The inhabitants include love-nympho, a 700-year-old woman, man-child, spaz, a guy who thinks he's at war, a woman who thinks she has a baby, and a guy who thinks he's a judge. One day, out of the blue, the judge kills a doctor with an ax, shortly afterwards, a mother who wants to be a child will kill her sister. Ten minutes to the movie and things look really ugly. Maybe the new nurse will know what to do, then again, maybe not. Surrender more would cause more harm than good. It is best to immerse your head in this first if possible. If you can appreciate sincere to God, untamed horror, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> If you like Scream, if you like Wrong Turn, if you go for that, unoriginal, over-produced, over-scored digital Hollywood garbage, then chances are high that you just wont see it beauty in this one. Don't look at the Basement because the first attempt makes the quality shocking. The atmosphere and grain fit into place and score like a glove. Unfortunately, good ol 'S.F. He used most of his good ideas for his first film, although the next record in his Texas-sized quadrilogy is somewhat of a masterpiece, that is, if you're in an extra slim, middle-minded, Hixploitation like someone I know. If you fall in love with Brownrigg's first two, and absolutely have to figure out what else he has to offer, look at Do not open the door and House where hell froze. Don't Look Into the Basement has everything that successful horror needs need, no stars, no budget, no digital effects, just an original story that revived in a crazy asylum procedure, with a dozen cast members, and a dark, fine score and, of course, twist. This is a real horror for a real horror fan. 10/10
