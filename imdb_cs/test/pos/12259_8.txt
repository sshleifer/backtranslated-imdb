Spunky journalist Holly Hunter produces investigation reports for the major news network. It is a maverick engine, brilliantly good at its work and little time for romantic relationships. Enter William Hurt and Albert Brooks, two men who compete for her love. Brooks is an old school journalist who loves Holly because he is good at journalism. They both believe that the media exist to test the gods, educate the public, and fight for the truth. The children of the sixties represent the values ​​of hippies. They are defenders of the public good. Knights fighting bravely with a pen and camera. William Hurt, on the other hand, is a much more complex character. Initially, he was clumsy, clumsy and self-destructive, gradually revealing that he was a sexy and manipulative tall man who was led to climb the corporate ladder. Unlike Holly and Brooks, it is a symbol of modern media values: news as a spectacle, journalism as entertainment, news anchored like celebrities, truths subject to editing board. We want to despise him and his joking journalism, but we just can't handle it. He plays the game according to his own rules. Do we condemn him for missing the moral backbone? Do we condemn the game? Can the game exist if its rules are violated? How did these rules evolve? This is not Lumet's and Chayefsky's "network", so the film never bothered to answer these questions. Content retaining things at the light comedy level, it ends up Hurt being promoted to the London Division and Brooks are introduced into a small community network. Holly, when she refused both men, remains caught between them. The last bastion of media integrity, this spunky reporter remembers her roots, mourns the loss of Brooks and warns he's on guard for future William Hurts. It's a cute ending, but compared to the "Network" movie it seems to be positive. "The Chayefsky vision is one in which global media, despite ubiquity, offer less meaningful information. It assumes a world in which globalization has homogenized cultures, information has become subject to corporatization, and a handful of media monopolies have dominated all international news: it is a world in which truth is subject to shareholder meetings and economic interests. Perhaps this is why "Broadcast News", which yearns for journalistic days, ends on such a bitter note. It knows what the future is. Today, however, things are even worse in the digital age: mergers and acquisitions have left a very small number of masses in the communications environment This resulted in hyper-commercial content, a barrier between the creative / editorial side and the commercial side, but everything collapsed. Today, everyone can start their own blog or website, but it is essential. As the communication reach of individuals increases (thanks to technological advances - e-mail, internet, electricity, air mail, etc.), the size of the individual's world is also increasing. He must project his voice further and louder, vainly struggling with deafening white noise, a constant verbal static signal that is a global community. According to democratic theory, you ultimately need two things. First, you need a strict arrival of people in power and people who want to be in power, both in the private and public sectors. Second, you need a wide range of informed opinions on all the important issues of the day. The media system as a whole should produce this kind of culture in a democratic society. Unfortunately, the structure we currently have in the global system directly counteracts the needs of democratic journalism and democratic society. <br /> <br /> 8/10 ?? This is an easy thing, but a funny script, some funny moments, and a short portrait of Jack Nicholson, who elevates him to most other journalism films. Interestingly, unlike most media films, he never falls into satire and instead plays things like a straight love triangle. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
