This BBC series is incredibly good fun. I only saw a few minutes before I knew I had to own it and watch it again with all my friends. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone cautious, but almost everyone else will enjoy it - from the snob cinema to the masses of hungry fun. The leading character is a lesbian, but it's still worth watching if it's not your thing. Rachael Stirling is incredible in the lead role that pulls her into a dazzling range of emotions and situations, some of which are bizarre. Nature. Nobody who would see this series would ever say he couldn't act. It makes us laugh, weeping, turning on and slapping our foreheads in amazement. You cannot compare this story with anything else. It's not a rehash style or conspiracy. It is a totally custom comedy, historical drama, eroticism, story of arrival, musical and more. I must commend the BBC for doing this story. I can't imagine anyone in (too cautious and formal) the US doing it. So stop reading about it and go buy it.
