Great show! The reality of the television show's reality is that it will close the generational gaps. The contestants move in age, some look old enough to watch the movie when it first appeared. And others, they looked so young, that parents or teachers gave a film hoping to touch their lives as they once touched them. Grease has actually become an American icon. Grease is a fun and fun movie in which young and old can relate. "You are the one we want" is sure to get even more follower smiles. The only thing I wanted was more than the history of the characters, then it's a little nice to leave some of them on the nostalgic imagination of the fifties. She can't wait to see more shows ... and then on Broadway !!!
