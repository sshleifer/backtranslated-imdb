The gripping ambitious cartoonist Hoops McCann (John Cusack's exquisitely engaging performance) and his best friend George (deliciously dead Joel Murray) go to Nantucket for the summer after high school. Hoops, George, and a few of the newly found friends come to help Cassandra (Demi Moore at her most beautiful), the singer who is a detached house is threatened by the demolition of the greedy clan Beckersted. Savage writer / director Steve Holland often offers a hilariously crazy and gloomy nonstop barriers with undoubtedly wide and stupid but still very funny jokes. The insane madness of madness has a giddy dizziness, a good-natured and infectiously inanal vitality that is either impossible or not to resist. In addition, the lively and enthusiastic acting performance of the cast of the subtle game adds immensely to the zany merriment: Bobcat Goldthwait as the spastic Egg Stork, Tom Villard as his goofy brother Clay, Curtis Armstrong as the sweet Ack Raymond, Mark Metcalf as the evil rich blockbuster Aquilla Beckersted Matt Mulhern as an average Teddy, Kimberly Foster as a charming Cookie, Joe Flaherty as a gung-ho General Raymond, William Hickey as a rough Old Man Beckersted, Jeremy Piven as a smug preppy Tyrant and John Matuszak as a mighty biker Stan. Isidor Mankofsky's quiet cinema, the brilliant soundtrack, Cory Lerios 'cool rockin' score and funky animations are all unmatched. The only fun scene: Eggs in a Godzilla suit terrorizing a luxury dinner. Absolute hooves.
