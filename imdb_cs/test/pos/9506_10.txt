As other reviews have said, there are a few missing videos from this collection, but what's on this drive is amazing. There are two separate audio tracks, an original recording and a brand new version of the new version. Any new music from Resident is welcome and I suppose that the new audience will enjoy the new version, but I prefer original recordings (probably because they are "originals". Amazing, new and old videos are interesting, with the most interesting video featuring live video shows From what is being offered (although the passages of live recordings hidden as Easter eggs are very welcome), this is not a tenant, it is your own collection.
