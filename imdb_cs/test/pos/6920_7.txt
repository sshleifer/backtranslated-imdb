This movie is about fun. Imagine your friends with whom you love to spend time, with those you know are becoming a little stupid and maybe you take a character or two. That's the movie. Inventive scenario and brilliantly executed. It's not about the pleasures of the masses, it's about having fun with a bunch of brilliantly talented people. What I'm sure everyone thought when they joined him. The above review sounds totally unfair and I think the one who wrote it was in the wrong spirit to watch the movie. There is great dignity in it if you care about it. Good work, I think it was a great movie. I'd watch it before the norm in North America. <br /> <br /> In short, it's not the best movie you've ever seen, but it has a lot of moments. I haven't laughed so long.
