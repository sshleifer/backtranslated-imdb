OK, that's what Pulp Fiction owes, but in my opinion, it has its own voice and identity, mainly due to the style of music, video style, story-like story, and great performance. Thomas Jane adds a great (drug-dealer show-down is extraordinary), Aaron Eckhart alike. James LeGros has a short and sparkling look - great humor - "got the Wong House". Porzik's interrogation and rape scene is unforgettable, as is Mickey Rourke's appearance - "take it to the top". Great Hollywood pop-B-production with strong A renegades (Rourke) performance. Well, take the top, it's worth it.
