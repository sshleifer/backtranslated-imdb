That was a really tense and dark episode. Superbly executed, wonderful acting and atmospheric direction, 'Ice' is one of my favorite episodes. Along with 'Pusher' 'Grotesque' 'Wetwired' and 'Home' (in my case they are pretty good in the dark atmosphere) It seems quite realistic to them, their paranoia, their suspicion and their increasing anger has been perfectly accomplished by great actors. However, 'Ice' had a problem that I got after a few watches: it was too short! I wanted more! <br /> <br /> Overall, 'ice' had what 98% of all X files episodes have: Outstanding Acting, Intense Story-Writing, Bold Overhead. All work. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
