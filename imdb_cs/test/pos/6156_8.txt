Surprisingly beautiful movie. Beautifully designed, beautifully directed, beautifully played, beautifully played and most beautifully photographed ..... the camera is nothing less than beautiful. It is a war film, but it is an epic in its scope and combines romance, tragedy and comedy into a story that is as terrifying as provocative.
