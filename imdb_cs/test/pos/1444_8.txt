Lots of scenes and dialogs are exploding, but when you add it all, everyday machine cycle from depressive overcrowding to depressing bar to thickened burlesque room to thickened poker games filled with smoke and back home, you get a strange sense that someone is trying somewhere to give a true picture of the drug addict's life around 1955. Whether it is Sinatra, who would obviously come across this type of character growing up in Hoboken and worked in numerous groups, or Preminger who uses the soundtrack and subtext of Frankie-Zosch to slip the inner view of the addict around the Hays Code cage, you get a good backing piece on the waterfront that was shot almost exactly at the same time. Some faux-realistic work that lets you realistically think how deep the American culture is in drug culture.
