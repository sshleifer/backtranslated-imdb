I first saw this film in Papua New Guinea in 1967 and I remembered it because I have never seen it since the first time. How easy can the lives of good people be destroyed by the pure evil that existed then and still is memory that will haunt me forever. The film is entertaining and extremely sad at the same time, and the role played by Anthony Quinn is excellent. This film should be in all college studies about human inhumanity towards man.
