Man! I remember this nostalgia show ... I really dug Bravestarra because he wasn't a conventional hero. He was more than a futuristic Texas cowboy. The man had the power of a bear, seeing walking and agility ... I can't remember it. <br /> <br /> Action sequences were great! I remember Bravestarr would always use his bazooka named SARAJUANA (translated into Spanish) whenever he was in big trouble. This was a quality action cartoon. I loved characters, dialogues, music and, of course, introductory credits! Bravestarr! long to live with him. The iconic classic in my opinion and must see.
