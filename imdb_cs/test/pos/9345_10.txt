"Thriller" is brilliant. It's a long video, but just brilliant. The song itself is ... great ... add Michael JAckson to dance and have a golden phenomenon. Of all the videos I've ever seen, it's the best. If you haven't seen the video, then I'm challenging you ... <br /> <br /> Special effects are amazing because it's time ... everything from transforming the wearer to the idea that these scary zombies are slowly increasing their graves are spectacular. .. spookyly spectacular. Vicent Price has his segment of trembling bone lines ... known simply as "rap" Ola Ray does well as Michael's girl and Michael JAckson himself ... dancing and singing (though not during the video itself) is incomparable ... /> <br /> 10/10.
