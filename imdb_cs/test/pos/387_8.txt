Though some unrealistic things happen at the end (ie a policeman firing a gun in a crowded carousel where many innocent people could be killed), it was still an intense, fun thriller, one of Alfred Hitchcock's better films. Robert Walker is great as a cooling case, really convincing, which sometimes adds fascinating performance. His teammate, Farley Granger, is fine, but there is no match for Walker, either in acting or in the characters they play. It's a typical Hitchcock film with some strange camera angles, immoral themes, innocent people in trouble, etc. Unlike many of his other movies, I thought this was a fast moving story with very little boring places. Being an ex-tennis player, I enjoyed his footage of some great old net matches that featured several good rallies. Hitchcock's real daughter Patricia has an interesting and unique role here. She didn't get a job just for her father; can act. Also note: The DVD has both British and American versions and there have been some differences in the story. It is a classic film that is still mentioned in modern films, even comedies such as "Throw Momma Off The Train".
