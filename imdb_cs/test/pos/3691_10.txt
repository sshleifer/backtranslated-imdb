What a pity that this movie was never released. (It is now playing on the cable.) I tune in based on my high respect for the stars and was rewarded by seeing the film much better than the ones I paid to see in theaters lately. I'd like to be surprised. So often films are sold as "offbeat", but are in fact more the same old recycled drivel. This movie is really different, with a pleasing news bonus. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel. Although a conspiracy is required to sing some of the most Moorish sentimental songs that have ever been written, it makes them so good. Cathy Bates and Rupert Everett are great and great, but Cathy Bates, the mother-in-law, steals every scene she is in. Give this movie a chance.
