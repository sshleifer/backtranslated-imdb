He just saw 'The League of Gentlemen: Apocalypse' at a special show in Manchester, with Mark Gatiss and Reece Shearsmith League participating. On the back, Peter Kay (who has a short portrait in the movie) lovingly shouted back during the Q&A session after the movie. The film was complicated (in a good sense) and very funny. This is followed by Geoff Tipps, Hilary Briss and Herr Lipp as they try and save the fictional Rosyton Vasey from their creators' disinterest. The league plays a wide range of their characters and themselves (or characters based on themselves) and is strongly supported by the cream of British actors and actors such as Bernard Hill, Victoria Wood and David Warner. Warner is special to stand out reminiscent of its smooth and cutting turn in time bandits'. The movie floats in and out of various realities and allows some of the denizen Rosyton Vasey some space to grow beyond their usual limits of their shtick comedy. Herr Lipp Steve Pemberton has a brilliant Bretchian moment at the end of the film and has to decide on his meaning and sense of life, which brings an unexpected moment to his throat and surprises you with a gentle affection for characters. This reflects something Mark and Reece said in Q&A after that the league's story is tired of their famous characters being fake and that the whole movie is really a love letter to them. <br /> <br /> For a format that started out as a radio character- Based on this sketch, these guys have really developed to keep the film that takes you on the path of fiction, "reality", comedy, tragedy and a pleasant journey for two less obvious characters who have a long form. The story of their 70 strange existing creations. The fans of the show will love her. It is worth paying attention to the details in the grooves, the uninitiated may be a bit lost, but the joy of LoG has always been the ability to almost instantly tune its acutely observed characters and take a stylistic leap into farce and expressionist film honors. There are lots of homosexuals in this section, including The Shining and La Belle et la Bete. 1690 is England that makes perfect sense when dealing with film. What I can say, I was amazed, confused, emotional and twitched all over and have definitely pulled out of what many have failed. A successful British television comedy to translate cinema. <br /> <br /> If you have watched and enjoyed the League of Lords in the past, look at it; you will enjoy. <br /> <br /> If you do not, rent a DVD and then check it out. Well done guys and thanks for the charming and funny Q&A.
