Man, I really enjoyed it when I was just writing for Fred Willard's commentary. There are some dead spots and some gags that don't work, but overall the movie works very well. When I was younger, my parents bred dogs, and the people I met at these shows were no less bizarre that they were surprised at this show that I can assure you. I enjoyed this film for my art and for commenting on how we tend to take frivolous things too seriously ... I liked acting for its accuracy (most accents were flawless) and its subtlety (I loved how each person walked with his dogs) ... <br /> <br /> Rent this movie if you have any appreciation for the strangeness of human existence.
