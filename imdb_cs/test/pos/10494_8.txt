I have to admit that when I first started watching this movie, I had no idea what was going on. The beginning was a little confusing for me. However, it did not reduce my enjoyment of the film. The characters reveal that they are more complex than they may appear, and that's what makes this unforgettable movie. At first I heard it was a real "Hollywood" movie. Although apparently lacking the stereotypical element of "guns and fists", the compelling performances of talented actors such as Martin Sheen and Sam Neill make it more than just think. I'd rather see a movie with more content than filming.
