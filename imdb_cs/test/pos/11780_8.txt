Finished for a replacement budget change of twenty bucks tops, this lowie thirteen minutes shortly cheerfully parodies the legendary George Lucas '77 science fiction blockbuster "Star Wars" in the most infectiously stupid way you can imagine. Writer / director Ernie Fosselius brings a triumphant and often bustling mix of ridiculous sound effects, unnoticed staged action scenes, crisp (far from) special effects (you just have to love cheap scratched lasers, asteroids and a home-made home). appliances ... eer, I mean spacecraft that move around obvious wires), badly dubbed in dialogue, shamelessly hammy playing, and Richard Wagner is an exciting piece of classic Ride of Valkyries. Characters are presented in suitably wide strokes; My favorite are the fluffy werewolf Fluke Starbucker, the venerable Jedi Knight Auggie "Ben" Doggie, and the hateful arch of villain Darph Nader (who spews nothing but the incomprehensible babble). In addition, 4-Q-3 is clearly based on Tin Man from "The Wizard of Oz," while Artie Deco is definitely a cheap vacuum cleaner. The true masterpiece of this film casts the legendary voice actor Paul Paul as the narrator; Delicate deliciously rich and marble tones of horror add immensely to the great stupid, yet rich, cheerful tongue (the selection lines: "You will laugh! You will cry! You will kiss three grandmothers goodbye!"). Full hoot.
