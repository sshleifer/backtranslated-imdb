This definitely the most tension filled the X-Files episode of the first season. This episode is what I think when I hear "X-Files". the land is simple but ends. Our main cast and several scientists went on exploration of the Alskan base in which the research team seems to have been killed. It turned out that a small parasite dug out of the ice had infected the research team. The parasite connects to the brain and causes paranoia and madness. Soon, no one can tell who they can trust or who is infected or not. This episode was a direct tribute to John Carpenters' great horror movie "THING". Thing takes place in Antarctica and a team of scientists finds a destroyed base in which they were killed or killed. The alien, who was buried on ice for 10,000 years, was warmed up. He has the ability to imitate any form of life. therefore, the main characters can no longer make clear enemies' friends. Believe me THING is one of the most serious horror movies you've ever seen. If you liked the ICE episode, I suggest you see it. Or if you've only seen what I recommend to see ICE. ICE is the best direct tribute / honor to John Carpenter I have ever seen and lives as an inspiration as one. The Best X-Files Episodes. I give him 10/10.
