A touching love story reminiscent of "In the mood for love". The story focuses on Chinese poetry and how Eastern people use it to communicate with each other, and therefore focuses on a teacher who wants to be a model teacher as well as a good husband and father. A senior student is very attracted to him. As the story unfolds, we see emotions below the surface in his 20-year marriage and how he faces the moral dilemmas he faces. A beautiful and moving story.
