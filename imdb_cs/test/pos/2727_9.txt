Mrs. Aparna Sen, the creator of Mr. and Mrs. Iyer, directs this film about the young girl's efforts to cope with her debilitating condition. Meethi (Konkona Sen) has been a secluded child since childhood. they showed signs of deception, no one knows why. However, a constant tendency is out of control when a work assignment takes her to neighboring Bihar, where she is raped by some political goons. The resulting trauma also leads to episodes of manic-depressive psychosis alongside her schizophrenia. She has been taking control over the years, getting worse and sinking deeper into her private world. By comparing the "unsatisfied" (divorced) older sister and how her aboriginal ways already make the bad situation worse, she indicates what the fine line is between the abnormal and the * seemingly normal *. Ms. Senova also makes excellent comments on the social alienation of these people. Social Rehabilitation is a standard therapy along with all deadly mind-changing drugs. But what about the poor and the poor who are always left to take care of themselves and usually fall on the sidelines? The Romantic Link Between Dr. Kunal and Anu were not necessary. Also a caf√© scene where Dr. Kunal explains Anu, how real their world is for them, was superfluous. Anu must know that. English dialogue is sometimes a bit uncomfortable, even though it compensates for acting. Konkona and Shabana prove that their reputation is worth it. Waheeda, Rahul and Shefali play their limited roles very well. Extensive research seems to have been done about this disease, its very obvious. But it is not clear whether MDP can coexist with schizophrenia in the same patient, side by side. Also in the early stage of Dr. Kunal recommends ECT (shock therapy), while abolishing the fact that it does not work for schizophrenics, only for extreme MDP with suicidal tendencies and other forms of bipolar disorder. The end of the remarkable story suggests an unknown solution (perhaps no solution). The film could end up in a nicer remark, because the world's mentally ill can and do lead balanced and fertile, if not very fulfilling, lives under good medical care. However, his excellent film made with extreme subject sensitivity. HATS OFF for Mrs. Sen! No one in India could do better.
