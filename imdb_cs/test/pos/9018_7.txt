It's pretty good, considering everything. Necessity for anyone who is wrong about the opposite sex (ie All of Us!). The trailer says nothing of the FOR GOOD REASON conspiracy. The assumption is absurd, so it's nice to see that he doesn't take it seriously. It's like someone from the BBC's children's ward decided to make an adult movie. This is not a bad thing for the IMO. <br/> 7/10
