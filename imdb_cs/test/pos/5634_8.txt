What gives this film to his personality is finally the realization that it is true. Although this is a convincing and humorous documentary that borders on mockumentary in some parts (is it staged or is it really going humorous?), It seems to be a little close. The movie is funny in the places it needs and flows relatively well. Reminiscent of Christopher Guest's films, if you liked them or Adaptations, I suggest you keep an eye on this. <br /> <br /> B +
