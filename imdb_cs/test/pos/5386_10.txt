I saw "Heaven-Ship" ("Himmelskibet") at Cinema Muto 2006 in Sacile, Italy. What a great movie! This Danish steampunk saga is the agile story of the first trip to Mars, at a time when wireless telegraphy has not been improved. The spacecraft has no radio and the heroes are brought back from the landing area through the horse carriage. Even the headlines are beautiful ... some of them are written in rhymed pairs in the original Danish language. Actors act as ridiculous, largely practical history. But the sets are overwhelming, easily overcome what Georges Melies did ten years ago (or ten years later in "Die Frau im Mond"). Of course, the plot is simplistic. The spacecraft crew consists of seven thin boys and one fat pet. Guess which one will burst. Interestingly, everyone in this film (except dubious Professor Dubio) fervently believes in God. Even the Martians. The screenwriters really feel that they realize that the journey to Mars is not a breeze: the title cards prove that scientists need two years to build their spacecraft (which has a crew of aircraft). ) and six months to Mars. During the construction sequence, there is one extremely impressive arrangement that must be choreographed: dozens of workers go through the workplace in different directions, without hesitation and without collisions. Danish scientists baptized their ship "Excelsior" ("packaging materials"?) And set the course for Mars, although the Moon and Venus are closer. When a ship (which flies horizontally, not vertically) lands on Mars, "Marsboerne" - Martians - are welcomed to be Nordic blondes, all highly developed pacifists and vegetarians. (As a highly developed eater I hated the part.) <br /> <br /> It turns out that Mars has an atmosphere just like Earth, just like the same gravity. In the outer image of the Martian landscape, the apparent size of the Sun as seen from Mars is the same as seen from Earth. I also couldn't help seeing that all the wise elder Martians were men. In fact, older women on the ground are thin: a hero born in the Earth and a Martian girl are without a mother. The Martians speak a universal language, wear clothes and welcome Earth visitors with a Earth Globe ... which, of course, keeps its North Pole up. The Martian girl is Marya, played by an ethereally beautiful Danish actress. (Waiter, I'll have some of that Danish!) We see a Martian chastity dance that could be twee or ridiculous, but in fact it's quite touching and beautiful. Also, the Martian funeral scene is one shot that reminded me of the succession in the "Seventh Seal." I wonder if Ingmar Bergman saw this movie. "Himmelskibet" has several drawbacks, but its manufacturing design and other advantages far outweigh its drawbacks. Ole Olsen who is named in credits (and who appears in a short prologue) is no relation to Chud Johnson's vaudeville partner from "Hellzapoppin". I would like to give "Himmelskibet" 12, but the scale jumps to 10 ... so, full of 10 out of 10 for this wonderful trip to Mars, a blonde planet!
