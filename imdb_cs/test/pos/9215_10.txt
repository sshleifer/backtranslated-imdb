Worst movie ever? HARDLY!!! This is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen! It has performances from all the great characters from the animated television series Rainbow Brite. Very safe for small children and colors capture their attention like no other! There is an evil princess trying to steal the Spectra diamond planet, which in turn would cause her life to stop on Earth. It tells the story of how Rainbow Brite and her new friend Krys are able to stop the evil history of the princess and restore life and color back to Earth. It's proof that kids can make a difference! Rainbow Brite will live forever.
