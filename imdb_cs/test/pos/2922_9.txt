It happens often, while growing up, Hollywood film impresses youth. Not only does it last a lifetime, but it inspires him to study ancient cultures as a career. Such was the case, with the 1954 film entitled "Egyptian." T Viewers were amazed by the sets, costumes, and great acting performance of this film, so other films soon followed as futile. This is the story of a young Egyptian boy who was less than a parent after birth. With such a dubious beginning it is not difficult to wonder why he will spend his life and ask questions. Sinuhe (Sin-oh-way), which means that "He who is alone" (Edmund Purdom) is growing up to masculinity and still asks why, even if he goes to School of Life to become a doctor. During his formative years he gains a lifelong friend named Kaptah brilliantly starred (Peter Ustinov), and Horemheb (Victor Mature) who rises from a simple guard officer to the Commander of the armies. His life offers everything from the rapid rise of social status to the convicted criminal, outcast, thoughtful healer, and finally to a life station he never expected. Fine playing goes to Jean Simmons as Merit, Michael Wilding as Akhnaton, Bella Darvi as tempter, Nefer, and John Carradine as a memorable grave robber. Tommy Rettig, plays Thoth, the Egyptian son. In his last years, "He, who is alone," finally finds the answer he has been looking for all his life he has left to his son, now in the care of his lifelong friend. Great movie! ****
