Easily one of the best gigs ever made, and that's better with age. For me, one of the main reasons was the English adaptation by David Weir. One of my Japanese friends once told me that the show in the original language was more moody and less inventive, the version we all know about. The fact that the show resonates so strongly, its non-Japanese fans are, I think, largely due to Mr. Weir's inspired efforts and some winning voice work. Well done, sir!
