I captured this film at the OutFest in Los Angeles in July 2006. It's rough around the edges (especially the sound is loud) and often very funny. The script is somewhat sharply episodic and ends abruptly, but Ash Christian makes the film a lot of real heart. It's also a refreshing change of tempo to make a gay movie that isn't star lingerie models obsessed with party and chasing straight guys. Supports the warmly sympathetic Jonathan Caouet as Mr. Cox, the related spirit of Rodney (Ash Christian), the lively and lively Ashley Finke as Rodney's best friend and Deborah Theaker as Rodney's mom, who has the best single-layer players. scenario and steals her every scene. The film is like his writer / director / star? Lumpy and a little strange, but also very sweet.
