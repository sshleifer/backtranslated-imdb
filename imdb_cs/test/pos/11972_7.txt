I love dogs and the most interesting character of this movie is the Golden Retriever. It's smarter, better looking and more interesting than any of the human characters. Like many other contributors, I didn't read the book, but I doubt it would change my mind about the movie. It is predictable from the first five minutes. No surprise. Mad scientists are creating a monster that is relaxed and the teen age of the boy and his miracle dog work together to destroy. There's a dog in all the movies. But as I said, I love dogs, so I give this movie 7/10 reviews. Watch if it's on TV, rent it if you're bored, and nothing else will catch you.
