From the first to the last scene, this movie is made very realistically, even too realistically, that sometimes in the desert we don't see details in night scenes (it's dark as real night) (the sun is as strong as in the real desert). . The script and the acting play are also very realistic. Footage and episodes are edited not to show things and events "effectively", "explain" them, or, as many Hollywood movies do, to "entertain" viewers. Adjustments are events as if they really happened in Afghanistan. The camera is sometimes set away from solder dying, even though the main character Major Bandura is shot and killed. Such a method reminds me of masterpieces of Italian neo-realism. The construction of the story is based on the same principles as "Pais√†", or "Bicycle Thief" - a chronological series of episodes of "faithful life" and several pathetic moments that initially seem random and illogical, but have internal reasons. I think the inner reason for Major Bandura's suicide death is religious emotion - repentance for the death of innocent people (not only his accidental killing of the family in the village, but also death is not the perpetrator under his command). He is not portrayed as an eager believer, but is depicted as a tactical and responsible officer. Precisely for this reason, his last decision (to return to a ruined village and turn his back on an armed boy whose family has been killed) appears to be an act of repentance. The Russian Evening Sacrifice is another context in which the whole film can be seen.
