After seeing the Lost Child several times since its release in 1995, and reading the reader's comments (mostly about Jane Tennison and Helena Mirren's excellent role in it), it strikes me more than ever that there are no comments. Robert Glenister as Chris Hughes plays a great role. Even after 10 years, he is still one of the most reliable ways to portray a complicated personality of an abusive child carrying the weight of his own past. Watching the episode for one and a half hours keeps switching between feelings of love and hating the guy in whom hatred prevails because of the seriousness of his actions. I have seen more great roles in my favorite actor, but this never makes me feel the best. Helen Mirren would never shine without these wonderful actors beside her. Praise for Robert Glenister!
