I saw this movie in the theater when I was 14 and changed my life. I immediately cut off my hair and started to buy all the recordings of the bands in the movie. It was one of the key bands of L. punk rock captured on film at the peak of their strength. Bands like Black Flag (pre-Rollins), Circle Jerks, Fear, X and Germs have little in punk music history. I can't believe this movie was never released on video or DVD. Great movie for punk rock fans.
