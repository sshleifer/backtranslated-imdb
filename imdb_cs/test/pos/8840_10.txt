It couldn't. <br /> <br /> It was a pleasure to have a look at the film from the cutting dialogue to the extraordinary effects that this film presented. Immediate feeling for Antarctica bitterness, kinship with characters that are built on a basic level before a real warm-up event, and combine the refined finale to make this film one of the most memorable and enjoyable movies in the area. Against the long list of films that try to exploit the theme of visitors from another planet, The Thing appears on top and laughs. Who can forget the perfectly timed dialogue and frosty special effects? Special effects that are much more impressive than the computer generated images we see today. I for one found some of the most enjoyable aspects of the film to be the way we were introduced slowly to each crew member, and the way they all had some distinctive feature traits. It wasn't just a nonsense bloodshed that came to the slasher. This movie felt. Emotion. <br /> <br /> I really can't recommend this movie. I haven't seen anything in my class yet to get closer to adaptation, let alone the better, to the perfect acting and timing used in this refined Polymeric cinema.
