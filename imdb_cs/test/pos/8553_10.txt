This movie ... I saw it 15 years ago and in recent years I didn't remember it anymore, name or anything else, it was just about a Romanian country man who played Anthony Quinn great. The impression of this drama will be eternal. Finally, I found the name of the movie, I hope to buy it. And honestly, this movie costs 10 Oscars. Ten times BRAVO. I was pretty young when I first saw a movie. I asked my friends if they heard about this story, but nobody would know anything about Anthony Quinn, who plays the role of a Romanian peasant. I remember when a German officer came and saw Anthony and told him he was a good breed, but in fact the German cheated him. For a few dollars you won't get rich if you buy a movie, but you'll be rich if you have one.
