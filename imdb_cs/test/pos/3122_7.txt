By 1950, John Ford had already fully developed the thoughts and motives that would form the core of his most successful Westerns. Always present, for example, is a strong sense of community, most sharply captured in the family of Joad Steinbeck 'Grapes of Wrath (1940).' Within these communities, even in the midst of the sublime motives of Ford, racism and pioneering spirit, there is always room for less human interaction, less friendship and romance that life is worth living. 'Wagon Master (1950)' came after Ford released his first two films in his "ride" trilogy ?? 'Fort Apache (1948)' and 'Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949)' ?? and covers a similar territory, only without a military outlook, and thus a stronger leadership of John Wayne. Ben Johnson and Harry Cary, Jr. are great actors, but they feel like they should play someone second, and the damned Mormon Elder Ward Bond is potentially a candidate for such a role. account. <br /> <br /> In the 'Wagon Master', Ford looks so comfortable with its proven Western formula that any character development is largely overlooked. Ben Johnson's romance with Joanne Dru is considered a commitment more than anything else, and Harry Cary's charming girl Jra of Mormon's girl is so perfect that she almost doesn't exist in the final film, so one thinks about surviving deleted scenes. Only in the charismatic and shameless uncle Shiloh Charles Kemper, Ford is trying to do something different and it works, even if it is surrounded by an army of intolerably motionless jokers. Where Ford succeeded, is the organization of a conglomeration of three distinct races of Americans? value-oriented Mormoms, unassuming horse traders, eccentric traveling showmen? into a cohesive community of pioneers looking for a bright future. This apparent harmony is thrown into disarray by the advent of Uncle Shiloha's weapon-toting outlaws, who exploit the injustice of the western frontier but eventually lose to the noble cowboys who "just ever drew on snakes." <br /> <br /> Master for favorite of his movies and maybe it has something to do with the absence of great names like John Wayne or Henry Fonda. Armed only with his choice of regular players, Ford is able to generate a sense of community by avoiding a single-character focus, although most of Mormom's passengers still remain completely anonymous. While this is undoubtedly well done, I cannot help that this film does just what other Ford pictures have made even better: the stunning grandeur of the western border was more beautifully presented in "She had a yellow ribbon"; romance and friendly quarrels among community members have taken greater emphasis in 'Fort Apache'; early relations with Native Americans, only implied here, were more thoroughly investigated in 'Seeker (1956)'; the courageous pioneering spirit of early settlers was explored more movably (though Henry Hathaway and George Marshall) in 'how the West was won (1962).' 'Wagon Master' is pure John Ford, but it is not a landmark.
