in times of predictable movies, in which violence, cheap romance and melodrama spread widely, it is pleasantly surprising to find such a strange movie. The storyline itself is persuasive and the actors are outstanding, especially Alan Rickman. If you want to watch a movie that doesn't provide all the answers before asking questions, a movie that will surprise you (in both good and bad), Dark Harbor is for you. And if you're not convinced, believe me, Alan Rickman's performance is worth ... especially at the end, ladies.
