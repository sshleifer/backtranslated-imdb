This is absolutely the best cartoon of the 80s, perhaps the best cartoon of all time. It had all the action, adventure, excitement and much more ... <br /> <br /> I can't imagine how hard it was for Ruby-Spears to do this great cartoon. money for this work of art and it was worth it, for example, only the bright scenes were difficult because I wouldn't call the 1980s for a great computer year, as it is now in the world we live in, so the bright scenes were great! <br /> <br /> Cartoons will never be the same as before, so I hope everyone will be released as a favorite on The Centurions DVD. I have a complete set of 65 DVD-r episodes, but it's not the same, because if they were released on DVD, people in the world could buy them and see a DVD in almost every store, which means a lot of fans. My good friend Ted has made this petition to get back on TV or better on DVD, that is, if we get many requests to return them on DVD.
