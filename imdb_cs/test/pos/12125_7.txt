Of all the mafia movies I've ever seen, it's one of the best for many reasons. Playing from Pesci, Cortese and Vincent. The story is one of the best (In the Mafia genre) as realistic. Characters are people with whom many other people can touch. This movie is also great because it's a good dialogue. It also has very realistic fights and action scenes. This film also began the career of Pesci and Vincent. If it wasn't for the success of this movie, Casino and Goodfellas might not be as good as they were. <br /> <br /> Story 10/10 9/10 Realism 10/10 <br /> <br /> 10/10 br /> 1: Goodfellas 2: Casino 3: The Godfather Trilogy 4: The Death Collector 5: The Sopranos
