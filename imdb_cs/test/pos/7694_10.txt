I've always been a fan of this very invisible filming of Gershwin because I last saw it in 1959. As many of you know, it's not available on video or DVD; the Gershwin family actually tried to destroy all existing prints. Still, for some reason - hopefully, it signals the end of its opposition - the Gershwin family has recently approved the display of collector press in the museum. moving image in Astoria, Queens. . <br /> <br /> Well, the Technicolor widescreen was excellent! (Not perfect, but excellent.) The sound was excellent, in stereo quality. People who saw it in the original release wouldn't see a much better copy. (Program notes include the original variety review, which points out that people might refuse the steep price of a limited version of the $ 3,50 ticket!) <br /> <br /> And just as I loved it, PORGY AND BESS he was better than I remembered. It's just amazing. Sidney Poitier as Porgy was where his career had just begun to ignite and his charisma shines through. Dorothy Dandridge as Bess is beautifully beautiful. Brock Peters as a crown is aggressively masculine. Pearl Bailey as Maria provides several comic moments, although her role is small. And Sammy Davis, Jr., like Sporting Life, steals every scene she is in; it is especially impressive in its two big numbers: "It is not necessarily so" and "is a ship that is Leavin 'soon for New York." (The last one won the applause during the screening I saw.) <br /> <br /> PORGY AND BESS is tightly bounded, but it doesn't matter when the set is as beautiful as this. Costumes are also excellent. The singing voices of Sidney and Dorothy are dubbed, but they dub very well. The excellent "Summertime" is sung by Clara, played by young Diahann Carroll; her singing is also dubbed. (Actually, only Pearl and Sammy are doing their own vocalization.) Of course, the music is noble, but what really hit me this time was how much Preminger's emotion left the story. People were sniffing the audience several times - once when Bess sings the beautiful "I love you Porgy." And I got a kick from the audience who actually laughed out loud on the tracks in "It Ain't Necessably So." Could it have been that they had never heard this song before - or had they ever really listened to it? I believe that most of the film's emotional impact is due to the performances of Poiter and Dandridge - you are praising their love for victory. A minor quarrel with 136 minutes - one or two slow spots and a stereotypical scene of Amos-n-Andy about Bess, who sees a lawyer to divorce Crow, even though he is not even married to him. (I would shorten it.) And the beginning is a bit confusing - both characters are uncomfortably introduced - they are part of the movie before you realize who they are. And I think Preminger used one detail throughout the movie. It all seems to have been shot in 3/4, which I think is his way of working with a widescreen screen. PORGY AND BESS has always been a cult film for those of us who have seen it For those of us who loved the soundtrack, and for some of us who just heard about it. Hopefully they will find a way to reissue it and put it on DVD. They deserve the widest possible audience.
