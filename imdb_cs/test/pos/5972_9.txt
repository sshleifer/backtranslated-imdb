Fantastic Russian WWII movie. Like most World War II Russian movies, The Ascent is incredibly appalling. It is also dense in its symbolism. The story follows two guerrillas, Sotnikov and Rybak (Boris Plotnikov and Vladimir Gostyukhin), who go on a mission to look for food. On their way they are spotted by German soldiers who injured Sotnikov. Sotnikov, in turn, kills one of the Germans, which leads to trouble for the two guerrillas and all others they later get into. The greatest success of the film is its vivid sense of place. Russia is frozen and snowy and it is hard not to feel that winter is going straight into your own bones. Shepitko keeps her close to the characters, examining each reef with their faces. Probably not a choice, but the film is framed 1.33: 1, giving the film a sense of claustrophobia. While the whole movie is pretty successful, I felt that the first half was stronger than the other. My main complaint about the film is that it evolves into a very indecent Christian allegory with its climax. I do not think that symbolism contributes too much to driving, especially when I was already interested in the debate between the two guerrillas. It is not fair. I appreciated the pros and cons of their arguments. I started leaning towards a certain character, and then the director emerges and tells me he is Judas! Despite some cumbersomeness, it is still necessary to see.
