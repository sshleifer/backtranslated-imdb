Before it was shown on MTV or VH1 it was at my local theater to play just before the main movie. I remember this short film more than the movie I saw that day. It was the first time I ever had such a music movie, but I will tell you that seeing on a big screen of a 35mm dark theater print gives it a much better impact than seeing a cropped version for scanning and scanning on VH1 All Saints.
