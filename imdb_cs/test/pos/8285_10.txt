AWWWW, I love this movie in pieces. I and my cousins ​​enjoy this movie a lot and I'm just a huge fan !!! I hope the TV series will be released soon on DVD. Let's talk about it, I haven't seen a LONG TV show. Such gear times! Where I come from Australia Chipmunk Adventure is known only to people in their late age and adult years, which is a bit sad because little kids don't know what's missing. <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are Ace the ones I love most. This film will excite young and old GET THE ADVANTURE CHIPMUNK TODAY !!! 10 out of 10, such an excellent movie.
