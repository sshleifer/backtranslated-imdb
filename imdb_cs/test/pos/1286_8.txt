Great movie. No involuntary tricks like most Hollywood movies. Everything was supported by the tension of the conspiracy. B&W gave the basic, no-frills feel as well. In short, it was visceral in its simplicity of cinematography and cast. <br /> <br /> The following serves as an interesting contrast to Memento. Characters in both used manipulation and subterfuge considerably. In this sense, they both reminded me somewhat of "In the company of men," I also highly recommend. One difference between Nolan's two films is that Memento was a little easier for me to follow, since the b & w scenes progress in a constant chronological direction. I don't think it would be true when it comes to After, where the scenes seemed to be random. If you have a choice between a VCR and a DVD, I recommend you a DVD because it gives you the opportunity to watch a movie a second time in chronological order, not only in the mixed (though inept) order presented by Nolan. It also makes it easier, at the second viewing, to piece orders together for yourself if you want. As another spectator, he noted that one of the best things about this movie and Memento is that none of the cast was famous. They were characters, not big-name actors who brought personalities developed in other films. Given some similarities on the land, I wonder if Memento is a remake of After, but it aims to reach a larger audience like Edward Burns She is one in the form - and pretty much the same cast as - McMullan brothers.
