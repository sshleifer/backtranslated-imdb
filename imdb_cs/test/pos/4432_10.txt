Until this document, I've never heard of architect Louis Kahn. In this almost two-hour documentary that goes very fast, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores his father's life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia at the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia, where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton and La Jolly, California, as well as to New York to explore his father's creative spirit. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him divorce and their daughter Sue Ann. Nathaniel includes his family members. Louis also has another half-sister, Alexandra Tynge, from her father's previous relationship with Anne Tyne, a fellow architect. Louis's passion was his art.
