Not only was this film exciting, it took me back to mind with its true soundtrack. Those were the things we were saying and doing ... those were the songs we listened to ... all during the same time, at the same time, down the road south in Alabama. Maybe I wasn't one of the skateboard sets, but I was certainly one of the observers sitting on the curb with an old transistor radio listening to Neil Young, who was watching the braver ones than I ever hoped they would be. they were shooting on their surfboards on wheels, using Alva and Adams tricks, hoping they might just take the Zephyr style for a short while. It's just to show how much we've all been during those wonderful days. ~ KLJ
