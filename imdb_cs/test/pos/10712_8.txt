Although it was a low budget movie and a clear last minute, it has a certain spell that is difficult to determine. I tend to believe that he is a screenwriter - Grant Morris (see Dead Dog), who, despite the distorted line of wit, has imprinted a fantastic piece of humor that is missing in many of today's boxing hits. You must see laughter on Sunday afternoon. Talking like a true single girl, and very skeptical this movie didn't inspire me in particular, but lit a small flame of hope for lovelife. Not my lovelife, as much as my beloved crazy neighbor who lets her hamster sleep in bed with her. He can find someone.
