I loved it. In fact, I watched it over and over again, and I could watch it again. This movie isn't bored. <br /> <br /> The concept of this vampire is revolutionized in this film. It's a job well done, great for today's generation. Wesley Snipes was born for this role. Stephen Dorff was the perfect vampire. Arly Jover, mmmm mmm, can bite me anytime she wants and what sexy accent she has. Donal Logue provides great comic relief. This vampire movie is like no other. I can't wait for Blade 2.
