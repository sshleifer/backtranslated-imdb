It may be a 1937 remake of Capra, but it's only wrong to consider it this way! It is assumed that Hilton's novel is completely different. He is excellent as a musical. The scenery is amazing, good characters and everyone like "Leonard Maltin", who considers Bacharach's music to be terrible, must be completely deaf! I highly recommend.
