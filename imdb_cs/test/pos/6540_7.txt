Whenever this film gets mentioned, usually the discussion starts and ends with a wonderful collection of cars and dragging scenes, often overlooked by occasional eclectic characters who fill a film around three central characters <br /> <br /> One character stands out Rebel played a big veteran Australian actor Max Cullen. The Rebel is a blind tow racer who almost runs away the hero and his band in the middle of the night because he doesn't use any headlights. In the back story we find that Rebel Master Street Builder racing cars, and he and his wife seem to be locked in the warp of the fifties. Rebel plays a small but crucial role in teaching Mike, played by Terry Serio, almost spiritual truths about street racing. It's not a speed, a reaction time that makes a great competitor. It's the one who feels the best car to become the biggest <br /> <br /> This is best evidenced by Rebel explaining to Mike after the test drive "You've got all the agony, just missing the style" <br /> <br / > Graham Bond, is another well-respected actor who gives his talents as a crooked police officer trying to get into some of the financial events that street racing generates. The confrontation between Bond and Fox, played by Richard Moir, adds tension to the story. Not only does Bond expect results but also Fox to make it into the racing company <br /> <br /> For most of the movie, Fox is showing a real manipulative and evil side, but at the top he dedicates an honor that turns the last few minutes into an extremely tense and unforgettable end. It is almost as if the film has again focused on its true purpose, to show us more about the street race culture than the daily activities of the people. One of the main complaints about the film is the script. Although it is not exciting, I believe that the complete lack of any chemistry between Mikes' girlfriend, Deborah Conway and his mechanic, Vangelis Mourikis, has more in common with the problem. Every scene in which these two interactions should be shortened Finally, when it comes to actors, Kristoffer Greaves, who plays a deaf and maimed member of Fox's inner circle, is one truly exceptional performance. His back story is never explored, he was hurt in the race, he was born in this way, what is it that Fox sees value to keep him around <br /> <br /> The reality of the movie is simple, it's about street and culture behind him. When cars are flying and action sequences are moving, this is the only time when director John Clark and his writer Barry Tomblin seem to be really happy with what they're doing. So if you are looking for a depth of exploration of human relationships, moments of life defining drama, then this film is not for you. If your pulse is racing at the thought of a deflated 57 Chev or an iconic GTO Stage 3 sprawling on the streets of Sydney, then you won't find much better than this movie
