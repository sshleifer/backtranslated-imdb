I think Crewes did her good part very badly. Everything Dunne is about is rescuable because Dunne is a great actress and can pull something, even a weak script. Therefore, I would recommend it for this reason alone. This movie may be a little earlier than the time, the storyline could be more acceptable these days. During the golden age of Hollywood films, they were meant for entertainment or learning, mostly to feel good or to cope with the times. This graph seems to deviate from this profile. But again I have to say what ever was Irene Dunne at least "good" because she made things so believable! The only other actress I can say was that it was, Deborah Kerr. Watch Silver Cord if you get a chance to play if nothing else.
