I usually give horror movies around 6/10, but I was intrigued. The House of Wax was by far the best horror movie I've ever seen ... Even better than the Amityville horror movie. Paris Hilton was good at it and I have to say he has a good future. Her scene of death was probably the best. I'll just say how he dies ... <br /> <br /> He gets a giant rod right between his eyes and up close. Gory, huh? Brian Van Holt was very good at both the murderers, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had long hair). He usually plays an average cop or soldier, but he did very well in this matter. Eliza Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray also acted very well as Carly and Nick Jones. Nick took his attention in the first half of the film, then Eliza stole it when she suffered a lot of pain in the second half, as if with a finger tearing his finger, tearing his lips apart after they stuck together and getting a straight punch forward in Bo's face. Overall I give this movie 8/10. Horror movie fans have to see it.
