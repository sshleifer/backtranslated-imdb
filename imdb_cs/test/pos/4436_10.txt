When Nathaniel Kahn embarked on this journey, he barely knew who his father really was. At the end of the film, he found him and coped with the strange life he lived as a child. Father was the father of Kahn. He was an architect architect. His suggestions might have been too complicated because he was trying to create buildings that did not meet popular trends at the time. Ironically, he has never achieved fame that was so easy for some of his contemporaries. He had a vision and never took it from him. In the buildings he left as an inheritance to mankind, we see the qualities of his unique style. Each of his creations is unique in that they do not imitate the works of other architects. Louis Kahn's life was quite complicated. He was married, yet he had affairs with two of his assistants who made the girl and the boy, except the legitimate daughter he had with his wife. a secluded area, far from his father, who only visited late at night. Louis Kahn never knew these children, although it is clear that everyone knows about the existence of others. It is tragic that Louis Kahn died alone at Grand Central Station as he returned from the road without reconciling himself with women and children. He probably took care of all his children, but remained a reserved character throughout the film. We never know a man, although at the end Nathaniel, in search of his father's life, finds most of the missing pieces of the puzzle. This is a personal account of an artist's life. With this son, who has the courage to tell this story, we almost feed Louis Kahn and his wider family.
