At a time when almost every great horror film of the 1960s and 1970s has been reworked for viewers weaned from today's horror movies, which are not very good, it is instructive to see John Carpenter's opus in 1982, which is in itself. remake - Howard Hawks' child favorite 1951 sci-fi / horror classic EXTERNAL SPACES. Although Carpenter's film was not so big at the beginning that it was released in mid-1982, it has had very big consequences since then. In fact, Carpenter's film is a less remake of the Hawks' movie than it's a rework, because it reverts to the original idea created by the source material, specifically the John W. Campbell story "Who's Going There?" US Antarctic scientists are threatened by a shape-changing alien to melt from ice after 100,000 years. Kurt Russell, who has played for Carpenter in the director's television film by ELVIS in 1979 and ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK in 1981, is cast by dedicated actors, including Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Dysart, and Richard Masur. filled with exploration of paranoia, as a shape-changing "thing" that first reaches their camp in the form of a guide dog, which the Norwegian team tries to kill, each of them takes over one by one. It's not long before everyone in the camp starts to trust their neighbor. The end of the film, in which Russell and David are the only ones, has a disturbing and chilling ambiguity similar to similar codes as BIRDS and STRAW DOGS. Almost universally, when The Thing is redeemed, the emphasis is on extremely harsh special makeup effects and extraterrestrial designs created by Rob Bottin who worked with Carpenter on the classic horror film THE FOG in 1980 and on the 1981 Danish film by the Danish Werewolf movie HOWLING. These effects are really spectacular and graphic, and even today they can be quite stomach. But all of this would make Carpenter's film anything but a high-end spraying epic if the direction, story, and acting were not except for snuff; and fortunately each of them is. When not concentrating on the extremely horrifying transformation sequence, Carpenter puts the tension in the same Hitchcock-influenced manner that he reported on his previous films HALLOWEEN and THE FOG with cameraman Dean Cundey, who worked as a cameraman, especially through the station corridors, a major help. Acting increases the already subtle adaptation of the script written by Bill Lancaster; and we also got a tight score Ennio Morricone, whose work on director Sergio Leone's classic sixties Italian spaghetti westerns is well known to all, including of course Carpenter himself. THING also includes other fine visual effects by Albert Whitlock (who has worked on many Hitchcock movies including THE BIRDS) and Roy Arbogast, who worked on CLOSE ENCOUNTERS THIRD KIND and JAWS 2. <br /> <br /> it might have been because Universal decided to release this graphic shock just two weeks after Steven Spielberg issued a far more family friendly ET: EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (unexpectedly, critics and spectators at that time favored Spielberg's excellent film of carpentry as well, but very different). Also, most of the horror movie box store shop in 1982 went to another Spielberg-produced film, POLTERGEIST. As a result, at a cost of $ 15 million, ASSUMED suffered from a lack of attention in its time. Over time, however, many came to see Carpenter's movie for what it is - extremely Gory, but an extremely intelligent combination of science fiction and horror, done with great enthusiasm and a real understanding of psychological paranoia in the heart of her story. . Though it is still quite horrible, THINGS should be equally remembering the skill with which the story is associated as it is for bloody alien patterns and make-up effects; because it is a storytelling and tension skill that is so unforgettable in the final analysis.
