Good movie, great story, great characters, I enjoyed it so much, enough to buy a DVD when it came out. The real life story, which is said to be interesting, is fascinating and witty than anything that fictionalists could ever invent. My friend, who is in the media business, said that they should not exhibit insider dealing like this, give the business a bad name. As if. <br /> <br /> Although there were several problems with the DVD: First, the sound volume is extremely low. I noticed that this is also the case when HBO runs it as it is in the original production copy. Second, about the first five minutes, the left side of the video is cut off, that is, the image is cut one inch shorter than the left side. After five minutes, the screen fills properly from left to right. Sloppy technical production like this is very amateur and I don't know why the director and producer let such sloppiness slip. Yet, even with technical flaws, his pleasant story, one of the best HBO I think.
