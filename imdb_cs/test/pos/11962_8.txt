So begins "One Crazy Summer", twin evil "Better Off Dead ..". How can any film be bad when David Lee Roth is singing the opening lines? This movie is a complete explosion. Re-pairing with John Cusack with Curtis Armstrong, but this time adding Bobcat Goldwaith to the mix has great, funny results. Hyper Bobcat Grids All Around Around, Curtis "If Ak" is the son of a frightened army with pacifist tendencies and Demi Moore (with natural breasts ... wow!) As a love interest, again chronically depressed Cusack. The story is, well, simple. Laughter is there, but both Savage Steve Holland movies have a certain quality to them ... they are funny but they are also sweet. The scene where Curtis finds a thrown out doll in the target exercise beach and starts to wonder how a little girl won't be able to sleep was stupid, funny and touching. The whole animation is quite unreal. "The Boat" is hysterical (complete with Watsamatta U. sail and Odie plush doll). Overall, a fun movie, though not as good as "better dead ..."
