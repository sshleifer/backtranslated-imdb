I was attracted to "Friends" by the sound of a very young yet familiar Elton John I saw in a club in nearby Houston. I had no idea about the emotions and impact of the film. I was recently brought back to the song movie Heart called "Seasons" and then I found the song Elton John "Friends" who thought it was the same song ... it's 35 years old. The flood of "Friends" returned as a vision of an old photo of your first true love. I have more memories of how the film hit me than the real details of production, conspiracy, etc., So forgive me a little bad review. I remember taking a few special friends on the day I saw the movie and moving and tearing at the end as I was. I'm nervous and nervous looking for a copy and seeing it now. So many movies that seemed so important to me at the time (ie "The Graduate" "Easy Rider") now seem silly and I don't want it to fall into the same category. But I'll find it, and if it turns out to be stupid, then I'll at least be able to turn my wife into a great ... no .. an excellent soundtrack. When we met, we went through "Last Tango in Paris". The youth I work with (56) respects my views, but it is difficult to explain the feelings of the sixties and movies and songs that reflect such strong feelings, but now they seem a little "aged". I just can't figure out if the aging process is movies ... or me. "Friends" is a very special, sensitive and amazing movie. This will bring you a lot of special feelings. In any case, rent or buy a copy ... The Indians weren't near the strong genre then they are today.
