I've been waiting since last October to see this movie! (it was supposed to come out in October '98) and now I finally saw that I was not disappointed. Bloody awesome! At the beginning it was a bit slow, but once it was, it's a very exciting thrilling nail Robert Carlyle is so different from Gaz in 'The Full Monty' and Begbie in 'Trainspotting' that it's hard to recognize him! And Johnny Lee Miller, already with his Sick Boy of Trainspotting, plays his lively man, who is right about humor and sensitivity, that it's easy to see why Liv Tylers Rebecca is falling. Great movie. As Hades in Disney's 'Hercules' would say, "Two inches way up!"
