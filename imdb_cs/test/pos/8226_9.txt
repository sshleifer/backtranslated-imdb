This film by George Fitzmauric, who has made so many excellent films, is on a good level. It's sharp, funny, with beautiful lines and has an inimitable Ronald Colman in a romantic lead. Colman plays the irresistibly charming younger son of a wealthy English peer. She is financially irresponsible (she spends, for example, 15 pounds of the last 20 pounds in the world on a cute terrier named George), but is open, wildly generous, contemptuous of clear, impolite, and hopelessly sentimental. She is so lively that all women fall in love with him. His girlfriend is the star of the music halls, and in 1930 he played with her typical slim, narrow-sided silky youthful Myrna Loy. Fitzmaurice was not a great user of details, and the girls of that day had their faces half-hidden with such terrible clinging hats, so we can't see the looks of both heroes the way we want. The director is equally interested in charming Colman. The romantic feminine leadership is youthful and fresh Loretta Young, who has not yet become a proto-Julie Andrews, whom we generally know her as, but was still a blushing girl who radiated all the sweetness of the rose garden and laughed and laughed warmly. throughout. Obviously, a character with her amazing sense of humor was needed to appreciate the snobbish crazy social anarchism of the refreshing aristocratic character Colman. The story hardly matters, as is the case with these light and fun movies so often. That's just fun.
