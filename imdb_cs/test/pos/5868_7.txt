It was interesting with Hartley's "The Go-Between", which was well known, both in the original book and in his unsatisfactory editing of Pinter-Losey. "The Hireling" sometimes shows almost mirror image; set in a somewhat less remote period for the main body, featuring exposure to the British class system, and containing a set of piece sports wrestling (boxing takes place in cricket) that reveals much much about. <br /> <br /> It recreates small scale, focus character . You do not need to know exactly "Lady Franklin" and "Leadbitter" in the Romanesque sense, but this distance is appropriately played in body language and in the declension of actors. Your distance from sometimes fully sympathetic to any real character reflects a dormant "difference" that makes a central relationship. Miles and Shaw are beautifully gentle and we see more in their "less"; never once are these acting performances. These are Stanislav's interpretations, which give the impression that these characters have a life outside the boundaries of the film. All the other parts are very satisfactorily processed, although in this film they are much smaller than I suppose in the novel and compared to "Go-Between", the overwhelming work of disillusionment. Disillusionment at the center of this film is so sadly and movably transmitted in the late scenes where Shaw kisses Miles and is rejected, and then where the drunken Leadbitter confronts Cantrip and Lady Franklin. It's a shameful shame that what would be an incredibly pernicious end to spoiled, desolate lives on both sides of the screen is definitely decorated with a strange little cod. One is completely confused by a jump in tone, as Shaw's Leadbitter goes beserk and ironically sings "Rule Britannia" and "God Save the Queen" as he crashes his car into things. The political point is strongly exaggerated by this bombastic, somewhat somewhat operatic ending. All the sense of subtlety so effectively transmitted is lost because the implicit point is strongly and loudly created. Agit-prop certainly has no place in this delicate time drama. <br /> <br /> But overall, it can't be too hard. While this absurd ending is a major mistake, the rest of the film must be praised as a sensitive, evocative film, sadness, and detailed observation of how British society was in the past. Hartley's weak but crystal clear touch is largely evidence. It is a pity that we will not end up in the shattered conclusion of Shaw's drunken scene. Mrs. Franklin's tragic, deceitful character, Sarah Miles, is suddenly denied her place in the epicenter of the film, because the excellent human drama bizarre slips into the sphere of political scoring. Also, Shaw - the drier yet profound feeling of actors - is betrayed by the supernatural surplus that the film concludes. Thus; a gentle small-scale triumph is sabotaged; but we should remember many good points. <br /> <br /> Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
