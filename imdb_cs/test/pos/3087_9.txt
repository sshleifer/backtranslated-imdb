I remember when I first saw this movie. I was babysitting for my mom's friend and one of the kids suggested we watch it. I was thinking that it was a sincerely miscible "prince of thieves" who slipped into the video recorder, I was ready for a few hours of boredom that came as a shock, pleasant to admit, but still a shock. Now you all know that Robin Hood's legend isn't? I'll explain a little. Robin Hood was a Saxon criminal who was collecting money from time to time and giving it to the people who needed it all while seducing the magnificent Maid Marion and the sheriff of Nottingham and Prince John. These are the basics! Now, for review. This movie was released in 1993, and is the start of the entire Robin Hood legend and p-take Prince of Thieves. Loosely following the legend, Robin of Loxley first meets in an Arab prison during the third century of the Crusades, and along with 'Moor' as they were called in those days, he performs a cunning escape with cellmate, Asneez. After running away, Asneeze begged Robin to find his son Atchoo, a foreign student in England, and watch him. This Robin promises to do! Robin swims back to England. He returns to his home, Loxley Castle, to find out that he is being taken by the bailiffs on the back of the car and goes through a sad revelation that his father, dog, cat, and even the goldfish are dead. Desperately longing for a familiar face, he finds a loyal servant of the Blinkin family who sits in a toilet with a Braille Braille jazz mag. Glee continues throughout the film. As with all Robin Hood stories, Robin must thwart the evil plans of Prince John and Sheriff of Rottingham who are disaster and urge exorbitant taxes on King Richard's kingdom. Is gone. Those who know the movies Mel Brooks had previously directed will have little idea of ​​what to expect. After all, he's the man responsible for Dracula dead and loving him and young Frankenstein. All the jokes that range from visual gags to amazing funny comments are in the right place in the whole movie, never more than a minute between laughter. Cary Elwes (by the way the only English man who plays Robin Hood in the movie), which many of you will know from the bride's princess brings his cheeky smile with glitter eyes to this movie, and does a great job. From an extraterrestrial heroic attitude to a sinister sexy look, it's really amazingly funny. And the man looks better in stockings than I do! Richard Lewis is cheerful when he is a jolly arrogant Prince John with a constantly changing mole. He gets sissy-boy behavior to the tee and his vocal American chants are great. Throughout the film, the mole on the face constantly changes position: it starts on the left cheek, then on the right cheek, then on the chin, then on the forehead before returning to its original position. This is a funny joke based on a mole on Alan Rickman when he played the sheriff in Prince Of Thieves. Roger Rees as a slender sheriff from Rottingham is amazingly slimy and ugly and has some great lines around the world. film. There are some faces that you will know from other Brooks movies. For example, Robert Ridgely, played at the kata in this film also starred at the kata in Blazing Saddles, another film directed by Brooks. He also likes to add subtle references to his earlier films; Having a few in this movie that dying Brooks fans will be on the spot. Those who have watched World War 1 history will recognize the music for 'Men in Tights'. Also, when Patrick Stewart arrives and snogs Marion, Mel himself (played by Rabbi Tuckman) pronounces the line 'it's good to be king', one of his lines in the history of the world. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is beautifully comic, even those with just a few lines bring them a great depth of warmth and humor <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so beautifully warm and funny in my opinion are all improvised scenes. Although there was a species scenario, some scenes were completely improvised by the actors themselves, such as the scene where Latrine (Tracey Ullman) prays for Rottingham in bed, and he falls over the ceiling, landing right where she wanted him, which two actors were totally invented and thought out. <br /> <br /> There are a few special effects that are small but fun moments of computer fraud. The soundtrack is unforgettable, with some very funny songs, and a couple of cheesy love songs. You will sing 'Men in Stockings' or at least buzz it for weeks. Rating is Pg, which I call BAH HUMBUG. There is no bad language in the film, with the exception of using a double submitter and one saying that violence is minimal. In fact, I would go so far as to say that they do not exist, except for a few comedy combat scenes. <br /> <br /> A great fun movie that adults and kids will enjoy!
