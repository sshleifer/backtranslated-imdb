After reading all the books of Sarah Waters, I was eagerly looking forward to the BBC's adaptation of Fingersmith. Especially since Tipping the Velvet was so well done by well-known Andrew Davies. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the results, in fact, I think it could be on a par with TTV; romantic and fun. And not so many ignorant people could believe you, senseless lesbian rowing. Since I was a fan of Elaine Cassidy because she saw her innocent turnaround in Felicina Journey, I thought she embodied both a hard scam and a growing fragility like Maud. Her transformation was credible and impressive to watch. I met Sally Hawkins as Zena Blake of Tipping the Velvet, a small part mainly because I didn't have so many expectations but was stunning in the role of Sue Trinder. Her eyes were fascinating and carried everything from rage to utter despair. Both of them act together and combine these talents. Obviously, Imelda Staunton was amazing as usual, is unmistakably a national treasure, and the supportive cast was high. Even the direction from relatively unknown Aisling Walsh used contrasting, yet beautiful blue shades for Briar and Brown for London. However, many praise must be written to Ransley. If you want to rotate a 600-page book where every line has the highest quality in a three-hour extravagance, it's a huge performance. He illuminated the main revelation at a steady pace and at the same time gave us plenty of stories and character development. She has my full admiration. In conclusion, a brilliant adaptation where all the participants gave 100% and made this the best BBC drama I have seen.
