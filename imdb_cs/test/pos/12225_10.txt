I like this show. It's really unique. I was under the impression that it would have more seasons. In anticipation of Series 2, I recently purchased Series 1 to review it for renewal when Part 2 began. After watching him, I was thrilled and craved more, so I came to see the sequel. I am really disappointed to see that there are no plans for the second series because I was eagerly looking forward to the next story. I think they really fell for this. There was a lot of story left to build on and lots of unanswered questions. I am very unhappy now and I hope they would reconsider their decision and pick up the story where it ended.
