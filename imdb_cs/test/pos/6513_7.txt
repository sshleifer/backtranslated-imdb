"Miss Cast Away" is a fun little thing that excludes serious plot or character development to pack as many gags as possible. They enjoyed the best with a large audience that is open to such entertainment and maybe having a few drinks. Most jokes are a contemporary event based so in future years this film may become a time-turnover capsule-from-21. century pop links links. <br /> <br /> 30i to 24p conversion The shots create a jerky look in some parts, the most noticeable opening of aerial shots. The appearance of Michael Jackson is truly a strange event without a sequencer. But for one I find it encouraging that Mr. Jackson has shown a useful interest in one of his protégés even after (the director) has passed the stage of a cute preteen-boy. The work effects are not as bad as one of them suggested. Most of it was made by a single-man crew in the short span of time consisting of animator William Sutton, whose name seems to have been dropped from IMDb credits. His work is extraordinary success and really helps fill the gaps in this film. I hope he's finally paid!
