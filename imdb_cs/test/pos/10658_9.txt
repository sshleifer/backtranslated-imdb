On June 14, 1905, during the Russian Revolution of that year, sailors aboard the Russian battleship Potemkin revolted against their repressive officers. Frustrated by the second-rate treatment they receive, and in particular by the mass of worms being forced to eat, the crew of the ship, led by the inspiring Bolshevik sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), decided that the time was ripe. revolution. And so the excitement of the classic Russian propaganda classic, Sergei M. Eisenstein, "Bronenosets Potyomkin / Potemkin Battleship" begins. The film itself is full of sharp examples of stunning visuals: the captain of a dropped ship gently hangs from the side rope he was thrown over; the body of the deceased rebel lies calmly on the shore, a sign on his chest reading "KILLED FOR BOWL SOUP;" close-ups of clenched fists of hundreds of viewers who are finally poisoned by the Tsarist regime; a progressive baby carriage career descending to Odessa Steps as desperate viewers watching with breath (this scene was unforgettably "borrowed" by Brian De Palma for a particularly exciting scene in his "Untouchables"); the barrels of many canons are ominously compared to the vastly superior Potemkin battleship. However, the film itself is best analyzed? not as a fragmented selection of unforgettable scenes? But as a single movie, and indeed, every scene is extremely unforgettable. Although the whole film is divided into five quite different chapters, it spins greatly; in no way do we show any loss of interest, and we are absolutely never in doubt as to which side we should be sympathetic. that is, but it does not have to carry a negative connotation. The Potemkin warship was made by Eisenstein with a special sense and it perfectly fits in every way. Planned by the Soviet Central Committee to coincide with the celebrations of the 20th century of the unsuccessful revolution of 1905, it was assumed that "Potemkin" would be a popular film in its home country, symbolizing the revitalization of Russian art after the revolution. It is somewhat unfortunate, then that Eisenstein's film failed to perform well in the Russian box-office, reportedly defeated by Allan Dwan's 1922 'Robin Hood' film in his opening week and runs only four short weeks. Fortunately, despite being banned in different countries in different countries, "The Battleship Potemkin" behaved more admirably overseas. The film also showed that Eisenstein was a successful tool for testing its "assembly" theories. Through the rapid cut and distant shots of the crowds of extras, the viewer is not allowed to sympathize with individual characters, but with the revolutionary population in general. Eisenstein briefly breaks this form, however, in a scene where Vakulinchuk flees a ship's officer who is trying to kill him, and, of course, during the renowned Odessa sequence steps in how our hearts beat in horror for the life of an unhappy child in a drum buggy. The accompanying soundtrack to the version I watched largely featured Dmitri Shostakovich's orchestral works, serving beautifully to enhance the emotional impact of these scenes. One of the greatest films of the silent era, The Battleship Potemkin is a triumph of phenomenal filmmaking and is a significant slice of film history. The highly exaggerated events of the film (among others there were never any violent massacres at Odessa Steps) were remembered so often that we are not sure of the true history behind the events shown. This is a great success.
