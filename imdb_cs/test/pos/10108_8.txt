Maybe I'm one of the only enthusiastic horror fans who think the recent overload of Asian shocks is so exaggerated! Movies like "Ring" or "The Eye"? which are praised all over the world? she just didn't convince me and looked dull than frightening. Well, this dull opinion is not for the South Korean gem "The Story of Two Sisters". It is a stylish and totally complex psychological story that really gets under your skin! The plot, based on a local folklore story, might be a little confusing to make this film one of the greatest achievements of the genre, but the atmosphere and tension-building certainly provokes feelings of great respect. It is one of those few movies that are impossible to label: events in "Two Sisters" qualify as a stunning horror, as well as an intense family drama and a deep psychological portrait. In addition to the charming story, "The Story of Two Sisters" also has all the great elements that I feel are usually missing in Asian horror movies such as impressive music, good acting performance and an innovative camera. The family event castle is brilliantly illustrated as a truly spooky place where secrets and dangers lurk behind every door. Several sequences (such as dinner with relatives or a night look in a girl's room) are pretty complete perfection. I felt uncomfortable, and I believe that I have seen my share of scary horror. "The Story of Two Sisters" is an amazing movie-adventure and sure to see for Asian film fanatics. A little warning for people with short attention, though: this movie makes you have eyes and ears focused on all the time. It is also a film that requires repetitive viewing, even though it is never "provided" by 100%.
