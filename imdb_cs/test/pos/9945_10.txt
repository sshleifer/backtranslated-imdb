When I was growing up, Voyage to Space was my favorite movie. I remember when KTLA (Channel 5) ran the film all week and I and my sisters watched it every day! I still remember every part of that movie. The end was so sad when the Giant Robot blew up with the guillotine and then watched Johnny Sokka with all the tears that ran down his face and called for Giant Robot. It was supposed to be a continuation of the movie in which Giant Robot somehow survived the blast. :) I can't believe there are so many other Voyage to space fans. I really want to buy a movie when it comes to DVD, but my sister said those that are now there are collapsed and probably bad copies of the movie. I don't know why they haven't released it since it's been over 40 years. I think Voyage to Space was created in 1968. Only now, my second most popular Japanese monster of all time (War of Gargantuas) finally comes to DVD and is released on September 9th and can't wait! :) Now if they just did the same with Voyage in space. Giant Robot, Johnny Sokko and Voyage to the Universe will never be forgotten! In my eyes and probably many more, it will always be a childhood classic for me! :)
