First of all, I would like to say that this film is the greatest thing that ever happened to humanity. It's the best of all the great Muppet movies and every other movie! so BOO-YA for them Henson! This film is the first of all Muppet and Best Movies. (boo ya) It's about a frog (kermit) trying to make Hollywood. along with the amazing friends he meets on the road, there are some of the greatest songs ever made and which must become classics, including the "rainbow connection" <br /> <br /> to conclude that this track the movie was the biggest thing EVER!. If you haven't seen it before, get out of your computer and get the closest video store to yourself !!! (if they don't have a movie muppet, I'd be BIG TIME)
