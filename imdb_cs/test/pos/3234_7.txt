I think this movie version of NORTHANGER ABBEY is actually pretty good. It's definitely fun. Well, it's not a masterpiece like PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ('95), but that's a very good thing. .. Royal Crescent, Roman baths, fascinating Georgian atmosphere .. That's great. If you're a Bath fan like me, you'll love watching this movie! The performance may sound a bit "melodramatic", but I think this film, like the novel itself, deliberately makes fun of popular stories about romance and horror and about the society of the time. The only drawback is probably female leadership, because I personally have another idea of ​​Catherine Morland's physical appearance. Music is also a little "unusual" .. but strangely I consider it acceptable, although it has nothing to do with the historical period. I wonder what a respectable Jane would think ... :)
