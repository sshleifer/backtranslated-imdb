Ronald Coleman was the star of the screen for several years when interviews appeared, and what it was for his career. His Oxford English accent is so charming that I could listen to him reciting a farmer's almanac and not getting bored. Coleman plays Willie Hale, a 30-year-old playboy from a wealthy family who spends his time getting married and gambling. However, it is a likeable tramp - not only sympathetic from the perspective of the audience, but also family and friends. He broke again because of his constant gambling and sells his property abroad to deal with his debts and provide a passage to England. When he gets there, he first meets his father, who insists on kicking him out - he has it with Willi and his lay ways. However, five minutes alone in the room with Willie and his charm, and Willie is not just forgiven by his father, Dad gave him a hundred pounds to start. Willie then goes on a daily recreation with his sister and her boyfriend, Dorothy Hope (Loretta Young). Dorothy is ready to engage with the Grand Duke Paul at night, mainly because her father wants a royal degree in the family and there is no one else in his life. It will change after his day with Willie, and soon there is a cooking scandal as Dorothy refuses to go through with the marriage as planned. Ronald Coleman is always a pleasure to watch in these early-speaking movies he did for Sam Goldwyn, where he plays an adventurer or cad or both. He has behaviors similar to Errol Flynn, but he is unable to display Flyn's physical agility due to the wounding injury he received during World War I. However, what he lacks in physical agility Coleman has always formed in Soul Agility. Loretta Young, just 17 when this picture was made, shows the beginning of her sweet girl who can explode into a fireball when the opportunity demands it. Myrna Loy plays Willie's girl from the past - Mary Crayle - showgirl. Here Myrna still plays a part similar to the exotic works of vampires she has so often encountered at Warner Brothers when she was a contract player from 1926 until this movie was made in 1930. <br /> <br /> is almost light and fresh romantic comedy from start to finish. If you're in the mood for a kind of escapist entertainment that lightened the audience's heart during the Great Depression, this little movie fits into the law.
