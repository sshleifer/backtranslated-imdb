In fact, there were only three of the Korean films I saw with me. The first of them is an excellent horror story Two Sisters. The second and third - and now fourth - have all Park Chan Wook movies, namely Oldboy, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance) and now thirst. The park reminds me of Quentin Tarantino with his hostility to conventions. All his films are shocking, but not without reason. Rather, it shows us what we do not expect - typically situations that radically oppose social morality, such as incest or libidinous, the blood-sucking but pious priest. He is also quite artistic in cinematography, and his films are among the most beautiful ones I've ever seen. Thirst is all that is - about the priest and the suppressed woman without conscience. will fall - and more. It is horror, drama and even comedy, because Park disarms its audience with many inappropriate but humorous situations. As such, it could be his best job for me, because his other two films I saw lacked a humorous element that would make them more enjoyable for repeated tours.
