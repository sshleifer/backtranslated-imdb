This was one of my favorite concerts when I was a kid. It was all - music, stories, talking squirrel and laughter of daisies. I wanted to be one of those hippie chicks singing and swinging on a swing. I'm 35 and I grew up in South Jersey, but we have three New York channels with our cable connection, and I think it was on channel 11. It bothers me that I grew up with 9 channels on our TV, but I could always find something that would be great to watch. I only talked to one other person I actually heard about and watched this show. She is three years younger than me and grew up in North Jersey. I'd like to see this series on DVD so I could show it to my 5-year-old daughter and she could see what a stupid (but great) thing her mother was watching! I just found a VHS tape from several episodes and a music CD from an eBay show, and I bought them straight up, even though they were a bit more expensive. I can't wait to revive great memories again!
