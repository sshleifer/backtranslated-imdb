The undisputed highlight of this film is Peter O'Toole's performance. In return, wildly comic and terribly terribly tragic. Does anyone better than O'Toole do that? I do not think so. What a big face a man has! The story is strange and very distracting and emotionally intense in games (especially towards the end), but it is also oddly moving and has succeeded on many levels. I felt that the film was basically revolving around the light performance of Peter O'Toole, and I'm sure I wouldn't even enjoy it half if it wasn't there.
