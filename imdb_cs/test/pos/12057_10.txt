So many times, Bollywood tried to remake Hollywood hits just to produce total duds. Mercifully, Yash Chopra's interpretation of "Sleeping with the Enemy" is very stylish and well-made films. Shah Rukh Khan is obsessed with Juhi Chawla (who is watching her best here!). Realizing that Juhi's fianc√© is in Sunny Deola, she stops for nothing to make sure he's his. <br /> <br /> Every film in this movie is a pleasure to watch. Be it Shah Rukh chanting his mark "I love you, K ... k ... kiran!" or scenic scenes between Sunny and Juhi (who fit perfectly), you won't want to be eaten in boredom. <br /> <br /> Every song on the soundtrack is nice, especially Jaada Teri Nazar and Tu Mere Samne. As I said, Juhi looks like a goddess in this movie. Darr doesn't have to be the best SRK movie (the honor goes to Baazigaru), but it's definitely one of his most successful shows! Sunny is fine. He has done similar roles before, but he is good. Overall, Darr g ... g ... g ... great! ;)
