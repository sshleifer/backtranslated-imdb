Overall, this is a funny and weird movie. Don't try to understand it. There are more holes in the story than the computer could keep up with, but Robert Cummings and the cast of tiny characters are mostly fun to watch in this "Fugitive" -like story. Unlike the popular television show and then the 1993 film, this fugitive does not seek a single-armed man, but a two-armed Nazi saboteur named "Frank Fry." Cummings ("Barry Kane") is blamed. when a defensive factory explodes in Los Angeles and continues to search for the man who did (Fry) to delete his name. <br /> <br /> The first 40 minutes or so are very tense and interesting. Then Priscilla Lane ("Pat Martin") enters the story and starts to crazy with some unfortunate dialogue. Director Alfred Hitchcock often did this with his female characters to the point that I wonder if she has any idea how the woman is talking. Lane's character was a bit lame. In fact, in my opinion, the best criminals who played Otto Kruger ("Charles Tobin") and Norman Lloyd ("Frank Fry"). ..is fascinating. Kruger's playing and dialogues were particularly good. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, but have seen Hitchcock known to the North of the North, you'll be laughing at the end and really enjoying it. Instead of the top scene at Mount Rushmore, we have an unforgettable last 10 minutes in the State of Freedom. As usual, the Hitchcock camera angles are great and fun.
