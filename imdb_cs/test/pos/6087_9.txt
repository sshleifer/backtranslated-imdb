The "English Patient" can rightly be compared to the films of David Lean, whose extensive epics such as "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Bridge on the River Kwai" had to inspire director Anthony Minghell. The film is beautifully photographed and as Lawrence takes place in North Africa, but during World War II. The story is complicated, but it is reduced to a forbidden love between a secret and often difficult archaeologist who plays Ralph Fiennes and married female actor Kristin Scott Thomas. The story, based on the novel by Michael Ondaatje, is said in the flashbacks Fiennes' Count Laszlo de Almasy - titular character. The fact that his name does not sound like him plays a key role in what is unfolding. He was badly burned in an air crash, occurring just as the film opens, and is cared for back in Europe by Han, an army sister played by Juliette Binoche. What makes this epic story is a huge intersection across place and time and the development of characters that are beyond the two unfortunate lovers. The film explains that true love and passion, even with feared consequences, can make life worth living or worth dying. If you are romantic in the heart and you can appreciate the film without the standard happy endings and simple moral codes, you can find that the English patient speaks directly to you. <br /> <br />
