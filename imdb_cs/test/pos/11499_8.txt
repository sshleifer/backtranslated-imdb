Some people go through life, moving from one thing or from one person to another without burning an eye; others resort to a thing, another person or principle, and remain adamant, devoted to what they are - and figuratively or literally giving their word and standing behind it. But we're all different, `Made from another clay ', as one of the characters in this movie puts it, which is what makes life so interesting. But some people are just crazy - and maybe that's the way you have to live among the masses. Who knows? Who knows what it takes to do it - life - work? Writer / director Lisa Krueger shot at him with a light approach to explore the thin line between committing - and how one gets - and the obsession, in `Committed ', starring Heather Graham as a young woman who is relentless , devoted, obsessed, and maybe a little crazy. It's just called Joline, and that's her story. Joline was always a devoted person; at work, in relationships, in life in general. She is the woman of her word that holds her no matter what she is. And when she marries Carl (Luke Wilson), it's forever. The only problem is that someone forgot to tell Carl and 597 days into marriage is gone; turn it off to "find" it and find it all. When Joline realizes she doesn't come back, she refuses to give up, or their marriage. Maybe it's because it's made of clay. Regardless of leaving his home in New York and embarking on him, she does - in El Paso, Texas, from all places. But as soon as he knows where he is, he keeps his distance, gives him space, and doesn't let him know he's there. He considers Carl to be a "spiritual coma" and it is her work to maintain spiritual vigilance over him until he reaches his senses. And while she watches and waits, her life is different than boring when she meets a young woman named Carmen (Patricia Velazquez), a waitress at one of the local restaurants; Carmen `s Gramps, '(Alfonso Arau), which is something of a mystic; T-Bo (Mark Ruffalo), a truck driver who has problems with Carl; and Neil (Goran Visnjic) an artist who does pinatas and takes a taste for it. For Joline, this is a way of discovery, during which he learns a lot about Carl, but more about himself. There is a touch of humor, a touch of romance, and some views of human nature, this unpredictable film that is more about characterization and character than conspiracy. And Krueger presents it all very well, bringing a movie that is engaging and entertaining. Her characters are very real people, with all the wishes, needs, and imperfections that make up human condition; a rich and eclectic bunch over which he tells his story. We see this from Joline's point of view because Krueger makes us grief at Jolin's thoughts, and hence his motivations, which make a decisive look at the events as they evolve. This, together with the deliberate pace it sets and allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the atmosphere it creates, creates a very effective piece of narration. There is a fundamental esteem to this topic, but Krueger decides to avoid something heavily-hand or too deep and concentrates instead on natural humor that develops from people and situations that Joline meets. The result is a well-structured, impressive and positive view of what we call life. Heather Graham has taken this role from the first film to make Joline her own character. creation. Diving into the game and giving a performance that is convincing and believable, it adds small personal features and nuances that make the difference between being a mere representation of man and one that is real. And to make this film work, it was necessary for Joline to be viable and credible - and Graham succeeded on all fronts. Her presence on the screen has never been so enticing, and her lively personality, or even the way she uses her eyes, is enough to pull you completely. it is just part of the character he creates; it is a call to Joline who radiates from all over her face who is inside and out. He is a nice, friendly person, and because you shared her innermost thoughts with her, you know who he is. It's a good job all the time, starting with the way the character was written, to how Graham animates her so vividly. Like Carmen, Patricia Velazquez is also absolutely engaging. Her performance is very natural and straightforward and uses her instincts to effectively shape her character. It has a charismatic presence, but is less than spectacular, and gives it an aspect that is appealing down. It is refreshingly open and up-front; you have the impression that Carmen is not something that should stop anything, but is absolutely honest on all fronts, and that is also part of her appeal. And like Joline, this character is well written and Velazquez convincingly brings her to life. Overall, there are a number of remarkable performances that are the heart and soul of this film, including Luke Wilson, Casey Affleck (as Jolina's brother, Jay), Goran Visnjic, Alfonso Arau and especially Mark Ruffalo as T -Bo, who with very little real time on the screen managed to create an unforgettable character. Supporting cast includes Kim Dickens (Jenny), Clea Du Vall (Mimi), Summer Phoenix (Meg), Art Alexakis (New York Car Thief), Dylan Baker (Carl's Editor) and Mary Kay Place (Psychiatrist) ). A film that says something about the value of returning to consider the Great Image - reflecting on who we are, where we go and what we really need - "Involved" is a pleasant experience; The ride is definitely worth it. 8/10.
