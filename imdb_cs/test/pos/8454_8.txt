The Bridges drama about a reporter who discovers any deficiencies in the security measures taken at a nuclear power plant is well done and an interesting film from the late 1970s. It's not amazing, but its solid, acting is pretty good, especially Jack Lemmon, but Douglas and Fonda were also good. It was a pretty good scenario, and Bridges' direction was solid and appropriate. This is definitely not one of the best 70's movies, but one of the best. Good Early Michael Douglas Movie and Lemmon in Its Premiere .--- IMDb Rating: 7.2, My Ratings: So in Simple Words, Fixed But Not Amazing ... That's What This Movie Is But Not Amazing 8 / 10
