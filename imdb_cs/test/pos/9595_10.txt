As a reviewer has already commented, this for the television comedy is there among the best football parodies ever. But .... when I failed the video when it was first aired, I find it not in any format. OK, so this was only 17 votes today, but the average of 9+ seems to suggest something special. Basically, I think it's a case of hard luck if you missed it because it's no longer available to watch !! Aaaaaaaargh.
