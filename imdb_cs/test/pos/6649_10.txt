How is it that you like and don't like the same movie? The storyline is very similar to what Jody Foster, Sommersby, just not so good. Nicole was great. They haven't given him many lines ... is that the reason? In general, he's a pretty good actor. He is so elegant, his character is so bumpkin. It makes one wonder what they see in themselves. Romance between the two was only successful in Lover Lady Chatterly. I think I don't like it because the movie is too long. They could tell it in two hours. The story is good. Good places, good filming. The characters of the actors were great.
