In this film there are influences of other sci-fi and thriller films and stories. Films that come to mind immediately are Alien, Aliens and Starship Troopers. The story itself is fairly straightforward and not everything that is original, hibernated space travel, a landing crash on a planet with no apparent life, and an "abandoned" geological expedition - except when the lights go out, forcing different types of people to work together on their mutual survival while the body counts horses. This kind of movie is always fun if it's done well. I believe Pitch Black was well done. The characters are interesting and you want to know more about them the longer the film continues, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't do it. Vin Diesel plays Riddick, a stereotypical convicted criminal who has a murderous past, physical fitness, high tolerance to pain, and comfortably sees in the dark. You know he'll end up in the film at the right time, because the film suggests that he may actually have conscience about things. Cole House plays a drug addict a bounty hunter who seems to be a real bad guy in many ways compared to Riddick because his character is revealed throughout the film. It is very likely that it is the bravest when there are chances and firepower in its favor. A very self-serving character that at the end gets what he deserves. Radha Mitchell plays a co-pilot on a convicted ship that is jolted out of deep sleep because the ship ran a meteor swarm or at the end of the comment. He searches for a pilot dead in the sleeping chamber and attempts to land on the ship, leading to our discovery of a potentially fatal error of this nature - fear of responsibility, responsibility and leader. Her character is likely to grow the most in the short storyline, in that a certain belief actually grows, takes the lead and does not sit around waiting to be absorbed at night by the persecution of strangers. In some strange way, he associates himself with the still distant human side of Riddick, who in the end respects it for his choices and stick to them. The story happens in some cases as you would expect, but I think you'll be slightly surprised by the characters that survive this horrible experience. This movie is a fun train-wreck during tracking. Go look! <br /> <br />
