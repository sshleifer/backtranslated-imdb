I still haven't read one book by Dan Brown, but I've been watching all his film adaptations. I will not fall into the game to rate this with the previous one because the range is not really the same: in fact, it is a thriller, a race with time puzzles. The plot is very twisted, imaginative, and cast is excellent: I've never been a big fan of Hanks, but it's well done. I noticed his jeans shirt (the one that shed with blood) because I was looking for it in vain! The Italian search engine is a great newcomer to me, but I really appreciated the portrait of Ewan MacGregor: his inner faith and calm is really impressive. I really like the debate between science and religion. The event, which takes place in the Vatican, seemed to be a holiday. Finally, I'm not sure it helps to add new converts to Christianity. With all the gold and man present, anyone would ask what charity means and why women are almost released from church life while they are worth half or more believers.
