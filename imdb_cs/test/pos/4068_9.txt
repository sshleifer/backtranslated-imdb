Despite all the negative criticism, I really enjoyed this film. I'm not saying it easily. I love movies and I'm pretty picky about them (my home DVD collection is over 9,000 movies - some are great, others are fine, I don't like a couple at all). And to all who have criticism: it's a comedy. I just love this movie. It is light, fun and very quiet. I am aware of all (or most) deficiencies, but I love it. Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNir's comedy talents are tapped (fully for this type of film). Don't compare it with other movies with these star actors, just enjoy it. The cast is great and I believe the purpose of this film has been completed. If you want a really "easy" and very quiet night - watch this movie. DeNiro and Murphy just enjoyed doing this movie so we should (observe). And please don't be so negative. Don't expect the Godfather's Performance or Meet the Parents of DeNiro to expect Comedy Blockbusters to come out of Murphy ... It's a completely different genre, and that allowed me to relax after a busy day. Your parties don't have to split up from laughter, but it's still very fun.
