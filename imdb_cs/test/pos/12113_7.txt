Lloyd Hamilton was one of the most imaginative (and among the funniest) of all silent film comedians. Why is it completely forgotten? Unfortunately, the original negatives for a large percentage of his films were lost when the Fox Warehouse burned in the early 1930s. Hamilton was not handsome or graceful as Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd; neither was he as powerful as Raymond Griffith. And unlike Harry Langdon and (again) Chaplin, Hamilton didn't try to sympathize with the audience. However, his films were immensely popular at the time of their original release, and today they remain cheerful. Oscar Levant once claimed to have asked Chaplin if he was a comedian he had ever envied, and Chaplin was immediately named Lloyd Hamilton. The character most often portrayed by Hamilton on screen - an apartment-limited naff, with quick hand gestures and a duck-like walk - was later adapted by vaudeville comedian Eddie Garr (Teri Garr's Father), and further adapted by Jackie Gleason as his television character "The Poor". Soul ”from the 1950s. 'The Movies', filmed pseudonymously by Roscoe Arbuckle, is one of Hamilton's most innovative shorts and it's fun. First we see him as a country boy, saying goodbye to his family outside their home hut, on their way to the big city. Then he moves away from the hut, and we see that it is in a big city, where it is developing to the right! Finally, our hero ends up in a restaurant (no accreditation, but it is a Montmartre café). LA), where all film actors eat with each other. There is a funny gag when Hamilton's bumpkin character meets three actors in costume and make-up as presidents Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt: this gag would be more fun if the crooks looked more like originals. Finally, our boy sits at a table and hopes to meet a celebrity. Sure, entering the restaurant and sitting at the nearest table is a big movie star ... none other than Lloyd Hamilton! There is a very well-made double exposure shot - the connection is almost invisible - when Lloyd Hamilton as himself greets Lloyd Hamilton as a country boy. Unfortunately, Hamilton's peak period of creativity was very brief. He began his film career in raw films as one half of the double act (Ham and Bud, opposite Bud Duncan), and during a short silent time he had a short and flaming time of fame in shorts. The sound films were not affectionate to Hamilton and he was quickly demolished into the cast cast in some rough early interviews. Then he died young. Fortunately, "The Movies" is a very entertaining and great introduction to this unique comic style. I will rate it 7 out of 10.
