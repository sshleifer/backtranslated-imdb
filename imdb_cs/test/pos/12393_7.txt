It is a widely acknowledged fact that Marcel Carne's 1936-1946 films are masterful gifts and it is polite to say that the rest are mediocinity. This is an unfair opinion: at least two of the second era are wary: "Thérèse Raquin", his best post-war work and "les tricheurs" (fraud). From the golden hour of Prevert, this is a special development: the "forest triumphs": in "les enfants du paradis" "quai des brumes" "or" le jour se lève ", true love is thwarted by villains. In "les tricheurs" true love no longer exists: we are dealing with a bunch of young people who believe in nothing, falling in love would be incompatible with this youth. Adults are not at all wicked: Mic's brother and mother are kind people, but she's out of their command. Within two hours, characters continue to play around, dance, listen to jazz records (music that hasn't yet been a part of bourgeois culture) and strong drinks. When two of them find out they're taking care of themselves, it's too late. The cast is rather good, Laurent Terzieff as an existential cynic and Andréa Parisian as a rich boy is a stand-out. On the other hand, Pascale Petit and especially Jacques Charrier (who married Brigitte Bardot in the same year as the "tricheurs of the forest") do not have the ambiguity their partners demand. , too sweet and nice to be believable. Especially "les tricheurs" was called "nouvelle vague"! u know what priests of this school cinema (the likes of godard) thought of carne, it's a really good joke. But this disillusionment makes you feel like the whole movie is really disturbing.
