Jack Frost 2 is probably the most delicious movie I've ever seen in my life. The full title of the film is Jack Frost 2: The Snowman Mutant Revenge of the Killer. Horror fans who have a taste for camping story lines, will be pleased to watch. This movie was right on video and for good reasons. Here's why: Negotiations were so horrible and so horrible that they could cause someone to start crying. The main character had no personality, and the act of bad acting made it all worse. The script was also cruel. Every character always says a shabby line and adds cheesy lines to the choreography, then you have something wrong. Secondly, the story is not really that impressive, but because the film was directly on video, it is forgiven. The director and writer could change the idea of ​​a snowman killer to something cold, but not. They story has a lot of plot holes in it. Initially, a cup of coffee and a melted Jack Frost are thrown into the aquarium. Scientists are trying to restore his life, but they couldn't. Once the cup of coffee fell into the tank, Jack Frost was completely restored. Now he is immune to frost. In Jack Frost Part 1, the main character DNA was mixed with Anti-Freeze, which was used to kill Jack Frost. Since the main character is allergic to bananas, Jack Frost is also. Here's my opinion. They say Sam's DNA combined with Jack Frost. But one of the scientists had some saliva on the cup, so when he fell into the tank, DNA scientists would be linked to Jack Frost. Another thing special effects were not very good. Here are some good points: Jack Frost 2 has a lot of blood that looks pretty realistic. Although this movie is defective to hell, it is still fun. Overall, Jack Frost 2 is a fun horror movie. The first was better. 7 out of 10.
