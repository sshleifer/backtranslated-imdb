I am amazed at how a filmmaker known for his political left-wing zeal could create such a subtle, impersonal image. If you are for the death penalty, you will still be after you see it. If you are against the death penalty, you will still be against it. Whatever your attitude, this film is at least thinking about why you feel the way you feel. There is no false comment in the film.
