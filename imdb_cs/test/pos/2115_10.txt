This is the kind of movie I grew up on. It is a great family fun that children love and parents also enjoy. I wish more movies like that. It's a great story about a little boy who picks up a bull with his mother and sister and shows it all the way to the national championship where he wins! Then he is afraid that someone is going to grill his bull so he can kidnap him and go home. I was really excited when I first saw this movie in a theater and I was surprised to see George Strait, Julie Roberts and Bruce Willis in this little movie. The music was great with all sorts of huge country names like Willie Nelson and Dixie Chicks. Anyone who enjoys this film has no children or has never been a boy who is himself.
