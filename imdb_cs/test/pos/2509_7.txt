Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a bookstore in the sleepy coastal town of Loblolly by the sea. Divorced, Helen has a young daughter who goes to camp for the summer, giving her mother a little more freedom. Working in the store Helen's manager, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres), a man-crazy village-gossip girl who has eyes for a handsome fireman, George (Tom Selleck), and two young college students, Jennifer (Julianne Nicholson) and Johnny (Tom Everett Scott ). One day Helen encounters a romantic, tender love letter and suspects that Johnny has written it. Helen and Johnny are throwing carefully into the wind and starting a small "thing". But the letter will land in the hands of others, including Janetina, who thinks George sent it to her, and Johnny, who imagined him. And the letter goes. But in fact George may have eyes for Helen and Jennifer has fallen hard for Johnny. The city's curator can also have a secret love. Will matters such as these be confused? This is a cute movie with beautiful settings and capable stars. Each of the main actors gives pleasing performance, including the addition of Blythe Danner and Gloria Stuart to those previously mentioned. Also the coastal scenery is the most beautiful, the costumes quite well chosen and the photos very nice. There are several surprises including subtle gay plot development that may not please all viewers. But for those who love romantic comedies, he should be included in any list of good genre options.
