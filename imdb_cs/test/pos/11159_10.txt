This movie is full of interesting ideas. Some scenes are really fun. Dialogs are funny and colloquial. The tension in the film does not come so much from the conspiracy of "murderous mystery" as from the relationship between the characters. The film tells two stories in parallel. The first story includes characters playing Trintignant and Kassovitz. Trintignant is an aging wanderer, with a somewhat ridiculous macho tenacity, followed by a naive young man who plays Kassovitz with a lot of good smiles. Many good moments in the film come from the contrast between the two characters, for example, when Trintignant tries to teach Kassovitz how to intimidate. The second story tells how the salesman who plays Jean Yanne gives and his wife to find a young friend's killer. Yanne plays a role with some sort of aggressive irony. I wish I could describe it better. After a while, the viewer understands how the two stories are connected and at the end they really meet in both a surprising and logical end. The film is a successful blend of witty but superficial gangster films once written by the director's father (famous Michel Audiard) and a "typical French film" with a lot of psychological depth and plenty of care to portray emotions.
