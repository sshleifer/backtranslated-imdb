Wallace and Gromit are the main characters in the best cartoons ever created. An excellent mix of visual humor and deception makes "A Grand Day Out", "The Wrong Trousers", and "Close Shave" some of the best animated shots ever on television. Nick Park won several Oscars as well as numerous other awards and became a popular man in the US, but his impact on the United States was not great. After the third Wallace and Gromit, everything about Wallace and Gromit was about what was happening, about the fact that nothing happened. Then in 2000, instead of the full-featured movie Wallace and Gromit, we get another great movie about Claymation from Nick Park, which was Chicken Run, who was almost nominated for the best Academy Award. Perhaps it was the success of this film that eventually parked Park to finally work on Wallace and Gromit. 5 years later (these kinds of movies take a long time) and a lot of expectations, Wallace and Gromit finally hit the big screen. Despite somewhat weak trailers and a marketing campaign, this film brings in many ways. The film will be a pleasure for both children and parents. With the tones of adult humor hidden under brilliant animation, Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of Were-Rabbit is one of the few films that perfectly master equally attractive for children and adults. This somewhat difficult technique is that only Pixar has finished and DreamWorks has a lot of problems lately. Despite the fact that the DreamWorks logo hit the poster, this film comes mainly from the creative team of Aardman Animations. which apparently ran around wild and in large quantities lately. Their business has received respect from others who live in the city because of the huge competition for vegetables and crops needing protection. The complications arise when Wallace tries to manipulate rabbits so that they do not like vegetables, and then a large dining machine is released. It depends on Wallace and Gromit to find a gigantic animal and prevent him from eating through the gardens and their consent from the city's inhabitants. To add that Wallace wants to impress Lady Tottington, who also captured the attention of a snobby suitor named Victor. Simple conspiracy yes, but there is more than just an eye, get ready for some fun surprises along the way, just like in other Wallace and Gromit cartoons. <br /> <br /> In animated movies with a small dialogue, it's an animation that needs to set the stimulation and mood of the movie. Despite 5 years of producing only 85 minutes of recording, the reward is fantastic. There is a huge amount of detail that requires more than one viewing. Even more incredible than detailed and almost flawless animation is the inexpressible amount of visual humor embedded in the film. Whether it's creatively placed shots or normal labels placed in the funniest position, or it's oh-so adorable rabbits, which is constantly being portrayed in the movie, most of the humor of Were-Rabbit is strictly from watching the movie and capturing all the links before it will be too late. Just imagine the Madagascar film, in addition to a much more fun, much less pop culture link and better animation. Casting was great, though it wasn't so important in a film with too much dialogue. Peter Sallis is once again doing a great job like Wallace, although in this movie there was no stand-out quote that can be used at any time (The Wrong Trousers: "It's the Wrong Trousers Gromit, and they've gone wrong!"). Ralph Fiennes has a great job as the main villain Victor and also Helena Bonham Carter (known as the crazy female lead in the cult hit "Fight Club") lends her a beautiful voice when she plays Wallace's love interest. Though nothing could be in the first place in "The Wrong Trousers", the curse of Ware-Rabbit had a lot of action scenes, including one fantastically made chase scene between Gromit and Victor's evil dog. Last but not least, rabbits really steal the show at some moments. Whether they are their cute expressions, their funny moves or their howls, the rabbits in the film even take a part of the fame from the main stars. The funniest rabbit in the movie is the "cursed" rabbit himself, until the very end of the film he had an audience rolling in laughter. <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: Despite being as unforgettable as "bad pants this movie is just as good and fun as Chicken Run. Unlike almost every movie coming out this year, the movie doesn't drag at all, hitchhiking in a short 85 minutes it still contains so much joy and fun, it will let everyone watch it asking for more.This film is very poor, it was pure pleasure watching.This film is a total contrast of decent but vulgar, uncut, raw movies which made a surprising amount of money this year (40-year-old Virgo, Wedding Crashers and Sin City) and for families and those who want harmless fun, that's a good thing, I highly recommend, it's the best animated movie that will be released this year and is among the best that we've seen in this decade Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of Were-Rabbit: a totally harmless pastime from 1 to 5 5.100.
