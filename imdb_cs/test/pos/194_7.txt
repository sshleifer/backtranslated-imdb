After watching this film, it is not difficult to see why post-silent Soviet cinema holds such a small critical respect. Don't get me wrong. DRIVES ARE FLYING, is at least extremely entertaining for the first half, boasting an ease of touch unexpectedly from its country of origin; a fresh, agile, spacious technique that eventually irritates as much as the spell; two stunning subjective pieces; and a romantic dash that flirts with, but never quite disturbs, in Lelouch. It's just that in his casting of huge social, national and world affairs a love affair is basically no different from a conventional Hollywood movie. Of course in the Soviet Union, which emphasized the state Especially in the era (World War II), which suppressed individualism and freedom to assert the murderous symbolism, this foreground of two attractive young lovers is a relief. And the thematic similarities - all the love consumed by war - with the two most beautiful of all films (SEVENTH HEAVEN, LES PARAPLUIES DE CHERBOURG) also contributes to her potential lover. The story is simple enough. Boris, a young factory worker from a bright medical and artistic family, and Veronika, a student, make a seductive relationship at night, one free time. Boris's cousin Mark, the composer, also has eyes on Veronica. When the Nazis invade Russia, Boris secretly volunteers to stir his family and lover. She promises to write Veronica, but she never does, she thinks she may not have bothered to see him off, or maybe the mail is just unreliable. Veronica's parents are dying in a raid and moving with Boris's family, helping the hospital where his father beats the wounded soldiers. Desperate by Boris's silence, Veronika is also struck by Mark's attention, who has been exempt from military duty by bribing a local official. She is eventually worn out, and marries him, to her adoptive family's disapproval. Meanwhile, Boris is killed in action. Disgusted with herself and adulterous Mark, Veronika refuses to believe it and waits for her return, supporting young orphans bearing his name. The title refers to birds that the couple sees at the height of their love, symbolic perhaps its transcendental, epiphanic power. But it is illusory - cranes fly in V and this shape goes through the film, through geometric shapes of buildings, interiors, exteriors, groupings of people, composition, camera angles, heroine name - or the adjustment in which the feet walking southwest in one story meet feet walking southeast in another. This serves the fatal capture of lovers who have no control over their fates, and also suggests Stalin's power, which is never, specifically, mentioned in the film. Though the pair seems to be free in the universe, literally in an untransparent environment, or privileged in generous detail, they are always ironized, minimized, torn - depending on circumstances, families, crowds (see, brilliant, where obvious, sequences where Veronika is swallowed up by tanks, or the couple fail to meet in a huge crowd), or simply by the structure of a film that continues to distance itself, through parallelism, to their proximity. Although at the beginning, lightness and clarity of the style suggest a beautiful romantic idyll, it is constantly smashed by strange adjustments or camera angles of disturbing snippets of music. Most notable is how these blocks of romance are achieved by abstracting rather than emphasizing historical forces. The whole film, but above all the war itself, is strangely unreal and dreamlike, never showing its harsh, brutal reality, just its effects on the lover. In fact, it is transformed into a majestic spectacle, without ugly Germans. <br /> <br /> On the home front, air raids create excellent light and shadow effects, or ruins of almost Gothic decadence. In the bunker, the threat of the Soviet Empire is less important than Boris's perceived indifference. Empty, one-way Moscow spaces, which lovers initially, rather than Veronika with their mother, go though less current than emotional spaces. When Mark tries to force Veronica, the raid is a less destructive reality than the symbolic release of sexual and emotional frustrations. This is a great sequence, filmed by a silent, expressionist horror in which the screen appears to burst with hysteria and violence, all the more convincing for the wisdom of the finer scenes of earlier scenes. There's not much difference. on the front, where the struggle for the honor of girls is more urgent than tactics, Nazis or despair. The movement of Boris and his wounded comrade to the final space is another abstracting of the experience of war, its setting in the forest, which gives it sexual dynamism; and Boris's ultimate, pre-death flashback is an extraordinary blend of dream fulfillment and increased anxiety in which what he wants becomes grim and grotesque. From now on, the film becomes a little less interesting, somewhat more obvious. One more understanding for expressionist overload - Veronika's suicide attempt and her child's rescue - is clumsy; and her murderous guilt casts a paralyzing shadow on the whole film. The use of a deep focus, at first devastation, will soon become wearable, without any moral power or meaning that Welles brought to use in CITIZEN KANE. After it seems that the critically critical critique of totalitarianism in favor of the individual at the end seems to be cruelly betrayed when individual suffering, so often in Russian art, turns into a symbolic (ie, Headless, dehumanized) hope. Damage.
