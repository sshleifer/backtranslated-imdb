(Some Spoilers) Bruce Campbell took about 19 years to finally put his masterpiece "Man With Screams" on the screen. But Campbell had to change his story by playing him in Sofia, Bulgaria for financial problems, and not where he originally wanted to be filmed in Los Angeles, California. In the film Burce Campbell, the US plays pharmaceutical mogul Willian Cole, who travels along with the corrupt spoiled wife of Jackie, Antoinette Byron, to the former Republic of Bulgaria. William is there to help finance an almost non-existent public transport system in Bulgaria. It's bad William's misfortune to engage with both Gypsy wife Taya, Tamara Gorska, and her former friend Yegor, Valdimir Kolev. , a former KGB taxi driver. Both William and Yegor unknowingly end up cutting their brains, inside William's skull, because Tatoya is jealousy and vengeance. After Tatoya murderes both William and Yegor, their bodies are passed on to the mad scientist Dr. Ivan Ivanowitch Ivanov, Stacy Keach, his loyal assistant, Pavel Ted Raimi, to experiment with brains. Dr. Ivanov has this theory that two heads are better than one. And now with the material, William & Yegor, available to Dr. Ivanov finally shows it. What Dr. Ivanov finds out sadly that by combining both heads or brains, their brain waves overlap, causing them to not only go wrong, but also against each other! William and Yegor's right lobe fit into his damaged brain to find Tatoya and pay her for the damage she caused to him and Yegor. Yegor is stuck in William's head for his part, who likes and enemies, both in food and drink, is completely opposite to his own. This causes a lot of tension and hostility between the two brains in them fighting for control of William's body! Things get even worse when Jackie discovers that Tietoya murdered her husband William, who faces her in a dangerous and highly criminal section of Bravody calls Gypsy the city and ends up being murdered herself. His assistant, Pavel Pavel, returned to Dr. Ivanov, without any available body, to put Jackie's brain inside the experimental robot on which Paul works. Operation is a huge success, but the only drawback is that Jackie, with the brain inside the robot, must have a busy brain every few hours! Or, like a real brain that has no oxygen, it will die with the batteries of the robot. The combination of the 1930s, such as the ball-and-horror comedy, with William and Yegor, turning the Bulgarian city of Bravoda up in an effort to find Tatoya and her reward, with her life, for the sad state of existence that they she gave them both. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ALERT *** It's Dr. Ivanov, who actually saves the day by finding out how to keep two brains before the fight, and so work together! He does this instead of mixing his brains together. Ivanov retain them independent by inserting a neutralizing cell wall between two uncooperative gray matter globs.
