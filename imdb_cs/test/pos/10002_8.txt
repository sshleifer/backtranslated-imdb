I saw this movie in a sneaky look and it's wonderful. Cinematography is unusually creative, acting is good and the story is wonderful. If this movie doesn't do well, it won't be because it doesn't deserve it. Before this movie, I didn't realize how charming Shia Lebouf might be. As a leader, she does an amazing, independent job. There is something incredibly sweet on it and the film is even better. The other actors also work well and the film contains moments of really high tension, more than one could expect from a golf movie. Sports movies are dozens, but this one is great. <br /> <br /> That's one I would recommend to everyone.
