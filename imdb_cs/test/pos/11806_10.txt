Although this is a bad look at gays, this film sheds light on the viewer for the myths and inaccuracies about AIDS. Despite the depressing theme, this film depicts a warm friendship between the two boys, and will make you laugh as well as cry. Everyone was very good, especially Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro. The language is a bit strong, though appropriate, and it's a fun and intelligent movie for the whole family. But don't forget to have Kleenex ready!
