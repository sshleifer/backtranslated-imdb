OK, so the following review is more synopsis than that it really contains some spoilers, but better safe than sorry to avoid blacklisting, right? Right! Consider being officially warned, and read on ... <br /> <br /> In this parody / tribute to the greatest time in horror movie history - the 1980s - a group of stupid teens meet to host sessions at the notorious McGee killer , who defeated the whole family again a few years and buried them in the yard. As I am sure you can guess things go from bad to worse faster than you can say "Where is the beef?" and in the typical horror fashion of the 1980s, death is bloody, dialogue is cheesy, and beautiful women take their clothes off every chance. Good times ... <br /> <br /> There are no clicks or horoscope in the 1980s. In fact, no stone remained unrotated at all? we have a great hero, his innocent girlfriend, a goth chick, a hard robber (I mean John Bender), a hot blonde who loses her shirt, shy dork in love with a hot blonde who still loses her shirt, a couple of gorgeous half naked lesbians and two big geeks. <br /> <br /> As you can see clearly, the cast is big enough. Larger castings are usually where things can quickly disintegrate, with one or two sour apples bugging the entire barrel. Not in this case. Not one member I cast disappointed me. The meeting was very good. All from the super hero in his jacket Thriller playing Jovan Meredith to groo's Goth Chick played Renee Dorian on Geeks One & Two played by Cory Assink & Jonathan Brett ?? they all played straight, brought an A-game and left the park. If you are a fan of Gary and Wyatt in Weird Science, you will immediately fall in love with geeks. Director / co-founder Jeff C. Smith is a man you can watch in the future trust me. If that's what he can do with a low budget, there's nothing but good things for him to get more money for future projects. The characters were dead; the atmosphere was perfect; laughter was huge; blood flowed and sprayed and sprayed beautifully? it was like watching the 80's horror movie. Call this "THE CLUB BREAKFAST CLUB meets NIGHT OF DEMONS" !!! The line says it all says, and it says frankly - "EXCELLENT VIOLENCE; GRATUITOUS NUDITY; ZERO BUDGET" - no false advertising, people! As fans of this genre, we have to look at indies and support these hard-working people who are hitting their bumps there bringing us original stories to keep us forever stuck in a world filled with great study watered PG-13. "Horror" or senseless remakes like The Hitcher. No, thank you - nothing more for me. Finally, I must honestly say that STUPID TEENAGERS MUST DIE! is by far one of the best indie flicks I've been enjoying watching this year. It's a damn time and keeps repeating tours. From dialogue to characters to the wardrobe ... even the final theme of love over end credits (which, if it doesn't bring back laughter that recalls the power ballads of the mid-1980s by REO Speedwagon - excessively pronounced R on every word starting with 'R' - then I'll eat my DVD right now ... ... and finally it's if you're a fan of 80 years of horror or horror in general, without hesitation - this movie deserves to be in your collection !!
