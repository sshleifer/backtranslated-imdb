William Wellmann, who directed one of the most interesting films ever made in the world, "Wings" (1927), returns to heaven with another tale of commotion about how he dares. Wellmann was an ace in the First World War and no one knew biplanes like him. Here they are, stunt flying, crashing, exploding in the air and everything you can think of, as well as a fascinating view of commercial air operations in 1932. And there is a good strong story, great sombre Richard Barthelmess (the silent star she made several films with DW Griffith), Sally Eilers and Tom Brown. Eilers is a real sizzler. Such a relief to see a real woman with real fire and character instead of one of those photo botoxs that play in movies in today's Hollywood and all look the same. The story is sad, played with a real pathos and well managed. Towards the end of the film are some extremely exciting scenes of danger and rescue, and what must be the most urgent blind landing in the dense fog he has ever thought. I dare not give up the sophisticated aspects of this particular episode. The character played by Barthelmess is very similar to Wellmann, a really wild predator in the air. Anyone who likes early aviation will love this movie and it is very beneficial for anyone who likes good solid entertainment, love, tears and continuous action in combination with the delicate Wellman omelet.
