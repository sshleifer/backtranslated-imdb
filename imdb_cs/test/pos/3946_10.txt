The weakness of this comes from a confusing narrative, a conspiracy often coming from nothing. But it really didn't matter because I was still enjoying it. Once you really accept that these movies won't be taken too seriously, you'll enjoy it even more. It's basically a love story, at first confusing, but as it evolves, it's really something worthwhile. Of course it was so many times before, but the complicated version is quite inspiring and moving. The above-average fantasy and cgi was initially stunning, but I still enjoyed its purpose. And people stopped whining about how they borrowed from other movies !! Guess what we know! And it doesn't matter because his purpose was humor and fun. Sometimes people have to stop being so critical and thinking for a moment before they scream. Comparing with Hollywood standards is absolutely stupid and ignorant, it is a completely different style and target audience. As for the best films that I have been interested in, there are Eastern producers and directors. There's your police story 4, shaolin football game, kung fu, dragon tiger goal, fist legends, hero, tiger, crouching tiger, and so on. I will always be interested in these types of movies. Now try to judge my perception, but I warn you that I see things from the perspective of the five countries in which I lived.
