In addition to the discotheque scenes that embody the swinging 1960s (especially anyone who dances on instrumental versions of the Monkees hits), I am surprised how well this light farce holds up to 37 years later, but it does so thanks to the fresh realization of her fraud. on the basis of a conspiracy and a sharp interplay of three leaders. This comedy, which is run by an apparent expert on the scene, Gene Saks, is about Julian Winston, a successful Manhattan dentist, and has confirmed a bachelor who pretends to be married to avoid a long-term commitment to a young girlfriend of the year, Toni. In response to Toni attempting suicide suicide attempt, Julian agrees to marry her, but Toni first insists on meeting his wife to alleviate her conscience. Enter Julian's loyal sister Stephanie, who will play with his wife, and the inevitable complications will arise with white lies that grow in great predators that lead to supposed connections and dismantling. As Julian, the relaxed Walter Matthau deftly plays a deceptive dentist in his typically sardonic way, but lets his two female co-stars go away with the picture. In his big-screen debut, pixyish 24-year-old Goldie Hawn still holds his ugly person, "Laugh-In," but provides unexpected wits and depth as Toni. Together with Matthau, they have great, unforced chemistry in their scenes. Legend to the film Ingrid Bergman, still attuned to 54 years old, apparently has a ball playing Stephanie, initially starchy and fast, but evolving into a liberated spirit as the story unfolds. I especially like how she occasionally appears after her overnight stay. Rick Lenz's nice backing work as Toni's bohemian neighbor Igor and Jack Weston as Julian's charming actor Harvey. Billy Wilder is a longtime associate of I.A.L. A diamond that provides a sparkling scenario and opens the story beyond its stage design for Saks, who is not the most important film director. Other than a few trailers, there are no major accessories with DVDs.
