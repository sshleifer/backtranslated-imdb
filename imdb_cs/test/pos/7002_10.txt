This is undoubtedly the most exciting and satisfying movie I've seen in years! The plot seen in the press is almost banal - the ship hits a desert planet with three suns, the survivors must adapt to the landscape and themselves, then darkness falls and monsters appear. Pilot Fry, after a moment of cowardice during the descent through the atmosphere, almost throwing away the passengers, takes the lead of the group and gets the help of the condemned murderer Riddick to guide them through the darkness into the escape ship - it is with better surgery the eyes you see in the dark. But it's not that simple - every character is complex, three-dimensional, with conflicting features, so you never know who's good and who's bad. Performances are Uniformly Excellent - Radha Mitchell shows how Fry finds herself for leadership, overcoming her fears and trying to prevent further bloodshed, while Cole Hauser, as the man takes Riddick back into custody, shows he has his own program and its own idiosyncratic standards. But the movie belongs to Vin Diesel as Riddick - it has the strongest magnetic presentation I've seen in years. For most of the film, his face is in the shade and doesn't really say much, but attracts your attention as well. Sometimes it attracts your attention by not speaking - or moving. And Diesel does not disturb the character as it could easily be done by giving it a "heart of gold" - Riddick is still one evil and cruel man approaching the ship - just allowing us to look into the first experimental steps from Caring Only for yourself to take care of others. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is very good. Light effects are excellent at both ends of the spectrum - excessive triple sunlight and pitch darkness. The special effects that show both Riddick's and Monster's view contribute to tension as well as the sound effects of monsters flying and using ultrasound to "see" (the monsters themselves are anatomically plausible and suitably scary). The cut is so tight that sometimes it is worrying - there is virtually no padding, no fading, a time to reorient. <br /> <br /> From the opening image to the end of the credits you have to take care of you. Every scene, every line of dialogue, every single shot is important. Look at it three times to understand it all. My only reservation is about science - the solar system, as shown in the model, is impossible (planets revolve around the sun, not the other way around). But this has no effect on the human story, so I didn't take points for it.
