A very insightful psychological thriller! Traces are a stylish example of strong Italian filmmaking in the 1970s. Luigi Bazzoni, poorly underrated director and visually stunning author. The film develops its unusual plot with an incredibly thrilling atmosphere and never fails, especially in its sad and dramatic finale! Florinda Bolkan delivers outstanding performance, rich in nuances and touching sensitivity, capable of portraying a dark lady who is not only fascinating but also painfully real and tragically lonely. Lila Kedrova, Nicoletta Elmi (mysterious baby on the beach), Italian legend on canvas of Caterina Boratto and the immensely beautiful Queen B movie Evelyn Stewart in a short but scary role as a friend of the protagonist! And Klaus Kinski in a surprisingly distracting portrait! It's strange to notice how incredibly well done movies like Footprints were! Vittorio Storaro is a whimsical and creepy cinematography, stylized places and sets, the scary score of Nicola Piovani and above all a story, so intense and disturbing, so intelligently layered and structured! Thriller with fantastic elements, but above all with soul and personal vision. I wish movies like Footprints were not forgotten! I wish movies were now much brighter and more personal because they were in the 60's and 70's! And yes ... I wish someone soon made this little piece of work a digitally reshaped widescreen DVD!
