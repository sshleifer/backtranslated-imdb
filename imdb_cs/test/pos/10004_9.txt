I saw this movie on September 1, 2005 in Indianapolis. I am one of the referees at the Heartland Film Festival, which projects films for their Really Moving Image Award. A truly moving picture "... explores the human path through artistic expression of hope and respect for the positive values ​​of life." Heartland has awarded this award to this film. This is the story of golf at the beginning of the 20th century. At that time, it was a high-class game and a wealthy "gentlemen", and working people could only participate by becoming classmates in rural clubs. With this background, this based story unfolds from a young working-class boy who is dedicated to golf equipment and the world's largest golfer, Harry Vardon. And the story is inspiring. Francis Ouimet (played by Shia LaBeouf from "Dílek") will play against all the best players in the US Open in 1913 with the biggest golfers from the US and UK. Francis is poorly prepared and has a baby for caddy. (Kaddy is cheerful and motivational and steals every scene he appears in.) But despite these disadvantages, at this world class event, Francis shows courage, spirit, heroism and humility. And we are learning a lot about the beginnings of golf; for example, the use of small wooden clubs, the layout of short holes, manual tables, golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths, terrible conditions of greens and fairways, and the game is not canceled even in torrential rains. This film has stunning cinematography and artistic direction and editing. And without the big movie stars, the story is somewhat more believable. <br /> <br /> This adds to the inventory of major "Miracle" and "Remember the Titans" sports movies. <br /> <br /> FYI - There is a Truly Moving Website where a list of past winners is returning 70 years.
