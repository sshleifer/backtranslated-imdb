First Watched 8/26/2001 - 8 of 10 (Dir-John Cassavetes): Well done early independent film Cassavetes introduced a style that was very different from what Hollywood shows. This film also introduced some very taboo themes, especially real racism, which probably was prevalent all over the country, but was not portrayed by most white-controlled filmmakers of the time. The only black actors who had great respect at this time were those who behaved and portrayed the personality as white (aka Sidney Poitier). In addition, the idea of ​​ending the film without actually closing the relationships that have begun leaves many viewers overwhelmed, but in fact realizes to the audience that life is such (going on ...). I prefer this kind of ending because you think more about characters and what can happen next and conclusions are not just for you. The film follows the lives of people (especially a few people who have a short relationship and are random skin colors), then watch what happens when a white person realizes what he has done. This is done very well and makes the movie very special. Acting is said to be improvised, making the film even more amazing. I think you can say I like the movie if you can't say it. If you do, check out this classic early independent movie.
