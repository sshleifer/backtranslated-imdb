I have never been interested in this game even though he loved Shakespeare and I saw most of his games now and enthusiastically studied some at school. Something about this story and all that seemed to deter me. I never bothered to see Hamlet until I decided quite recently that I should at least try to watch him and borrow a version of Olivier from the library. Well, I fought it. Olivier seemed too old, not only in his appearance but in his actions. The game was tremendously shortened to fit the more normal length of the movie, and I think it must have been too much because I found it hard to concentrate on it, soon bored and sorry. I still think Olivier's Henry V is the best version I've seen when I noticed that I have read the Beeb version I haven't read yet. > I've heard of Hamlet's version that is full of Branagh. Although I enjoyed his Much Ado, I think the Beeb version is much better and I wasn't completely overwhelmed by his Henry V. But I was from Branagh a little after seeing his unsatisfactory effort in the Lost Labor's Lost, which is I like it and was so well made by Beeb. Finally, I recently acquired a complete Shakespeare Beeb on DVD, and soon I reviewed one of my favorite games by Shakespeare Richard II. . What revelation is now for me! Yes, it is wonderful, but I feel he needs an actor with whom you can go to play Hamlet, and that is Jacobi for me. Amazing. It is interesting to note that although he is older than I understand, the figure of Hamlet, in Olivier, does not show it. Now I have noticed that he is also in the Branagh version and had a lot to do with Branagh training, so I'll have to watch what Jocobi sees with Claudia! I'm interested in finding out that Jacobi trains Branagh as yes, you can definitely see the influence. And now I'll watch it again.
