Because I like movies like "Central do Brasil" (1998), I really like "Chop Shop". There is no sugar-coating, there is no attempt to make these people lives on something tastier or nice. What you see is what you get, and it is often bold and sometimes heartbreaking. But that's exactly what makes a movie like "Chop Shop" so beautiful, along with the story unfolding so elegantly and gently. For a young brother and sister who are as close to homeless as they would ever want to get, work (and live) in a car repair shop in Queens, New York is as good as it is. Is it a good or bad thing? This is the question that this film basically presents to the viewer. This movie is really a fantastic piece of life that sometimes feels like a documentary instead of drama, and that's a great thing because it looks and feels so real. In the middle, so many contemporary films based on essentially unreal and often unlikely conspiracies stumbling on "Chop Shop" are like finding a little gem.
