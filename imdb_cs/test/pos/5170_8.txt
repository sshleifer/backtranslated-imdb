He was just watching him on the Hallmark channel. I was surprised by John Denver! This movie was full of clichés, but that can be expected (made for a TV Christmas movie - come on!) The performance is as good as any other 80's made for television film. The story is, as I said earlier, predictable and cliché, but still good. If you are looking for a camera Christmas movie, it will surely scratch your itching. I was also pleased to learn that it happened in Georgetown, Colorado. It's a real mountain town west of Denver. Very cool because it's my home region. I've never been a big fan of John Denver (I've always considered him pretty bad), but he was a decent actor. He is very good as a good old boy, as in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to watch it than do it. I'm sure it will be back in 2007.
