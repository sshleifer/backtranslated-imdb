I saw this film for the first time just a few moments ago. If you ask me, he won't get the credit he deserves. It's a bit like American Pie meets the Fast Times at Ridgemont High, but with greater depth. He treats the same problems as both movies, but in a way that holds a certain grain of truth with him. The end is sad, but that is life. I think everyone should see it. I have it on DVD and it took so long to find it. This should say something heh and the other thing I add is that it's pretty hard to find a soundtrack. I believe they stopped it, but the soundtrack for this movie is amazing. He has songs from artists such as The Commodores, U2, Devo, REO Speedwagon, The Cars, KC and Sunshine Band and many others.
