I expected this movie to suck, but what I got was a pretty good slasher / gore movie. Most death scenes are brutal enough. Teens are decent, with Penny McNamee definitely the best of the game. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but she doesn't bring anything else into the movie. Kane was good as a killer, and he was absolutely believable as a fearsome juggernaut. I saw a "twist" coming from miles away, but I still enjoyed the movie. But what really cost me was direction. In fact, Gregory Dark could have a legitimate film in his career. In addition to overusing the horror movie "speed cam" (you know where the guy's face shakes fast?), Here are some good shots. Camera angles and environments really emphasize the size of Kane, so they look even bigger than they really are. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a deep story or character, that's not it. But that's not what the slasher movies are all about. If you're looking for some good violence or if you're in bloody movies, check it out!
