That is right. Ohwon (painter and main character) is an exceptional person. Most of all I think of the message that this film could reach all of you. And the message is sad. It is said to be very difficult to do anything that is amazing or even brilliant without having to obey governments, establishments and other VIPs. And even if you try, you may not be able to carry it. It's a one-person battle with the system. With many systems. Great movie of this beautiful Korean director. Please see if you have the opportunity.
