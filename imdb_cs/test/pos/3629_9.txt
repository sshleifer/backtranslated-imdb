It's a great movie for the whole family. I don't think many people have seen it because I ask people and say they never heard of it before. Sophie Heyman is my aunt's sister. My favorite scene is a whole movie that I can't even pick a favorite scene. My favorite character is Hubert because he's a funny but clever dog. if he wasn't seen, he misses a big adventure. I only saw it because my aunt is linked to Sophie and she got a copy from her. if someone reads this i suggest buying a movie and i guaranteed it wouldn't be a bad decision. I've seen this movie about five times and every time it gives me the same message, dogs are as smart as people give them a chance.
