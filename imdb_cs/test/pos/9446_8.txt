Okay, so I don't understand why people in this movie are getting so close. I thought it would be Amanda Bynes' usual movie, but it wasn't. It was great. Well, well, so the acting wasn't the best, but I thought the performances were still great overall. You could also say that the actors enjoyed this movie. In other films, which surprisingly won the award-winning movie, you can say. All the actors had chemistry, and it also turned out. The tone of people breaks into the football skills that actors have. Yeah, so they're not perfect. They are actors, not footballers. I played football all my life and believe me it's hard to learn, so stop ripping on the skill level they have. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie would be stupid, but it was really funny. The way Amanda Bynes and Channing Tatum can make fun without saying he's funny. I laughed a lot in this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall .. WE LOVE!
