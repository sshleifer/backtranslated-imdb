I'm not sure why there are no articles or posters or something about this movie because I saw it and thought it was AWESOME. I think it's not for everyone, because it's basically Kafka's "The Trial" that meets with "Beevis and Butt-Head", which is a pretty hard combination that can swallow. Still, I thought it was great. If you see it because you want to continue with Office Space, you'll probably be disappointed. But if you want to see one of the most brutal, sour and cheerful glances at where our company is heading, you intend to heal. I just saw an evening show opening in Los Angeles and there were only 12 people in the theater, which means the movie will be gone in about a week. This is a shame, because Idiocracies are in a way one of the best satires to bear. But then it's basically making fun of people who make up about 99% of the film's viewers, so I don't think it's a wonder the studio panicked and tried to throw it out.
