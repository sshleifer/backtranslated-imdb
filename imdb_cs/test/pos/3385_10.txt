This is one of the best TV series of all centuries, with all the great tensions, the story and the cast of absolutely fantastic actors and love and grief that really catches your eye and attracts you in front of the TV. Once you've seen it, you'll be back again and you'll see it again. I have several times and I still do it. The best drama of the 20th century.
