This review is based on Producer Editing: <br /> <br /> 'Halloween 5' was a major disappointment on the way to the '89 box office. I have always loved it and I am proud to have it in my collection. But because of his failure and also the rights to the questions, it would be 6 years before we see another installment. The film had the prerequisites to be one of the best if not the best in the series. Hardcore Fan Writing Screenplay, Return Not Just Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis and George Wilbur as Michael Myers, but also the return of the character Tommy Doyle from the first film, the main studio to support the project, and the fall. the release of all made film sounds like a hit in production. So what happened? I'll give you two good reasons: Re-shooty and bad editing. Due to poor testing screening and the unfortunate passing of Donald Pleasence, the film was changed and not for the better. The film, like Parts III and 5, danced at the box office and received negative reviews from critics and most of the series fans. But thanks to the smuggling charm, the original cut has escaped and many fans, including myself, have been very happy. I will end this part of my review by saying: This movie is at least my favorite 'Halloween' movie and I am not afraid to admit it. Advantages: The score is simply overwhelming. She has some of the best writing and dialogue series. 'Halloween 4' emulated the original in that it was more about tension and mood instead of blood and intestines, and 6 is the same way. Great performances, especially from the late and very late Donald Pleasence. It moves at a breathtaking pace. An interesting explanation for Michael's evil and why he won't die. Some brutal killings. Some pretty chilling moments, my favorite is the one that includes Kim Darby's character. Lots of really great nods to previous movies. Some good surprises. Like the previous two sequels, this one has an amazing cliffhanger ending. Disadvantages: Although the explanation for Michael's evil is fascinating, he makes him a little less frightening. Since when can Michael move from place to place so quickly? Final Thoughts: This was the first 'Halloween' I saw in the theater. I was so excited because I thought 5 would be the last and then I heard it. At that time I enjoyed it, but over time I saw what it was: A great movie trapped in OK with a terrible end. Why did filmmakers have to listen to people on the test screenings? If they released this excellent version, maybe it did a lot better and the show doesn't have to be stuck in a mess that's right now. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
