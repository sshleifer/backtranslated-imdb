Since there have been so many reviews of this fine film I will write in the form list and try to solve issues that have not been discussed. 1. Dana Andrews was 38 during the filming of this movie. His character according to the script was in his mid-20s. A highly underrated actor, Andrews played a character that was much younger. 2. Fredric March as all GREAT actors need to occasionally be limited by the director to avoid over-top-acting. He attracted the camera when he was drunk the night after his arrival, and the next morning as he watched the curtain in the mirror. 3. Dana Andrews was great because he was in "Laura", "The Ox-Bowl Incident", "Walk in the Sun", "The Purple Heart" and many other movies. Why did Fredric March win the Academy Award and why wasn't Andrew Andrew nominated for his outstanding performance? 4. Harold Russell gave the best performance I've ever seen to an actor. 5. I realize it was in the 1940s, but Dana Andrews had no romantic interest in his extremely attractive woman (Virginia Mayo). 6. Ray Teal, who played the right wing of the bigot, a few years later became famous for portraying the sheriff on "Bonanza". 7. The South professor wrote that the film was slow, boring and ill-treated. The Professor is more than likely not being informed about classic movies. The beauty and significance of these ageless classics is that they are slow motion studies that avoid blasphemy, excessive violence, and gratuitous sex. .
