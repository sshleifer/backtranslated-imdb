When I read the synopsis - 3 people lost in a wild fight against a giant crocodile - I wasn't exactly drawn inside. It sounded like a typical horrible pattern of yawning movies to a lot of people watching the monster - except for the case, there are only three, so we wouldn't even get a "fearsome" feeling that we could watch them one at a time. However, I watched it (I couldn't sleep, nothing else and it turned out to be much better than expected. The game is great, the atmosphere is tense and you really get the precious sense of low budget winner. Horror as it should be done First-class filmmaking It's not perfect, but it's worth seeing.
