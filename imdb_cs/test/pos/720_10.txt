If you like puzzles and tensions, you will enjoy this movie. The truth is that it was mostly Adrian Paul who got me to pick it up, I didn't know anything about the movie. The fence is: Sarah (Carly Pope), a student of philosophy and metaphysics, begins to play a mysterious puzzle game that tries to figure out why this is the reason and engages in the game when it solves puzzles. Vern (Adrian Paul) is a store owner, also a fanatic of puzzles, and is also involved in the game. Myth has it that if you solve the game, the sense of existence (referred to as "design") is revealed. Brendan Fehr's character is a type of "village idiot" that hangs around a store that turns out to be more than it seems. All in all, I thought the movie was pretty good. And it's definitely an original concept, a rare finding these days! I personally like puzzles and puns, so while most of them were not very difficult, it was still a fun movie. Well worth renting. <br /> <br /> So, if you haven't seen it - you'll get it! :-D <br /> <br />
