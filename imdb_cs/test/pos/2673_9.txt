When the movie started, I thought it was cheesy. The first ten minutes were really boring. After a slow start and some of the soap opera antics, I started to enjoy it. The story was different from what I had ever seen. Was it horrible? Not really. It wasn't supposed to be classified as horror, or the producers were supposed to put more money into the film to scare it. How it was, creature where there only for a short time. I can only assume that it was because of the money. <br /> <br /> The good thing was that the movie was very fun. I was wondering (after the start) and wonders about creatures from another dimension. It was obvious that this was the first time a film for a director, but there were a few highlights. I was addicted to the end. It is a pity that Hollywood did not give more money for it.
