Although I have read this particular book of Agatha Christie at some point, I did not remember anything about it except the name "Abernethie". Which is a good thing, because seeing this story unfolding without knowing how it will play has allowed me once again to appreciate the sheer GENIUS of Agatha Christie: the way she introduces you and then pulls her carpet under her feet, the main reason behind her success and timelessness. In addition to her stories, she has excellent production values, beautiful places, beautiful music, top acting, elegant direction, etc. The reason for the success of this series and the timelessness - and all these virtues are contained in "After the funeral". The word of joy: be vigilant right from the start - there are also traces in the opening order! There are some pretty unnerving moments also, as opposed to a peaceful looking English-rural location, and some little impressions of humor. Need to see mysterious enthusiasts and just a very good movie in general. (***)
