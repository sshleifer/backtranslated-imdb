When I watched this movie years ago, it never got out of my mind. I always thought it was Michelle Pfeiffer's best performance I saw. However, I am impressed by the number of negative reviews this film has won. Once I saw him again, I still think he is powerful, mobile, and could not care less if he is "loosely based on King Lear." Now I realize this is Jessica Lange's greatest performance I've ever seen - and she has honors for much less effort. Thousands of acres are complex, human, lively and immensely moving, but certainly not one of the primary women leads with any touch of grace or "sexuality." I don't think it's well received in these times. Perhaps one of the reasons for this overwhelming reaction of this film is that the writer (Jane Smiley (Laura Jones) and the director (Jocelhyn Moorehouse) are all women, I know I wouldn't read in my younger days a book written by a woman, I only focused on this fact after years. <br /> <br /> You haven't seen this movie, nor have you given a chance in the past, try to watch it again, maybe you're ready for it.
