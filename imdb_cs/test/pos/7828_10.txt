Undoubtedly, a great all-round show that would show today that it would be a huge follow-up. The Bodyguards were only 6 episodes and a trailer, but they deserved a few other series that really would bring it to speed. With the outstanding performances of highly talented and versatile Sean Pertwee and the dynamic Louise Lombard, she really put it together with professionals like The Sweeney and Thief Takers. Stories are based on Diplomatic Protection Services and great movie and storylines and scene locations. some of the junk that has been put into operation by other TV production companies. I don't think it was shown on terrestrial TV, such as Sky or Freeview, the witch is a shame, as it should be currently being shown, Sure it would get a big viewer. So I hope one day the guys in Carlton decide to release on DVD, Cheers, Nick.
