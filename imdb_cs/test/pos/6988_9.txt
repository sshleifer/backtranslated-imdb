If you are a science fiction fan and you have only seen this movie once, please PLEASE go and have a second watch. I did it, and I was amazed at how good I thought the movie was, as opposed to when I first saw it three years ago. For the first time, I was certainly impressed by the astronomical perspectives we were dealing with in this film, but in fact I didn't think most of the film as a whole. It was an extraterrestrial rip-off and I thought the description of the monsters was a case of really bad science. Being allergic to light was something I thought was especially ridiculous. Based on my first review, I recently rated this movie as 5. <br /> <br /> However, now that the sequel, The Chronicles of Riddick, is on the way, and the movie poster for one looks amazing, I thought I'd rather once cleared Pitch Black so I borrowed the video from my friend. I'm so glad I did it. There's so much I thought I remembered from the first look that turned out to be wildly inaccurate. I thought most of the characters died very early in the movie. That was not the case. I thought Claudia Black was the first to die. That was not the case. I thought Riddick was the only one who survived. That was not the case. <br /> <br /> Now I see that the movie works * very well *. There is no excessive, tedious focus on monsters. It's much more human drama. The main characters are attractive and capable of convincing acting. And there are so many minor details that make the Universe Pitch Black cohesive and credible, such as the lack of oxygen in the planet's atmosphere, and the fact that monsters ate everything on the planet, so they turned on themselves. And again, I have to mention astronomical views. We begin to see the spaceship going through the tail of the comet, with pieces of spacedust that pass through the hull. Then we are on a planet with three suns. Just as the shipwrecked people think it is dark, the blue sun rises on the opposite horizon and everything is shrouded in blue. As the eclipse approaches, we see a gigantic, neighboring, orbiting gas giant rising across the sky, and in the final scene of the movie we see the ship move just above one of these very circles. These scenes are created with a sense of beauty, miracles and details, and I don't think I've seen any other SF movie that would do that to really include these things. I hope to see much more in the sequel. Pitch Black now gives me a rating of 9 out of 10. A cult classic? You bet!!
