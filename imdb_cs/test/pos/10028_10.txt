After working on 7 films with director Mickael Curtiz (The Robin Hood Adventures are their best success), Errol Flynn got tired of the dictatorial direction and decided to work with the great Raoul Walsh. This meeting is a happy thing for cinema. CHILDREN WITH ITS UNITS is their first and best film together. Raoul Walsh portrays General George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn) of his West Point debuts, the Civil War, and finally the Battle of Little Big Horn. It is true that the film shows too heroic a portrait of Custer, but that is not important. What is important is that we are transported with passion and fame that the characters carry. Who can forget about California Joe, the great "Queen's Own Buttler" with his song "Garryowen", the moving Mrs. Custer (Olivia de Havilland), the devil Sharp played by Arthur Kennedy? The Eternal Strike remains on this epic and tragic fresco.
