Special should be able to come across "Classe Tous Risques" just by accident; it should be on any "best of the movie-noir" list, including IMDb's. Lino Ventura is as good as ever; Knowing his desperate, delicate family status gives extra weight to his almost expressionless face and brief dialogues. Belmond's limited performance under the fixed direction of Sautet shows only what a great actor - and should - be. <br /> <br /> "Classe Tous Risques" is absolutely minimal, dry and cold, without Melville's artistic scenery, pretty faces and luxurious cars. It's almost a film-noir that meets neo-realism. Davos' few hard words to their children describing their lives in secret from there on the neck at the end of the film. The last sentence of the film - a voice narrative about the end of Davos in less than ten dry, dark words - will leave a hard blow in your stomach. A real gem in the big crown of French film noir.
