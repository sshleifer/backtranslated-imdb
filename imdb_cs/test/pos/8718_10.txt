Recently, I was fortunate enough to see the name of Ingrid Bergman associated with a film I never saw on the AMC (or heard of it). What is happiness? <br /> <br /> To admire its flawless and hassle-free performance, it's not the only reason to stay late and watch this movie. Writing is wonderfully comic and the performances are excellent. Walter Mathau (not my favorite) was almost perfect and Goldie Hawn (surprisingly) was wonderful. The offer sometimes, challenging, then just plain goofy. There are times in the film when even the toughest movie viewer gets into the story and forgets that it is a movie. Bergman is able to steal a dance scene between a crowd of 20 years old have been amazing to watch. She is effortless in her return to the screen (at age 54?). The support cast was great and the lines ... are beautiful. Top 5 romantic comedy of all time.
