Notable in this amazing movie is that Altman, a crazy and wild guy who is, took a novel that was a cold day in the park and the character of Sandy Dennis was originally a man in the book. He was a psychologically torn-off gay man who was looking out the window of his apartment when he saw a cheater. It's strange that Altman fans are not aware of how clever it is to change the gender of the main character; this avoids the homo-erotic taboo of tobacco life in the sixties and actually makes Dennis's reclusive kind of madness even better in transposition. If you see the movie again, it will be clear how Altman's mind works ...
