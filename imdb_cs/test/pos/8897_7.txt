It is a pity that Asterix and his friend Obelix do not receive worldwide recognition that other comic book characters will come. This is another funny Asterix cartoon jammed with fun. The animation is excellent and the voice characterization is good even if the sync is a bit out. The music and score fit well into the story and the grooving of some modern music numbers is a pleasant touch. Running time is short and it's not the best Asterix story or the most developed cartoon, it's good pure fun. A modern (Disney like) animation captures children, Asterix fans and newcomers ... Enjoy the adventure in Gaul!
