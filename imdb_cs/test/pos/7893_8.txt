If Archie Bunker was armed, he could be "Joe". However, "all in the family" would have had a somewhat short run because censors would never allow it to run along the lines of this film. Joe is a working class guy who is racist and bigot, and has a big mouth, especially when he's drunk. One night he meets a man at the bar, Bill, who drinks to calm his nerves nervously after accidentally killing his daughter's drug addict and letting him slip on Joe. What happens is that Bill's daughter lived with a junkie, and after an overdose she is taken to a hospital and he goes to the apartment to collect things, but doesn't expect to get into that friend, which comes in fresh from a big drug deal . In a fight that follows, a friend is accidentally killed, and Bill doesn't want anyone to know, of course. But he lets it slip on Joe, and when newspapers and TV news appear, Joe sees them, puts together 2 and 2, and suddenly this man is a hero in his eyes. He later joins him and Bill is, of course, concerned that Joe is blackmailing him, but not for money, he wants to hang out with him. Which is almost worse in a way. Now, Bill's daughter escapes from the clinic she is in and slips home, and by mistake overhears what happened and then runs, and most of the rest of the film consists of Joe & Bill infiltrating the "underground" to try to find her. This builds on a somewhat shocking ending that was utterly unexpected to me and ended up on the right note, or bad note, depending on your perspective. Some decent but dull look at life in the early 70s, mostly from the bigot working class, which makes it not for everyone, but it's not a bad movie at all and it's a decent watch. 8 out of 10.
