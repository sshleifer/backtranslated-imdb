"Imaginary Heroes" is a 2004 film starring Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels, Emile Hirsch, Michelle Williams and Kip Pardue. ) commits suicide. "Ordinary People" often refer to this film; it is something like "ordinary people" with the reversal of the role. The mother in this case, Sandy Travis (Weaver) is more accessible than father, Ben (Daniels), which is clearly devastated and unable to settle. Like "Ordinary People," Tim (Hirsch), the younger son, is also a film. For me, the film was so absorbent that it watched it, but it has a curious curiosity. There were amazing interactions - mother and son, mother and neighbor, brother and sister (Williams) and some good moments. What never clicked was Ben, who was part of the family or had chemistry with Sandy. This seems to be the goal of director / writer Dan Harris. In one scene at a grocery store the cash register child assumes Sandy is "about 30" and gives her her phone number. Almost in the next scene, Daniels asks Sandy if she wants a plastic surgery for her birthday. Weaver was 55 when this film was made, actually about 54, and looks phenomenal. What is Ben looking at? However, there is something that is something about Ben's complete separation because the viewer does not really see how Daniels has ever joined this family. The end has several twists and some very moving scenes. Everyone is very good, with Weaver and Hirsch being standouts. There is not a huge number of dialogues in this movie and many views. The script could be sharper. But "Imaginary Heroes" is a good effort.
