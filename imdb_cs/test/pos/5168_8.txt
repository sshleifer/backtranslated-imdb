The joy and tragedy of the Christmas season is that it mainly revolves around the family. That's why some people call it "children's holiday". As we age, natural wear and progress remove people and things that gave us our special memories. John Denver, in one of his sweetest roles, plays George Billings, a successful NYC architect and new widow who lost his wife a year ago. His life focuses on his 9 year old daughter Alex; both lose their loss. George is trying to make it a special Christmas for him. Enter his boss, Thomas Renfield (playfully playing great Col. Flagg of M * A * S * H, Edward Winters) who sends George to Georgetown to investigate a possible real estate business. George and Alex lie to their daughter that the destination of the trip is holiday rather than work, and flies to the city, where they immediately meet a collection of loving generous but somewhat eccentric groups whose main eccentricity is that everyone believes in Santa Claus. Georgetown is a community of picture books in which we all love to live and we would love to love people for neighbors. George soon meets love in Susan (Jane Kazmarek). If it wasn't for Renfield, it would be an ideal time. But the fact is, he's in town to find a property for Renfield development, and near the city is a pretty ranch to be closed, and the dark edges of the film revolve around the impending market foreclosure and urban reactions, rancher and outsiders. I will not spoil the end of those who have never seen the film. It is a typical happy Christmas ending, but it is processed in a rather gentle and believable way that shows the best in the human spirit without being too syrupy. All in all, it's the most enjoyable way to spend a few Christmas hours. John Denver and Jane Kazmarek have nice chemistry and Gennie James because Alex is doing a really good job. I've always loved the work of Mary Wickes, a recognizable actress, and all the other members of the cast do a nice job with less meat parts. This is a regular Christmas fare for my family; I rate it 4/5.
