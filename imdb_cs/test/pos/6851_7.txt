More than Miss than Flop, MR. IMPERIUM plays Ezio Pinza as Alex, the heir apparent and later the king of a small European nation who falls in love with the willing American actress and entertainer Freddy Barlo (Lana Turner), but because of cunning Prime Minister Alex. King, played by Cedric Hardwicke, lovers are separated for 12 years before they meet in Palm Springs, where their love is revived. Director Don Hartman, who also has scripts, is unable to take full advantage of his talent for elegant dialogue, because Pinz's preliminary English application, and the necessary rewrite, along with less than complete proof of evidence between two stars, results in a somewhat ragged tone. to the scenario, aggravated by the studio's harsh cutting of many scenes, leading to a confusing ending. The prevailing Pinza dominates his scene with Turner, but both performers are doing a good job, while Marjorie Main is impressive with her little effects as written, and Debbie Reynolds based on Louis B. Mayer for SINGIN 'IN RAIN as her stunning performance here; Only Barry Sullivan is heavily the victim of flagrant cutting. The film was shot mainly in Pebble Beach, California and around Monterey County, the film is endowed with Pinza's iron strong opera bass at Solamente Una Vez, as well as original songs by Harold Arlen and Dorothy Fields, with Douglas Shearer, who is great at recording sound, and the announcement must be made from a fine set of decorations by Edwin Willis, and an effective costume design by Walter Plunkett.
