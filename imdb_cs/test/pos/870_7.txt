Despite the romantic illusion and everything, Louis goes in love with his mysterious woman. This film is a wonderful drama of a lot of betrayal, deception, killing, theft and Hitchcock's tension. The good performances of Jean Paul Belmond as a young owner of a cigarette company who is committed to falling under the femme fatale and the wonderful Catherine Deneuve as a suspicious heroine. The film will receive several references to American cinema, but Truffaut (400 strokes) was a fiery movie viewer, such as: Johnny Guitar, Colorado Jim, Bogart and Hitchcock. The US version has been cut in minutes and deserves urgent recovery and remastering.

This is one of the best of his tense movies along with arFarenheit 451 and shoot pianists. Redesigned by lower version by Michael Christofer (2001) with Antonio Banderas, Angelina Jolie and Jack Thompson, full of erotic and lusty scenes.
