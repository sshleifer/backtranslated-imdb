This movie will challenge you. It shows how women's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others. Her physically aggressive behavior is more common in men than in women, so I felt even more uncomfortable seeing how the actress acted. I think women might think about this behavior, but I don't think they would. The dark scenes added a sense of evil that had to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners escaped. I was hoping that the end would bring a satisfactory solution, but not. Maybe it's more realistic. Life seems to be running in the same direction instead of creating a new river bed that rises uphill.
