The story of a young boy, Dexter (Joseph Mazzell) with AIDS, who makes friends with a rough and drum boy (played by Brad Renfro), his exact opposite, The Cure is sad, if it's a little too much soapy, pull out a "message" movie with heart in the right place. Just for this fact it is a recommended view. The highlight could be watching their friendship and meeting each other when no one else accepts them. However, since the real story is centered on the AIDS boy - things take off when one day at a local supermarket, Dexter's eye catches the tabloid tabloid magazine that states New Orleans doctor has discovered a cure. Both of them, apparently naive, make him a plan to go to New Orleans wherever possible. Which drew me in two ways. It is a huge mite of heart and I hate nit-pick, but I find that conspiracy roams in a melodramatic, predictable sense, and the proceedings have a shine like just movies. I couldn't escape the expanding idea that I was watching a movie about a trip about self-discovery, illness and adolescence. For example, I know they are young, but I have found that it is a real task to believe in the things that these boys are doing. Like boiling leaves of trees and drinking hot tea or eating an experimental diet of chocolate bars because they believe it will fight the devastating disease. Not to talk about going across countries because they have no legal or frightening consequences. Still doubt aside, those movie conventions you expect are a story worth seeing especially with your family.
