For unknown reasons, this beautiful masterpiece did not gain well-deserved recognition, and many American film critics underestimated it. So it's easy to understand that I have encountered many problems that are trying to find this movie. In the end, I watched it and it was so beautiful, honest and engaging that I watched one movie five times a week for the first time after getting a tape. The story focuses on the friendship between two young boys Erik and Dexter, eleven and twelve years old, who are very different, but become the best (and only) friends. The beauty and sincerity of their friendship has been shown in Cure as honestly and naturally as never before. There are so many beautiful, cordial and engaging scenes (especially on the river) that hit the heart and leave no one indifferent. The film is also full of incredibly strong and emotional symbolism (especially strong with Eric's shoe), which also greatly enhances the visual impression of such beautiful work. The story written by Robert Kuhn is well written and, unlike the vast majority of modern Hollywood products, virtually every scene, every phrase and every sentence in the film is meaningful and brings something important about the characters and relationships between them. Peter Horton, who, as I know, had no great experience in directing the film, showed his great abilities and talents in this area. Cinematography is also excellent with perfectly selected places for film, but the most important is the perfect performance, which makes The Cure one of the best films ever. Brad Renfro as Erik and Joseph Mazello as Dexter created an amazing atmosphere of sincere friendship and wonderful chemistry between the two main characters. Only one of these films (I didn't notice most of their other works) is enough to name them as one of the best actors of my generation. Annabelle Sciorra also performs amazing performance as Dexter's mother. It is terribly sad that these talented actors did not gain wide recognition, while many overrated stars have enormous publicity and huge salaries. Finally, it would be unfair not to mention the amazing soundtrack written by David Grusin and the amazing song of Mark Cohn (one of the best songs I've ever heard in movies) My Great Escape. So all I can say about The Cure is one simple word? great. In any case, this film is a beautiful, warm and inspiring work by all the people involved in the creation of this masterpiece. I have to admit all the people who put the heart and soul in the movie and Universal Pictures, which have found a way to create such a beautiful movie among numerous formal commercial projects. But such a film rarely comes to the movies, which very often studies themselves do not realize what the gem did, they are unable to provide the appropriate marketing campaigns. The only small downside to The Cure for me is its short length (only 97 minutes). <br /> <br /> I don't want to write more about the movie because it's just impossible to put its beauty and honesty in words, so if you can watch The Cure, rent it or buy it and you wouldn't be disappointed. 10 of 10. Sorry for my bad English.
