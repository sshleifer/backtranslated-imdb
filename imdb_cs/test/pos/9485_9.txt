I am a professional musician who was inspired almost 20 years ago to start playing guitar after hearing Jimmy Page on Led Zeppelin II. Although I don't play in the same genre or style, the impact of this man was huge. Now, almost twenty years later I finally saw something more than not-so good The Song remains the same. Again, I saw how many bands perform, some little - some contemporary masters. No band, nowhere where EVER couldn't get rid of the spell you can actually taste by watching this DVD. Robert Plant may occasionally be a little bit more, and you can almost feel annoyed by the Page that forgets the lyrics, but it didn't matter - especially the era. Bonham's genius shines more on this DVD than on Zeppelin, Joy or Lord Sutch. JPJ is quite common - but the magic of this DVD is how well four of them play together. The world liked to imagine being in black magic (k), etc. - that was just a matter of interest. Magic (note a lot) is that this DVD captures a rare look at the roughness of 4 young boys who can play brilliantly, no matter how they actually play. It didn't matter. <br /> <br /> Fast downtime. The first of the two DVDs is where it's the magic. You should be able to feel the power and consternation Zep had in his early days. By the end of the second DVD site struggles with his common sense during the songs of Knebworth. (It is no secret that until then he was heavily addicted to heroin). So I would recommend the first disc for every music lover and the other for the only Zeppelin loyal fan. Maybe I went too far for some guitarists, but I'd say after watching the site is certainly more creative and resourceful than Hendrix. Yeah, I said it. And if you disagree - watch the DVD.
