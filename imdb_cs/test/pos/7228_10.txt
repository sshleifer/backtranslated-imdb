Wow, this movie is amazing. It's an excellent movie. Does a sick scene (not as sick as Terror Firmer or Citizen Toxie) have any nudity, and this was a monster penis movie debut! This created a scene for many of Trom's films, this is a very Tromatic film. It mixes comedy, romance and my favorite HORROR / GORE! Not so much gore in this movie, but enough to satisfy. This is the best adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Much better than any other version. They make it so fun and fun to watch. And we have Debbie Rochon ... hehe ... I like her. :) All I have to say is it's a great movie, very funny and Lemmy is a good host for him. Behavior is good and Kaufman manages style as always. They must see all the TROMA FANS!
