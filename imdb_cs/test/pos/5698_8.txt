I swore I would never allow myself to be transferred to the fake authorities of the 1960s who told me that things were better in good old days? the current Australian Prime Minister is a clever example of just such a mind. But I switched to "Decade under the Influence" because I found myself looking at the much-reported documentary "Sneakers". another channel that is so exciting. I found that the values ​​expressed in the "Sneakers" questionnaires are too ugly to be accepted as reasonable. So materialistic! So without any sense of outrage in a society that could kill someone who would steal his ugly shoes! So that they lack any purpose that could report without dishonesting exploitation, the audience, by encircling them to keep these shoes over their heads to lock out a sponsorship deal with themselves with a shoemaker, was too much to be able to track. "The decade under the influence" was a completely different response to the fruits of stupidity, corruption, and self-confidence in high (and low) places. I've noticed the changes in the movie making it accompanied by the exposure of American disastrous foreign debates in Vietnam and so many less reported sites on my site www.peterhenderson.com.au. "A decade under the influence" documents the exact moment when this change occurred. Before the 1970s, armed forces were portrayed in American films as an invincible combat force composed of decent human beings who transmograted to conquer heroes on the battlefield. After the 1970s, they are generally portrayed as scattered anger, which is confused by the Pentagon's many bureaucratic clowns in the Pentagon. Before the 1970s, the FBI agent and honorary cop were inclined to make portrayals as your friend and protector. After the 1970s, FBI agents were incompetent, and the best cop could strive to ignore their superiors' foolishness and corruption and promote justice in their own eccentric way. Before the 1970s, an archetypal American "little guy", "average Joe", Jimmy Stewart's type would face the problems he encountered, gaining insight into the basic wisdom of his elected leaders and the justice of the "American Way" ". After the 1970s, Kevin Costner usurps this role, but now he is the voice of the wilderness that evil is revealed, or accepted his work, and that he is the best he can do. Now these "ancient religious" ideas have been stripped of any honesty and justice and portrayed (with a certain amount of justification) as sanctifying fanaticism and self-service hypocrisy. "Decade under the influence" says it was. "Decade under the influence" says it's now. It depicts the redemption of the American film industry from the hands of artistically, morally and intellectually failed studio magnates. This shows the Hollywood Bastille storm by independent filmmakers who have promised to get a disillusioned and tired audience back to the movie. The fact that their failures were numerous and sometimes disastrous just underlines the magnitude of their success. Success is reflected in the adventurous and challenging attitudes of big stars at the box office, such as Clooney, Daman, Affleck, etc. And directors and producers who provide vehicles for their talents.
