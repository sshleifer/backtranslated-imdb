All I can say is that I waited for a wick movie and "Blurred" surprised me in a positive way. Very nice teenager movie. All these situations are normal in school life, so all I can say is that it all reminded me of my school times and sometimes it's good to watch this kind of movie because we have fun and travel back to those golden years when we were young . It will also lead us to think better about how we have to understand our children, because in the past we were just as they want to be at the moment. Try this movie and you'll be very satisfied. you have a guarantee that your time has not been wasted.
