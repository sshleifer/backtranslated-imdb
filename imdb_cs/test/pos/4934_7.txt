This is a great movie! It's fun for everyone, even adults. We got Jason Voorhees / Leatherface as the killer in this, along with other crazy characters. Very fun movie for kids of all ages. He has to rent it every time we go to the video store! Buster and Babs are making a good pair and they have to love the duck. It's probably my favorite character! I've never been big in the TV show, but this movie just brings so many great memories. Must see for families, show fans, or anyone! Pleasant no matter how small or old you are! PLEASE TRANSFER THIS HARD IN THE MIDDLE VIDEO STORE! <br /> <br /> P.S. He needs a RELEASE DVD!
