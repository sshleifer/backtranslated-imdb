After seeing Big Fat Liar, I think Jason learned a lot more. When he was telling the truth about Marty stealing his story, it was like a boy who wept a wolf. People heard him, but they didn't believe him. Nobody helped him. Besides, Marty's films stink, just like his advice. Truth is not overestimated. I'm so glad he was revealed for what he really is. They all found he stole the boy, including his parents. Not only did he steal the boy and lie to him, he gave them the work of someone else and tried to call him his own, which is plagiarism. Doesn't he know it's illegal to plague someone's idea? Another reason he was fired. Not trustworthy. He's a liar, a cheater, a thief, a cheater and a plagiarist. Do you have that Marty? You're a plagiarist. Plus, you have everything you deserve.
