Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa was actually stolen once and was missing for almost two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's 'La Gioconda' (better known as the Mona Lisa) was taken from the Louvre by a small thief (and former Louvre employee) who allegedly sought to return the world's most famous piece of art to his native Italy. His activity after the theft seems more likely to intend to sell the image for his personal gain. (Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.) The Mona Lisa quietly returned to the Louvre on the last day of 1913, and since then she has stayed with occasional loans. When "Arsène Lupine" was released in 1932 (twenty years after the theft), most viewers would remember that 1911 crime, and their knowledge would lend some credibility to this film. "Arsène Lupine" is quite enjoyable, with the usual high MGM production standards and the usual, effective direction of Jack Conway. This film does not have enough pleasure; what he lacks is credibility. John Barrymore is a criminal title champion: he specializes in committing "impossible" crimes, which is even more difficult to announce in advance ... but of course he always commits a crime and deceives gendarmes. Tully Marshall has a good scene as one of Barrymore's victims. Lupine has a penchant for sophisticated disguises, allowing Barrymore (Swiss Class A) to indulge in his own hobby for the tomfoolers. John's older brother Lionel Barrymore is Guerchard, detective Javert similar to Surete, who swears to catch Lupine. Karen Morley was a very beautiful actress whose private life was filled with populist political activities; the screen was most impressive in the working class roles that matched her own political beliefs (for example, her excellent performance in 'Our Daily Bread'). In "Arsene Lupine", Morley's naturally dark hair is faded by a terrible blond tone, and she is all torn in classy clothes that make her look uncomfortable rather than sexy. <br /> SPOILERS COMING. Finally, Lupine decides to steal Mona Lisa from the Louvre. He cuts the picture from the frame, rolls the canvas, and then smuggles it into the flower basket. We see John Barrymore as carelessly waving a tightly rolled piece of fabric that is said to be the greatest work of art in human history. I had to laugh at the mistake of the filmmakers. In real life (but not in this movie), da Vinci painted Mona Lisa on a poplar plank, so a thief would have trouble rolling it up! Finally, Guerchard captures Lupine and takes him to Le Calaboose. The scene between John and Lionel Barrymore in the police car is an absolute pleasure because their true affection penetrates each other's dialogue with their characters. I would consider this scene unlikely by two other actors. As it is, I can't imagine anyone but the Barrymore brothers playing these roles. Well, maybe Dennis and Randy Quaid, but hardly. <br /> <br /> Don't look for good land, but "Arsène Lupine" is a wonderful example of old-fashioned work. I will rate this movie 8 points out of 10.
