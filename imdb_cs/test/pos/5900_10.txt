In 2004, I wrote the following statements on the IMDb bulletin board when the user wondered if the best years of our lives were a forgotten movie: <br /> <br /> ***** For me, this film is like opening a time capsule. I think that in many ways "Best Years of Our Lives" is probably one of the more fascinating studies of character and that it keeps on being very good as a view of life in the US in the mid-1940s after World War II. I believe that "Coming Home" and "The Deer Hunter", both released in 1978, were the newest films that were the closest to the numerous questions of military men returning from the war raised in "The Best Years of Our Lives". What really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when I was in college around 1980-81 and many, if not all, college students applauded at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie still packs and I am very glad that I could read other users' feelings of a movie that will surely pass the test of time. ***** <br /> <br /> I am very pleased to have seen a movie that came close to the top 100 IMDb and AFI movies. Although it was in competition with what eventually became a Christmas classic, it's a wonderful life, probably the best years of Oscar's victory for our lives, including Best Picture, have been well deserved. I saw the film again in 2005 and after almost 60 years, the best year of our lives is still a powerful, beautifully processed and well-made film.
