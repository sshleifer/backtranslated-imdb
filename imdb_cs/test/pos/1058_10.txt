I've always loved old movies, but this is one of my ten most popular ... it has all the magic, the forties' pictures and old-fashioned romance and it's cheerful, naboot! Barbara Stanwick plays an independent free woman who writes articles about cooking for life for a famous magazine ... under the assumption that she is married in a household. Even the magazine's president is under this delusion. Enter a handsome GI, (played by talented Dennis Morgan) just rescued from the raft along with his friend. His simple wish is to stay in a home-based inn, which he writes so eloquently and relax with his famous home-cooked meals. Now she must desperately find a way to save her job and her reputation ... to add to the fact that her fianc√© is in a hurry to tie the knot. Humor is excellent and the chemistry among the leading characters a lot of fun. Throwing in the character-actor nicknamed "Cuddles" (who fits this name entirely) it becomes even more adorable. This has become my compulsory film, which I invite every season with a cup of cocoa. A wonderful, enjoyable movie that you can enjoy at Christmas or anytime!
