You don't know what movie or version Jeff saw, but the whole movie was amazing, not just Poitier and Going. The story was riveting, exciting and engaging. And for those who complain about historical accuracy, remember. Yes, there were some black marshals in the Indians, but they were not entitled to arrest white outside India. As a rule, they do not "patrol" but only execute warrants for criminals. It seemed strange to me that Corby didn't seem to have "any" Indian friends. I know their number has diminished, but it still seems strange to me, though Corby has returned to his people, his Indian cohorts remain anonymous and nameless.
