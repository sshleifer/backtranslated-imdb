It is difficult to understand this film today and in the US. We can't compare it. Here is a comparison attempt: It is as if during the last years of Saddam's rule, a film director in Iraq might have somehow created a film that for the first time ever showed the life he actually lived in that country. The life of an ordinary young girl, with all the horror and oppression. Then the film was exposed freely in Iraq. If you could imagine it being an unlikely event, then you should have an idea of ​​what happened to this film in the last years of the Soviet Union. Before this film, Soviet cinematography was highly censored. Soviet films would show an ideal life in a working paradise. Then it all at once. Alcoholism, a random sex, an ugly wasteland that was a Soviet city, suffocating pollution, a proletariat that sacrificed each other and itself, utter hopelessness - all this is there. People were amazed. Soviet women would often cry during exhibitions. Many would say it is their life story. It was a cultural earthquake that the filmmakers only dream of. This undoubtedly accelerated the collapse of the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Reading reviews here, I see that few people understand this movie. One says it was a breakthrough because it contained real sex. For Soviet viewers at the time, sex was a minor event compared to the fact that it displayed reality for the first time in Soviet film. Others compare it with contemporary films, such as "As Good As It Gets", as well as comparing Homer Illiada with John Griss's latest novel. They just don't compare. This is not just a movie, it was a social document and a transforming social force. It has to be seen or you won't understand the movie. Other reviewers see it as a film about a broken Russian family. One even says that it is difficult to apologize to Vera because he is still returning to his family. The point is that Vera and her family are symbols for the entire Soviet life. There was nowhere to go, because the family in the block and the other city was the same. For most people, it was life in the Soviet Union. It is a film that can be seen on many levels: as a drama that follows the landscape of despair, as a social documentary that shows the living conditions of that time, as a political documentary showing people's attitudes and many reasons for the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and as a moral documentary shows the evil of a dictatorship that is out of control, and the cruelty that victims will practice on themselves. Little Vera clearly shows the human tax that socialism ultimately takes on its victims, despite all the good intentions that this system may have. In doing so, he helped to end the Soviet regime, which contributed to one of the greatest changes in modern history. This film reaches just a few films. It is not just a stunning representation of history, but it also becomes a force in this formed history.
