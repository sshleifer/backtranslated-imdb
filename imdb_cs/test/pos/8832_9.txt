I came across this movie on DVD purely by chance through Blockbuster rental. Sailing to the planets is an excellent documentary / drama about the future "grand tour" of the solar system. This painful film adhering to current knowledge of planets and space flight and credible extensions from existing technologies tells the story of astronauts on their way to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Pluto. Special effects are great for TV shows. I found the actors believable as astronauts. The presented situations are largely credible and you will learn a lot about the science of planets and spaceflight! Only two small complaints: I have ever found some situations and dialogues. Besides, I'm not sure that a single crew and ship will be sent on one mission to see all these destinations at once. Visits to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, etc., will be more than likely to be separate missions. <br /> <br /> They were not trying to save on production at this show. The scenes of Venus and Mars were actually filmed in the northern deserts of Chile - the driest area on Earth and the dead ring for the Mars landscape. The weightless sequences were filmed in the Russian transport stream. Producers could dabble in one of these studies using studies and CGI, but instead chose a real thing. Especially I would like to mention the amazing music that was made for this movie. The exciting theme of Don Davis is the first thing that catches you when the movie starts because the beautiful Pegasus shot through the screen and David Suchet intones "it's the fate of a man to explore the stars ...". Watching on a small TV screen is one of the regrets I have. This is exciting to see in a movie theater, or better yet, an IMAX presentation!
