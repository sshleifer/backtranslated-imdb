This marvelous short strike will return home to all those who explicitly asked for something as a child because it was hip or cold to give them something that would mark you as a life with your peers and that your mom or dad told you (or both) that it didn't matter how you started seriously considering joining a witness protection program to avoid ridicule. For those US residents who are not scared because you are not watching hockey, it's like a Dallas Cowboy fan who gets a Washington Redskins jersey or a Yankees fan who gets a Red Sox jersey. It's not nice. For our European friends, imagine two big football clubs (football on us) and imagine a fan of one who takes a jersey from another. Au! NFB C Overcome Yourself Here! Une hommage du Maurice "Rocket" Richard, merci, M. Richard.
