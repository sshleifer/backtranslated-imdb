In this early Fulci work the director shows his majority of the mainstream party as well as the talent for compelling storytelling and more than reasonable clarification for the genre. Personally, I think he has been unfairly malevolent throughout his career as aesthet gore. It is a fairly capable procedural process and surprised me with its overtly rich story, which shows its distrust of the small mentality of small towns and the inefficiency of the police, as well as the twisted ideals of the Catholic Church, the last of which seemed to have decreased. this movie on his knees when he was first released and could give the director another direction so soon. The comparative lack of gore in the film shows the more urgent and psychological necessity of this film in its predominant "mystery," but the gore and puppetry it uses is mainly used in a scene where a falsely accused murderer is absurdly lynched by a crowd of men in the graveyard a show of vile and obsolete vigilantism, choreographically adapted to modern melodies from diegetic radio. Another example was the last scene (which was Really Amazing), where a strikingly handsome priest falls from a cliff, and the puppet used is marked in the middle detail that emphasized his demonic appearance and apparent ugliness. Curiously, with regard to his later works, Fulci also invokes the idea of ​​modernity caught on the village to adhere to his anachronistic superstition and ignorance when the concept of black magic is just that, the quaint image of the supernatural evil that never really ends up manifesting itself from the voodoo doll, while his Witch nothing more than a disturbed woman. Another thing I liked was that he added to these character layers by making the girl of the bourgeois city an ambiguous figure - a preacher a priest fears for his wards and perhaps more for himself? This giallo is suitable for becoming one of Fulci's more personal and substantial films, in that we have actually received a fair flow of thought from him.
