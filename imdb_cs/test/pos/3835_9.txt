When the Romulans come, they will not carry gifts; No, they bring war - war and conquest. As everyone familiar with this episode knows, this is the redux war movie "Enemy Under" from the 1950s. The obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and submarine (or US destroyer and German U-boat) dealing with deadly war games, they are two starships in space. In Trek's history, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, Earth fought the Romulan Wars. After about 5 years of conflict, the stalemate brought a contract and institution to the Neutral Zone, the border between us and the Romulan Empire. The treaty seems to have broken up at this stage, because our bases are being attacked and destroyed by a weapon of great power. Yes, the Romulans are back, trying their new war toy, and Kirk now has to earn a salary: he must make decisions that would affect this galaxy sector, such as finding out how to avoid ... oh, I don't know - maybe interstellar war ? I think what makes this episode so effective is that it does not avoid the grim aspects of war, as would be expected from a mere television episode of the 1960s - especially episodes of fiction science. It's all very tense and exciting, as well as the best war movies like Kirk sits with his key officers on what equals a war council. Writers and actors are not kidding here: that's all the preparation for a terrible conflict, perhaps the beginning of another summer-long battlefield. In the final analysis, Kirk's goal is to keep the battlefield on only two ships - but even then it is an effort full of dangers and probable casualties. In fact, I believe that this episode contains a record of the victims of the ships. Right at the beginning of the episode, we see the devastation that such a battle can produce in a supposedly well-protected base. Then start cat-and-mouse war games between the Enterprise and the Romulan ship - it's as exciting as any conflict we've seen on the big screen. Of course, if you're not in war movies, you would have to look for other things to admire in this episode. What makes this episode even more powerful is the revelation of what and what the Romulans are - it's an electric shock. Now we have yet another conflict between crews on the Enterprise Bridge - the war in some people tends to bring the worst. Because of the still ugly attitudes toward race in this future, tensions have grown even further - Kirk's hands are full in this hand. I suppose one weakness in this story is that we conclude the problem of fanaticism. On the Romulan side, actor Lenard makes his first appearance in Space Trek as Romulan Commander; He's amazing in the role, on the swivel side of Captain Kirk or Captain Pike, take your choice, make Spock look more than a little. Surprisingly, his character is not war hungry, as we would expect, another eye-opener for this episode. The actor would return to this universe as Sarek, Spock's father, so there's nothing unless it's universal. It is also a story about how the first appearance of characters such as Romulans is usually their best shot, as it is here. They appeared in the "Enterprise Incident" next.
