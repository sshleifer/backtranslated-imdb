If you took a really good jack black movie, some creepy jeepers added, and then a joyride dash with a hint of Texas Chainsaw massacre and a house of 1000 corpses ... should you MONSTER MAN! I went to this movie, really didn't expect much at all, but I ended up really enjoying the movie. The whole premise is really a cheesy, monster man in a monster truck chasing people, but it's so funny that a writer / director doesn't expect you to take it seriously. Justin Urich is a comical gem and should have a very promising career. is identical to jack black. the only problem with the film is the incredible heroic role played by eric jungmann. But overall, if you're looking for a truly fun movie that breaks you when you roll in the aisles while scaring those crap out of you ... check out this movie.
