Yes, you can look at Babett's feast as some sort of slap on Puritan Christianity, but it's much more. The superficial story of a gifted Parisian cook fleeing Paris after one of his middle-class revolutions and found himself on the shore in Jutland in the north of Denmark is simply a fat that allows deeper narration. Babette is an artist, one of the small armies of people who have been driven from the pillar for centuries so that politicians, robbery, greedy and arrogant who kill beauty for profit, something that politics always makes, the pace of the National Foundation for Art, which simply institutionalizes creativity for propaganda purposes. Babette is on her last legs as she walks into a small village where two virgin sisters live to see their descending flock of devotees to their late pastor. They live on salt cod and black bread porridge. Babette shows these simple pious people that God is in pleasure and sensuality, as well as in behavior and mental purity. He also shows them how this mental cleanliness can lead to the control of madness, which we all know in these days of neo-authoritarians that they would limit our personal freedoms because they are a crime against the state, or as humanity would say. Babette cooks a bang-up French dinner to celebrate the 100th birthday of the late Reverend. Daughters and their flock think the devil is among them, and they promise not to notice food or drink. Just at this point, while preparing the meal, Babette paid for winning the French lottery to start tearing. It is a poisoning caused in comparison with everyday vulgarity and indifference that floods our consciousness from morning to night through media and power maneuvers to gain an advantage over all of us in the dark. The simple sophistication of Babett's artistic work spits out in the face of all the mock speeches in our modern society, and it hurts to see how he is doing so well in this beautiful movie. It's together with Fanny and Alexander (Bergman), my favorite movie ever, but I can only watch it once in a while because, like a rare bottle of wine served with Blinis and fresh oysters, it's something that must not be exaggerated. Great, great movie that should be in every library of movie lovers.
