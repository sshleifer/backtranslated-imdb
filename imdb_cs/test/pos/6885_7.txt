When I returned to Blockbuster with my friend, I decided at night that we were too broken and too lazy to be actively involved. She decided she wanted to watch Closer, which seemed like an idea that I had to rent another movie for once when she went to bed. When I looked around I didn't see much of what I was interested in, but I saw Doll Master in the news section. Just on the sleeve (Woman with a tear like tears blood) I thought it would be interesting enough to rent. As far as the film itself is concerned, watching in an almost empty movie house, with all the lights off, was scary. I have to admit that I have always had a little phobia dolls since I was a kid (and watched a horrible film called Asylum, one of the stories in it included a mental patient who created a doll who killed people. the first three quarters of this film really hit me. The first half hour was amazing. The horrifying premonition atmosphere really set the scene well, and without dolls moving it seemed threatening. But unfortunately, as soon as it all began to move, it was a bit cheesy, I was a little disappointed when moments that could be really scary made me laugh because of how they were shot. <br /> <br /> As a character for horror movies, you really don't expect anything unforgettable. I found myself remembering the names and faces better than most of the Asian horror movies I saw, suggesting that there must have been some hidden character development that I didn't consciously notice. Typical stereotypes in this film are in effect, each of them having a character that distinguishes them from others, from shy and quiet Yeong-ha to her Damien doll, to the departing bimbo Seon-yeong. The plot itself was quite cool, though the end, which bought a lot of free sources of conspiracy, seemed a bit confused and didn't really do anything for me, even though it had some really cool conspiracies that wouldn't ruin it. The basic plot is a bunch of children to be modeled as dolls of a famous recluse doll, must stay in a haunted house (decorated with scary dolls, some big little ones) and things begin to happen as our heroine Hae-starts to explore the area of ​​the house to other residents. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would definitely recommend a movie, not looking at too many people, because some of these moments would probably be laughing when you're surrounded by friends, but as something you see with your own eyes in the dark, with open windows and doors, just in case you want to watch the dolls. It's really letting you guess for most of the movie, allowing you to go for wild conspiracy theories only to completely destroy them later. If you really get into it and ignore it on the spot, I can guarantee that you will be checking under the bed before you go to sleep, and maybe leave the lights on. Or maybe it's me: P As for Closer, it was okay, but I preferred it.
