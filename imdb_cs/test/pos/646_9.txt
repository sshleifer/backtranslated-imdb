I love this little movie that reminds me of the original Japanese jewel SHALL WE DANCE? Luckily I found it and recorded it when it was on STARZ Promo Weekend, because I know it's not available on DVD. I will only look at something with Yancy Butler (whoever recalls the short TV series MANN and MACHINE ???) in it, and she positively shines on it. She makes a dance routine on a disco song that is verrrryyyyyy HOT !! He loved all the other characters in it, especially those played by Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron (where are all those years?). This is one of those movies I choose from time to time and I always went out with a smile after watching it. Very recommended !!!
