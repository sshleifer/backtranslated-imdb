I liked this movie very much, but the feeling that I was leaving was a memory of how much I enjoyed the novel. The film presents two of the best actresses today - Jessica Lange, who is great here, and the divine Jennifer Jason Leigh, who does the best she can do with the thin character given to her - as well as the surprisingly outstanding Michelle Pfeiffer and Jason standing Robards. Adjustment is essentially a faithful book, at least as faithful as it can be in an hour and forty minutes. The film really does not dazzle, except for certain scenes between Lange and Pfeiffer, but it does a thoroughly competent job of visualizing this beautifully tragic story. As for the movies edited from the novels, it certainly was better. If nothing else, she sent me back to her shelves to rediscover my favorite passages from Jane Smiley's excellent novel, and back to King Lear to take care of the tiny characters to see how deep the parallels go. It is worth your time as a movie, certainly, and hopefully you will remember that reading great literature is also a pleasure.
