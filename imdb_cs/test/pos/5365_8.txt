I saw it at the Stony Brook Film Festival in NY in 2004 and was very warmly received. A few German rocket scientists working on the Scottish island of Scarp in the film before the World War II, as war appears on the horizon. The characters we meet on the island are invaluable in their creation and display. Shauna MacDonald is especially unforgettable <br /> <br /> After getting on speed on "Scootish" accents, the viewer feels at home with these people watching the fun as the Germans work to link their island to the mainland through delivery mail based missiles. It seems this film was so unlikely that it was based on a real story. All in all, an unforgettable movie that will stay with you for a while thanks to its cast, its story or its scenery.
