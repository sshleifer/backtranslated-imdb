Although this film doesn't have the darkness of books, it's a great movie in my opinion. It's great fun at the campsite with beautiful Stuart Townsend like Lestat. She doesn't have to have blonde hair and blue eyes that are so vividly described in the book, but to be fair, she doesn't look good with blonde hair and Lestat definitely looks good. She moves like a predator I always imagined would have Lestat. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are pretty good and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. It's not an interview with a vampire, so don't try to compare these two. Interview is Louis's story. This is a carved and embedded version of Lestat's. In any case, I highly recommend.
