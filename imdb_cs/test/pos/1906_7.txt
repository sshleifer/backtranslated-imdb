Of course, seeing a few boom mikes doesn't mean anything? Sir, Rudy Ray Moore and D'Urville Martin really put it together? I laughed a lot, as often happens in these types of movies, but I don't know what to laugh about because I laughed at many other things. I'm not saying that the film was bad, but I'll say that a little more editing would work miracles. I'm a huge Blaxploitation fan, so I don't think it was awful, but I know the "Human Tornado" was a few times better than this. I think those who can do it might need Colt 45 or two. I mean, it really helps you not to notice it reappearing.
