Happy 25th Birthday in Valley Girl! A great soundtrack, a credible story, a wonderful performance ... captures the spirit of the 80s; slang of main streams and outcasts. Wonderful rendition of college life and "brave center" from a suburban perspective. The soundtrack includes Modern English, Felony, Josie Cotton, Sparks, Payola $, Josie Cotton, The Plimsouls, The Psychedelic Fur, Men at Work, Flirt and Bananarama. This movie is really Romeo and Juliet (minus double suicide) in Los Angeles in 1980. Julie's father, played by Frederic Forrest (Anyone? Sonny Bono) Is hysterical as a hippie idealistic dad who wonders how a materialistic offspring emerged. Still, he doesn't judge ya dig?
