I found the movie Judas Kiss Excellent. Carly Gugino's performance was extraordinaire, probably her best career. Her facial expressions in many scenes were incredibly true to nature and director Gutierrez exploited them. All the actors and actresses were very good at their performances. As usual Emma Thompsom was amazing. Her acting skills are beyond what would be required for this character, so she really improves her in the film. The story, though sometimes too complicated, is fun and goes towards the end. Very very good. A film that you must not miss. Story well woven and brilliantly driven. Movie quality, great.
