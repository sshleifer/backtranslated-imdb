Okay, other reviewers have largely covered the main points of this great little gem, ie the story began in life as a material for the silent classics of Buster Keaton "7 Chance". Comedy, or acting in any genre for it much, is only to interpret the scene and lines that someone else has written and played before, if it is not entirely original creation. Here we have Stoogs who basically make material that someone else has written and done, and yet they manage things well for a low budget, a short period of film. No matter what credits they say on their movies, the real "stooge-philes" know they have had lots of entrances on the tracks and directions. They took their work as seriously as a surgeon makes a vital operation. Words Emil Sitka herself during a documentary about boys. Here, what seems to be their usual anarchy over something as simple as getting married is actually organized chaos. Each line is perfectly timed with the appropriate physical activity. How many comics are there today who can afford such a championship? Apparently it's a Seinfeld crew, but no one else I've seen in the last 35 years watching TV. Critics will always be "pooh pooh" The Stooges or Laurel & Hardy and others, but then again ... who ever remembers the critics' names or what they said? Just watch, laugh and enjoy!
