This is one great show that I'm wondering why it has been so many times out of the air. But I believe he's here now! This show can not be compared to any other than the Simpsons was quite "on the edge" and than came Family Guy, and they are stretching it to go off the "edge". Things that this show is getting rid of are incredible. Totally work watch! If you like the Simpsons, you'll LOVE Family Guy!
