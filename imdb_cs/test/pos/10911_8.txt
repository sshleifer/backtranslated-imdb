While friendly and entertaining for a gay audience, Frank Oz's film "In and Out", about a gay teacher's locker who was eliminated from a former student's national television, was disinfected and deodorized to appeal to larger and more beneficial direct viewers that sponsored "The Bird Cage" . Although the audience probably patted itself on the back for being tolerant and liberal enough to see the film, the film revolves around Kevin Kline's Howard Brackett, who is roughly a stereotypical homosexual. The film asserts that the tendency to dance to disco music, to appeal to Barbra Streisand movies and dress well shows one's sexual orientation. Like the "Queer Eye", the film actually takes a backhanded slap on equal men and stereotypes is as sloppy, dull and tasteless and cultured. OK, so "In a Out" is just comedy, but comedies also send messages that can hurt. Unfortunately, humor is somewhat pathetic in the middle of the film. Howard is middle-aged, deeply covered or self-denied, and apparently never had sex life. A three-year engagement with a teacher in a school where she works is described as a series of sunsets, long talks and watching "Funny Lady". Fortunately, Joan Cusack plays Howard's intended Emily Montgomery, who steals the show. Most of the movie's funniest moments belong to her, though Kline's attempts to resist dance during the instructional tape on macho behavior are cheerful. He is a talented physical artist, but the film only gives him a few moments to shine. Matt Dillon also stands out as a student turned actor, and a clip of his Oscar-nominated film about a gay soldier is hysterical. However, despite the film's gay theme, there is no boy-meets-romance boy, and only one man-to-male kiss, and that smoothoch is about as erotic as one between Michael and Fredo Corleone in "The Godfather II." "In and Out", though well-intentioned, cannot solve the injustices and prejudices that it illustrates. Howard is released from his teaching work despite his excellent performance and credentials, yet little indignation is expressed. Most characters are more upset about canceling a wedding than about Howard's self-realization, which seems to take place overnight, and his sudden and unfair dismissal. No wonder Howard's parents, portrayed by Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley, and his students support him. However, the final finale is so embarrassing for the audience, as it was in Howard Brackett's movie. The film would be more refreshing if it revolved around a gay man who dressed like a slacker, was an angry fan of football, drove a estate, listened to country music and lived on fast food. Despite some good performances and witty situations, "In and Out" preserves stereotypes and, whether positive or negative, stereotypes should be set in a dustbin of social history.
