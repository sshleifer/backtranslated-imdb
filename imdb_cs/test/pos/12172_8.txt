First, from Munich, where this film takes place and believe it or not, there are guys like Erkan and Stefan, including a stupid dialect! I know their comedy show is from the beginning and my main fear was that the movie is just a collection of their already known jokes, but it's not! Jokes evolved through the story and made, in a special way, sense. But if you don't like Erkan und Stefan, the hands of this movie. Everyone else - worth seeing!
