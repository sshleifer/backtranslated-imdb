James Cagney, a petty officer and a political assistant, became deputy commissioner for repair and attends a boy's reform school. The catch is that Cagney is not in it for the graft, he really wants to make a difference in the lives of children there because it comes from a background like theirs. The villain's piece is Dudley Digges, who is a fissile cleaver and a mocking hypocrite to introduce. One of the contexts of the conspiracy of the Mayor of Hell is that these children are predominantly immigrants, and those who judge them and are in power positions are those who have been there for several generations. Note in the hall scene as Digges offers prayer thanks for the food they are about to receive, Digges is eating well, but the kids are getting good quality that you would feed your pet. Cagney has some trouble in the city with some of his followers and has to take it on the lam. It puts Digges back in order and prepares the film for its peak. The Mayor of Hell was a typical working class product. And because it was pre-Code that sometimes gets pretty horrible. A later version of this, Crime School, with Humphrey Bogart and Dead End Kids, was a more disinfected remake. Although Cagney is fine in the lead role as Madge Evans's school sister, acting honors goes to Dudley Digges. It is hard to believe that the same man could have portrayed a drunk, but kindly, one of the ship's ship surgeons at Mutina's Bounty. But Digges is a great player and a pleasure to watch in every movie he is in. This film is often not shown because of the racial and ethnic stereotypes it displays. Today, many minorities would be offended. It's a good movie. Interestingly, the movie Sleepers came out a few years ago and touched on some of the same issues. I think films about reform schools don't change.
