"Hit and Run" is a horrible story in which the beautiful Margaret Colin always plays as a company that "has everything" until she hits a child with a car and leaves the scene. Hence the name. The tragedy is that it is help and return, but it is frightened by angry passers-by who think the hitter has left the scene. This was done on days when not everyone had a cell phone or there was no story. Colin's guilt and anxiety are palpable and cause him to behave so strangely that the detective gets away on her right. Her lies dip her deeper and deeper into a hole that is ugly in itself, causing her worse. It's a very provocative story, and one can't help it feel the Lady's pain that she wants to be just clean. As a TV movie, thanks to Colin and a strong screenplay, it's a well above-average TV movie.
