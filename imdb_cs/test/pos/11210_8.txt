Reading some of the other reviews of this movie, I was reminded of both good and not so good aspects of it. But overall, I have to say that this is one of the best films I've seen recently in many genres or countries. More than anything else, he avoided many of the typical pitfalls of more recent international cinema, such as taking nice landscapes or being "hip", "fun", or imitating American movies, such as fiction. The film is unique in many ways. For one thing, it's a movie about relationships where sex plays no part (unusual, especially for foreign movies). It is also a film about the relationship between two men (also unusual - not "buddy", no homosexual tension, no ego / phallic competition). It uses a small dialogue but communicates a huge amount. It's a simple story, yet full of complex details that are easy to understand for every human being and universal in their meaning. I did not find a dark or depressing film (everything would look like this if you were looking at the Hollywood happy endings of the movies all the time), but rather the real reflection of human emotions. For example, in a scene where Mahmut realizes that his cousin is gone, you see his feeling of relief that the cousin is gone and still regrets having pushed him away. Who did not feel such ambivalence - when he lost a friend or lover, or in any other situation? It is rare that these kinds of real human emotions appear on the film in a neoclassical manner. As for culture, or it is a Turkish film, I feel that it is a very difficult balance between a "Turkish" film - a reality that is more concerned with this place (a greater struggle for it to happen in the Turkish city versus the European, a greater contrast between land and city) and a universal, human story that is not necessarily set in Turkey. Nowadays, when people around the world consume culture and fetish, this film does not seek to entice us as "Turkish", nor does it seek to convey it as "cruel reality" or "that is how Turkey / Istanbul IS '. And yet there are cultural elements. I think a comparison with "lost in translation" that someone has done is pretty good. Everyone, at least in the US, waved the movie. Personally, I thought it was average at best. This was well laid out by someone as a vague story that supposedly had to deal with "disorientation" that happens to people living or traveling abroad. Even if the film were to be funny, the characters and their motivation or crisis were never clear (even in the case of a "lighter" movie or comedy is necessary). And I found myself being a typical "orientalist" story of alienated Amerian abroad. Let's go back to "Remote", as well as the idea that it's a bad deal, or too slow, or has no conspiracy, I'm sorry, but people who say it don't know anything about making a movie and maybe nothing about it that they would be people, no offense. You do not have to be a film enthusiast or cultural expert to appreciate this film. This movie will have two hours of your time!
