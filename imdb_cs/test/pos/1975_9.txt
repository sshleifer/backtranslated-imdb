It was a great movie, I would compare it to The Game. You get to the end of the fast movement and cant ... your brain has been removed and shaken (not mixed) and returned to the head. Don't plan anything after this movie, you'll need time to think about what just happened. Don't come to this movie and expect the Matrix million to be spent on special effects. , they keep you involved, no, they suck you and dont let go for the duration of the movie. Great acting, great land ... very nice movie, I can't say enough. Also a very original plot, lots of twists and ideas that I would never think of. The end is sudden and leaves you hanging wondering was it real? Is it really over? Good end, I'm not saying it's bad ... he just lets you think, and a little frayed. A great movie for those who like action like a good plot on this movie will get lost lost) and like games in mind because it's exactly in the nutshell what it is.
