It's not a bad movie first. It's good and I like characters. I also like Lady and Hiker voice more in this. However, I'd like to see Lady and Tramp more. I know it says 'Scamp's Adventure', and I like Scamp And Angel, but it's a continuation of the original where I think it should be released as 'Scamp's Adventure', not 'Lady and Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure' '. The hiker had a pretty big role, but he didn't have much time with Lady. But anyway, the songs are pretty good and Scamp and Angel are sweet. I saw a better sequel, but hey, it's not a failure. I give it 7/10. Very good, but still lacking.
