First, the whole scenario is mostly improvised, which contributes to the fantastic illusion that what we're watching is a real documentary. Secondly, the actors hired by Watkins were deliberately chosen to represent their true political alliance and background. The depictions of hippies are real hippies, government officials (though not necessarily in government itself) being at least actually hearty conservatives within the system, and several cops are real policemen. The interaction of these actors, given the text freedoms assigned by Watkins, eventually comes to a violent head where even Watkins himself is convinced that a member of the congregation was actually shot. (We hear him screaming "Cut! Cut!" In the background.) The film AMAZING, though American critics were quite rough in their reviews, one of the real reports that it was " the most offensive "movie, seen. This is not entirely unexpected, because revealing this oppressive communist form of America during this era would surely shake some cages. This pseudo-documentary film definitely requires an open mind, though if you are looking for a truly accurate picture of 60's culture, it will be a movie that it will follow.
