Many of the earlier comments are right on money, but some, well, not so much. This is hardly a movie "B" ... it's well made, live flying sequences are really great and model sequences are the first speed. It's not "cheap". Ricard Barthelmess is pretty good at it, and he does a nice piece for "Only the Angels Have Wings". <br /> <br /> If you want to spot John Wayne, in the first place J. Carrol Naish, they will end up together. Tom Browne is teenage enough (and somewhat boring), but when he confuses him with the most perverted pencil mustache in Hollywood history, it makes his character even less believable. Sally Eilers is much more. For later influences, Wellman is in the early Airliner-in-Distress zone ... the opening sequence of this film, with a guy arriving at "Grand Central Airport" would be very well suited to "The High and Mighty" ... just imagine Regis Toomey ... and 1955 Buick.
