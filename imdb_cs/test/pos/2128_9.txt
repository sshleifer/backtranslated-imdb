This movie was a very cute and absolutely little girl appropriate. My nieces are watching it non-stop because they've gotten it, and as a result I've seen it almost four times all the way. I can't get enough. CGI pictures are great to watch, humor is good, and ballet views are excellent. Although the story has a few holes, no little girl picks up on them, and as an adult, the movie is so charming that one barely notices. Just keep in mind that this is a Barbie movie, and although occasionally in my experience, he lives up to the high standard created for him by other Princess Barbie movies. I would recommend it to anyone who has a little girl who always wanted to be a princess. They also teach a good lesson. Everyone is in a way different and different, and everyone can change something.
