If this movie was made in the 1950s or 1960s, critics and fans would praise it. I myself enjoyed the film from start to finish. It's not a timeless piece and has not aged over the years, but it is nice to watch, however. As for the actress Mrs. Ritchie in the movie? It's not the best on this planet - but it adds to the film's unique grotesque comedy - aspiration and shows Madonna the (often underrated) sense of comedic timing. Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a former convict who was built for a crime she didn't commit. Griffin Dunne plays the unfortunate future of the groom / puppet, who is sent to escort her from prison to the bus station where a series of unfortunate events occur, creating a conspiracy. (And there is * one, people!) Give the movie a shot. You may be pleasantly surprised at how funny it is.
