While songs and dance numbers, in general, are not as strong as they would be, the film story and messages are still there and loudly echoes the simple 70's music numbers. Keep in mind that this movie was made after Hollywood Musical almost died out (with a few exceptions that are rock musicals), the audience that could see the new didn't appreciate the fact that it was a brave attempt something that hasn't been done yet. The audience that sees him today will tend to judge him against the movies and musicals of today, and perhaps the huge star cast of the musicals they've missed. But to this film, or to all this, is the injustice to the film itself. There are good musical moments in the movie. The first is Bobby Van. Mr. Van took over his role of Harry Lovett just after the closure of Tony's two-year nominee (for Best Actor) of the Broadway Revival Run, "No, No, Nanette." It's singing and dancing - a man out of the way, and honestly, the only one in the cast who was really talented and experienced for musicals. He never misses a step in his "answer me question" and rightly ... he was completely home like Harry. Olivia Hussey makes other nice numbers when he welcomes new visitors and while the lyrics are weak, James Shigeta shows his strong voice in the "Family" song as well as a nicely done staging of the whole work. Watch a movie about what it is ... a fantasy about a place where you will never grow old, hidden in the ice and snowy mountains of Tibet, found by a group of unsuspecting modern people wrapped in any modern culture. Take it and compare it to reality and get a movie that doesn't reach your goal. But ... take this film for the message of love and peace and calm and fraternal love, and get a warm and refreshing message and positive. others will welcome the release from the hectic pace of reality. Do not try to review and enjoy messages for the first attempt. On the other hand, you have discovered the secret of Shangri-La!
