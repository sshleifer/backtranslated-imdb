A fabulous movie I've watched several times since I bought the video just four days ago. Yes, I'm Colin Firth Fan and Colin was his usual talented, natural gorgeous man. The interaction between Colin (Matthew Field) and Fissy (Sammy, Nimi's 7 year old son) was very strange and so natural to watch. They were cheerfully funny and also touched my hearts. I liked the scene the most when Sammy and Matt were sitting on the wall talking to Matt. Also very hilarious was Sammy quizzing Matt about sex, Colin and Fissy were perfect in this scene and doing what may be an embarrassing topic between adult and child so natural. Colins words and face at the end of this scene were so wonderful and told it all! just brilliant. Credit, of course, must also go to Fissy Roberts for his wonderful Sammy view. He played so cute and cheeky childish character. Both actors were perfect together. The interaction between Colin (Matt) and Niou (Nimi) was totally balanced and I could not agree that the chemistry between them was amazing when they watched, portraying love, tension, and of course passion. It was exciting to see how their subtle blooming romance gradually developed, and also showed how their cultural and social differences influenced their relationship and it was good to see how Colin and Nia sensitively portrayed Matt and Nimi how they discover, accept and overcome these differences. He kept me on TV and guessing the end of the movie. Colins' portrayal of Matt's vulnerable and youthful side was also perfectly rendered so that I found it hard to watch when Matt was so average and childish towards Sammy because (Matt) felt that Sammy didn't that he managed to establish his romance / relationship with Mother Mother Nimi. She couldn't help Matt for feeling very disappointed, angry, and frustrated with treating him with Sammy. Colins' special talent 'get inside the character's head' and portraying viewers on different sides of the character, was very proof here and the pure spell tracked. I must also mention that Colin also has a good relationship with young actors (see also "My life so far is amazing and must not be a missed movie"). I also loved Matthew's relationship with his wife Jenny, both of whom were brilliant in showing viewers the dark side and tensions in their marriage, and not all seemingly "happy marriages" are what seem to be outside . I must not forget to mention the memory I thought was a very fun, serious way! Nimi's mother and family were also cheerful, as well as the importance of Nimi's culture and her situation. The disadvantage that I can't really find, but to be objective in terms of film and credibility to my review, the only negative comment I would make is that the screenwriters didn't explain in sufficient detail why Matt in the car collapsed. his heart. However, it did not undo my enjoyment of the movie, far from it. I just needed to rewind the tape a little for 2. take. I felt that this film had everything, fun, uplifting, and loved rich colors and sunny scenery. The film warmed up a cold day and made me smile :-)) All the essential elements there were, laughter, love, tension, sadness, anger, drama and warm feeling good factor, with, yes a lot of those great Colin Firth moments, including a very soaked Colin in 'Wet Shirt Scene', don't miss any fan what more girl can wish for ;-)) <br /> <br I highly recommend this movie, especially for all Colin Firth fans ;-)
