I listen to Istanbul, deliberately, eyes closed: First a gentle breeze and leaves on the trees Swing slightly; Outside, Far, Water Carrier Bells constantly circled; I listen to Istanbul, deliberately, eyes closed. I listen to Istanbul, deliberately, eyes closed; Then suddenly the birds fly, flocks of birds, high, with shade and crying, while the nets are drawn in the hunting ground and the women's feet begin to dabble in water. I am Iistening to Istanbul, intent, closed eyes. I listen to Istanbul, deliberately, eyes closed. The Grand Bazaar is calm and cool, a buzz in the center of the market, the mosque yard is full of pigeons. While the hammers are shaking and kneeling on the docks Spring winds carry the scent of sweat; I listen to Istanbul, deliberately, eyes closed. I listen to Istanbul, deliberately, eyes closed; Still disturbed by the past, the coastal mansion with the dirty shipyards is asleep. In the middle of the dune and the drone of the southern winds, deployed, I listen to Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed. I listen to Istanbul, deliberately, eyes closed. Pretty girl walks on the sidewalk: Four-letter words, whistles and songs, rough notes; Something falls out of hand It's a rose, I think. I listen to Istanbul, deliberately, eyes closed. I listen to Istanbul, deliberately, eyes closed. A bird trembles around your skirt; Is there sweat on your face? Or not? I know. Are your lips wet? Or not? I know. The silver moon rises above the pines. I listen to Istanbul, deliberately, eyes closed. For you, my neighbor, All is for you, Night is for you, days are for you; Daylight is for you, moonlight is for you; Leaves in moonlight; Miracle and wisdom in leaves, Myriad greens in daylight, yellow is for you and pink. The feeling of skin on the palm, its warmth, its softness, comfort lying down; For you, all greetings and masts are in port; Names of the Days, Names of the Months, Fresh Boats' Color for You Postal Feet, Potter's Hands Pot on the forehead, Bullets fired on the battle fronts; Graves are for you and tombstones, jails and handcuffs and death sentences They are for you Everything is for you. SEA NOSTALGIA <br /> <br /> Vessels sail along my dreams, over roofs, boats for the feast of color, and pathetic, longing for the sea, year, and look and weep. I remember my first glimpse of the world I opened through the shell of the shell: The greenest water and the most beautiful sky And the rarest piece fish ... My blood still flows salty where the oysters cut my skin. What was our crazy speed that was our High Seas on the whitest foam! Foam bears no anger, like lips whose adultery with men is not shame. <br /> <br /> Vessels sail through our dreams Over the roofs, color feasts and the poor, the desire for the sea year after year - Orhan Veli <br /> <br /> I couldn't say nothing better than what Orhal Veli Kanik said about Istanbul. I only praise this film. A very nice and balanced introduction to the city and its music that united Asia, Europe and Africa at one time.
