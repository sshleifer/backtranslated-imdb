Chan-wook Park, you gotta hand it over to the guy. In my eyes, he is not only a great director but also a great director who can turn his hand to any genre and often provide something refreshing but still satisfying. Thirst is basically a vampire story, but one of them plays fast and free with some subgenre rules. Kang-Song is playing Father Sang-hyeon, a man who unselfishly surrenders to the research program, and then to the unselfish kind of catches he tries to heal, die and return. Thanks to the blood he was transfused with. Being the only five hundred people to survive is becoming quite a celebrity for those who know it and all it wants is to get back to normal. Normal, however, now includes being able to jump large distances without injury, wanting to drink blood and getting severely hot under the collar when the sun's rays get on its skin. It is not long before he lives with a rather dysfunctional family unit that recognized him in his childhood, and while hiding his new, strange lifestyle, he finds himself in a complicated love triangle that becomes more acceptable for darker thoughts and slips down a slippery slope. lead him from man to beast to monster. Slowly Blending Many Genres, Park's film seemed much fresher and original to me than Let The Right One In, and really impressed me with its approach to material that could easily feel worn out and again crushed like any other vampire movie we've seen over the years. It is a mixture of horror, melodrama and comedy, and at the same time thinks about ideas such as the power of faith, power over life and death, the disadvantage of immortality, etc. Etc. Some people have complained that this genre-blending approach weakens the film, but I personally found that it was a lively, fun, and always enjoyable movie that helped a great central performance from the song like a tortured priest and fantastic turns from a supportive cast without weak links. Many characters get into movement with different emotions, all with skill and credibility, especially with a young woman (played by OK-vin Kim) who becomes the subject of priestly love, lust and affection. Fans of Asian cinema (and especially Park), as well as Poe fans "The Tell-tale Heart" should pop it up, it's another cool movie from a man who seems to that he takes everything to his own pace and always manages to release less than solid entertainment. <br /> <br /> See if you like: Cronos, Near Dark, Dellamorte Dellamore AKA Cemetery Man.
