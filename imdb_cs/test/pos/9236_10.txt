After watching the "Texas Story of Betrayal" you feel renewed resistance for the nature of the Hollywood beast. Inside the interviews and interviews of all involved with the project, there is a common sense of duel and rebellion that covers backgrounds, social classifications and even geography. This can be attributed to the hard work of the whole project's commitment to the project's story and love of the original film and the complete creation of the vacuum that is its creator. The range of people involved in "Waldo Hawaiian Holiday" was amazing to me in no budget, no fame production. There were no trailers or craftsmanship, no equipment at all, and they were all involved. If nothing happens from this project, Antstuie Productions laid the foundation for being a serious, sincere company that never stops and does not take or sell out and creates a film for money. I'd like to see a director, L.A. go through a guerrilla process to get a chance. A more realistic realistic cinema is missing at this time of CG and green screens. The masses can look forward to their fun teaspoon, which is served to them in censored, pleasant bites, but there is a large group of people who have shared the views and insights of filmmakers in the world who are still making films for love of material. or love to tell, not sell DVD or checkout. I loved this document, and I hope IFC has the stones to pick it up and broadcast it so that maybe, perhaps, one more person decides to pick up the camera and make some real life, so the viewer can even have a temporary understanding that everywhere is the same, and anyone can be a real storyteller.
