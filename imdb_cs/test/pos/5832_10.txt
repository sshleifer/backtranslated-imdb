Oz, the first original TV show HBO introduced to his channel (in 1-hour form) and to this day is the best ... The story is simple ... Oz is a surrealistic insight into the lives of high people The maximum security of prisoners in Oswald, especially focusing to "Em City". Here are a lot of things to show off this typeface (which I think was the best on TV when this show was broadcast), directing (top notch), playing (the best of the best) and characters ... show just she literally threw her socks ... This show was a critically acclaimed jewel until the Sopranos moved away, after the critics saluted this epic story of trust and family to notice this convincing drama ... Oz is a better show than Sopranos overall and is it is a pity that I never won any big Emmy's ... = / <br /> <br /> kudos to all who joined this magnificent, gut - gaudy, show ... <br /> <br /> KUDOS
