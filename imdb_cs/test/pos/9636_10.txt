This is another classic Seagal movie. He passes, no, only the other Mega Seagal films pass through the patriot. Nothing in this movie comes close to thinking of Seagal, except for the part where he has to find a cure for the so-called "plague" and throws things about the lab, but it all works out. must win. And what his clothes in the film, a masterpiece, had to pick him up by himself. It's great that everyone in the movie dies after being exposed to the virus, but Seagal doesn't even get coughing. Event at the end, when he kills a fat guy with broken glass, a genius, I bet Seagal was thinking about it. This film is clean and simple. great land, great characters and seagal.
