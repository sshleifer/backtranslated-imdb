I agree that this film was spectacular. The way Jamie Foxx captured, not just Ray Charles's impression, but the essence of Ray Charles actually made the movie. His life was a great story and it's good that he is finally told. I also found a great interview with Jamie Foxx about this role of Ernie Manouse from InnerVIEWS on KUHT, Houston Channel 8.

Docid = -3001837218936089620 & q = innerviews + jamie + foxx I urge everyone to see how it explores in depth what went into his role and his personal feelings about Ray Charles. The only problem I can quote with the movie is that the shot style was sometimes rather bland, but in the end I think it helped make the story more realistic and focus on Ray Ray than on Ray.
