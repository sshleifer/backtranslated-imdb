This is by far my favorite action movie. But what makes it not work complicated Renny Harlin blasts and shoot-em-ups. It is a script by Shane Black and his skillful delivery of Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson. The chemistry between the two principles deserved a continuation. Thank God it's never been. Too much risk of taking the original. There is never a boring moment. This must be Jackson's funniest role and the amazing thing is that he plays one of the most common characters in his career. No quirky Tarantino hit-man, super-cool Shaft, or border psycho soldier. In TLKG, Jackson is everyone we identify with. Poor schmuck stretches to this crazy female odyssey to uncover the dangerous secrets of his past. Although the story claims that Davis's character, Samantha Caine suffers from amnesia, the writer and director treat her condition as if it were multiple personality disorder. Samantha Caine is not just a new identity accepted by Amnesian Charly Baltimore - he's an independent, fully developed personality. The traumas suffered by Samantha in the first half-hour of the film help to re-discover Charly's subtle dissociation. The materials of her past life exploited by Jackson's detective Mitch Henessey facilitate Charly's resurrection. Good timing also with regard to the goal that Samantha does. But Charly has to fight alone to remain the dominant personality. One is gathered from pieces of dialogue that the warrior personality (Charly) developed after her father died and was adopted by a "chapter". At the age of eight Charly was buried in the psyche, though, Samantha evolved into a dominant personality. This is probably because it becomes a mother because it is a meeting with a daughter who breaks Charly's struggle to suppress Samantha, leading to their obvious integration into the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Is it I can't choose the "best quote" from this movie: <br /> <br /> "Are you a sharpshooter now?" <br /> <br /> "I saved your ass. It was great!" "Continue dying. Out." "Dive into the jaw and scream" Pop goes weasel ". <br /> <br /> A few more than a dozen, many too cocky here to quote. (Listen to Charley's history, do math) Fantastic soundtrack Santana, Muddy Waters, Elvis, LaBelle, Marvin Gaye. <br /> <br /> I'm giving 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' and 9, just because I don't believe perfect 10 "I've seen it a dozen times and it's still fresh. A nice twisted holiday smear on the shelf next to 'It's a wonderful life.'
