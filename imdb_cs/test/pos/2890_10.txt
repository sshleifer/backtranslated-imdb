Rush in Rio is simply an amazing DVD. This concert is one of the highlights of Rush's history and their music brings brilliant and stronger than ever. I was lucky to have been at this concert, not only that, I was in the first place grabbing a gate that separated the audience from the stage !! It's the first and only time I saw a Rush concert and it was my dream. I have no words to describe this experience exactly, but I can tell you that it is one of the highlights of my life. Some people complain about the sound of this DVD, which says it is not too bright and polished, but the sound you are listening to is real, as it was at the concert. It is raw and powerful and so authentic that every time I look back and live the beautiful moment again. Many artists record live performances and then do a lot of improvements, so the final product is not far from what was actually a gig. Of course, you can achieve very sophisticated and polished sound in this way, but you won't get the real thing. This is not the case of Rush in Rio, it is a real deal! I admit that I like the fantastically sounding concert DVD, I love music and sound is a very important aspect, but it's refreshing to listen to a concert that's so honest. You listen to Rush as it sounds in a live performance, no tricks, no improvements. This is a real live DVD. Rush I highly recommend in Rio, set-list is fantastic and Geddy, Alex and Neil are stunning. Not to mention the crowd, you can see how much they love Rush and sing in every melody, even YYZ, which is instrumental !! Actually, I seem to sing twice; in Tom Sawyer I sing "always hopeful, but dissatisfied" and in Earthshine I sing "just thinking". It's just a few seconds, but I just couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the DVD rush! Amazing!! I hope you enjoy this wonderful concert from the biggest band on Earth.
