I gave this second version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" to My Top 10 Hitchcock Movies. Along with "Frenzy", it's probably the most guilty movie among Hitchcock fans. I consider it much better than, say, "Rebecca", which has received disproportionately many awards. <br /> <br /> The movie contains many ingenious scenes (most of which have been mentioned in other reviews), but this is something that is important to us. to expect from Hitchcock. It takes almost half an hour for things to really happen, but the time is used to prepare the following events that are full of interesting tension. If you can ignore the clumsy back projections, the only weakness of this movie is the main villain played by Bernard Miles, who is more flat and undeveloped. Fortunately, he is a scary killer in the form of Reggie Nalder. And Hank, the little boy, isn't as uncomfortable as most kids in old movies.
