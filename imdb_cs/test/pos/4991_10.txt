I'm very impressed with acting in Comanche Moon. Before I started watching, I didn't expect him to be as good as Lonesome Dove. I couldn't believe how well the actors were chosen to represent all the characters. That bothered me how well they played every role! That was, in my opinion, almost as good as Lonesome Dove. It's hard to compare any movie with Lonesome Dove. If you don't make this comparison, I'd give it a thumb up. It was very fun! I don't have many comments on this site, but I felt I had to get my opinion there. Amazing! I do not want to name every actor who has been brilliant, because I will probably have to inform each individual. My favorite was Steve Zahn. He hit the nail on Captain Gus's head. His mannerisms were perfect.
