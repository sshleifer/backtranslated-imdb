In a sport that appreciates the unpredictability and treasures it is characters, one of the greatest of the 30s was the pitcher of Dizzy Dean. He was so colorful that he was elected to the baseball hall of fame, unlike his statistics. After all the Dean's story, it's about to end his career soon. In Pride of St. Louis Dan Dailey successfully captures the character of Dizzy Dean, at least Dean remember. I am not old enough to remember his pitching, but I remember that in the 1960s he broadcast a baseball game of the week. It is also part of the story of a dean who is a pioneer of radio and later television. Now that the announcers are in the Hall of Fame, there is no question that Dizzy belongs to. Jerome Herman Dean was one of the children 's tribes who had very little education but an amazing talent for throwing baseball. at the speed of blindness. In fact, he had a younger brother, Paul Dean, who was a pretty good pitcher himself. Richard Crenna plays Paul in this film and is one of his earliest roles. Paul Dean in real life was a quiet retirement whose career was also shortened by injuries. Thanks to that, Crenna doesn't have much to do. During the heyday of Dean, athletes tried to pin Daffy's nickname on Paul, but they never did. Joanne Dru, who has taken a break from acting, western girls in gingham dresses and corsets is the first measure as a wise, patient and understanding Patricia Nash who has met and married Dizzy while he played for Houston . Texas League. In 1937 All Star Game Dizzy started for the National League. Faced with Cleveland Earl Averill, Dean was hit on the leg by the aisle that hit him. Dean refused to listen to medical assistance and returned to the course too early. He broke his toe and overloaded his arm. There has never been the same pitcher and his refusal to accept it is part of the story. He had a career to say ten to fifteen years, who knows what pitching statistics he might have done. Dean was the next last pitcher to win 30 games in 1934 and after Denny McLain (who was something of a character himself) made it 1968 that wasn't done because. Dean went to broadcast and while he was not the first former player to go to the broadcast stand, his descriptions of the color play made him an instant hit. He started broadcasting for the next St. Louis team, Browns, and Browns were quite a miserable team with not much cheering. Dean became a star attraction there. Of course, the Dean story is a problem he got out of due to lack of education and the color of expression in the air. This is part of the story I don't get in, but in the film it's with tact and humility, and your eyes can get wet if you tend to be sentimental. Gentle baseball film, a true tribute to American success.
