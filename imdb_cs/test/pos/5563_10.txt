One of the biggest crimes against Sci-fi television was the abolition of Farscape. One of the most well-written, well-played and over-all best shows ever loving airwaves, it set new standards for science fiction television. Once the flagship, the highest rated, critically acclaimed show of Sci-Fi Channel, it defies the explanation of how to why shows as Buffy, Tremors: The Series, and even StarGate: SG-1 resisted as long as they have. Yes, even Buffy. But I'll save Buffy one more time. Farscape was poorly processed by the Sci-Fi channel, continually thrown in the planning, repetition rarely proved and never really advertised. But while the show was canceled, everyone involved in the show's production wants the show to return (Henson CEO Brian Henson). There is also an extensive fan-based movement to show back. Overall, things are looking away from the dark and hopefully the fans will get their season 5.
