This movie is great. Stylish, fun, good acting. I saw it described differently as 'Lock, Stock and Two Muskets' Smoking and 'Reservoir Fops', both of which are excellent descriptions. The storyline is simple, but it does not hurt pleasure. Carlyle is a great ruffian and Miller is an excellent drunk master. The sets and costumes are stunning and the music and cameraman are totally unusual for the costume drama. Sense and sensitivity is definitely not !!!!! My recommendation? Look, sit with a huge popcorn tub and have a damn good time.
