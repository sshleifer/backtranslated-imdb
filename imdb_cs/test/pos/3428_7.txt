An interesting comedy that takes place on a train from Stockholm to Berlin in December 1945. We can't help if we apologize for a poor writer / critic who leaves his job and jumps on a train to Berlin. His ambition is to make a difference and participate in building a new united Europe after the war. <br /> <br /> I like the black and white movie format and the closed motion picture of the train moving. Robert Gustafsson creates the classic role of "Gustafsson-role" in this film. If you're a fan of his, this movie is for you! The philosopher Wittgenstein, despite his saying "One can never assume it is something that seems to be", refers several times in the film.
