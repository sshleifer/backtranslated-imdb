At first I didn't think I'd like this movie, but as it progressed, it was better and better. I love music and I was impressed by how well Cage manages to play false moves. My son was with me and he liked the movie too for his music and story and the way the story unfolded - slowly as Corelli won the girl's heart. Acting and story were well done and well managed. Initially Corelli's bravery teased her, but soon she grew up on you. The twists and turns in the plot were particularly impressive with relations with the Germans. I'd like to see it again to watch all the other lands. I also want to buy an audio track to hear the music again.
