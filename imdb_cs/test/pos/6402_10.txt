You agree that this was one of the best episodes of this show. I remember the show well when I was in Florida Keys when she had her show debut. I watched through old video recorders that were "guards" and came across two that had about eight episodes. Finally, I spent part of the Christmas evening (and others) watching these shows. The singer was Bankie Banx - saw his name come up on loans. It's from Anguilla and its own beach bar called The Dune Preserve. He is a longtime friend of Jimmy Buffett and Bankie's classic "Still In Paradise" is featured on the latest Buffett CD / DVD combo, "Live In Anguilla" - Track # 12 on CD 1 and # 8 on CD. I would also like to see once that this short series is based on DVD. Keep faith!
