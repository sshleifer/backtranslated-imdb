Probably the best show ever (no argument here yet) about Earthman Flash Gordon, Professor Zarkov, and beautiful Dale Arden, who are traveling by rocket ship to another universe to save the planet. Along the way, in the magical, magnificent and action-packed chapters of Flash and his friends, along with the new friends found, such as Prince Barin, Prince Thun, and the amazing King Vultan, they pooled their resources together to fight the evils and armies of Ruthless Ming. Mongo and jealous betrayal of his daughter Priness Aura (now it's a car!). This series is not just a cut over most of the series in terms of conspiracy, acting and budget - it is miles away in these areas. Produced by Universal Studios, it has many former sets for its single use, such as the laboratory set of The Bride of Frankenstein and Opera House of The Phantom of Opera just to name a few. Production values ​​across the area have progressed to my most advanced view of 1936. Costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are truly creative and top-notch. We get hawks, shark, lion, high priests, creatures like dragons, octasacks, orangapoids and tigers (oh my!) And many other fantastic things. Are all credible and first-class special effects? In any case. But for 1936 most are impressive. The musical score is amazing and the beginnings of the chapters are well written, long enough to revive the audience's memories of the previous chapter and score professionally. Director Frederick Stephani is doing a great job and working out everything together and creating a good film for Alex Raymond's comics. Finally, it is pretty good in this series. All too often the series has no titles without talent around one or two former talents - most of them have some ability. Don't get me wrong, this is not a Shakespearean file in any way, but Buster Crabbe does the job as a nice work like Flash. He is enthusiastically supported by Jean Arden, Priscella Lawson, and the rest of the cast generally with two artists performing. But before I get to the two, let me add as another reviewer noted that it must have been awesome to get this series Hayes office. On Flash and on Jean Rogers and Priscelle Lawson, I see more body than in films decades later. Crabbe Shorts (and unfortunately for us all of Zarkov's professors ((Frank Shannon)) are worn as if they fit a pair of shorts they can wear, girls are wearing middle curtains and they are absolutely beautiful Jean Rogers can have limited performances Lawson is also very sultry and sensual and beautiful, but for me two actors who make the show are Charles Middleton as Ming: Malevolent, Sardonic, Ruthless and Amusing Middleton's Class Act. "Tiny" Lipson Plays King Vultan: Stormy, Hilarious, cheerful - a symbol for pure joy in life and every essence of hedonism Lipson steals every scene he is in. Gordon is the penultimate series, a space opera and a foundation for a lot of science fiction.
