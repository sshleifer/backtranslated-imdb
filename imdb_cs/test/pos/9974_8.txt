"The Merchant of Venice" is one of Shakespeare's most famous plays and is still regularly performed in the theater. Incredibly, however, this film would appear to be the first ever English language version made for cinema rather than television. There were several versions in the UK and America in the early days of the cinema, but they were all quiet. The reason for this neglect may be the sensitivity of the alleged game. anti-Semitism, an object that was even more sensitive from the rise of the Nazis in 1933. (This may explain why all previous versions were made during the silent era; in 1908 or 1922 it would be easier to portray Shylock as a straightforward villain than it would be today). In my opinion, however, the film is not anti-Semitic at all. It should be remembered that during Shakespeare's life in England there was no settled Jewish community; Jews were exiled by Edward I in the late 13th century, and were not allowed to return until the time of Cromwell, some forty years after Shakespeare's death. As far as we know, Shakespeare never traveled abroad, so it seems possible that he never knew any Jew in person or experienced the effects of anti-Semitism. The game is not just about the Jewish question, but also about analyzing the corrosive effects of religious prejudice. In fact, it can be a coded exploration of the mutual antipathy between Catholics and Protestants in Tudor England (something Shakespeare would surely have firsthand) and a call for greater tolerance between them. Traditional anti-Semitic stereotypes, like today, displayed Jews as shameful, but Shylock's main sin is not greed; if that were the case, he would surely accept Bassanio's offer to pay him six thousand ducats, which is twice the amount borrowed by Antonio. The shame of Shylock is rather anger and the root of his anger is the way Christians in Venice work with him and his Jews. Not only are Jews generally considered second-class citizens, but Jewish missionaries like Shylock are certain targets for abuse, although the services they provide are essential to the Venetian economy. The game shows the spoiled effects of prejudice. Not only do views of this kind corrupt Christians who hold them, but they can also spoil the Jews who are suffering from abuse. Shylock's vengeance is totally proportional to the mischief he has suffered. Spitting on him and calling him a dog behaves like a divine bigot, but divinity and fanaticism are not generally considered crimes that deserve the death penalty. In addition, Shylock seeks revenge on Antonio not only for the unmistakable mistakes Antonio made to him, but also for all the real and imaginary mistakes he had suffered in the hands of the Christian community, such as his daughter's marriage. to Lorenzo. It is thanks to director Michael Radford and his star Al Pacino that they understand all these questions. At first, Pacin's Shylock wears a kind of angry dignity, which gradually recedes to a vengeful rage, and finally, after his humiliation in the trial scene by Portia's thinking, to pathos. We can clearly see that he is the instrument of his own destruction, but we can still sympathize with him. In my opinion, none of the Pacin performances I have ever seen have ever matched the ones he put in the first two films "Godfather" (not "The Fragrance of a Woman" for which he won an Oscar, and certainly not "Godfather III"), but 'The Merchant of Venice is one that approaches these criteria. Other performances that excelled were Portia's luminous Lynn Collins, speaking her line with great clarity and simplicity, bringing intelligence and ingenuity to make her character more than a romantic heroine. I was less impressed by Antonio who looked too passive. Antonio is a complex character; part of loyal friend, part of melancholy contemplative, part of religious bigot and part of enterprising capitalist. Although Irons captured the first two of these aspects, it was hard to imagine his Antonio either spitting on someone else's beliefs or risking all his risky business activities. Radford's interpretation of the game was attacked by the film critic, the Daily Telegraph, who, while admiring Pacin's performance, did not like the setting of the season and claimed that Shakespeare must be placed in the current environment if it was to be 'meaningful' for a modern audience, citing the recent stage of production that prepared the event in Weimar Germany. I would strongly disagree with this approach. Theater and cinema are completely different media, and although some remarkable modernist approaches to film have appeared in the cinema (Trevor Nunn's "Twelfth Night" comes to mind), the traditionalist approach is often the best. (For example, I preferred Zeffirelli's 'Romeo and Juliet' to Baz Luhrmann). The idea that we can appreciate Shakespeare in a modern mask is mere intellectual laziness; We are not prepared to strive to see our greatest writer in the context of the Elizabethan society that produced him, but rather to dress him as a man ersatz of the twentieth century. Radford's traditional approach is not merely allowing us to appreciate that fanaticism and vengeance are age, universal problems, but also make a visually striking film. In the game, the scenes in Venice are characterized by turbulent action; those located in Portia's country house in Belmont are happier and quieter. In the movie, the Venetian exterior scenes were shot in place against the backdrop of a hazy, winter gray sky, a similar appearance reached in 'Don't Look Now'. Candle interiors with brightly lit faces on a dark background resembled the chiaroscuro effects of Caravaggio's painting; I think it was quite intentional because Caravaggio was a contemporary of Shakespeare. Unlike the dark or foggy Venice, the Belmont scenes (filmed in the enchanting Palladian Villa on an island in the lake) have sunshine or a calm moonlight. This is one of Shakespeare's finest adjustments in recent years; an intelligent and visually attractive view of a complex game. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Several bugs. We see a black swan on the water in front of Portia's house. These birds are native to Australia and were not introduced to Europe until 1596 when the film was screened. Also, the portrait of Portie in a lead coffin is painted in the Florentine Botticelli style, which was active about a century ago. Lynn Collins may be reminiscent of Botticelli's beauty, but it seems unlikely that a Venetian lady from the late 16th century would have herself painted in the style of Florence from the late 15th century.
