It is important and only fair to remember that at the time this short was produced, a state of war existed between the United States and the Empire of Japan. Add to this the tremendous sick will created by the beginning of the war, as well as the Bataan Death March and other incidents, and the only thing that is surprising about this short thing and more is that there was not much more. One more thing: my only problem with this short is that it seems to be trying to be funny, but it's not like that. I'm not sure if someone who is associated with him has really tried to joke or has taken care of it. It would be much better if they did what Disney did with Education for Death and was absolutely serious. But this short rap is bad and should not be considered in context. Times were different and that is an important aspect. Anyone who spends energy and tries to save the world from a 60-year-old cartoon must take a step back. Like me, spending the same energy on the same cartoon. This should be available to stakeholders, even if they are not in full circulation. It's not a nice cartoon, but sometimes life isn't nice.
