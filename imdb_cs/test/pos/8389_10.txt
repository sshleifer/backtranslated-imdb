Annoying Basterds does not excuse any apologies, asks no forgiveness, it's not holding a wasted attack on the senses. Tarantino doesn't care if he's offended when he goes on stereotypes and clich√©s, it's the film that makes it purest. It's great to see a filmmaker whose work is not clearly associated with the forces they are. Tarantino is a champion who effortlessly develops immense tension and suddenly mixes him loudly with laughter; You are not sure if you should look away in a wicked way or laugh, whether it is a roller coaster and one must not miss it! It's not for everyone and I'm not sure how the Germans will take the film, certainly, if you're not a fan of Tarantino's style, it may be a little hard to swallow, but never, it's a movie that just has to be seen. No respecting movie fan should miss this. And the performance of Christoph Waltz ... Oscar you dare not ignore him !!
