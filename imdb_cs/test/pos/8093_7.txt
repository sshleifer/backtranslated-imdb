Most of this film is alternately hilarious and brutal satire of Nazism and Fascism, made on top of those successes of these movements. Unfortunately, in the last moments of the movie, Chaplin leaves all pretense of making art (not to mention comedy) and switches completely to propaganda. And not anti-Nazi propaganda, but also some of the most beautiful and idiotic "progressive" propaganda that have ever faded from Hollywood. It doesn't matter that nothing we've seen so far means that a barber is even able to give a speech that we see (ironically delivered, with disturbing wild-eyed fanaticism); such trivialities must not interfere with the Message.
