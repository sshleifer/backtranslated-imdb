I've never seen such a powerful film of a real story. With this masterpiece, I discovered the city, the country, the lost revolution, and even the Nobel Prize winners. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, you can't say you've seen a great lesson of courage, humility, and life. I've never seen anything so good since then. TE Saturday, January 9, 1999
