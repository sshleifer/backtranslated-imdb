The Book of Railway Children is a children's book published in 1906 by Edith Nesbit, an early British socialist who had very strong views on the importance of family values ​​for raising children, and the story that was said was probably intended to be contemporary. . Somewhat surprisingly, it seems to have retained a significant attraction for today's children a hundred years later. The film adaptation of Edward's classic children's story with the main roles of children doesn't sound much exciting to most movie visitors today. But the really great performance of Jenny Agutter, who (at the beginning of his long and acclaimed acting career) played the role of the oldest girl, Robert (Bobby), combined with the remarkable work of screenwriter and director Lionel Jeffries, and a brilliant photo by Arthur Ibbetson made him a film that he has not yet we must not miss, and one that most viewers consider to be unforgettable. It is noteworthy that this book, founded in 1905, was filmed five times between 1951 and 2000 (four of them BBC for British TV) and all of these versions are not only greatly admired but also highly acclaimed (something that user comments on this the database), although it may seem almost impossible for a nostalgic period of the story to reach out to children in particular. Since I have not seen the four television versions of the BBC, these comments relate exclusively to the 1970 version of the film, which was made for cinema screenings. Unlike most children's book movies, "Railway Children" can reach more adults than children. The structure of family life has changed so much in the last century that many children may feel completely lost in the way they are captured in the film, while many older adults may have considerable nostalgic appeal. Perhaps they compensate, the children who appear in the film are full of life and vitality, while adult figures, although well rounded, are usually "stuffed shirts". The story is mature, dealing with love, support and encouragement, not only timeless, but it can appeal to all ages. This can be quite described as sentimental and more than a little idealized, but it is by no means a wisdom, and it seldom justifies the adjective "uplifting" as a glove. Spoiler Ahead. The film begins with an Edwardian high-class family celebrating Christmas in a comfortable, rather spacious London house when two unexpected visitors call and take their father (who is the chief government officer) away with them. The mother has to move to a very small hut next to the railroad in a remote part of Yorkshire, and the children are gradually building a new life mainly connected with the railroad and several trains passing by. This life turns out to be a little thing, and the older daughter Bobby is growing fast. At one point he turns the accident into the train when his sharp eyes in place that the landslide has created a natural danger. Father's story is never over-emphasized, but it is never forgotten, and it turns out to be imprisoned and suspected of treason. Eventually, these suspicions become clear (we are not informed about how and why) and reappears unexpectedly at the local station to return to their family. <br /> <br /> For many years, this movie has not been available in any home video format. North America, but Anchor Bay made a DVD out of it three years ago, so they clearly recognized that this relatively simple movie had not lost its appeal. For anyone who does not already have it, I would highly recommend that you go buy a copy of this DVD while it is still available - it would be very unlikely to be disappointed if you have become absolutely cynical or minimal in film requirements include buckets of blood and / or intense sex scenes.
