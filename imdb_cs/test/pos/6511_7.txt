If you like silly comedy like Airplane you will love this movie! It's definitely in the style of Plane and Scary Movie. Funny movie! It has the strangest cast of characters in the same movie. Michael Jackson, Joyce Giraurd, Stuart Pankin, Charlie Schlater and Eric Roberts. Special effects are hokey, but I think they should be because it's a silly comedy. There is apparently two versions of the film, one at the blockbuster and one at the official site: MissCastaway.com. The one on the webpage appears to be a preview of the version signed by the director. Behind the scenes is a fun scene that was shot at Neverland with Michael Jackson. The film was shot in 2003 and says it's fun with PG rating on the box.
