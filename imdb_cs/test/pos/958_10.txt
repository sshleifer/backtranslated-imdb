Big Fat Liar is the best movie ever! It's funny and cool. Jason Shepherd (Frankie Muniz) proves he was not lying and going to Los Angeles to get his paper from Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). Along with friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) confused his life because Marty won't call Jasons' dad and say he wrote the paper! Yet it all turns out well and it's a good movie to watch!
