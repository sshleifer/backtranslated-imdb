This is what the films should aim for. Funny, without being totally stupid, a little sexy without every woman in the cast showing her breasts, biting without resorting to every f-bomb line. I saw Justin Long jump up in many movies in the last few years, I came up with the right role he could break out. (Mac ads aren't durable.) This movie could get him on a quick trip to list A. The rest of the cast also did his job perfectly, that's an excellent little movie with a nice message. (But you don't have to buy a message to have a good time.) Lewis Black is as always cheerful and Blake Lively is a fresh beauty. Take a few hours to watch this movie.
