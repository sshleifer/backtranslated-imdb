Well, I'm afraid my assessment of this special will not pay attention to any other observation than the others before me, but I literally watched it - during PBS membership - and frankly, I'm too excited not to say anything. To really appreciate the mystery that is Barbra Streisand, you have to look back before the movies. Before the Broadway phenomenon mid-60. When the television was still young, there was a form of entertainment very prominent in the air, which today is only a memory: musical diversity. Some music shows have been a weekly series, but others have been single, one-off specials, usually showing the particular talent of an individual artist. This is where we get a raw, unlimited first look at Streisand.

Yet there are cuts, dissolves, and shots of shots, resulting in one spectacular peak - modern, slightly beatnik-flavored, "I have to move." After being lost among modern abstracts, jazz bong clubs begin, Streisand appears in psychedelic dresses and shimmering eye make-ups, making catchy staccato melodies with almost androgynous sex appeal. It's not until Act 3, believe it or not that the moment is adapted or enhanced by other performance: in concert order, in white dress and pearl earrings, Streisand recites the grieving "Any place I hang on my hat is home," tearing into the final notes and revealing one of those climactic belts that makes you scream like a little girl, even if you are 44 years old ... and a guy.
