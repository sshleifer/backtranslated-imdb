After the death of all senior officers, Commander Craig-Scott, from the laundry and moral corps, finds himself promoted to command the intergalactic spacecraft owned by Starcups Corporation. His main mission is to find populated planets and, of course, long-term coffee markets. Craig-Scott and his second commander, Chief Blather, find themselves poorly prepared to command, except insofar because they are fully capable of keeping crews clean - which is not to reduce the importance of clean underwear, especially when incompetent commanders cause the same underwear to be regularly, well soiled. The episodes are presented as a series of short, 2-3-minute Earth Commander reports. Humor is a combination of wry deadpan and outrageous physical comedy. You think the minister will meet the Red Dwarf, but the shoe budget. All the usual science fiction plotters are here - aliens, nuclear weapons, computer failures - but each is enhanced with fresh lemon scent of high-quality detergent. The commander's protocol is certainly low-budget, but somewhat cheesy effects and props fit into the absurd premise of the show. Remember the merry hockey helmets they had on old Battlestar Galactica? Do you still see the brand name "Jofa"? Okay, there's a lot in Commander's Log, but it's cute. Commander's Log is not high-art, but that's not what it is trying to be. It's just a little fun. It's a good job.
