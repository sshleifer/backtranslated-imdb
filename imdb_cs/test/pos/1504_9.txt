This is an interesting movie. I think it's very funny, though humor is very black. Fulci is a good and funny game alone, it's a really funny and really crazy "self portrait" artist ("I'm making horror movies. If I made love movies, no one would buy tickets ..."). And indeed it is also SEXY: Almost all the time there is an action or tension; and many sexy girls ... Maybe it goes to the heart of why someone starts making movies / art first ... It's a real psychedelic trip, maybe best seen a bit drunk or some similar state of mind. Of course it's a really ugly scene because it's Lucio Fulci. Some of these scenes are actually disgusting. Anyway, it's one of the three best and most complete Fulci movies I've ever seen (others are House By The Cemetery & Zombi. In fact, the script is, in my opinion, too genius. -compulsive disorder (fashion words): The character has a compulsive need to admit "crimes" or bad thoughts, especially crimes he doesn't have. And he constantly asks: What if I did it? "Overloading and exaggerating his thoughts. I'm sure Fulci was interested in psychology, and maybe even reading something about this area; in his" cemetery house "-movie, for example, there's a character named Freudstein. I also like the simplicity of photos / pictures in this movie, the only thing that disturbs me a bit is sadism especially for women; I don't understand why? It's fun? Is it art? It's horrible? Anyway, and overall, it's a really interesting and well done movie, definitely a recommended classic movie for fans or those interested in this genre. It may be too much for others.
