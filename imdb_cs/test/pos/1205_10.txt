Now more than ever we need Peace & Love in this world! This movie really shows off the wonderful music of the Broadway show and the wonderful choreography of the legendary Twila Tharp! I saw it again after many years, and it still keeps good. <br /> <br /> Thank you, MGM / UA for DVD release! I like the opportunity to see in a wide screen. MGM Rocks for doing it on many of their DVD releases. Ya Must Love Treat Williams as Berger and John Savage as Claude. They couldn't choose better actors and actresses for this movie! Beverly D'Angelo is so hot mom in this movie - I forgot how hot! WOW! The support cast is absolutely great, with the late big Nell Carter doing a few songs in several scenes, as well as the charming Charlotte Ray (Mrs. Garrett's 'Life Facts') ) The story gets a little weak by the end, but the anti-war sentiment from the late 1960s is still holding and is relevant today. It's beautifully filmed (a little bit in place) and is so colorful and beautiful and really brings the spirit of 1968 back to the big screen. This movie I saw when I was released in 1979 when I was 15, and was moved by then, and it still moves me now at 40. Some other reviews here say they think thought it was supposed to have been made before - I don't think Hollywood was ready to make such a movie back in the late 1960s-early 70s. The Vietnam War ended in 1975, and the whole thing hit A little too close to home, I think this story will be filmed before it was (like in 1969, 70, 71) Bravo director Milos Foreman! I love this movie !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It's nice to see it again, this time on DVD. It never looked better!
