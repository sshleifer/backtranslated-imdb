I'm afraid I have to disagree with Mr. Radcliff, because although he is right when he says it's not a comedy, he has many other merits. The story is a bit angry at the part, but I believe it all fits nicely, creating a satisfying, enjoyable movie. The last scene was somewhat bleak compared to the rest of the movie, but the real ending of a few scenes earlier is very interesting, showing what someone will do under stress. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to thriller and action movie fans, but if you're a fan of gangster movies then as long as you don't expect something as deep as Goodfellas then you should still find it enjoyable.
