Let's face it, you know what to expect when you tune in a 1990 movie by Corey Feldman, there are probably breasts, guns and cars. It is said that this film is more than just naked ladies (I'm sorry to say that) because it is mainly people who kill themselves in various unusual and, as the name implies, often "mystical" ways. I love lousy horror and I love this movie. If you don't, you'll probably be used to it. But I think it's worth it that most people do it, it's not that bad that it will ruin your weekend or whatever. All in all, if his mindless good fun, a little loving corpse and the superstar of the 80s of your childhood in the mood, you are in the right place. jeho cracker !!!!
