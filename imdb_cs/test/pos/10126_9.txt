This is a movie you will love or hate. I loved it. If you're looking for tension, great special effects, action, sophistication, cynicism, etc., you won't find it in this movie. It's a good movie, sentimental, positive, uplifting. The film's heroes are coach Jones (played by Ed Harris), Man of Power and Integrity, and Radio (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) a mentally retarded man who finds a way to contribute to his world. I think I didn't find this movie as "sentimental hogwash", as many people did, because it seemed very real to me. I know people like these. I've seen athletes who think it's fun to pick vulnerable. I saw a man of impeccable standing up for the vulnerable. I've seen people who think high school football is a serious thing. I've seen people who know what's important in life. Some of these people might have been people I knew. I laughed; I cried. I left the film feeling good, I remember that in my world there are people like Coach Jones and Radio. If you don't have people like you, you may not like the movie. If you don't like a movie that shows a better side of human nature, you'll hate it.
