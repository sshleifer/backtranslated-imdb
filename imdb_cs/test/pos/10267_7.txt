As with FOOTPRINTS (1975), I realized this by chance: he mentioned it in a review by The LIBERTINE (1969), which I examined when the film appeared on the late night of Italian television, as in a similar film. vein; by the way, I missed THE LIBERTINE (though I got it later on the same channel), but during my stay in Hollywood at the end of 2005, I managed to watch a movie by renting an English-labeled DVD DVD. / early in 2006. Actually, due to the enthusiastic revisions, I was released by LIBERTY, which was too light in nature for what was essentially a serious topic (sado-masochistic relationship between a young couple)! To be honest, most of the time I was afraid that the WONDERFUL WOMAN would go exactly the same way ... but then she was abundantly redeemed by the evil (if not unpredictable) final twist. The film concerns free social attitudes and dazzling fine arts prevailing in this era: a major philanthropist (Philippe Leroy) invites journalists (Dagmar Lassander) to her fashion home for the weekend; however, it turns out that he is a misogynist who does not trust all members of the opposite sex and would rather dominate (or even kill) them! Therefore, in the first half of the story, we see a heroine who suffers from pain and humiliation in Leroy's hands (including being forced to make love with the manikin in her own image!) ... Until the tables turned slightly, but surprisingly: she not only emancipates herself from her control but teaches him that man and woman can coexist harmoniously - except that Lassander also follows his own personal agenda !! The drivers are perfectly cast and the film itself is often darkly comical for those who are in the mood; moreover, it is heavily influenced by the typically sparkling "Euro-Cult" score (from Stelvio Cipriani's reliable) and imaginative - even outré - appearance (a giant structure depicting the lower part of the female form, with a steel trap) where his genital organ should appear that it emanates from Freud: by the way, this battalion was prominently featured in the distillations I had seen before from the WOMAN'S WOMAN… but hardly registered in the movie! “. Other bizarre touches include the absurd radio program "Sexual Aberrations and Stars" and the idyll at Leroy's Castle Family with a secret passage through the wardrobe and dwarf. One of the highlights is easily Lassander's erotic dance in practically nude - an episode that actually leads the "humanization" of Leroy; eventually, these two characters have a "showdown" in their pool - set to Spaghetti Western-type! In the long run, for all its styles, the film appears to be worse than a similar but much more extreme contemporary Japanese masterpiece by Yasuzo Masumura BLIND BEAST (1969). Finally, it is worth noting that the film FRIGHTENED WOMAN was distributed in the USA by Audubon Films to Radley Metzger. he would even employ his production designer (Enrico Sabbatini) for his own CAMILLE 2000 (1969)! To get the release I watched: in addition to the usual shortcomings in the English dubbing department, the presentation was further marked by a somewhat fanciful appearance and brief cases of disturbing external noise on the soundtrack! By the way, there seems to be some confusion about the time of the movie: its length on various sources is anywhere from 84 to 108 minutes - all I can say is that the copy I owned lasted 87 minutes !
