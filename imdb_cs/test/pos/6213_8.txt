Let's get it out of the way so you check out this page looking for information about something related to the word "breasts" (and you know who you are, googlers) can move along: this is by no means pornographic. Conversely, if it has some value as a masterpiece, frankly, the filmmaker did not do a good job because the goal is to keep it on the subject and on the experiences of women and their bodies and of themselves and society. health and so on. I would really be a little cautious of who came across it on DVD, or, if it ever plays again, late at night on HBO or Cinemax and used it as a means of pleasure. You could also go to the supermarket and pick up a few ripe melons and take them home and squeeze them and uh, well, you get the idea. No, this is a semi-serious movie-production designed for first-class night-time viewing, but it should not only be used for night-time types. This is an intimate setting, but not a tone. All women in all their different shapes and sizes and races, and even with one man thrown with false breasts, have something of value, from life experience to the most direct path. If I say semi-serious, it's due to a few tiny segments that the director feels he needs to throw, with archive footage of old "how-to" videos about puberty and sex and breast, and super-rare knocker-flying cartoons. But the benefit: we need a few visual seg-ways to go between these conversations. Nothing is sticking, and we see it as feminism in a liberating form: you don't need to cover up, and even if they decide not to choose their tops and shirts and bras, they're still open, as it may be about the natural part body that is the subject of sex, surprise, comfort, discomfort, curiosity, motherhood and, unfortunately, cancer. In this last part, another brave step is made when we see a woman who has survived cancer with only one breast. You know you're mature and adult when you see the woman who has somehow lived a semi-natural life with one breast (the most beautiful moment is when she says the fairy godmother said she could have one wish to have two full breasts she had to think), and you don't sneak or go "eww, rude." It's a test, people. It's not a shot under the best circumstances, but then again for the TV is adjusted at a tight pace. It is never boring for a moment, and we never feel that anyone is abstaining, especially when one can hear the harsh truth that breasts may not be really erogenous, or that a flat chest is very attractive to some men. Breast: A documentary is about deconstructing myths with real faces and breasts and minds and a heart laid bare. If it's worthy "I was alone" sitting, then, well, more power for you, I mean, even if it's not intent.
