It seemed to me that it was a bland film for me, which reveals a low budget with poor cinema and not everything that is great for work. This may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during World War II, but I recommend that everyone else be careful. Many scenes in this movie were flat and some actors were a little weak. The story of how men returned to service during a short vacation seems quite realistic, but there is no real pace or tension in the story. I also had a hard time understanding what the actors were saying, partly because of some strong English accents, and perhaps because of worse work in the area of ​​sound recording. I give it 55/100. Most people will want to "drive" clear.
