I can't stress enough what a beautiful movie is. Just the memory of this movie is fascinating now. If you want <br /> <br /> to see the vast epic of the movie, with beautiful live actors <br /> <br />, with a great dialogue to remind you of what's in early America. > could be like [what the world could be like back <br /> <br /> then] ... well ... I highly recommend this movie. Especially during the war and conflict in Iraq ... when our American painting is not on <br /> <br /> everything that was ... this movie takes you back to the time we just started <br /> <br / >. When you're an American really means <br /> <br /> pick up your bootstraps and move on. When the <br /> <br /> world was so untamed and unknown. Well, this movie has it ... and more. Enjoy.
