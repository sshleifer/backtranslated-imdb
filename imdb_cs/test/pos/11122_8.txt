Fame is one of the best movies I've seen about performing arts. Music and acting are excellent. The Scenario and Set Design are also excellent. My favorite part is when all students start dancing and making music in the dining room. I see this movie several times, and never get bored. I'll give it 8 1/2 to 10.
