Actors in this dark movie are really believable and well cast. The quality of working with the camera makes you feel like you were on the scene The scenario is intense and does not go through. The story is the one that wants to watch you the second time from a new perspective. We showed this film to a small group of patrons at Gadsden's Center for Cultural Arts. After the film, sometimes the patron was eager to discuss the film, and one person called me the next day to say they were still "bothered". While we've put an age limit of 18 on the film, I'd watch a movie with a group of young people because it's a very real depiction of a nasty situation and paves the way for a great conversation.
