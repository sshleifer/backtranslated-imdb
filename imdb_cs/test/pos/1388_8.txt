The title on the screen informs us that it is "Caribbean Sea, May 1891". The small lifeboat is drifting aimlessly at sea, containing six convicts from the shipwrecked prisoner and ship's doctor Lt. Claude De Ross (Claudio Cassinelli). It is night, a strange stream takes the ship to a strange, unnamed and unexplored island. The ship hits some stones and tears. One of the prisoners is killed by what appears to be a slimy mutant creature. The next morning, Claude wakes up to find himself on the beach. He found a white water pool and one of the prisoners beside him. Claude warns another surviving prisoner Jose (Franco Iavarone) not to drink water because he kills him. They both meet other survivors, Peter (Roberto Posse), Francois (Francesco Mazzeri) and Skip (Giuseppe Castellano). Francois roams to try to catch the animal for food, finds and kills a large water bird. But again he is killed by one of the fishermen. Claude, Jose, Peter and Skip continue exploring the island when Francois' death was put on an animal attack of some sort. Soon after Skip is killed, he is impaled at the top of the pit. There's only Claude, Jose and Peter left. They stumble across a graveyard with lots of empty graves and signs of recent black magic rituals. Claude notices a snake on a nearby rock, suddenly there is a shot and the head of the snakes explode. A woman riding a horse named Amanda Marvin (Barbara Bach) is revealed as Savior Claudes. He tells them to leave the island immediately because he is owned by Edmund Rackham (Richard Johnson) and does not like visitors. Claude, Jose and Peter decide to continue regardless of the fact that they will eventually find Rackham's big house where they are invited to stay. That night, Peter goes to Amanda and tries to rape her in the swamp, Peter quickly becomes a food for fishermen. And the priestess Voodoo named Shakira (Beryl Cunningham), who lives with Rackham, performs a black magic ritual that involves cutting a chicken's neck in a cemetery. The next day, Claude and Jose decide they should leave the island because they feel very worried about Rackham and think he is lying to them. Jose rides his horse and is lost. Claude is rescued from one of Amanda's fishermen and is told to leave again. Claude wants to confront Rackham again. Rackham reveals that he has a scientist, and Amanda's father, named Professor Ernest Marvin (Joseph Cotten), whom he needs to keep alive. Rackham says that the longer Ernest stays alive, the chances of his own survival increase dramatically. Rackham tells Claude his plan. Rackham found the lost city of Atlantis at a depth of over 2,000 feet. He uses fish men as a means of getting to the lost treasures of Atlantis, and he needs Amanda and her father to control them. They claim that fishermen are descendants of the original inhabitants of Atlantis. Rackham offers Claude a share of the treasure if he helps him keep Ernest alive. Later, Claude remembers Ernest Marvin as a scientist who was convicted of attempts to transplant animal organs into human beings. Finding Ernest's secret lab to find out that Rackham lied to him and fish men are not offspring, their genetically altered people have turned into amphibious creatures using Ernest's grotesque experiments! Finally, Rackham had enough Claude and decided to put an end to his meddling by keeping him in a large tank and slowly filling it with water, because the volcanoes of the islands begin to explode and send lava everywhere. Rackham wants to leave the island with his treasures and Amanda, will Claude escape almost certain death to save Amanda and get off the island before the volcano erupts? Director Sergio Martino I really liked this movie, which combines different genres. Sergio Donati's screenplay is fast, interesting, and fun. The plot is revealed bit by bit, which I still wondered how to watch it. I have to say at this point that I saw the original version and not the one with the added scenes embedded for Roger Corman's US release. Barbara Bach is doing for a very attractive leading lady, but I hated the way she was introduced by shooting the head of snakes, I thought it was more than a bit nasty. Richard Johnson makes a great villain and Claudia Cassinelli's sympathetic hero. Fish men themselves look a little fake when the camera takes a long time, but their cool look and I saw worse. Some of the miniature effects also look a little poor, but overall I have seen much worse. There is no real gore, violence or nudity in it, but in fact it has not bothered me at all. Giancarla Ferranda's photos and Massimo Antonello Geleng's production design combine a very nice looking movie. Similar costumes, props and sets like Rackham's House and Ernest's Laboratory with old science equipment. Fresh green jungle settings also add to the visual beauty of the show. I really liked this movie and I enjoyed it all the time. I'm not sure who would recommend it because it blends different genres, I think someone who may be cheering something a little different and generally well done. If you can find a copy to give it go, I'm glad I did.
