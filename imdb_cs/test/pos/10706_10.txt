A scintillating documentary about how a small group of idealistic young men used music, art and dance to unite and heal the Vigario Geral community, one of Rio's most violent neighborhoods ("favela" means a neighborhood in Portuguese) and offers its young people a positive alternative to the deadly gangster world of drug traffickers. In his feature film debut, Zimbalist and Mochary made a film that is breathtaking because it works at many different levels. As a social documentary, it gives the facts we need to know to have a context for understanding the meaning of a particular story that is presented here. The story itself is well developed, with a strong narrative arc, and for further action, it is a shot with enthusiastic tension.

Jeff Zimbalist, who was also chief cameraman and editor, is a student of modern cultures and media at Brown University. He polished his chops to edit feature documentaries for PBS and others, and he teaches film at the New York Film Academy and elsewhere. Matt Mochary, as well as Andrew Jarecki ("Capturing the Friedmans") a few years ago, came to film from the business world. Zimbalist and Mochary together won Best New Cinematography Award in 2005 TribBeCa Film Festival and "Favela Rising" were tied for the best documentary film of the year by the 2005 International Documentary Film Association. to site about Afro Reggae, Sa, and this movie.
