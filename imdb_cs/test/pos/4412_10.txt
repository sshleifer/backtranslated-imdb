A pile of human flesh sleeps on a red pillow. This is a piece of naked meat that is "Little Joe", a New York cheater who lives with his bisexual wife and baby child. The film follows the day in his life, after waking up from sleep his wife, who demanded to go out and make a traditional male thing - was a breadwinner. But the use that wants to give bread is to pay for the abortion of her new girlfriend. Definitely not in the traditional family unit here ... <br /> <br /> After playing with his baby, Joe hits the streets for a voyage to Johnny. Clients come strong and fast: an ordinary homosexual who wants to meet him again because they 'work well together', an old English classic scholar who pays $ 100 to see Joe as an ancient Greek athlete; woman topless dancer who blows Joe then boasts of being raped; An aging bunny who doesn't think what he and Joe are doing is weird. After a hard day's work, Joe returns home exhausted, only to be put off by his wife and girlfriend. They go back to sleep when they harp and undermine it. Meat is fascinating because what is the traditional classic mainstream structure is an inciting incident (money for abortion) and settings, confrontations and resolutions (albeit very clear), even a protagonist with a strongly motivated goal and then concentrates on the details of the daily routine of these people, who are absolutely ordinary to themselves, but unusual for most people. "mainstream" people. It all looks very authentic and natural - it is hard to see acting, the actors are so full of their roles - but the whole thing is clever - a beautifully drawn portrait or an intricately carved statue. Director Morrissey carefully collects every incident, every encounter around his human meat theme becomes a packaged commodity, but with such a sophisticated hand that you almost won't notice it. The wife of "packages" Joe's sexual organ, the old English defy the long-standing order of classical beauty, which created the art and poetry of human bodily beauty, the transvestite friends of the stripper as women, while reading a Hollywood magazine in which "real" women are packed as products ; The gym bunny buys Joe friendship and affection, thinks that artificial porn is real and can't tell you how we can't that Joe performs his friendship and intimacy for money. The film itself presents itself as no plus ultra-film realism, but we can also deal with the art of art or the prime example of the concept of art. Genius - a Word That Is Not Easy to Use - Morrissey was to find a way to take Warhol's artefacts to filmmaking that were interesting but boring as hell, making them marketable, one of the most interesting works cinemas that have ever been filmed - commercial cans labeled "Flesh" and "Trash" and "Heat" with the product label - "Andy Warhol" - which sells the product idea as well as the product itself. impressed by his ability to keep the highest standards and depth of meaning, the constant that appears to be the flashes of the camera constantly draws attention to the cinematic nature of what he witnesses, and yet you get into illusion - surely one of the most remarkable pieces of cinema magic that when the viewer is amazed.
