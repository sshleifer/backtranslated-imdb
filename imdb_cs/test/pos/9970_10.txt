I am always amazed when a director (and this case director / screenwriter) takes a piece of classic text - and revives it. Certainly, Shakespeare's text can give you goosebumpy, even if they are taken out of self-importance, but seeing production where true ingenuity makes wonderful words even more - simply by providing a context or nuance that is not on the stage, it is simply amazing. . There are many worrying things about the game. It is a racist game about racism - and it keeps on. I have never accepted Jessica's abandonment of her father without any reason. I have never accepted the Christian position of sanctified self-justice. But there is a brilliant prologue that helps us understand the times and policies in which the story is set, and mercifully a large part of Jessica's part. passages. But I noticed only one line that was cut out the moment I expected to hear it - and that was replaced by a look that said it all. This economy and prudent editing gave us an engaging film - not just a movie of the game. Finally, there is a reason why Antonio is so loyal and generous to non-interfering / unrelated Bassanio - you can almost feel that Antonio's pulse starts racing when he sees Bassanio around in a gondola or comes to visit. But it's just as subtle - nothing more. I was impressed. There were many other attractions. I felt that the arguments during the trial were heartbreaking. And competitors' attempts are cheerful. <br /> <br /> Add everything to the famous cinematography and costumes that resonated with the times and understand why I can't wait to see it again. And again.
