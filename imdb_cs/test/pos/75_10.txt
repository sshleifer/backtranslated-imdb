This often broken movie is a must for fans of Blake Edwards, Julie Andrews, Henry Mancini or Hollywood Musicals. Other writers have commented on shifts in tone, confusion of conspiracy, etc. But the film has many things that recommend it. The score is one of Henry Mancini's best players (and has written many fabulous), several songs sing to perfection Andrews, Julie's performance is nuance and she is laid out in some beautiful clothes (she is absolutely the most beautiful), shots in place are breathtaking There are some funny Clouseau-type Inspector gags to introduce. Basically, Rock Hudson called into his show, but it's passively good. The real curiosity that it was the last big movie Julie did for about 10 years, and in many ways, is the precursor to Victor / Victoria. It's beautiful to watch and listen. When will it be available on DVD ??? If that's the case, I'd like both versions for one - the longer and the shorter, the director's cut. Since it was lampooned in S.O.B., they would make a great two-pack!
