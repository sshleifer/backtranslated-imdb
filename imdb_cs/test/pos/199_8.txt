Recently watching this movie, I had to keep reminding myself that it was made in 1957 .......... and in the USSR! This is all the more remarkable. Many of the cinematographic effects in the film looked clich√© in 2002, but in 1957 they were completely original. I first saw the film in 1963, when it was first released in the US, and then I was impressed by its originality. Now that I have seen it 40 years later, I have no reason to change my mind.
