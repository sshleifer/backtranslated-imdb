This is one of my favorite horror movies of all time and I thought she never got her life. This is until I read the glowing reviews here. It seems that many feel just like me when I first saw it. It's a bloody haunted movie and I've spent most of my life watching scary movies. I've always found dolls, dummies, and such damn horror! Look at the dolls in "Beyond the Door" and of course the great "Trilogy of Terror". And what about the amazing Twilight Zone "Living Doll". Damn, dolls are scary! The Tourist Trap has a few moments that will allow you to put your hair on the back of your neck. Everything was supported by an excellent soundtrack that made Connors even more pounding. I remember seeing a trailer for this movie on late night television and the thing, "Wow, I gotta see it!" It was unforgettable. And it's one of the only trailers I remembered when I saw that I was doing it. It took me years to see it, but it was a treat. Stephen King also mentions this film in his book "Danse Macabre" and gives him shining recommendations. Pretty good company. <br /> <br /> This film will always be a must-see on my list. It's really a solid addition to the genre of that time and deserves a place alongside the best of the 70s.
