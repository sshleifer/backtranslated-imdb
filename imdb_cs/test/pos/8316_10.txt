SPOILER WARNING <br /> <br /> For Christmas, I got this documentary on a Christmas 2004 DVD. The score is unforgettable (my favorite <br /> <br /> were "Sauropod" theme song and "Winters Coming" song). The effects were dazzling, you could almost believe they were there. You will actually learn something; MAY Stegosaurs were able to pump their plates with blood. T-Rexes MIGHT went on a deadly spree before laying her eggs. I know there are a lot of people who thought it was too much on speculation, but there will always be questions we can only guess. And there's a lot of hard, undeniable FACT. We know that some dinosaurs traveled in herds, we know that Diplodocus swallowed stones to grind the stomach vegetation. Despite this "speculation" the series did very well. So well in fact, he spawned a follow-up, a prequel and a few specials. If you are a dino fan, then this IS for you. It makes Jurassic Park look small and weed.
