I really enjoyed "Random Hearts". It was shocking to see such a low rating on the IMDB, but chacun's son in and all that. I'm a big fan of Harrison Ford, but I have to admit he was badly cast in this movie and why I gave him 9th place 10. Kristin Scott Thomas was just amazing. She was believable and beautiful, despite the fact that she was half the film, as if she had been crying for days. Could "Random Hearts" be better? Sure, but it's worth seeing.
