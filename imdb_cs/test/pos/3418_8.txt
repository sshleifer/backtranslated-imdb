... and I usually don't like the surprise !! Watch this movie by accident at a motel in South Africa for the second week of a three-month motoring holiday in ZA. Besides being well shot and acting, it has helped me to understand the country's problems immensely. He was just watching "Million Dollar Baby" and had to look at Hillary Swank because the name sounded somewhat familiar and her acting was excellent. She didn't realize she was an attorney at "Red Dust." I'm not afraid now that they'll disappear like so many other Clint sidekicks before ... Now I'm asked to write ten full comments, which is somewhat ridiculous because I wrote what I wanted to write. OK, here it is: I think if you are from a Western country, especially from Europe, observation will help you to better understand what is happening there! So hopefully it will fill ten lines.
