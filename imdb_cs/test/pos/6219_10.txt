This charming film is based on the novel Arto Paasilinny. Bestseller is one of the best books I've read. Here's the story: <br /> <br /> One-day journalist and photographer Kaarlo Vatanen has decided to leave his past and start a new life wandering through the Finnish forests and countryside. With him he has a companion, a young hare hit by a car. Vatanen has to take care of the hare because it is a wounded leg, and so they start their journey together where they take care of themselves. During their adventures, hunters are almost shot by the police, meet many people, and eventually reach Lapland, where they live peacefully until a group of foreign tourists disturb their privacy. The hare gets sick and has to go back to Helsinki to visit the vet. Vatanen has found an ideal way of life, but modern society is trying to re-establish his duties and taxes. In Helsinki, Vatanen drank, got captured and imprisoned, but finally he and the hare run away.
