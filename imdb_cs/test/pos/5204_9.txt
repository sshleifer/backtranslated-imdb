I recently saw this film in the hope of seeing the exact depiction of the bloodiest battle of the 20th century. I have what I expected and much more. Just to think I came up with this movie of luck before I ever heard of it. It's a German movie made in 1993, so I suppose I can't be surprised that it's almost unknown to a modern American audience. It's a shame, because this is a really remarkable film, I dare say it's as good, if not better, than a platoon, a full metal jacket, an Apocalypse and everything quiet on the Western Front; all of them are iconic war films. 1942: World War II is underway. Nazi Germany has over the course of Mainland Europe and parts of North Africa, then Adolf Hitler orders a full range of invasion of the Soviet Union. A fateful step that will ultimately defeat Nazi Germany. In the early stages of the invasion goes well and the German armies conquer large parts of Soviet territory, but a critical battle follows at Stalingrad, a city that holds great symbolic and strategic value. The battle soon turns into a blood bath of epic proportions, a nightmare for both German and Russian soldiers fighting. On the verge of taking the city by the Germans, the Russians are suddenly unleashed, ending the cut off of the entire German 6th Army inside Stalingrad. To make matters worse, Russian winter comes to Germany and causes incredible suffering. The whole battle is seen through the eyes of several young German soldiers fighting for survival not only against the Russians and the harsh winter conditions, but also against their own sadistic officers, who care only for medals and fame and generals who have little attention. average foot soldier. This movie will be chasing me for a while. The German filmmakers are so young and naive that their humanity and common sense are deprived of them and they are really sorry because the demonic Nazi is not often portrayed in the film. All they've been fighting for is no longer important, and everything they believed was destroyed, and after fighting the horrific battle against the Russians inside Stalingrad, we see them getting worse with the onset of winter, causing many people to freeze. The battle and winter scenes were like a terrible nightmare, but it was so real. It's amazing, at first we see the banding of young men in their lifetime, and in the end the shells of their former self are stripped of everything. After these men witnessed so much bloodshed, they lost their will to live on, it was really sad. Finally, when there is a moment of hope that Hitler will betray them, who eventually abandon these men with a terrible death, just another of Hitler's crimes leaving the men who fought for him to be killed by the Russians. A good anti-war film captures the horrors of war and that's what this movie does. Battle for Tractor Factory Progress It's the closest thing that comes to hell on earth, but that's really what was the battle for Stalingrad. The Germans and Russian soldiers were depicted with humanity, it was only bad apples (specifically on the German side) that denounced the men. Bottom line is this movie is an amazing way to see how men break down physically and emotionally during the war. We all have our limits, and these men were pushed far beyond their borders in the deadliest battle of our time. What an average foot soldier stood in Stalingrad was beyond imagination. Even if they survived everything they saw and did, they would reveal it to life. Stalingrad shows us why war is hell and what exactly the hell it looks like.
