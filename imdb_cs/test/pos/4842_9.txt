Since I was relatively young, I didn't know how bad anti-Semitism was in Brooklyn, where my family originally came from. This film totally frightened me. I've seen many films about prejudice, racism, and anti-Semitism, but it seemed to hit me more than most. This was definitely one of the best independent movies I've ever seen. I had to travel 45 minutes to see it, and it was worth it. Almost everything about the movie was great. Sometimes it was a bit slow, but I really didn't mind, because the movie was very atmospheric. It happened in the 1940s and it looked like it was 40 years old. Acting was great ... William H. Macy was always amazing, as was Laura Dern, and I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Meatloaf playing the evil anti-Semitic neighbor. 9/10
