This film offers many pleasures and surprises. When Achille and Philippa sing beautifully duet from the film "Don Giovanni", which perfectly describes their situation in the film, you will appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film. The story takes place in Jutland in the 18th century and the use of period music on period instruments is just one of the gentle touches. Share the great joy of General Loewenhielm in his participation in Cailles en Sarcophage, even if you're just watching a movie - but you just want a small sample to enjoy. Babette is an artist whose medium is food. Perhaps no other art form allows artists to share their creations directly. The main theme of this movie is the potential that food sharing has to change the way people see and see the world, it's the same as the theme "Chololat," but "Babette's Holiday" won't hit you over your head with his report. The townspeople are conservative puritans, but not overly repressive. You understand them and respect them and eventually appreciate their humanity. Many questions are raised to reflect on the nature of art, the contemplation of paths and paths that have not been accepted, the relationship between the spiritual and the physical, the influence of the environment on behavior, the use of life for life, among other things . The only disappointment for me was that General Loewenhielm got on top of the meal. I expected deep cordial observations, but I have some vague mystical ramblings. This speech had such a minimal impact that I could barely remember it. But this undervalued film leaves a lasting impression. The heat he creates is in contrast to his austere background. You will leave the theater that wants to go out and dance under the stars.
