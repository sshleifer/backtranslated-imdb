When I saw and loved this movie in Australia, I was very excited to get paw kicks. I got one on DVD back in the UK just to find out that it's a very different arrangement. <br /> <br /> Home Australain editing I've seen is a snappier. The United Kingdom and I assume that the European editions spend much longer on the storyteller who played Jimmy's dead brother. And in fact it is, and a few other points that have no real benefit. It's not serious criticism, but Oz editing is just sharper and I think it's more confident. Can't say why they thought they needed an expansion for a foreign market? <br /> <br /> So careful about which one you go for. I went for both of them.
