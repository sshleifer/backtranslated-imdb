I'd say this movie is worrying. Brutality is depicted in a very sick way, it is like psychosis in 40 minutes. At the same time, it is a cruel introspection in human behavior. The scenes are wild, from the horse butcher to the brutal sex scene in the kitchen. Every emotion is exploited to the extreme, the butcher's frustration, the love of his daughter almost incestuous, the rage when he finds himself abused, every feeling is so natural and so bad. This film brings truth about human nature in a very sincere and brutal way. The message of the film is that a person's life can change in seconds as a result of one's behavior and that the most primitive emotions are strongest and can determine one's actions. I loved the unique way of filming, simplicity, and brutality, accompanied by silence that only intrinsic thoughts penetrate.
