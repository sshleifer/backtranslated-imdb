Pretty damn good for a French movie. I haven't seen any of Catherine Breillat's previous films, so she has no opinions about her prior work. French cinema usually adheres to finally bohemian films and leaves shooters and stellar vehicles in Hollywood. This is probably a good business strategy because no other nation's film industry will likely have the resources to compete on these types of projects. Films about filmmaking are often boring because they have little resonance for people who are not in business. But this took me much more than I thought. Despite the title (strangely in English) it really is not much of a comedy, despite several droll moments. I have seen only a few of Anna Parillaud's films, but she shows a generous talent and range, from the action / psychological drama "La Femme Nikita" to the funny comedy "Innocent Blood". The film also extends its range when it plays a more or less ordinary woman, but is still persuasive on the screen. Kudos also Roxane Mesquida, with whom I was unknown. For most of the film, she plays a very unimpressed actress whose talent is at the end stretched. If you don't have fun car chases and explosions, check out this.
