This was the first Mickey Mouse cartoon released and the first cartoon with sound. In the cartoon, Mickey is not wearing gloves yet. She doesn't even say. All he does is whistle and music. The song he plays is "Turkey in Straw" using several farm animals as musical instruments. For example, he plays the cow's teeth as a xylophone and pulls the nursing piglets as an accordion keyboard. I made this drawing from Disney Channel and I think it's amazing. It was based on a silent film starring Buster Keaton entitled "Steamboat Bill, Jr."
