This is one of the best movies I've seen in recent years. Belmonndo and Deneuve shone in their roles, he as the owner of a naive plantation and she as a mysterious jersey. They say it is a film that explores the darker side of love and pain, humiliation and self-deception that go with it, even when dressed as a film noir. Forget the faint remake with Jolie and Banderas, instead look for the right articulator and enjoy a moment of great movie beauty.
