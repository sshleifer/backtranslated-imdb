It has been said that Batman starts in Batman's first movie "Get it Right", but I think it's a terrible overstatement because I think the new Batman movie, though bigger that Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, pales in comparison with Tim Burton, the best of five. Darkness is beautiful as well as music and scenery, creating Gotham City shrouded in mystery, unlike Batman Begins, where Gotham City is a normal looking city. The villains are amazing in this movie. You can't literally take your eyes off a penguin and a cat woman. I applaud Tim Burton for being an original with his use of a penguin as a madman, rather than an ordinary criminal or clone of the old Batman TV show. In Batman Begins we have a scarecrow that's not as demanding on the screen as a penguin or a cat. The film doesn't just have to focus on Batman because we already know its story and it's a villain we're researching and trying to find out, and those are the ones who create this conspiracy with the penguin running to the mayor and seeking revenge for their parents' desertification by that they will kill the first born sons of Gotham, a task that failed. Danny Devito gives the best performance ever a superhero villain in any movie, even over Nicholson's joker. The final scene in which penguins drag a penguin's dead body into the water is touching and powerful. It is a tragedy that Tim Burton was not allowed to complete his trilogy because Warner Bros., interesting in the marketing appeal, wanted to "lighten" Batman's movies up. And their wishes ... unfortunately. Tim Burton planned to direct the third film, using Riddler as a villain, with no Two-Face and Robin to beat it. So this is the last big Batman movie. Batman Begins is a dark but boring, tedious, plain, full of devious villains and playboy Bruce Wayne. Decent Batman Movie But Best Batman Movie Ever? Never. Batman returns holding a crown.
