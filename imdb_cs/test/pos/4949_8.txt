Iron Eagle may not be the most reliable film fence, but the characters are well written and very well functioning. If you can't trust characters, the movie is a flop. <br /> <br /> I believe photography, especially aerial photography, is excellent. I believe it is far better than the Top Gun, to which it is infinitely compared. It's one of the best aerial photos I've seen. The soundtrack by Basil Paledouros (Forgive Spelling) is great, and juxtaposes well with rock tunes. I wish part of the soundtrack was available. Jason Gedrick behaves well as a teenager who suddenly has to grow up in the hurry and reality of life, death and responsibility. Lou Gossett is fine as Chappy, as stubborn and yet human as he remembers the death of pilots. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of movies you watch there and you don't care to watch again. Then there are those movies that put you on one aspect or another and you can watch it over and over again! Iron Eagle is such a kind of movie!
