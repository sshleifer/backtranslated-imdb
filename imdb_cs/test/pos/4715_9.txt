Based on a real story, John Boorman shows a fight by an American doctor whose husband and son were murdered and she was constantly plagued by her loss. Burma's holiday with her sister seemed to be a good idea to get away from her, but when her passport was stolen in Yangon, she and her sister could not leave the country and were forced to stay back until she could get the I.D. papers from the US Embassy. Filling the day before she could fly, she made a trip to a guided landscape. "I tried to find something in those stone statues, but nothing has changed in me. I was a stone myself." Suddenly everything hell broke up and she was caught in a political rebellion. Only when it seemed that she had escaped and safely boarded the train, she could see that her guide was beaten and shot. In a split second, she decided to jump from a moving train and try to save him without thinking of herself. Her life was always in danger. Here is a woman who has shown spontaneous, selfless love and risked her life to save another. Patricia Arquette is beautiful and not just looking at her; She has a beautiful heart. This is an unforgettable story. "We learn that suffering is what promises life."
