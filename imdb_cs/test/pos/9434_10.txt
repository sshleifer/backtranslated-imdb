The evil Professor Moriarty conspires to gain control over both SHERLOCK HOLMES and SECRET WEAPONS that could win the Nazi War. Basil Rathbone & Nigel Bruce returned to the screen as beloved detective Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Sidekick, Sherlock Holmes, and Dr. Ruthbone. Watson, in this fun little mystery. Universal Studios wasted no money on valuable production values ​​or a reasonable scenario, knowing that its two stars would be the greatest attraction viewers needed. Rathbone, like the brain ego, and Bruce, seemingly idle, seem to become the characters they create, joyfully keeping their faces straight while dealing with the most prominent nonsense. Dennis Hoey makes his first appearance as a pursued Inspector Lestrade from Scotland Yard; They contacted Bruce, these two good-natured, but the Pedantic boys actually saved the intellectually superior Holmes life. Lionel Atwill, a master of sinister who deserves greater appreciation for his talent, does a great job like Moriarty, so a sinister villain is an enemy who deserves Holmes' steel, enjoying the scenes of torture and pain. William Post Jr. and Kaaren Verne play a Swiss scientist and his girlfriend who are at the center of the secret, but don't have much to do. Sweet Mary Gordon performs as owner of Holmes, Mrs. Hudson. Rathbone likes his classic Holmes interpretation when he appears three times during the story, telling the viewer that the big sleuth was a bit of a ham actor in the heart. This film - based largely on elements in Sir Arthur 'The Dancing Men' and 'The Empty House' - followed SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE TERROR VOICE (1942) and preceded SHERLOCK HOLMES IN WASHINGTON ( 1943).
