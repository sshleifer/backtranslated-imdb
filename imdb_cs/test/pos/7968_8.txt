Once you sit down and see this movie "Cannon for Cordoba", you get the feeling it will be great. Reason? The film begins with the immense score of well-known composer Elmer Bernstein, who has given us such unforgettable themes as "The Great Escape and the Magnificent Seven". In fact, when you read headlining introductory titles, there is no one but George Peppard as Captain Rod Douglas, you know it will take action and much of it. Besides, when you see actor John Russell playing General John J. Pershing, you know you're in the heroic saga. The story is taken from the annals of the Mexican Revolution and includes the US in a border town dispute with Mexican bandits who crossed the Rio Grande at the beginning of the 20th century. Among the most rebellious leaders of the insurgents are General Cordova (Raf Vallone). With his army of Mexican revolutionaries attacking Pershing, killing his men and stealing some valuable artillery pieces. Since the United States Army cannot legally enter Mexico, Captain Douglas is being sent for what is meant as a suicide mission, without command and without the help of Pershing. His mission is to win cannons, destroy the rebel's fortress, and revive Cordova. Douglas selects the harshest, hardest, most experienced, certainly the bravest men available, and enters Mexico and attacks an almost impregnable fortress. There's a dramatic action, as well as a lot of explosive excitement. If someone asks for criticism, I would say it is the choice of heaven. Vallone and John Larch are not very menacing. Not with the men who are on Peppard's side. Pete Duel and Don Gordon (Who's Great.) However, this movie is recommended as a good view. ****
