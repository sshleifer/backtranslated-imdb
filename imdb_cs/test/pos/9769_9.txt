Apparently this Australian film based on Nevil Shute's novel exists in more than one form. Beware of heavily cut versions that sometimes appear on cable or satellite running anywhere from 95 minutes to 2 hours. Only the full version of the 5-minute miniseries tells the story properly. It is a very narrow realization of the story, suffering only from editorial errors commonly found in television films: blasting and episodic progression. But this excellent cast brings the story very well with generally good production values ​​accompanying their work. Yuki Shimoda is notable as "Gunso Mifune", one of the guards assigned to accompany women on their agonizing trek. He finally becomes a friend. You will bother him when his loss of face leads him to death. Helen Morse as "Jean Paget", a beautiful but not great beauty (a bit like Sigourney Weaver) registers just the right amount of spunk and winsomeness as an opportunity. . The Miniseries rightly emphasizes beautiful love stories, three of them: "Joe" and "Jean", "Noel" and "Jean" and "Jean" and Willstown. Gordon Jackson plays "Noel Strachan" attractively, but as a somewhat younger man than Nevil Shute featured in the novel. The third love affair I mentioned is not getting enough emphasis, and the full meaning of the title diminishes. "Jean" is dedicated to the goal of bringing businesses to Willstown, which will attract young women and girls and their civilization influence to this city abandoned. He wants it to be "City as Alice"; Alice Springs, that's it. In a few scenes we get just a few tips. If you have five hours to save, these miniseries are a real reward. Nevil Shute founded his novel about the cruelty of the Japanese army in moving a large group of women and children from place to place on the Maylay Peninsula to a true occurrence. It happened on Sumatra, according to Shute, rather than on the peninsula. Crucifixion "Joe" by a Japanese officer for stealing chickens that would feed women is probably a fiction, but the cruelty of the Japanese in dealing with prisoners is certainly a matter of record.
