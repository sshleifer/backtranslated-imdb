I lost a full four-hour version when it was originally released in theaters because it was a week. I had to be content to see a shorter two-and-a-half-hour version a year or so later, and I was amazed at what I saw. I left theatrical thinking, witnessing a masterpiece and wondering what a full version was. The full version is usually good, but it has sequences that are so unbelievably boring that the entire movie is down and almost falls under the waves. <br /> <br /> The problem is entirely in the edit, which should be marked as the last word of the surplus. There are times when things go on and on and on and nothing happens. Shots of people in the city who are going on too long with no sense of narration. We get beautiful views and visions of such beauty that bring tears to your eyes, but are used too often as a place instead of punctuation or as a place. Most of the longer version seems to be on the screen simply because it looked good. I was actually trying to sit down and watch the Heaven's Gate to resort to the Fast Forward button, but somewhere along the way I find out I can't stand it anymore. I'd like MGM to pity on us and release a shorter DVD version, just like a huge dinosaur. Perhaps as two packages, so we could see which is a better version, and whether Cimino was upset or not. And while they were on why not include once said Johnson County War Edit, which ran for 90 minutes. Probably united artists with another cut in the hope that they will return some of their money. Whether it was or still exists is in the air, but it would be interesting to see.
