You Are Alone is a beautiful, almost subtle film, intelligent direction, sharply typed, with two intricate and exciting performances and a twist of the end that no one will see, but you will want to see the film a second time. Go back and catch up with all the tracks you misunderstood. A story about a girl who runs away from her depression and embarrassment by working a few hours a week as an escort of $ 500 an hour. and a depressed neighbor who reveals her secret and hires her for an afternoon call at the New Haven Hotel, she is a breathtaking performance by Jessica Bohl, as well as a girl and Richard Brundage, as her neighbor. Bohl as Daphne gives a breakthrough performance at par with Maggie Gyllenhaal in the secretary. She thus captures the teenager's anxiety that she gets into her own skin, and when she talks about her being under control, you start to realize he's not under control at all, but she threatens to go through a deep end, which I think. she does. Brundage as Buddy is depressed, angry, broken heart, man's shell. But it's not until the surprising conclusion of the film that you understand the full understanding of his pain. After a very short introductory segment that will pamper the majority of independent movie lovers, it will have a religious right to the exits, we are brought to the hotel room. At first you are not sure about these people or the film style. Trembling, unpleasant ... like characters. Until you realize their story is backward. First, for some reason, they're confrontational, just like a camera. But how they open up, as the story settles, as does the camera. And I don't know, 20 minutes, I give or take, you'll find that you can't break your eyes off the screen. - where did the director ask the audience if someone was expecting the end and did not answer one person yes? I almost wished the movie was already on video so I could watch it again. Since I am thinking about some film interviews, especially about a very sincere dialogue about fantasy and climax, I thought things were going in a very different direction. But I realize that so much of their conversation meant something completely different than I had imagined. I have to see it again! But as dark and sexual as the conversation, at least blunt, I found myself laughing more than I might have expected in some of his sorrows that definitely fall into "the things we think but lack the nervousness to say out loud". It is very dull, especially when you realize that it has a completely different meaning. Some of them will make you uncomfortable, especially if you're watching yourself with a partner. Are you sure to talk something? maybe guess about? later. Maybe it should come up with a warning: You should be watching yourself! Music is amazing. I'd come home and buy a soundtrack on my favorite online store if I could. The film looks as good as anything on the film. After screening by Gorman Bechard, he was asked what process he used to make the digital recording look so good. His answer: none. They couldn't afford it. I have to give Bechard credit. I am a big fan of his two shorts The Pretty Girl and Objects in the Mirror, but even they couldn't prepare me for the complexity and surprise of this movie. <br /> <br /> For all involved: bravo.
