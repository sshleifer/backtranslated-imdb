Breaking film about film. It shows intense and strange relationships that can develop between directors and their actors; manipulation and mind games; preliminary egoism of performers. As in any workplace, sexuality complicates matters, but here up to n-th as filming a sex scene. Absolutely fantastic performances by Gregoire Colin as a fragile, wannabe male man, and - above all - Anne Parillaud as a director's self portrait. The image of her laughing and eating banana at the end, having finally got what she wants from her puppets, is pure pleasure.
