This film is a Spartan, unsentimental edge that gives us plenty of room to take part in the event without any stylistic burden that tells us how to feel; in 'Blue' everything was obviously sad (certainly powerful as hell, but still); in 'White' it was a wonderful whim. But there are no such emotional clues or stimuli in this. It is as if he finally let the power of the story work his own magic without spoiling the shelter. I think that is what makes it the most serious mystery of these three, but ultimately the most accurate and redeeming. Never infallible, unreal honesty was so beautiful.
