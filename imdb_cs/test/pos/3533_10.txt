Jeff Lieberman's "Just Before Dawn" is definitely one of the most underrated horrors ever made. The film, while slightly influenced by "Deliverance" and "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre," is extremely scary and memorable. The release and the atmosphere is really scary. The casting is excellent, Deborah Benson and Jamie Rose are great female lead. The film is beautifully shot-it was actually filmed on site at Silver Falls State Park in Oregon. There is very little gore, but one killing, when Verchel is stabbed in the groin, is pretty ugly and uncomfortable.
