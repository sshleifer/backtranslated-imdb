For the first time I saw this movie in the early 1980s and we had it at betamax. As we all know, betamax went the way of 8-traction straps, sighed, really had a nice picture quality. By the way, I'm glad I found this movie again, I've been looking for it for over 10 years! This film falls into the category of films as a plane: continuous jokes, onelinery, funny actions (bodylanguage). Mark Blankfield is absolutely cheerful. His transformation from the shy Dr. Daniel Jekyll's sex-crazed strananimal Mr. Hyde is unforgettable, complemented by gold, chest and gold. The best thing I liked was when he kidnapped this poor guy's car and then went to Madam Woo Woo. A completely psychedelic drug-free experience! If you need to laugh at therapy, it's a movie to do. When I first saw him, I had tears in my eyes and my stomach hurts from constant laughter. This is a movie I could watch over and over again. I warmly recommend.
