** SPOILERS AHEAD ** <br /> <br /> It is really unfortunate that a film that is so well created will prove to be such a disappointment. I thought it was full of (stupid) clichés and that it basically tried hard. <br /> <br /> (Americans) there: how many of you spend time <br /> <br /> jumping on your girlfriend's bed and doing monkey <br /> <br /> sounds? (Married) to girls: how many of you suddenly went from prudes to nymphos overnight - but not with your husband <br /> <br />? For the French: Would you really ask someone <br /> <br /> to be "à la fac" when you know they don't speak French? Wouldn't it be <br /> <br /> to use a more common word as "universals"? I lived in France for a while and I know and understand <br /> <br /> Europe (and I love it) but my (German) roommate and found it <br /> < br /> quite offensive overall. It looked like a film funded by the European Parliament <br /> <br />. It had all the <br /> <br /> kinds of differences he tried to unite together (not a bad thing in <br /> <br /> himself), but the result is at best embarrassing, but actually ridiculous - /> <br /> many clashes that would not really happen. Then the end of the movie <br /> <br /> - the last 10 minutes - destroyed the rest. Why does Xavier <br /> <br /> not speak to Erasmus students in Paris? Why is <br /> <br /> just leaving? Why is he running away from his work, is it "freedom"? And finally, is the new Europe based on <br /> <br /> a lot of people who smoke and shout all day? Is that what it consists of <br /> <br />? Besides, the acting was terribly awful. I can't believe Judith <br /> <br /> The role and role of Godrèch. Why did it make Emanuelle Béart look like <br /> <br />? At first I thought Xavier was okay, but <br /> <br /> with a look back I think he was pretty bad. And that's really bad because technically (opening credits, <br /> <br /> scenes when asking what documents it needs) it was really <br /> <br /> good (except for the British siblings) and the <br /> <br /> soundtrack was also great. So the form was good, but the content <br /> <br /> was pretty bad.
