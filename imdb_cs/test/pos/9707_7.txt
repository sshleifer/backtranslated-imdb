Johnny Knoxville's gone crazy. In the first Jackass, did practical jokes pleased more than physical things? His opening car rental gag and later bit that includes an air horn on the golf course was more similar to some type of extreme Candid Camera? But in Jackass: Number Two is really out of his rocker. It starts with a sequence of being chased by a bull's living room, or later when riding a rocket (a stunt that almost cost him his life because of an unexpected blast from a rocket), especially when he is intentionally facing by the defense mechanism and taking the pellet spray into the stomach, Knoxville is a madman. In the first film Bam Marger and Steve-O ?? notorious party animals ??? they were brave, but you know it's pretty bad when you see Knoxville's enticing to make a sensation. each other. Does it eventually end in death for one of the cast members? In Jackass 2 Steve-O almost loses his leg on a shark, Knoxville (as above) is almost impaled by a rocket blast, and so on and so on. Jackass 3 has already been confirmed by success 2, and frankly, I can't imagine any stunts performing in the opening scene of this movie. this is incredible footage. It's almost incredible, and I was wondering if it was fake, but apparently it was 100% genuine. (Which is kind of scary.) And as far as extremes are concerned, Jackass 2 far outstrips his predecessor? it also feels more film than the first film, with fewer of the cheese titles before the bits that were famous for the original MTV TV show. Unfortunately, the boys got too much freedom here, and a good number of gags are just lame exercises in roughness? I can enjoy the occasional shit, but watch a man relieve himself in a miniature toilet, or see Steve-O get a beer on his ass (yes, honestly), get a grid after a while. Even frat boys in the screening I attended ??? who was excited when the Wee Man took the playing card back and got zapped into the rigged chair? they were disgusted by some scenes in this movie. It's not a question of how to get away as much as possible? it's a thing to say, "Is it fun or fun?" Many times, unfortunately, it really is not. But for every lame stunt involving feces and farting on people's faces, there are some brilliant hidden camera bits. Wacky director Spike Jonze ("Adaptation") dresses like an old woman and hits the streets naked, with falling breasts and no shame. And my personal favorite parody included Knoxville as an irresponsible old man, having lunch with his grandson, letting him drink alcohol and smoking and swearing and offending people. This is a classic comedy taken to new extremes with the R-ratings freedoms. Is it a shame they had to destroy all the great things? including the final segment involving a sophisticated terror joke? with poop jokes along the way. Yet, there is enough pure spirit and the madness in this movie deserves to be viewed, and it's really taking the concept of extremeity in the cinema to new heights.
