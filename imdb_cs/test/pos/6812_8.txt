It was much better than I expected, the film issued a proffesionalism compared to other B-moive this kind of budget. The script was good, though a bit formal, but the acting was surprisingly good from everyone, including Lorenzo, and you always expect good standards from Scheider and Busey. As well as good land and action, chases for cars and crashes are especially good. These are all rises over other B-movie thrillers and do not have to rely on constant nudity or the flow of cheesy toys to cope with budgets and scripts. certainly worth it.
