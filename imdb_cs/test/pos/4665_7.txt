As a film, ITALIAN JOB is at best; good (not big) gaming, <br /> <br /> nice visual effects and stimulation, average plot, but nothing wrong <br /> <br /> to leave. But as a commercial ad for the new MINI breed <br /> <br /> Coopers, this movie is magnificent! Ok, this is a typical Heist film with an odd twist (underwater safe-cracking was nice, if not unlikely), and the cast was fairly solid. /> <br /> (except rotting Wahlberg), but when it all came down <Br /> <br /> down to it, the real "stars" of this picture were three MINI <br /> <br /> Coopers, in all their high-flying, speed-racing, ramp-jumping, <br. /> <br /> bullet, golden vault, shiny new glory. The audience I was <br /> <br /> sits between really "ooed" and "aahed" when Theron is little <br /> <br /> the red number first hit the screen (strangely, neither she nor < br /> <br /> Wahlberg collected the same reaction). The film starts promising. Mos Def, Seth Green, Donald <br /> <br /> Sutherland, Edward Norton and Jason Statham begin as an interesting and humorous group of characters, with only one real <br /> <br /> uninspired Performance is usually a powerful Mark Wahlberg <br /> <br />. Why he claims to be his best film I can't imagine; his character is absolutely one note, playing so blandly that it was as if Mr. Rogers had returned from the dead and inhabited his body. Charlize is fine like Sutherland's daughter, though nothing magical. Seth Green's character is perfect and Napster's jokes (including Shawn Fanning's portrait of Napster's founder, Shawn Fanning) are fun; He and some Mos Def's soon <br /> <br /> lines add some much needed sparks of humor. Unfortunately, Edward Norton and Donald Sutherland don't have enough time <br /> <br /> screen time. Most of the charts come a mile away, and the dialogue <br /> <br /> is full of bad one-sided lines and donations, but I doubt that filmmakers could reinvent the wheel, so take it as > <br /> typical action / voltage flick it works out fine. Worth seeing on <br /> <br /> cheap night I recommend. <br/> 7/10. It's not worth the weight in gold, but it does a nice fill.
