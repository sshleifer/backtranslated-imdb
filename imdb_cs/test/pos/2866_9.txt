This movie was so cool! I saw it on Friday night with a couple of my friends. While the first credits were rolling, we saw that Lionsgate Films made this film. They are the ones who made the stupid Wolf Creek movie that was absolutely gay! When we saw it, we groaned. We thought it would be like Wolf Creek, but we were so bad! Not only was the film better than Wolf Creek (which is not that difficult), it is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen! They really redeemed this film. It was bloody, clever and frightening, which is a combination of an amazing horror movie. Kane is amazing, like Jacob Goodnight, and Christina Vidal, Samantha Noble and Luke Pegler did a pretty good job as part of a group of offenders cleaning an old motel. She had some rough scenes and in fact you feel a little sad for some of the people who die. All in all, a great horror movie that you can watch on Friday or Saturday night with lights off and friends. Just don't look at it in the hotel.
