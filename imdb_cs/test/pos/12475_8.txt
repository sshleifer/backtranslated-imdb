Bruno Rivera's ruthless mercenary (Paul Naschy at the top of the ugly form) betrays his pregnant partner / girlfriend Meiko (played well by Eiko Nagashima) to have exclusive dibs for luck in stolen diamonds. But Meiko can seriously hurt Bruno before she gets away. Bruno ends up in an elegant cottage with the kindly wealthy Dr. Don Simon (the great performance of Lautaro Murua). He also draws the attention of Simon's two hot daughters: Monica (seductive Silvia Aguilera) and Sweet Alicia (nicely written by beautiful Azucena Hernandez). But Bruno soon realizes that something is very annoying about an isolated place and plans to escape as soon as possible. Meanwhile, bitter Meiko tries to find Bruno to take revenge on him. Naschy, who wrote and directed, as well as the stars, invented one of his strangest, most twisted and perverse horror vehicles that had ever been strange with this low visibility. The unusual plot and mysterious atmosphere become more strange and disturbing as the story unfolds, which ultimately leads to a truly surprising surprise ending. This film also benefits from occasional moments of graphic gore (watch out for an unforgettable sequence with one poor man who is swallowed by the living pigs who feed on the body that feed on the body), Alejandro Ulloa is in cinematography and decent sprinkling nudity and soft-core sex. Good support turns Roxana Dupre as Raassa's maid, Pepe Ruiz as playboy love Don Serafin and Julia Saly as terrified Teresa. Pleasantly grim and valuable shock.
