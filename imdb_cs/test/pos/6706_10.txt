Based on Colin Wilson's "Space Vampires". This is (in my humble opinion) one of the best pieces of Sci-Fi horror that came out of the 1980s. The effects (made by ILM) still adhere to today's standards. Actors are mostly British and the British seem to give this film a greater depth of realism. The film was criticized by the critics, and unfortunately it failed to do well at the box office on both sides of the Atlantic. . Tobe Hooper accused the promotional work that was done before it was released as a major cause for its low sales. But for some reason it still does not detract from the fact that it is a superb movie with a great cast and well-paced plot. <br /> <br /> Don't be overlooked.
