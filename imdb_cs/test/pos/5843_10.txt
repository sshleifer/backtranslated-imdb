Oz was a fantastic show if frequent nudity doesn't turn you off. There was too much frontal male nudity in this show, more than any other show you would see on a porn channel. Minus, that was the best show on TV, and the previous commentator said "better than Prime Suspect". The primary suspect is Tom and Jerry vs The Simpsons. No competition. If you have DirecTv, they are now running again on Channel 101, they are now on episode # 3. Creator Tom Fontana also killed the murder, which was AWESOME's show. But why all the nudity men? We all know that this is happening in jail, but did they really have to show it so often? That was the only thing that turned me away from the show. If I want to see naked men, people who are raped will kill someone and witness first hand. Otherwise, I like my TV shows every five minutes without black cocks.
