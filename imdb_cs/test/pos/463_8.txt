I just saw this film at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham, AL, which was really a fun festival and was blown away. It was the best movie I saw all day. A school-age prostitute meets a middle-aged man and tries to end a deep depression there. It is an inner look into the darkest parts of human sexuality. The story is based on real life events, torn directly from the headlines. Raw, blunt dialogue and killer at the end. The film includes graphic sexual dialogue and nudity. Definitely not suitable for children. Too depressing for the taste of some people. Definitely worth checking in my opinion though.
