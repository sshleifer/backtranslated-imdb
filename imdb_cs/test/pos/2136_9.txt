I only saw this movie once a quarter of a century, but it never left me and I still remember my reactions to it. I was fascinated by the breadth and beauty of so many photos. I was impressed that the American studio could create such a European film with a slow pace and out of focus. The lack of any strong characters felt like a mistake, but I was furious at the utterly useless ending of a yacht that seemed to be connected to some sort of conspiracy coherence and which was totally contrary to the rest of the world. It was also refreshing to see the West, which made no pretense of brutality and exploitation that so often was an unfortunate criticism of the American dream. Western scenes and ensembles also had an authenticity that was completely new to me and which predestined the recent Deadwood series. The film was massively shortened for the American audience, and its real wish was that in these days of director's screams, Michael Cimino had been given the opportunity to redesign in the light of reflection - a cut that might change the disease. the fateful film in the masterpiece had the potential to become. Now I have seen the original first cut and the network of relationships is much more meaningful, though Christopher Walken is mainly responsible for doing it. If only De Niro and not Kris Kristofferson played the main car, she was still massively engaged in creating reality and atmosphere at the expense of a good script. However, the work of the camera was so cleverly worked out that sometimes you could almost believe that you were inside the action yourself. And there were many special moments. All those who argue in the hall in different languages ​​and try to overcome their national differences and seek unity of negotiation in connection with the impending catastrophe, have provided a genuine insight into the problems associated with welding in the US: especially when the threat is a combination of old elite and money. is a hesitant approach to Ella when he first visited his cabin stood in sharp contrast to the violence that was to follow and was next. I had a special show with a large group of friends to see a new cut, and we all enjoyed it while we had some reservations. they have released, but we all felt that he had great merits and that his place in the history of cinematography was also due to the great revision
