Lemuel Gulliver (Ted Danson) is a doctor who disappears at sea leaving behind the pregnant woman Mary (Mary Steenburgen). Eight years later he appeared, tousled and seemingly mad - a fool about his adventures in the lands of petty Lilliputians, the giant Brobdingnags, the floating island of intellectual Laputa, and Houyhnhnms, a race of intelligent, talking horses to deal with Yahoos - the race of bestial people - many other adventures. No-so-good Dr. Bates (James Fox), who has suggestions for Lemuel's wife, has Gulliver trapped in mental facility, and Lemuel, Mary, and son Thomas (Tom Sturridge) must find a way to prove his common sense. This film is a wonderful adaptation of Jonathan Swift's satirical novel, and it's an amazing adaptation on so many levels: story, satire, characters, visuals, brilliant cast. It's just something you're looking at, and it's almost amazing because it was a movie made for television. The film does a great job of capturing Swift's sinister satire that looks like an ax like a British ax. today's society. The wise Brobdingnags and Houyhnhnms are almost perfect individuals who find it virtually impossible to understand why Gulliver speaks with such pride of vice and corruption of his society. The scenes where Gulliver tries to prove that they are different from Yahoos are perhaps the best, with the way they choose their leaders ("they seem to choose among themselves the worst of them ... who rule until someone not worse ‚Äù). , going to war ("We go to war just for a very good reason - as they are weaker than we do, or we want all of our lands"), etc. Scenes involving Laputu are also effectively made - intellectuals are so packed in their specialized areas that they don't Time for nothing else and really have little common sense. And adding a number of asylum plots enriches this story - Dr. Bates is really ugly, and when he makes a speech to investigate alleged Gulliver's vices, it is clear that he describes his own mistakes. <br /> <Br /> The film uses beautiful and fairly convincing CGI effects to display very diverse settings with a great effect. The size contrast is done in a very skillful way, and all the worlds described in the story are convincing in their own way. Cinematography (especially asylum) and costumes are brilliantly finished. Cutting the present with Lemuel's memories is a device that might be embarrassing, but it works very well. The cast is really amazing; real, who is from British and American talent. Ted Danson gives an excellent, multi-layered performance like Gulliver, who effectively demonstrates his transformation from a man confused by his strange surroundings, into a crazy state in which he was when he reappears to his rational, intellectual personality at the end. Best known for her sit-com work, Danson shows he's more than just Sam Malone with this wonderful seri-comic performance. Mary Steenburgen is as effective as his wife, and James Fox is totally disgusting like Bates. The rest of the cast is made up of mostly portraits, with Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Warwick Davis, Kristin Scott Thomas, Geraldine Chaplin, Alfre Woodward, Edward Fox, and Sir John Gielgud being the most memorable - but even the smallest parts are very well played. "Gulliver's Travels", which is not a 100% faithful book, is a triumph of story and images. Don't miss it. 9/10
