There are a few things in life that we cannot experience more than once, and experience with them is one of them. Especially if we live in a foreign country and in an apartment with 6 wacks from 6 different countries. Xavier's main character leaves his tidy life in Paris, his ex-hippie mother and his beautiful girlfriend, and goes to Barcelona to study Spanish to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with a French doctor's wife and makes friends who look at things differently. When Wendy's brother (Wendy is one of the friends of the room) comes from England, the film becomes much more fun. Anyway, Xavier is beginning to see things differently with all his new friends and probably lives something he will never forget and forever change his life. A very nice nostalgic film, which becomes even more interesting thanks to its transnational cast. I thought it was very interesting that you could see all these children from different countries, all of whom speak different languages ​​and have different cultures with each other and have fun. I gave him 9 out of 10 because I left the theater with a smile on my face and thought about things I haven't done yet when I'm still at college and want to do it before it's too late.
