I really enjoyed this movie. Yes, there was disrespect in the movie, but Bruce Willis learned from The Kid that he had more value in repeating others, and his life of disrespect had to change. This film was a refreshing change from a basket that Hollywood is trying to put in his throat. There are some very good lessons to be learned in this movie. I really believe it was one of the best Disneys, although a few things could be left out. I was impressed by the lack of swearing and the lack of sexual inuendos. It's not perfect, but much better than most.
