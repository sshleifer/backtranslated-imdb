I feel lost, so great is this movie. Kieslowski is a writer, philosopher; and while an excellent filmmaker, his size lies in his writing; and "red" is its paradigm. This film is a metaphorical study of the author's judgment in the creation of his imaginary world; about how an artist can try to rebuild his life - even his own - through his art, though he cannot escape the knowledge that no matter how he engages in his story, he is still a fiction and is still out of his overworked world , still burdened by his unreality and the reality of life he tried to remodel. And magically, this is not all in the slightest at the expense of a wonderful story about the secrets of love and fate and the characters who live this story. If I had to choose, I could name the biggest movie ever made.
