I love it! I love Pauly Shore. Some people seem to disagree. It's humor and he's not like everyone else. The movie is great. I love the story and most people in the movie. It's funny when he first meets him at school. I like that he chooses him over a guy home. I like that Tiffani Theissan is not a bad girl at the end. All secrets are dropped. Finally, only the people you want to see remain. (Except for those of you who don't like Pauly Shore.) Although you don't like it, there are funny parts and her family tortures him mostly for the movie. It is a wild country girl and must be heard. Finally, he can do it. It has the right amount of love and romance. I give him 8 out of 10.
