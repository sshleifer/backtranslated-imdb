Unfortunately, due to the slow start, I can't say it's one of the best Hitch movies. It's very excellent. The film plays Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day as parents who find themselves in a political murder conspiracy and must try to get their kidnapped son back. Both have excellent performances, of course not surprising. Indeed, I was impressed by Hitchcock's amazing use of music. The opera peak was fantastic, and the use of a live orchestra to create music and tension was a pure genius. There was a fantastic tension out of this scene. Also, the use of Doris Day singing "Que Sera, Sera" was excellent. Especially when it is transposed to the scene at the end of the movie. So this movie ends with Hitchcock's best use of the music I've seen to this day. Unfortunately, it had a slow start, or I could recommend this movie a little more. Even in this case it is worth a look. 8 out of 10.
