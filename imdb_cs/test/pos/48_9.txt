I watch Lackawanna Blues every time they appear. It brings me happy times. I'm growing up in a big city in the west. It reminds me when I was a child, although my situation was a little different, she feels the same. I wonder if everything we know about families is lost. Big mothers of the day are under 55 years old. They will know what it means to be an inspiration to others. I hope I wasn't the only one who loved this movie enough to relate to their past. Music was great in this movie. I really felt like it should go to theaters for which I would pay. The second time I saw the movie, I figured out who the life of this film is. He did an excellent job in writing and producing this film. I think who is better off to produce a film based on your life other than you. Once I can get a copy for my home use. I always enjoy the black producer or the directors who feel such a film as if you actually lived at the right time. Thanks for such a great movie.
