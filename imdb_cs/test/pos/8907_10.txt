Like many other reviewers, my memories of this show are generally warm. In fact, the rumors of beloved memory are so kind that I recently bought a DVD box set to return to this happy and carefree childhood period when I was absolutely fascinated by how I watched the ongoing search of Monkey, Pigsy, Sandy, Tripitaka and later Yu Lung Horse / Dragon / Man (you really have to look at it to understand) when a very beloved show was broadcast on BBC 2 on Friday night, as I remember. Well, I'm glad I can say that even after all these years and now we're looking at it with adults, ie, Cynical (!) Eyes, the show has lost none of its inimitable magic. <br /> <br /> Just great fun, from magic characters and their comic interactions to each other, to not so special effects (which are actually used to enhance fun) and of course remember the unforgettable first season titles. not in any way, shape or form did not diminish any of the monkey's magic. As Monkey himself would probably say, 'Oi! You there! Go out and grab nostalgic fun.
