There are some minor spoilers, but none of what you learned from reading on the back of the DVD has been learned. Sister Betty, who, together with Renée Zellweger's beautiful performance, is a dark but deceptively good comedy. Suffering from emotional and mental illness after witnessing the murder of her sinister husband, already worried and desperately unhappy, the waitress Betty, is convinced that her long-lost fiancé is on her favorite daily soap and goes from Kansas to Hollywood to find him. Instead of joking at the expense of Betty's mental state, writer John C. Richards is very sympathetic when Zellweger portrayed her as a lost innocent, not completely helpless but tragically vulnerable. And while this is indeed a sacrifice, and while undoubtedly suffering from the horrible motives of the characters who treat it badly, they are all understandable - even Greg Kinnear as the object of her vicious moods can be an egoistic, flashing, arrogant pig, but truly believes it is simply an unpredictable would-be actress with talent bags rather than a mad stalker. Farcical ends where all the main protagonists descend to the same place (in this case Betty's house) at the same time it is as old as the cinema itself, but it works quite well, even though the shift in tone is unhappy. Zellweger is enthusiastically supported by Kinnear and Morgan Freeman, who do a solid job, especially pleasing to see Chris Rock show restraint in his earlier scenes. Not nearly as cruel as one would expect, and not at all lively, sister Betty - while far from laughter riots - is a solid fun promoted to something of an actress.
