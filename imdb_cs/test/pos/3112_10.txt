I finally got a DVD today, looked at it, and I'm glad to announce that it's the original theatrical version of the movie. As you may have read in previous reviews of "Rich and Famous", which he edited for the TV version of a movie that somehow did it on VHS sometime in the late 90s, but now WB corrected the error and released DVD complete with a toilet scene, Matt Lattanzi is a bare butt, and a scene in a hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) C ** t! It's all and looks better than ever! Bright, clear digital transmission, widescreen display and special features that include the original theater trailer and the 1981 edition "On Location with Rich and Famous" with cast and director interviews. If you love this movie, you won't be disappointed with buying this DVD. I'm glad it finally on DVD? It's worth waiting! Thank you Warner Bros!
