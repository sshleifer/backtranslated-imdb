I just want to say that the movie was good and moving. The film explains the true meaning of being saved or reborn and very well defined. The meeting was pretty good, but it could have been some improvements. The story of the Board is catchy and when my church was serving the youth and we watched it, 8 people gave life to Christ. I would also like to say that anyone who reads it gives his life to Christ and repent of his sin.
