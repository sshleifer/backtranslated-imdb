This program is a favorite of our family and we feel it has to be released on DVD in seasons !!! The name of the "Promised Land" is very apt because it is a positive statement about everything that is good in this great country and the people living there. It is a "God Bless America" ​​program with inspiring stories, old-fashioned values, characters on the back of the earth, true and encouraging messages, beautiful nature and well-written humor and drama. It's a show that the whole family is able to benefit and benefit from - without worrying about bad language, "adult" themes, crispness, violence, etc. We've always felt blessed when we looked at the episode and can't wait to see each one is every time it is finally released on DVD!
