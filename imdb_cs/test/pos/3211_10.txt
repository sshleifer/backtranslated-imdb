People must give this show a chance. People who write bad reviews (very few) are clearly people who have not seen many episodes. One must really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All characters are realistic because they have so many mistakes.

Someone has to give this woman the credit she deserves. The same goes for Kelly Bishop, who plays Emily Gilmore so perfectly. Also, it is nice to see a show that can have a young girl in the middle and not be filled with teenage anxiety. Rory is a clever girl who doesn't see much on TV today. If only other exhibitions could capture the integrity of this show ...
