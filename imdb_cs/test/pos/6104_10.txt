The main point of the film, IMO, is the fact that Joanna's lifetime was nothing but a series of facades. The film opens with her secretly dying her gray roots, and hides the used kit into an empty tissue box. It's strange he's hiding it from his HUSBAND. If he is to hide worldly things from his beloved person, he can bet that there are even more things from others who have been involved in her life. When Joanna accidentally hits Cory, she leaves the scene and calls the police. By the time they return, there are the police and the ambulance, as well as the people in her community who note, "What kind of a child will hit, then leave her there?" With respect in her community, she decides to keep silent about what she has done. But she never realized how hard it would be to keep the facade ... <br /> <br /> Great movie - I've seen it many times!
