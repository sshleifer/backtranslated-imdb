Director Peter Chan, Screenplay by Maria Maggenti. Based on the novel "The Love Letter" by Cathleen Schine, director Peter Chan's film version, released in 1999, wasn't a big box office, even for a romantic comedy movie. While it was not so popular in theaters, it soon became a beloved film on cable television and on VHS / DVD. It's a story about a mysterious, passionately written love letter that fits into a city harbor in a good old US (forgetting the exact location), among the main characters who think the letter is personally addressed. At the end of the film, we don't know who the lover or loved one is, but the power of the letter has changed the lives of almost everyone in a small town. The cast is made up of amazing actors who have done well on TV and film, including Kate Capshaw starring middle-aged beauty Helen, owner of a bookstore, comedy Ellen DeGeneres as her friend Janet Hall, young hottie Tom Everett Scott as Johnny , a young 20-guy who falls to older Hellen and older Tom Selleck as fireman George Matthias, who has to compete with Johnny for Helen's affection. There are portraits of the role of veteran old Hollywood actress Gloria Stuart, who is best known to the modern audience as Elder Rose in "Titanic" (1997) and a portrait of her own daughter Kate Capshaw (with husband Steven Spielberg) Jessica Capshaw. A love triangle is between a middle-aged woman, an elderly man and a young man, each of whom feels as enthusiastic as Helen as a mysterious letter writer. The conflict lies in Helena's indecision. Will she choose the right person? Which man has something to offer her? Johnny is in a relationship with a girl of his age who loves him with the passion of all of her own, and in fact it is a reminder of what Helen was at her age. George is in the process of divorcing his wife and living a secular and busy life. A cultured intellectual marries Helena on an opera day, when the tragic death of Puccini's ultra-Italian heroine Tosca moves Helena to explosive tears. There are plenty of beautiful views of the enchanting coastal town, which was beautifully portrayed by cameraman Tami Reiker. The score is a paradise of romantic and beautiful songs - "I've never been in love before", "I'm in the mood for love" and "Just The Lonely". Ellen DeGeneres, as Janet Hall, who is constantly working at Helen Bookstore, who is walking with people forever, without finding the right guy, is just amazing. She did not lose her comedy atmosphere, even though at this point in her career she was not appearing much on television or film, because only about two years before her hit Mid-90's television show "Ellen" was canceled because of her "come out" \ t as a lesbian and new lesbian show issue. Here you even found Jack Black's comedian, long before he did it, in a small part of the fisherman. It is a moving film about human emotions and decisions that are significant, about the human need for passionate consumption of love and general love for escapism brought not only through books, letters and music, but through a truly loving and secure relationship. It's a great movie with beautiful moments and infectious romantic spirit.
