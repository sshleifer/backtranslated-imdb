"The Big Snit" came to my life by accident and left an indelible mark on the soul. The scar of love, destruction and absurdity that will be part of my life forever. This is a story of beautiful vanity. We are powerless without ourselves. We are helpless against the government's injustice. We are helpless when it comes to the choices that we all try to make in love. You can't hear the confusion and the world happening outside the window. Blind to the inevitable apocalypse. Stupid to hatred and greedy views of excessive society. It is a story of personal engagement and victorious love that has defeated the ideology of war. Their little bickering is a noble observation of human nature and how love comes with pain and darkness. We travel only a short distance with the two main characters, but we do not want to complete our own paths with any of their simple, loving, honest philosophy. I am so glad that I exist in this "our time". The next 20 years on both sides of my date of birth, and I wouldn't see and feel .... .... Big Snit. William White. Sheffield.
