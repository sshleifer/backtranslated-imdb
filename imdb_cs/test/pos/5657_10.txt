This is one of the most anti-traditional war films about I have seen. Instead of typical films that emphasize fame and perhaps super-human characters (such as John Wayne), this film is the exact opposite - emphasizing the de-humanization that ALSO is doing in the war. The story relates to the Japanese who are imprisoned in the Phillipines after the US returned in late 1944-early 1945. By the time the film begins, the Japanese were clearly defeated, but because of Bushido's insane logic, they cannot afford to consider surrender. At one of the many annoying moments, the leading character is told at the beginning of the film to report to the hospital because she is unable to fight for her TB. The problem is that the hospital won't accept him, so his commander will tell him to go back to the hospital - and if he doesn't, he should be thrown out with a grenade! Well, this only happens in the first five minutes of the film - much worse things this soldier and the few rogues commit because they don't give up. What's more, the film is where a soldier tries to give up but is shot. It happened much later in the war, because so often surrendering Japanese soldiers threw themselves into the air as they approached. In addition, the film shows the liveliest portrayal of starvation and the accompanying madness of any movie I've seen. In addition, cannibalism, cowardice and treachery accompany this very bold, realistic and depressingly realistic film. You can't just make a better film of this type. Terrible, but great.
