Peter O'Toole, one of our best actors, is magnificent as a reserved school boy who is dedicated to teaching young boys. She meets a girl and falls in love. The story is about love and devotion. Petula Clark adds spirit and sensitivity, not even mentioning a remarkable voice. You will enjoy this movie even though the end may not be happy. I enjoyed it.
