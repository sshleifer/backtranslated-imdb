This is absolutely one of our favorite in 2007. <br /> <br /> The story of two boys who come from different worlds but are as close as brothers is well said. Beautifully filmed and screenplay - from childhood to adulthood never fails. A brilliant view of lost culture and a very good way to understand Farsi's cultures and traditions is also an exceptional story in itself. It is compassionate and exciting, uplifting and full of immense grief, joyful and depressing. <br /> <br /> With great casting performance and great camera skills, it's really the best movie ever. > <br /> Top Recommendations: A real piece of life that uplifts and informs.
