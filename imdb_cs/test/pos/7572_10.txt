Jack Palance, (John Witting), was mostly bad in most of his films, and in this film he showed his great acting talent beyond my expectations. John Witting unexpectedly returns to his son's farm after years of separation. Christopher Walken, (Jacob), hardly tries to come into his father's shape after spending the night in the family barn. Jacob's son and younger daughter greet their new grandfather and accept him as he, a very old man, at the end of the rope. Glenn Close, (Sarah Witting), immerses himself in John Witting's character and begins to tell the truth about what happened to him during his family absence. It is a very warm and loving film about real events that have been happening in most families for generations.
