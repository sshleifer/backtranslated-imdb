When I was employed, I and my fiance often visited the adult bookstore. He was looking for his favorite magazines and sometimes a video that might interest him. Just as I enjoyed one on one with him that the media caused, there was never a video that I really enjoyed. I only saw one more film trip when there was a satellite channel called XXX (that dealt with the private eye that revealed the case), which actually had a proper plot and was pleasant. All the others grunted and swore, blowing, and not. It's just as many times as you can look at the blond bimbo in it. This movie captured me and I moved to it, allowing him to wander around the store. He noticed (how hard it wasn't? Grins. Actually I was interested in something, lol (!) In the video section!) And I came, bought a slightly used copy for me. We took it home and I loved it. Here was "Porn" with a conspiracy. I wasn't sure he was even classified as porn, but I use the word freely. The librarian was a character I could identify with. Alice refused her friend's advances. In her comments, she was not satisfied with her own sexuality and caution. Bill left and continued to check the books. The white rabbit went through the library (one book, if you notice it, I believe it's been ten years since I saw the movie) by Lewis C.) and Alice, for the same reason that drives teenagers into the forest when a chainsaw controlling maniac is behind them rather than toward populated areas, following. It's the best way to get the story ahead. Alice finds herself in Wonderland. I hardly remember all the details, but I clearly remember swimming in the lake and how it was "dried". I liked how they got Humpty Dumpty again, the size of his freaks on his hat to carry him proudly, and his sister sister team Duma and Dee (who disturbed me a little - then they were married) wife, but I could never say how many times I watched it). The knight woman who told Alice leaves and finds her own knight (What is a pretty girl like you do a knight like this?). The part that interested me when I watched it for about a year or so later was one of the cards (3 hearts, I think) who resembled my former wife exactly! We couldn't help but tease her in the movie! The King of Hearts was interesting and the Queen was even more. Given the openness of the forum I can't go into details, just say it was an "orgy" based and we'll leave it to it! <br /> <br /> When we split up, I was allowed to take a video - I knew I liked it - but when it was lost in borrowing. One day I'll find another copy. <br /> <br /> Btw, if anyone could tell me what the scene is from Amazon, I'd definitely appreciate it. <br /> <br /> I heartily recommend this movie to over 18 people. It was soft, sweet and really 70 years old, but I enjoyed it immensely. <br /> <br /> ***** from 5th D.
