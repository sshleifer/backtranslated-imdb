Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett. <br /> <br /> Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie. This seems to me somewhat ironic because it is actually one of the first films I remember. My mom took me and my little brother to this film at the Garland Theater in Spokane when it was first released in the mid-1970s and I still remember it. I'm going to the memory, but I believe this step is about a hunter who has been charged with a crime he has not committed and the law goes after him. I believe it will be in 1800 in Alaska. The narrator tells the story of a hunter played by Mike Mazurki. Indeed, this is a very good movie with great settings. It could be compared with the 1981 film Hunting Death with Charles Bronson. Both films have a very similar story. The main difference between them is Death Hunt is an adult-oriented movie, while Challenge is a family-friendly movie. Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both old enough when this film was made, which I find somewhat impressive considering that this film was filmed in Alaska's wilderness. This was the last film made by Tay Garnett before he died which was only a few years later. They were both from silence.
