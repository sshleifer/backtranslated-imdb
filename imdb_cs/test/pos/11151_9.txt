From the bare description of the main TOLL GATE plot, one might think that it is a revisionist west of the 1960s or 1970s. Our hero is a robber, a murderer and an arsonist; interest in love is a single mother whose helpless husband has left her and her child; twice our criminal hero is "unofficially" released by the authorities in return for some good deed, and this is presented as a commendable act; the only acts that are introduced as truly evil is betrayal of one's family and betrayal of a criminal companion; The hero tries to go straight, but returns to the life of a crime after he can't get a job; * the hero is on the run from the position of sheriff and criminal gang; The final redemption of the hero is done by strangling a man with his bare hands and throwing his body over a cliff; * and "Good Bad Man" ends the film by sending a young mother and her child back to civilization and leaving alone for the Mexican desert, never (probably) paying for their life crime. Just shows you that there's nothing new under the sun. Of course, TOLL GATE does not show the cynicism or moral nihilism of his successors: The redemption of the hero is set when he surrenders after reading the Bible passage. Clint Eastwood can't imagine. TOLL GATE an excellent film of any standards, and Hart was a very fine actor who was not dedicated to the wide history he often used to express the emotions of the day. before the sound. 9/10.
