Really accurate and reckless look into modern life. This could be set in every city in the UK. I live in a housing estate in Glasgow and I can very well apply to this movie. Unfortunately, the situation and characters are too realistic, but unpredictable. The actors are hardly believable, I felt like I was spying on my neighbors. It was an intimate step into the lives of fragile and hopeless people. I was very moved by a few scenes. <br /> <br /> I loved the way this movie was shot. Overall, this film has to be seen.
