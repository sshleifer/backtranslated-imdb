The three Stoogs were always one of the many actors I loved. I only love each of the shorts they made. I love all six Stoogs (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All shorts are cheerful and also many other great actors and actresses, many of them in many shorts! In my opinion, the Three Stoogs are one of the greatest actors of all time and the funniest comedy team! One of my favorite Stooges shorts with Shemp is none other than Brideless Groom! All that appears in this short is Dee Green, beautiful Christine McIntyre, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntyre offer great performances here! There are so many funny parts. This is very good short. There is another similar Three Stooges short, like this one called Husbands Attention and I recommend both!
