This film certainly shows and sheds light on what is happening in most institutions today, and shows how one gurl with the help of her newspaper manages to do things, her editor has complete faith in her and does not publish something important because it would hurt her boyfriend ... and when it was the right time, she took the necessary action. The film overall received a rating from me 9 because it has it all, I think it keeps you entertained, and moreover, they behaved really well for a TV movie, its really high quality acting that deserves a lot credit.
