Nynke is an elegant film shot in the same style as Oscar's movie character (1997). But this comparison prompts me immediately to add that the other one was quite exciting ... Sure, Nynke is a beautiful historical and costume drama (with the fantastic acting of Monic Hendrickx!) In which you are witness the personal growth of "Nynke van Hichtum" in marriage with Pieter Jelles Troelstra. The subtitle of this movie is 'lovestory'. So it starts and ends with their marriage. But that's where the director makes a major mistake! Nynke's exciting, independent life began when the marriage ended. She has written several books for children and traveled around the world. What a great life she lived. However, Pieter Verhoeff returns Nynke to the convent trams that depressed her and that she was struggling with the idea that only her marriage to Troelstra spread her life, that there is no one but their children's mother. Let's hope for Nynke II!
