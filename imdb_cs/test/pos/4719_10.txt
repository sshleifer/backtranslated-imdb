"Beyond Rangoon" is just amazing. From the traumatic opening to the uplifting end, you'll be amazed at how well this movie is put together. Patricia Arquette portrays Laura Bowman amazingly, with whom we meet as a closed and discontented young doctor, unable to cope with her grief at the loss of her husband and son. In the course of the film, as imprisoned in Burma, he witnesses a democratic uprising and massacres in the capital of Yangon, flees his life and saves the life of his guide (U Aung Ko), regaining his will to live. It can be seen fictitious or hard: it is not so. John Boorman, a master in spiritual and emotional conflict, paints the film with wide strokes and often uses symbolism to capture Laura's emotional state and physical distress. Patricia Arquette, as usual, gives a wonderfully convincing and believable performance as Laura's emotionally injured. What makes Arquette amazingly, in every role he plays, gives us a word in the heart of her character without words. Every time the film gets close, viewers are inspired by its character. He doesn't need to talk to express emotions, or to be up. Some critics were tough on the performance of Arquette in the movie when it opened on August 25, 1995, considering she was "flat" or "boring" in the role. I have found that her characteristic is dead, remaining far from the melodramatics that are usually part of the drama when personal tragedies take place. She is in shock and is reserved about her feelings: it is as normal as yelling clanking at those around you. I hope Warner Brothers will soon release this title on DVD. With Arquette's very successful NBC drama "Media", which brought her to the name of the household, not to mention the Emmy's victory and the nomination for 2007, it would be in the best interest of the studio. Hopefully there will be accessories, with an alternative ending. Don't get through this movie. It is the one you will not forget even after viewing.
