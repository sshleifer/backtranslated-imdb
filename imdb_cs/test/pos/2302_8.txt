It is Oshima, the director of the notorious "In The Real of the Senses" film, a film that is so sexually sunk and undeniably controversial, which has been banned for a while. This film takes place initially in 1895 in Japan and presents a very nice Keziko Yoshiyuki as Seki, the wife of a rickshaw driver who falls on a much younger man who eats in kind. The man, Toyoji, comes to her when she sleeps and seduces her, even if she is soon willing to be seduced. Soon they have an affair and a plot to kill Seki's husband, to be together forever. They do and throw it in the well. However, they did not count on the spirit of a dead husband haunted by Seki and others in the village! This film is visually very stunning, using shadows to emphasize this story of murder for passion. Ms. Yoshiyuki (who is still active as an actress) is particularly good in her role. His sexual at times, but not as "in the realm of the senses". Some of what follows depends on our imagination. I found this movie that has mood consistency, making it very attentive. A little scary, but it goes with the territory. I would recommend it.
