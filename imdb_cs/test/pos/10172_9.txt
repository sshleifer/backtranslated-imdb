The original man who knew too much brought Alfred Hitchcock acclaim for the first time outside the UK. Of course, people have wondered how Hitchcock can provide so much on such a modest budget compared to rich Hollywood products. The original film was shot in the studio. For whatever reason, he chose this one of all his films he was supposed to remake, Hitchcock with an international reputation and a large Hollywood studio behind him (Paramount) decided to see what a man who knew too much would be like a rich budget. It is shot in place in Marrakech and London and has two great international names for the box office. That was Steve's third fourth Hitchcock film and his only connection with Doris Day and her only Hitchcock movie. I wonder why Hitchcock never used Doris again. At first glance, she would fit into the profile of the blond leaders, whom Hitchcock favored. Maybe because her healthy picture on the screen was contrary to the sophistication Hitchcock wanted in his blondes. Doris does some of his best acting performances in a man who knew too much. Her best scene is when her doctor James James Stewart gives her a sedative before telling her that his son has been kidnapped by an English couple who befriended them in Morocco. Stewart and Day play beautifully in this scene. But Doris, especially when she registers four different emotions at once. Day and Stewart are on vacation with their son Christopher Olsen in Morocco and meet Frenchman Daniel Gelin and the above-mentioned English couple, Bernard Miles and Brenda DaBanzie. Gelin is stabbed in the back of a market in Marrakesh and whispering some dying words to Stewart about the assassination that will take place at the Albert Hall in London. Their child is caught to make sure their silence. Just so I could think that hit hit hit Hitchcock. In fact, Doris plays a well-known singer who has gone from stage to wife and mother. The song was Que Sera Sera and I remember it well at the age of 9. You couldn't go anywhere without hearing it in 1956, this year even competing with the fast-growing Elvis Presley. Que Sera Sera won the Academy Award for Best Song, which won titles such as True Love from High Society and title song from around the world in 80 days. It became Doris Day's thematic song for the rest of her life and still is she should ever want to come back. In fact, the song is processed pretty nicely into a plot as Doris sings it on the embassy side at the top. Instead of doing it with mirrors, Hitchcock shot a real Albert Hall assassination and, as another reviewer, said it's not ordered, it's choreography. During this moment you will hang on your seats. This was good to remake.
