Looking at this GREAT Classic movie, Greta Garbo and thought her performance was excellent. However, the German film version that had English subtitles was her greatest performance. Even Greta Garbo mentioned the press that German film is her favorite, where she had to make a change from Silent Movies to Sound. Greta had a high voice and had to take lessons to lower her voice for her future roles in the movies. This story was very sad because Greta Garbo (Anna Christie), "Ninotchka", 39, was abused by young boys on the farm and her father left her as a sailor years ago and then as a coal boat captain. There were many scenes of Old NYC, Brooklyn Bridge, Coney Island and Sky Manhattan Line. Charles Bickford (Matt Burke), "Wine and Rose Days", "62 classic veteran actor gave a big supportive role.
