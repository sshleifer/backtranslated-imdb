I love this movie, one of my favorite favorites. Ann Blythe as Sally O'Moyne is sweet and hassle free. He believes that the prayer to St. Anne will solve all her problems and difficulties. An inherently malevolent man who would take possession of his father's property is witty and clever. Her brothers are brothers a girl wants to have. Also look at "Aunt Bee" as her mother, a strong Irish woman who does not leave her home to bring her family inside.
