Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a tough party, has made Texas a congressman with no recognizable legislative record. In 1980 he is interested in the situation of Afghanistan, which is in the midst of a brutal war with the USSR. Under the auspices of her old flame, arch-conservative Texas sociality, Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), she travels to Afghanistan to assess the situation and is impressed by what she sees. He is returning to the US, who is determined to help Afghans, just to keep his colleagues extraordinarily indifferent to the situation - and is being investigated on charges of drug use. Wilson, who is not discouraged, recruits Herring and the vulgar, outlawed CIA agent Gust Avrakotos (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) to launch an intricate arms trade involving Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and most of the unrecognized US Congress. Finally, the Afghans defeated the Soviets, but while America celebrates its victory, Wilson and Avrakotos find their warnings about the instability of post-war Afghanistan, which will fall on deaf ears. Charlie Wilson's War is a slick diabetes, a truly elegant movie for a more intellectual viewer and entertaining entertainment for the average filmmaker. The film puts together an amazing array of talents, both in front of the camera and behind the camera, and promises to be one of the hellish times. The film has only one mistake we will arrive later on. It is fascinating to explore the improbable way in which the greatest secret of the 20th century has been conducted - and perhaps the way in which the CIA and other intelligence agencies are doing. The film is interesting on several levels. The story portrayed in the film - with all its outrageous double negotiations, insidious secret operations, and possibly its success - would be as fake as the work of fiction that could easily be rejected as a satire. But things really worked in this way, at least within reasonable limits. The film portrays our three protagonists in an interesting way that emphasizes their merits without obscuring their shortcomings. Wilson as a man who is infallible about his unrest (though he is embracing it) - yet willing to accept a righteous thing. Herring is something elitist, and its reborn attitude of justice is gone - yet it is deeply committed to the affairs of the Afghan people. Avrakotos is an outsider of the CIA with a problem of attitude, looking down because of his "street" background - but his love for earth and hatred for communism are unwavering. The fact that this strange trio could play a significant role in the fall of the USSR is not just proof that everyone could change, but also the fact that truth is alien than fiction. It is also very interesting that this is all played as a comedy - not too surprising, given that our writer is Aaron Sorkin, but it is an interesting way to approach this story. However, the film has one drawback, which is a bit surprising. The film seems to be incredibly celebrating the success of Wilson et al. That's okay - nothing wrong with defeating the Soviet Union? - as long as it is not thought that the Taliban came out of the ashes of Soviet defeat in Afghanistan and ultimately al-Qaeda. Regardless of the level of responsibility in the US, it has happened and the display of Wilson's success is almost unreal. To be fair, the film deals with this problem to the end, with a relatively current Wilson speech about the US's inability to clean up after itself, but it is done in a tertiary way that the average viewer is unlikely to take much of it. . The overall impression would be that these three remarkable people helped the Afghans defeat the Soviets. This is not a fatal disadvantage, you think, but it is one disturbing aspect of an otherwise brilliant film. The film's talent is remarkable. The legendary Mike Nichols adds neat, beautiful looking production; the material is perfectly suited to its underrated directorial style. Sorkin adds yet another brilliant scenario; the film has dozens of citable lines and classic Sorkin exchanges (the best being "Scotch Bottle" discussion between Wilson and Avrakotos), and holds something of a political and historical perspective behind it. The movie's cast is a miracle: Tom Hanks gives gentle performance as a dear rogue with the cause, Julia Roberts is alternately charming and repulsive as annoying, but committed by Joanne, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene (par usual) as an abrasive Gus. Always nice Amy Adams will take another step on her way to fame when Wilson's long patient assistant and Ned Beatty, Om Puri, Emily Blunt, Christopher Denham and Ken Stott embody a supportive cast. Charlie Wilson's War is a smart and fun movie, a wonderful piece of fun fun. The fact that he decides not to be more than it should be; it's great at what he's doing. <br /> <br /> 8/10
