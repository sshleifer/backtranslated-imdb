Watching "Cold Mountain" gave me the impression that his director Anthony Minghella had deliberately attempted to overcome himself and his own film that he was trying to defeat, was a practically perfect "English patient" since 1996. Comparing both films, the assumption is quite similar. We have a passionate love affair between two people who have found themselves in a tumultuous time of war, and have ended up with the war more or less as background disturbances while trying again to find themselves in their arms. The primary differences in the plot are that the character of Nicole Kidman is not married, Jude Law is a deserter and the conflict is an American Civil War. "Cold Mountain" is, story-wise, more irrigated and milder than saying "English Patient" and it's more level for people who want a simple love story with some external turbulence causing the problem. It's a shorter movie that's a plus for people with less patience. However, it is not as spectacular or original, or indeed as an "English patient." Just my big complaint about "Cold Mountain" is, a stunning, love relationship between Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). Surprisingly, their love was the least interesting thing in the picture. They have no real relationship; we feel no real passion from them and the passion we see is more physical than emotional. I was more fascinated by the friendship between Nicole Kidman and Oscar Renee Zellwegger, as well as Jude Lawe's travels across the country, avoiding vigilants and enemy soldiers. If Minghella strengthened the meaning of a love story, I think better. Of course, the movie is fun, even if the love story is uninteresting. Civil War sequences are absolutely great; they are a modern tradition that shows war as severe and dehumanizing. The re-enactment of the St. Petersburg campaign, where tons of explosives have been detonated from underground, followed by a hand-to-hand battle, is terrifying. Minghella is not allowed to pretend blood and gore in an artistic and sensible way, and is not afraid to show the victim of innocence and life in these scenes. There are times when women, like men, are killed, often by crossfire. And there is more. Only the sound design of the film creates tension. There's a scene where Inman and the other deserter prepare for food by cutting off the head of a dead cow. We don't see slicing, but the sound effects of the blade passing through the bone are disgusting. Finally, I have to congratulate on the show. Jude Law was amazing in the film and earned an Oscar nomination he received. I feel that Nicole Kidman deserves even though her character was a bit shallow. Renee Zellwegger had the most personality and screen theft. And then there is only the part that really works to complete this stylistic world re-creating a terrible time in America's past. Perhaps "Cold Mountain" would be better as a war image, but it certainly would have been spectacular as the "English Patient" had his love story been powered and made by more passionate screenwriters and director Anthony Minghella. As it is, it is the most enjoyable picture, I bored it and I recommend it. All I'm saying is that his love story - even if it's a central plot - is somewhat gentler than necessary, and all the things that really worked.
