Lucio Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films such as The Beyond and Zombie, was a former Italian giall master (in Argento and Bava) with films such as The Lizard in Female Skin and his Masterpiece, Don't Torture Duckling. This film has all the elements of the Italian mystery / thriller genre known as giallo, but it really attracts viewers by having every key character with a skeleton in their own wardrobe. This will keep you as much detective work as the detectives in the movie itself. Who kills young boys in town? A young, rich woman who is so bored of sexually taunting potential victims, a reporter who likes to manipulate the crime scene to get a better picture, a townsperson with her mentally retarded daughter, a local witch, an urban idiot. .. the list goes on, and you have to keep mental notes as a real game to play and solve. The themes in this film are very bold and do with the perfect Italian style in the early 1970s. It is certain that no American studio would even consider filming such a strong content, and that is exactly why it is such a satisfying film (despite some unusual accents for dubbing) and certainly people will discuss its meanings long after. display. As they say, they won't do it like that anymore, so take a copy and appreciate an important movie like this!
