This is a new Barbie movie. The graphics were really good. They made the film seem partially realistic. I was doing ballet and this film made me continue. This film was like Cinderella, but a little different. The 12 princess's father is very ill. His cousin poison him and he wants the throne. The girls, through their dead mother's stories, find a secret magical ground. It's up to them to save their father and society. With the help of their handsome prince. It was a fun movie, and I and my friend talked to him. We enjoyed it a lot and we also enjoyed an Indian speaking parrot. The music was very nice and the movie was even bigger. He had a great classical orchestra. The voices were great and the characters were cute and cute. I liked it so your movie is great for the family. Overall, I would watch it again.
