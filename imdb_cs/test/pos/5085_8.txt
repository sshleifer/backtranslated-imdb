Some people think it was a rather bad TV series, with cheesy effects. (Since it was filmed in 1977-1979) but really, look at those years and think, "We didn't have computers then." so if you think about it, it's a rather good TV series. I've always thought bad reviews killed the show, but no. network. they canceled their theme as a "superhero network" and left a short lived spider-series man. if it went on, it should probably work well into the 80s, and if it was really lucky (And I really mean happiness) in the early 1990s. Up. Anyway, Jolly Old (or Young) Nicholas Hammond, of the Sound of Music Fame, is brought to the television screen as Peter Parker, the secret identity of the amazing spider. along the series, Peter deals with a clone, a beautiful girl from a foreign country, and a corrupt politician. that is, when he gets a bit, and Uncle Ben is already dead,) Spectators are treated to action, tension and attitude that have characters to Peter and his alter ego, the spider. It's also slightly disappointing that Robert. Simon doesn't look like JJJameson, it's not so disappointing that Betty's grant is not a Betty grant, but a hot African-American girl (who reminds me of a Halle berry who is one of the hottest women on the planet) really, one wasn't that bad. But with regard to the time, and how much drama they wrapped up in this, it's kind of a harbinger of what is bad television today. In any case, it's fun, even today. <br /> <br /> 8/10
