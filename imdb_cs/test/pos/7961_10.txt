Last time I came here, I think there was no more than one comment. I am very pleased that more people have caught up with this film, and even more so that you have all been kicking it. I caught it on the night of Christmas 2004 and found myself unable to change the channel on my TV even though it was an Asian movie - and I'm unfortunately, but really-very used to give no chance to any off-Hollywood products. But I did that evening and thank God deeply for it. I was not able to shake this movie out of my system because - not that I tried or wanted - and that still amaze me - in a grateful way - that such a great, beautiful experience came in such a way, totally unexpected, as Christmas Miracle.Please if You have a chance to go see this movie, buy it or rent it to smuggle it or anything, but watch it. I guarantee that it will affect you. I'm out of time, but I'm far from finishing my rating, so I'm back as soon as I can.
