This is one of the most fun movies I've ever seen in age. I watched for about 20 minutes, slightly confused by what was happening. Then I started laughing and didn't stop long after the movie. Such a satire is really rare. Christopher Guest has a real eye for humor to those who don't have a sense of humor about themselves (about 90% of white heterosexual men). As in "Waiting for Guffman" Guest Nails of Central America idiotic self-importance to the wall. I'm barely waiting for his next film.
