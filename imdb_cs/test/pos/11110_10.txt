I think fame was the best movie I've ever seen. The ways it was funny and dramatic, but that's what the movie does. It is true that she has a few free ends, actually a lot, but I still think it's a great movie. Some of the funny things happen in bankruptcy at the beginning of the movie. I think it's funny when a girl tries to perform O.J. Simpson in "The Towering Inferno" and Raul / Ralph go past every art department and says his father was great in everyone. He says his dad danced with rockets and left Ralph's tap shoes. Rockets, as far as I know, are made up of women. And shoe boots were just regular shoes with bottle caps on the bottom. Also, the one who read Julie's lines in Romeo and Juliet was fun. One thing about a movie that just turns me on is music. I've never heard anything like that !!! My favorite song is "I Sing the Body Electric" and the other is "Fame". Irene Cara has a big voice and she's a great actress. I like how the film focused on many ethnic groups. It showed all kinds of people there actually are in what is now called "La Guardia School of Performing Arts". This film has shown triumphs and trials of many young artists, including Angel, Doris, Bruno, Coca, Montgomery, Ralph, Leroy, Hilary and Liza. They all had hard times, but they did it on their own. This movie could add another 30-45 minutes (before graduation), but it's still my favorite movie no matter what !!!!
