As many other notes I read, I noticed I fell in love with this movie when I was little. My sister and I had a copy of the movie on Beta (before VHS) we wore. Of course, this didn't help when our parents sold BetaMax in the garage. Since then, we've been trying to find a copy. As the next commentator, I finally found a copy of the rental at a local video store. The owner would be pleading, bribing, and crying for a number of attempts to own the tape. GOOD NEWS! I bought a brand new, newly released, VHS copy of Midnight Madness for $ 9.99 on Amazon.com two days ago !!!! Finally, Disney woke up. Now that they're just releasing Song of the South ... If you love the movie, grab it. If you haven't seen the movie, it's worth checking - absolutely stupid humor, but a lot of fun (Stephen Furst is cheerful).
