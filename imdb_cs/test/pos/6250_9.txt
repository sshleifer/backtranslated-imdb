I love this movie! When I saw this movie on TV, when I was a kid, it scared me off. Probably because the pieces also creep me. Jocelyn Jones (Molly) is an excellent actress. She uses facial expressions, especially her eyes, to play frightened. Tanya Roberts (Becky) and Robin Sherwood (Eileen) are great actresses and I hope to see them in future films, especially Jocelyn Jones! So if you like scary movies but you're tired of seeing the same old thing, check out this movie!
