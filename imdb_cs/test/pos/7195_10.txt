It's the first time I remember where adaptation was done exactly like a book ... In fact, jokes were added to the story rather than content mixed or removed! As an Egyptian Cellularis slave who had difficulty transmitting, um, communicating, LOL! Or when Tidivinnus played like a quasi-Sith Lord and angry when the Roman Empire suffered a blow, the General ordered the Empire to ...? Oh, watch movie people! I can easily believe that this picture was one of the most expensive in French cinematography and it was worth it for me that Depardieux was excellent as a Roman rumble and boar chomping Obelix. Clavier, who plays a little indomitable Gaul, was perfect and far from his days as Mr Reno's lord in "Just Visiting." The battle scene between Artifis and Edifis was cheerful and nice. see theme The Matrix was not lent to spoil the otherwise perfect battle! Redbeard's pirate and his crew have almost stolen the image, from sinking their own ship to be the Otis '(Edifis' Assistant) invention at the very end. <br /> <br /> I understand that Asterix and the Olympic Games with many of the same teams, toutatis, I plan to see it too!
