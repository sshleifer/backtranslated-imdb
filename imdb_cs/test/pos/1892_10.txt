I don't know what some people thought when they said this movie was bad. It was great. Classic Bruce Campbell, yes, it was a low budget and a special effect showed it, but that's not what you see for Bruce. Also Ted Rami was excellent. I found this movie to be fun and funny. Now I admit that this movie is not for everyone if you don't like B movies that you probably won't like this if they long for big budget effects and actors avoid. But if you like slap-stick and off wall science fiction charts this movie is for you. Greetings to King Baby!
