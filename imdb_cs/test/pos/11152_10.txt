This has become one of my favorite movies and certainly one of the best westerns I've ever seen. Having a soft place for the genre (westerns is? Or was because they are no longer made very often? Game morals that too often were refined by critics with intellectual claims), I bought a DVD, a look invisible because I read enough about William's work S. Hart (much of what he wrote and directed) to wake up my interest and I thought I should have at least one of his movies in my video. I approached my own observation with a bit of anxiety. My previous experience with the "classic" silent film let me feel the decline. Chaney's ghost of the opera, Griffith's birth of the nation, and Fairbanks' Mark Zorro were all right, but not as good as their reputation would lead. They were either too long or too theatrical, or both. But the toll gate proved to be a pleasant surprise. It's a story told in a simple and straightforward way. Black Deering (played by Hart), leader of a notoriously successful gang, thinks it's time for the band to break up before she gets lucky. But his chief lieutenant, Jordan, who promises them great wealth, is against him, but leads them into traps in which he is a co-owner. Everyone is killed except Deering who is captured. When his captors recognize him as a man who once saved a number of soldiers and settlers by warning the base of the impending Indian attack, he allows him to escape. Single, trying to find honest work, but being alienated and ridiculed, he must eventually rob himself to survive. Soon the sheriffs, but also Jordan (now thriving from the rewards he has collected) and his followers are persecuting him. His flight leads him to a remote cabin inhabited by a single mother and a small son. After a few initial doubts, they take him into the heart. Deering sees a chance for a new life, but with a gradual and Jordanian closing he realizes that this may not be possible. Hart was the first great Western star and the first to put realism into the genre. As one of the pioneers of filmmaking he has created many characters and situations that have become clichés in Western countries for more than ninety years. Interestingly, his films are his ability to go for clichés (perhaps his imitators didn't go far enough), so the material seems fresh and innovative, even now. Three such cases in the Toll Gate illustrate it: <br /> 1) In one scene, his character shoots into the crowd in an attempt to kill Jordan and instead kills the viewer. The following detail shows that she is clearly frustrated. But frustration does not follow from the fact that he had shot the man who had caused him damage, but that he was missing his intended goal. 2) In another, when he runs out of position, his "borrowed" horse enters the gopher hole and breaks his leg. Hart pulls out a weapon to get the animal out of poverty, but before he pulls the trigger, he gives his head a sad, loving pat, as if to say goodbye to an old friend. 3) Finally, after strangling Jordan and throwing his body over the cliff, he returns to retrieve his weapons and see the enemy's pistol lying on the ground nearby. He moves forward and gives him a quick kick before he mounts his horse. It's a simple gesture, but underlines the deep hatred he feels for the man who betrayed him and his comrades. And I love the title, Toll Gate. As a result, it is allegorical that one cannot begin a new life until he pays his old sins. Deering's payment comes in the form of a victim. Today's more sophisticated audience does not have to buy this sentiment completely, but it can still work for you if you leave it. <br /> <br /> Viewers who like their videos in their original state will undoubtedly be directed against the quality of the DVD image, especially the badly damaged final reel. I don't mind at all. That a 1920 copy of this film even exists is a miracle because the copies of so many other silent films have been lost. Taking this into account and looking at the film as a piece of history, its visual defects are not that difficult to accept. William S. Hart was born in New York in 1870, but grew up in Minnesota and Wisconsin, where he learned to speak Sioux and Indian Sign Language. He counted Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson among his friends and garnered Remington paintings, so his knowledge of the West was the first hand. If his vision seems to be overly romantic by today's standards, he is rooted far closer to reality than the western spaghetti of the 1960s and 1970s and the revisionist work that followed. The star and his films are delayed due to a re-evaluation.
