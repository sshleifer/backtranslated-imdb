Someone who likes to drive the highway at 120 km / h eats McDonalds and runs air conditioning twenty-four and watches Fox News non-stop, I found this document interesting. One thing I picked up when talking about North America, I assume this document was Fabrique Au Canadie. I'll leave it to Bill O'Reilly for the Canadian assault. The consequence of oil depletion will affect everyone, especially those who live in the large countries of Australia, Canada and the United States. I'm sure Green Peace no longer consumes gas, it doesn't mean more SUVs without realizing that people who live below zero can starve. As someone who studied economics, I know that we live in a world of limited resources. I will submit documentary props to try to present a balanced view of oil depletion. However, I study journalism, this document is full of loaded news - Republican as governor. What did the Democrats not send to Vietnam? <br /> <br /> If you are going to introduce a document on economics and resources, it is best to leave political arguments on one side, as this could cause a potential audience member to shut down. Focus on finite resource issues. At the end of the day it is best to open the mainstream mind because it is not a good preaching to the minuscule congregation. I really enjoy watching documentaries like Fahrenheit 911 and End of Suburbia not for their political bias because they remind us that the world is not so safe. Certainly I like to buy and eat junk food like tomorrow, but if the world ends tomorrow, I'd rather die rich and use a lively beep. For potential documentary filmmakers, just give people the facts and let the audience think. If you try to wrap your political views as a balanced document, people will feel rats a mile away.
