This is indeed a documentary about love about a fascinating character, about her view of life and her extended family. The creators spent three years recording Sister Helena in her halfway home and captured so much beautiful material that you can't help but feel that you know Sister Helen and her "boy". There are 21 recovering addicts in the house, each with a story almost as much as Sister Helen. The final scenes are particularly sensitive and emotional. Sister Helen's story of marriage, addiction and loss reveals a very complex character that is hard love at all times fun, moving and cute. The film is amazing in the way it tells its story in a beautiful cut of life sequences that evolve in a story that is almost as clear as if every scene was written and performed to the best. The honesty (and apparent dishonesty) of "clients" is very important when you learn about their fear and follow their growth attempts. You'll never forget Sister Helen, Robert, Moe or the poor Ashisha (spelling?).
