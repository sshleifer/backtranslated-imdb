I'm a big fan of Lonesome Dove and all the books in the series and I love the movie. I was glad I ended up with Comanche Moon. I have long been a fan of Steve Zahn and I was glad to see him in a serious role. Personally, I think Steve Zahn did a great job of re-creating Gus. I can't think of another actor who would be better. He has a voice, mannerism, pronunciation of the word, all up to T. Granted, no one could ever hold a candle for Robert Duvall like Gus, but I think Steve Zahn did a good job. Karl Urban behaves the same way in all the movies he was in, so he was great for Woodrow Call. As for the movie itself, yeah, it's a little crazy, but can you really beat Lonesome Dove? No, I don't.
