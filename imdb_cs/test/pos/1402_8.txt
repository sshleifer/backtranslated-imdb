This is a very special film for Harold Lloyd - at least with regard to the sweet character he played in films during the 1920s and 1930s. Instead of a nice guy and Snib Pollard, there are men who deceive every blind man. In a particularly successful con, Chester pretends to have lost a "very valuable ring" and a little later, Harold discovers it is also a quest for a circle. The ring is of course cheap, and then Harold discovered it, but the stooge greed is so big that it "persuades" Harold to say nothing and sell him a "valuable" ring and then run to enjoy their happiness (?). They will find patsies again and again until they meet a woman who is a con woman herself (working with a man doing a fake session). She arranges a clever con and takes all the money they stole - and she has a police officer to make sure she eats money. As lucky it would, two con men come across a lady's shady business when no one is home. Soon the lady returns and plays with their minds - releasing a lot of dirty tricks to punish them for her evil ways. All around, it's a totally strange and fanciful movie, but it's also extremely funny because jokes work very well and Lloyd and Pollard are a great team. Plus, when I'm scary and weird, I liked to see Pollard dressed like a lady.
