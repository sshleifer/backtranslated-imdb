Forever Strong is a type of movie we've seen many times, only in different types of genres. Although it was said, I really thought it was a great movie, Sean Faris shows the type of potential that usually actors will land in great time. It seems that this movie got a limited edition because I didn't even realize it, but I saw it in the video store and decided to take a chance with it after I remembered Sean's performance in Never Back Down. Finally, I made a great decision, I'm not a rugby fan, what ever happened, but the movie isn't really about rugby, it's about being in your life, challenging, achieving your goals, there's much more than a simple chart suggests. At first we don't give a damn about what happens to Rick, he is powerful, full of himself and absolutely arrogant, we feel that his fate is completely sealed as a problem maker. Along the way we see changes in his nature, he starts to talk to better people, he starts to improve, we learn how many negative effects his father had in his life, it's just a great shock and the film did a great job of turning Rick from the prey to a good person. The rugby event itself is not bad at all, unlike the things I played and saw in high school, it was actually pretty fun. watch and beautifully choreography. The big young cast, combined with some veteran experience, has helped this film immensely, just doing a wonderful job and avoiding what might be an annoying and effective drama during the mill type. I also liked the contradictory contrast between the coach | Garry Cole | and Rick | Sean Faris |, it was for a very interesting story, and I liked to see him help Rick along the way it was emotional and pleasing at the same time. This is a real hidden gem that I really love to find that I thought about my life and many times I need something like that. <br /> <br /> Performance. Sean Faris is excellent as Rick Penning. He reminded me of a lot of young Tom Cruise, but still very charismatic and talented. It was a difficult task to turn from a furious teenager to a good young man, but Sean pulled him out with pure perfection. He clearly put his heart and soul into this film, so the great way Sean gave so much effort to this great movie. Gary Cole is excellent as a preaching but sympathetic coach who wants to help children. I've always considered him likeable, always having a kind of presence he wears to his movies. Neal McDonough is fantastic as selfish, yet under the pressure of Father Rick. For most of the film, the script leads you to believe that there is nothing more than a selfish bitter man who wants Rick to be like him, but eventually you start to see the real one who came out of it. bit. Julie Warner is a good actress and plays a good but clueless mother well. Penn Badgley is bound to play a real blockbuster and the boy does it well. On many occasions I wanted to deny it, so I have to say it's a great performance. Arielle Kebbel is a love interest that is not very important, she did OK. Nathan West plays a somewhat mysterious character, done quite well. Sean Astin is billed as the main player of the movie, but hardly doing anything he did well with what he had to do. Bottom Line Forever Strong is a great good movie, sure to stop you and think about how your life was much better than you thought. Don't let it slip away, you won't regret it. <br /> <br /> 8 1/2/10
