It's always a good feeling when a movie delivers goods when you didn't expect it. Dead End Kids / Bowery Boys have found themselves in a lot of uneven movies and usually do better when they are in a supportive role, such as in "Dirty Face Angels". Their presence as a backdrop to the story of a boxer destined for murder gives them plenty of time on the screen without distracting them from the main action. John Garfield is a lightweight champion Johnny Bradfield, a hockey player from the south. who is very different from the picture that portrays the sports world and the press. When a journalist inadvertently learns that Johnny is a loving groom's party, his plans to spill the information in the column interrupt the whiskey bottle to head from Johnny's manager Doc Ward (Robert Gleckler). On the other hand, Doc talks to Johnny's girlfriend Goldie (Ann Sheridan) to run with him to avoid a legal argument dealing with the reporter's death. As both flee, police pursuit ends up in the fiery wreck of the car, and Doc's body is misidentified as Johnny from the gold watch he was wearing. Claude Rains receives Edward G. Robinson's sneer, who doesn't quite work as a detective who has been transferred to the morgue detail after a bad arrest years ago. His character is Monty Phelan, and he has a pretty good feeling that the body in a car accident wasn't Johnny. He annoys his boss to give him a closed case, and is assigned the task of getting him out of town and out of the way. Meanwhile, Johnny seeks advice from his lawyer and winds to get even worse when he gets to most of his ten thousand dollar savings. He makes his way across the country, Johnny returns to Rancho Rafferty Date in Arizona, run by Crunchy Granny Rafferty (May Robson). The farm is the legacy of Grandma's brother, a deceased Brooklyn priest, and is now home to a group of boys from The Dead End Kids working on the farm. Billy Halop is the nominal leader of the boys in this lineup and his sister Peggy (Gloria Dickson) becomes a romantic interest for Johnny, now called Jack Dorney. <br /> <br /> I'll get a bunch of historical perspectives offered in these pre-war movies. When Johnny and the boys rejoice in the farm truck, they fill the gas station for $ 1.28! Tommy (Halop) gets the idea that a gas station on the farm would be a good way to make some extra money, and with that idea Jack Dorney decides to take on a boxer boxer who offers $ 500 per bike to anyone who can stay in the ring with him . The premise cliche is turned on the ear somewhat when Jack gets into the fifth round, but by then he has earned enough to give the fruit farm a chance to fight. Maybe Grandma Rafferty was supposed to be in the ring, she just took all who were sitting around her on the ring. When Johnny / Jack comes in the locker room, Detective Phelan is on hand to put him in custody. Knowing he can redeem this reputation with this collar, it's a good idea whether Phelan follows his arrest - you'll have to watch a movie to find out. <br /> <br /> I like the Dead End movies that Leo Gorcey is in charge of, but he doesn't have much to do in this matter. However, at a ticket buyer at the boxing match gate, he makes a great movie flame. Another thought - wouldn't it be great if a picture on the priest's wall was always present at Pat O'Brien? All in all, it's a pretty good record in both John Garfield's Filmography and Dead End Kids and a fun way to spend an hour and a half. If there's one downside, it's not enough time on screen for pretty Ann Sheridan. The film might be even more satisfying if the role of Sheridan and Gloria Dickson were reversed, as the screen chemistry between Dickson's Peggy and Jack was more forced than natural.
