If the legendary work of Monte Hellman appeared as a masterpiece of "Two-Lane Blacktop" in the early 1970s, it was more like a sharp, undressed, sharply tense and straightforward mood piece decorated with this distinctly non-meaning "rough, coarse", very raw and the ragged macho Australian mentality and ending in the generous sprinkling of the foul, desperate, hopeless pause dog nihilism, it would undoubtedly be very similar to this violently grim and atmospheric knockout. The nice factory worker Mike (appealing Terry Serio) is at odds with the grimace that wears the fascist races of Fox champions (perfectly hateful Richard Moir) stealing Fox's girlfriend Julie (beautiful Deborah Conway away from him). Mike and Fox are starting to compete in ever more deadly races, where bets become higher and higher with every subsequent match that culminates in a pulsating all-or-nothing run with a single real win. loyal Italian mechanic Palma Tony (Vangelis Mourikis superbly smooth) and brought up by a blind, sovereign rebel rebel 50-year-old greaser (amazingly crafted with Max Cullen's cool), willingly puts his life on the Line for his reputation, his old lady's affection, money, and most importantly, for the opportunity to overthrow the exalted Fox out of it About the Fame, Glowing Thrown Director with the highest degree of gravity and intensity John Clark, written laconically by the right-to-perfection of Barry Tomblim, with the shaking, meat-crawling synthesizer score by Peter Crosbie and the replacement, undecorated cinematography by David Gribble, this authentically rugged early 80's items represent the concept of racing cars not only as a funky alternative lifestyle, but also a versatile obsession and a reason to live (that's the only thing most movie characters are really passionate) with a remarkably delicate and indistinct eye. Complete with a harrowing negative end and a subtly grim central message about the bitter price that one pays for being a top dog, this stunning portrayal of the dead end's existence as an extraordinary film success.
