SEA INSIDE (2004) **** Javier Bardem, Belen Rueda, Lola Duenas, Mabel Rivera, Joan Dalmau, Alberto Jimenez, Tamar Novas, Francesc Garrido, Jose Maria Pou, Alberto Amarilla, Nicolas Fernandez Luna. : Alejandro Amenabar) An Inspiring Story of Live Death; Bardem is excellent <br /> <br /> The true description of the life of Spanish quadriplegic Ramon Sampedra and his petition to fulfill his desire for euthanasia by the right to death cannot be considered a likely source of inspiration, but this film is just that. Sampedro (playing great Bard) was a manly, energetic young man when he lost his function on his limbs after a tragic dive accident (depicted in memory with visceral laughter). For nearly thirty years, he had been in bed while his loving family cared for all his needs. Although his abilities to move were zero his mind was very active and proved proficient as an inventor, poet, author and artist who kept his mind busy until he could no longer carry the idea of ​​living longer in his stunned state. Enter the beautiful, but also afflicted Juliet's attorney (the ethereal Rueda, who is beautiful with Bardem, as if they were soul mates), is hired to see Sampedra's last wish to end his life and again become an assistant de camp when she begins to open her like never before. It is not too long before the time has passed and Julia begins to explore the past of her accusation and finds many letters hidden by his family. When Julia confronts Ramona with it, he is first reluctant to discuss something with her, but ultimately agrees with her that it can help his case and the project becomes a book in the process? memoir / biography by way of free style and prose poetry. The film is a heartbreaking story about human spirit and how love ultimately prevails over the heart pain in many forms, including Ramon's unlikely love, shared with a full stranger named Rosa (Duenas), the unmarried mother who sees him on television one day, when she inspires her to ride a bike to her distant farmhouse in Spain to recognize him and possibly change her mind about ending her life. Filmmaker Amenabar, who has written with Mateo Gil a fascinating screenplay, allows some imagination to mix when Ramon introduces himself magically leaving his bed and fly through bucolic landscapes to the eventual sea where he suffered so many years before the cruel twist of fate who has imprisoned him for three decades. The film is not a complete downer with a crafty wit and sometimes humorous tone that does not weaken the impact of the final story act. Kudos also to remarkable makeup James and Jo Allen are doing a tremendous job of aging the vibrant Bardem aging man in full effect that should get them the Acadamy Award nod. Bardem and Rueda deserve an Oscar nomination as two people who have so much in common and despite the fact that Julia Rueda is married to a loving, spicy husband, that pairs of people who are created for each other, is impossible never been together. This is just one of the atrocities that are true, but it is not the definition of film as a whole; it must be seen and be one of the best of this year.
