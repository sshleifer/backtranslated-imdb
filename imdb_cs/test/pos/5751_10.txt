I can't even imagine why he hates this film so much. Several times I was literally crying with laughter ("I believe you slept well?" "Actually, we had a bit of a rough night." "Ah, danger of adultery."). It is true that the end is a bit flat, but still has its moments (fake spalsh booger balls that flew into the ocean, "beach house paradiso"). <br /> <br /> I personally think it's the funniest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
