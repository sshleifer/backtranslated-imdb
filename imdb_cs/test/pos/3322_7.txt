These working girls go to hell soap is a time capsule candidate, courtesy of his immaculate physical production, costumes of 50 years (check out all those bows and pearls), creamy Johnny Mathis theme songs and oh-so daring (for his time) sexual attitudes. Rona Jaffe's novel, on which the film was based, keeps on being reublished, and just a few years ago Vanity Fair actually devoted an article to this delicate bon bon movie. Check out the new DVD and you'll know why. Three group leaders - Hope Lange, Diane Baker and Suzy Parker - make girls from "How to Marry a Lover" or Carrie Bradshaw and her friends from "Sex and the City". "Gentlewomen singers turn off on the spree ..." Their romantic adventures and sexual entanglements are things of paperback passion: empty caramel corn calories, no nutrition, impossible to resist snacking on. Lange really touches on her neo-Grace Kelly's way, Baker is dull and idealistic as a shy virgin who (hisses) knocks (hisses) cad. It helps the cadre to be played by Robert Evans, a proud voice, movie mogul, who has certainly led many innocent young lambs to defeat in his Beverly Hills bedroom. Suzy Parker is a fascinating first half of the film, all blithe self-confidence and conscious notes. She erects her stuff with the shock of fashion icons she was in the 50s. Unfortunately, it is not where the film sends it: into madness and obsession. However, it exudes grace and salvific faire and its actions are at least reasonable. One wonders why the critics hated her and practically expelled her from the movies a few years later. Perhaps the determined attitude of a good-looking woman is too unbearable. A little later he sank Ali McGraw's career, and when you think it, Ali McGraw and Suzy Parker were basically the same actress. The only significant film error is a weak ending. It quite collapses into romantic fainting at the end, rather than climbing to a melodramatic ending, like other famous soap operas by producer Jerry Walde, "Peyton Place," which Lana Turner cried and scraped her teeth during rape. process. Here, Hope Lange wanders out onto the New York sidewalk, spots, eternally hung (but now, of course, sober) Stephen Boyd and they just leave together ... into the sunset, one assumes. Otherwise, it is largely a definition of guilt pleasure. Oh Yes ... there is also Joan Crawford, breathing fire on all young girls and smoking cigarettes while she hisses at her married lover over the phone. And the titles are done in hot pink color, with the inscription on the ribbon, which resembles the ads of the department store from the late 1950s. Do not miss!
