First I played the second monkey island game and I liked it despite the low quality graphics and sound. A few months later I found out that a new game was created. I tried it and I liked it a lot. The first thing you notice is great graphics. The areas are huge, colorful and detailed, with plenty to explore. The game requires you to use your brain a lot, as always. The game is challenging, with all the games and click games, frustrating. The jokes never disappeared. Animated cut scenes are a great addition to the game. This is the best MI game out there, maybe the best P&C game too! If you like cartoony games that play like a movie, enjoy this game!
