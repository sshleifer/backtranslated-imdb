This is my favorite movie Hal Hartley. All his films are little gems. I like independent movies and I hope Hal Hartley will never go into the mainstream or sell. What if the Lord Jesus returned and loved his people so much that he could not open the last book and destroy the unbelievers? It was nice to see Mr. J. Harvey in the movie because I was a fan of her music. Don't look at it if you are a fan of Hollywood movie cutter, you will be disappointed.
