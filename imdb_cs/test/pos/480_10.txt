If you are tired of the same repetitive, unintelligent material that the mainstream film industry makes, you'll enjoy "You Are Alone". It is a provocative thought, well shot and riveting. Without revealing something you won't find in the first few minutes of the movie, it's the story of a young white college from school. an upper middle class environment that works as an escort and is discovered by its neighbor. The vast majority of the film takes place in the hotel room, where he hired her to come. Through your discussion you will explore two perspectives on prostitution, depression, loneliness. But the film is not depressing. He talks about dark things without being depressing. As a viewer, your emotions and predicted concepts move, but gently. You get out of it with a lot of thinking. I like it in the movie.
