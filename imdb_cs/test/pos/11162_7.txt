Hey, Ralf Westhoff seems to know a lot about people! We have nine women and nine men participating in a speed dating event, each person has five minutes to talk to each other. A good idea to make these conversations a movie. And even better: it works very well! Dialogue is witty, original and authentic, each person is gently characterized without getting into a cliché, something that is unusual for German films, remember: All these years we were troubled by the stupid zeitgeist comedies like "Workaholic" or "Stadtgespräch" . But the time has come for young German directors to do their own things and risk by making films that are fun and funny and at the same time intelligent and sensitive. The timing of the "Shoppen" is also good: although it is primarily a dialogue, it keeps tensions and interest. After a while, you will actually be curious to see how this man and the woman will do. Some of the participants meet later on a two-person, it's fun to see them interact in "real life". Of course, the film has several drawbacks: it's not too cinematic (but can such a film be?), The music soundtrack could have been better, but it's all just marginal. <br /> <br /> The most important thing about this movie: We've got some damn good actors here. Imagine it: All of them are still unknown here in Germany (most of them were derived from the Munich or Bavarian theater scene). But I predict that of the top 18 actors, at least 11 of them will become well known in the film and television scene. It's great to see so many fresh and talented faces. Well done! <br /> <br /> For those who want to know more, there are a total of 18 actors: (spoilers!) Sebastian Weber: Silent waters are deep! Remember your "Flower Garden" monologue, you can win the hearts of every woman with this. Anna Böger: To Hell Women! Every time you open your mouth, you can't help but laugh and feel good. Listen to how he pronounces "asshole" and calls the boy from the pink shirt "Bürscherl"! Felix Hellmann: "Bürscherl" from above is fun to watch. The uncomfortable truth is that there are too many of them. His appearance reminded me of Flo Weber from "Sportfreunde Stiller". Katharina Schubert: This woman has everything: love, hope, despair, beauty. Her "want kids" scene is classic. A great actress we'll hear again, no doubt. David Baalcke: Is this guy defeated now or not? Almost as authentic as Paul Giamatti in the "Sideway". I hope this is not the way to play. Julia Koschitz: "Good Looking" Circle Woman. Julia played theater in my hometown, kudos! I think they will appear in many TV series that will come. Martin Butzke: The Revolutionary Guy Catches the Biggest and Most Conventional Woman at the End. Would you like to share a taxi with this guy? Kathrin von Steinburg: Last year, she released a stunning performance in "Tatort". Her trance-like performance in this movie is no less. Look at her beautiful face and hear her dirty laughter. The best scene in the movie belongs to her. Matthias Bundschuh: I know that they "write everything" - they go back from school. I'm not sure if a hot blonde has an allergic reaction to him or his cat. Matthias's depiction of such a chicken is excellent. Mediha Cetin: My sister-in-law's sister-in-law was the same spokeswoman as she was. The day I met her was the only day in my life when I needed soothing means and bad memories here. Thomas Limpinsel: "A nice and desperate guy" in a circle. Limpinsel has a comic talent that is much better than most so-called "comics" on television. Lisa Wagner: The Sacrifice of Sebastian's "Flower Garden" Metaphors. Lisa's face is funny and full of melancholy, her story made me feel good and sad, wow! Oliver Bürgin: "Good Looking" Circle Man. No wonder they will eventually catch Julia. These two really fit together. I think he will appear in many TV series. Julia Heinz: "Cute, Conventional" Woman. I hope it won't be underestimated: Julie's changes from naive to injured to furious are great! Stephan Zinner: "Nature Boy" of Partenkirchen likes cooking, eating? and good sex. Look at the body language between him and the hot blonde! Zinner usually plays CSU Söder's politics on stage! Anja Klawun: "Negotiating Girl" has some good moments, but please excuse me (like most actors) while playing drunk on the screen. Christian Pfeil: Plays an arrogant and narcissistic guy. He couldn't believe this actor owned two cinemas in Munich. Tanja Schleiff: She plays a girl who sleeps with every man around. I'm sure many men will go for her. I heard she can do dramatic roles, so I'm curious.
