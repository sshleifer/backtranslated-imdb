Before I examine this film, I must admit that it is a bold statement made by a film reviewer. Anyone who has read any of my previous reviews may know that I am always controversial in the small sense of the word, giving high marks for flops like "Captain America" ​​and "Creature" of 1985, and panning such film classics as Alistar Sim's "Christmas Carol" and "Shakespeare in Love." With this in mind, this confession may not come as a surprise: The simple fact is, Christopher Lambert is probably one of my favorite actors. Woah, now, don't go crazy about me. Let me explain: In no way do I think he's the greatest actor in the world. I admit it is not. Certainly not Morgan Freeman or Anthony Hopkins, but I think his acting ability is probably somewhere where Bruce Willis is at least. What I admire about him are the human qualities he brings to his action heroes. He is just an average person who laughs and cries and bleeds, who is a hero because he must be, not necessarily because he wants to be. It takes a lot, in my opinion, to be able to draw those qualities in character (especially in the films he was working on), and Lambert's heroes are far from Schwartzennegger or Stallon. Frankly, Lambert's characters are easier for me to cover. He's not the biggest actor in the world .... He's just a personal favorite. I can't say the same thing but for his movies. Though I interpret a lot of his acting, it would be foolish not to confess that his choice of films leaves something to be desired. Most of them are, frankly, scary, and no taunts over the years are due to his acting, but rather to his bad choice in scripts. <br /> <br /> I can say that his debut film "Tarzan" is one of his best films and probably his greatest performance. As I mentioned, it is effective from how mankind brings to the role, and how seriously the director, writers and actors manipulate the material. This is far from the B-movie action adventure with Johnny Weismeller in the 1940s. In fact, I would hesitate to call it an action film. Instead, it is a serious drama that takes all E.R. Seriously, Burrough reveals to Tarzan's desire to discover his real family in Scotland after realizing that it is not a white monkey. He is torn between his old family and his new, which includes the gorgeous Sir Ralph Richardson in his final role. In an effort to adapt to man, his monkey instincts also kick in, and he can't decide what he loves more: His real family, or the one who is always known. All in all, it is an amazing commentary on the company and an amazing character study. If nothing else, Lambert launched international fame that continued in the 1980s with films like "Highlander" and "He Sicilian." Unfortunately, it didn't last. But wait for a while .... His latest career moves like "Gideon" and "Resurrection" have proven that while he still has a long way to go, he's a sufficient actor who might be able to ... comeback if you do he simply chooses his roles better. So far, there is a verdict on his first film: <br /> <br /> *** ****
