Perry Mason: The Fatal Fashion Case finds out that Perry and Della Street in New York are getting an award from the American Bar Association. An irreversible trial record should get some recognition that I would think. Anyway, Della's girlfriend, fashion designer Diana Muldaur, will be arrested for murdering her opponent, Valerie Harper, and in fact Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale testify to a confrontation between the two in a classy restaurant. two opponents have something that makes Heddu and Louella look like school girls. Of course, Harper has many other people who loved her as much as she did. The same offender also launched a fashion designer who could expose individuals. This throws Perry with his trusted investigative attorney, William Moses in an alliance with some gangsters. It seems the designer was a cousin of the crowd boss who also wants to handle some justice in his usual way. One thing I couldn't get is when Moses and the gangster Robert Clohessy tracked down the perpetrator, I can't believe the police didn't feel this case either. Of course, Clohessy has some access to resources that the cops just don't have. But the best part of this particular Mason entry is Scott Baio as a young rather full-fledged assistant to Raymond Burr himself, telling himself he studied all his cases and looked forward to defeating him. Foolish Boy. In fact, my favorite scene is Burr and Baio in the sidebar with the judge. Baio wanted to reopen his case and add a witness and ready and prepared with precedents. Burr catches his guards and says he has no objection to the new witness and then continues to demolish the witness on the cross test. Absolutely priceless. Scott Baio is the best thing in this particular Perry Mason movie and should be seen for him alone if nothing else.
