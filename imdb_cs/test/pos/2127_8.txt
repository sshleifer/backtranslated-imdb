I thought this movie was perfect for girls. It was about a magical place where Genevieve and all her sisters could do whatever they wanted to do whenever they wanted. Most girls would love this story, though there is an idea of ​​death. Although no one dies, the king almost does, but little girls don't understand it, so it adds to being the perfect story. All events add up and create a big conspiracy that can be important if you dig deep enough. This story is perfect for little girls, and since it's a barbie movie, kids can have more fun with it, especially if they have their own barbies. Anyone can entertain him because he is so cute and understandable. Overall, I think this film is a good movie for everyone, especially little girls, and at least one smile will be made to it.
