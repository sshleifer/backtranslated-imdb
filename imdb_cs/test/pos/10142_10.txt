Excellent cast, story, performance. Completely believable. I realize a narrow knit group that is an example of marines. But this film brought me fear. The marines left the principles to be damned. This film seems to have been based on real life events. It shows how hard it is to go against the device. Anne Heche was absolutely convincing. The gung image of Marine Sam Shepard was sober. And Eric Stoltz as her attorney was so profound that he balanced his loyalty to Corp, but also his loyalty to his client while he was high over the rope. He knew what had to be his real progress. But he was immersed in his maritime tradition, loyalty to the church over all others. I sat on the TV screen. All in all, this is 9 out of 10.
