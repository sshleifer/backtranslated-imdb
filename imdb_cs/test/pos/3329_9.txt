Tex Avery held as a director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history. His cartoons were extremely inventive and unreal with ME strange touches that were later celebrated in MASK. Eyes popping up when one sees a girl, impossible pieces, and continuous action were trademarks of these films. <br /> <br /> This is one of several Droopy cartoons for which Avery was responsible and one of his best. Droopy is Mountie and he's determined to get his man ... though in this case he's a wolf who escaped from prison. In the course of the film, despite many insane pieces, Droopy keeps up with this cheater until the wolf gives up because Droopy is seemingly everywhere! Full of funny gags and loaded with laughter, that's a great cartoon.
