Yes, 2:37 is in some ways tearing away from Gus van Sants Elephant. It's about some students who deal with their problems leading to the suicide of one of them. Yes, it is full of clichÃ©s, but that is life. You cannot deny that the fearsome fools, people with disabilities or popular students who, despite their popularity, have problems, exist in the real world. But that's not what this film is all about. It's not about high school life. It is not about the misery of life itself. When you look beneath the surface, under the social soaps shown, you will find some grasping and provocative criticism of our society. br /> <br /> Why do people commit suicide? Do we really understand their motives? Or are we just trying to understand after its too late? And why is it always someone you would never expect it to be? This movie doesn't answer this question, but it raises it. And it does it in a very intense way. All the while, guessing which blood can be kept you can see at the very beginning. You follow the paths of some students, all have a more or less good reason to end their lives, just to be forced to watch the horrific act in the finals. <br /> <br /> Did you know who it is? would? Or were you surprised like in real life? The report is verbalized by one of the surviving children at the end. We are always so firm about our own problems, we have forgotten the others. He may be someone, a colleague, a friend who no longer wants to live. But if you don't open your eyes, you never know when it's too late. This film brings good. It could have some shortcomings, but it doesn't matter when it ends. Either you see the reflection of society, or you are blind to reality.
