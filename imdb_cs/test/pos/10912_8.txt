Beautifully built and brilliantly played comedy. There is no person in the cast who would not (or herself) try to make herself happy. However, the real star of the film is the invisible director Frank Oz, who brought all the sensation and joke to this farce he brought to Miss Piggy with Miss Piggy's frog. This is not a movie that has been left out.
