I shouldn't like Jackass Number Two. No one should. There is and there has never been anything special about redemption of Jackass. And yet ... it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen - and I just can't explain why. This new film leaves the first film in the dust. It's so fun, so awful and so bad. They're giving the whole team everything - with Jackss in charge of Knoxville. It's a nut. I love him, but he's crazy. And more power. With his growing film career, he could sit and let everyone else do the dirty work, but the fact that he almost literally threw himself back into the world of 'Ass so wholeheartedly that he respects me strangely. More kudos must go to Bam Marger, who had previously seemed content to sit back and just make sure everyone around him had done almost what he wanted. Here Bam is not a tormentor, but tortured and is all the better. <br /> <br /> I just can't say what's my favorite part because I laughed all the way. It is true that I have seen most of the film from my fingers, but there wasn't a 'real' movie that I saw in a very long time, which made me feel so encouraged as this. To love them or most likely to hate them, the Jackass team added beyond my expectations. But I agree with Bam. There can never be Jackass number three because someone dies and I want these guys to stick around.
