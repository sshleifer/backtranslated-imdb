That's 80's classic humor. If you were a teenager in the 1980s, this was this summer. It was an early look at the super stars now. This and Better off Dead are just fun and silly movies you can enjoy. Everyone can admit they had a crazy summer when they were teenagers. Even crazy family and friends like these characters. Being introduced by any of these characters was so amusing. Uncle, who is crazy to sit every moment of waking up on the radio waiting to win a million dollars, grandmother, who likes granddaughter and gave children after dinner an account, twins that look alike and to meet hoop was so much fun. It doesn't have to be won, but it's just a fun movie to get lost in one afternoon.
