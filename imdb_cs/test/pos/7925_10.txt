He was looking for this film after I read Tom Clancy's novel "Red Storm Rising". Timeless masterpiece of the 13th century Russians attacked by the Germans. The film was made in 1938, following Joseph Stalin's orders to warn the Soviets of Hitler and Germany. Battle scenes are beautifully executed, showing that you don't need computer animation to make a great battle scene. Probably the greatest work of Sergei Eisenstein. See also 'Battleship Potemkin'. This movie should look at any buff history or poli-sci major. 10 of 10.
