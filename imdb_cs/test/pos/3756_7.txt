I only saw this movie once when it appeared on TV, but I still remember it 15 years later, so I have to say something about it. I thought it was an intelligent insight into education, friendship, bullying, and influence that could result in adult life. The title really refers to how good or bad it is in sports, no matter how low. at a low level or you will be tolerated by handles at school and later until adulthood if you are good at it - this is set in a private school in England, but it could be anywhere. The main character is bad in games, he tries to get revenge in later life, all of which culminate in the peak confrontation on the cricket field. I have to admit that I ended with the end - it was powerful and sad.
