I am glad that this was the work of foreign cameramen because it cannot be accused of unfair prejudice. With absolutely no cause, the Jacksonville cops rush to court in this case and pick the first black suspect to blame white murder, a foreign tourist. They've been up for 15 years. An old boy who is just as close to a saint as you could accidentally find, and then the fools try to pin the unlikely case against him. In addition to the injustice of blatant prejudices, it is a six-month unfair imprisonment of an entirely innocent young black woman. The question is whether, as a society, we should compensate those who are accused, imprisoned and subsequently found innocent. This docudrama is well made, professionally recorded and presented in a captivating package that won't take 1 minute break. If you care about social justice, don't miss this. I'm sure she deserves an Oscar.
