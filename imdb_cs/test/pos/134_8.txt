(This has been modified for space) <br /> <br /> The new Chan-wooka Park movie is a complex film that is not easy to classify. Namely a horror, the central character is a vampire, the film has elements of comedy, theology, melodrama, cultural invasion (and its analogue of the viral invasion of the body), romance and several other things. It's a movie that has too much in mind. The film has its own affairs and blends them with classic European literature, in this case "Thérèse Raquin" Emile Zola. It is a strange mixture that is not always gel, but still has incredible power. This is almost 24 hours since I saw the movie at Lincoln Center (with a director's post film discussion) and I found that my cage is getting more rattling. It is not so much what is happening, it is annoying, its more than its wide range and its motifs are a lot of bells in retrospect. to help humanity voluntarily engage in a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease. Infected with this disease eventually succumbs and dies, but due to the transfusion of vampire blood (not explained) actually survives. The priest returned to the hospital to serve the sick. Unfortunately everything is not right. The priest finds out that he needs blood to survive. He also finds that he has all the typical problems of a vampire, and he is not able to go out during the day. Things become even more complicated when they reunite with their childhood friend and his family. The priest, some of his animal passions have awakened and are being accepted with his friend's wife. From there everything goes sideways. An ever-changing film, this is a story that revolves around a wide range of genres, as it tells the human story of a man who discovers that his life has been radically altered by a random event and finds himself no longer who he is he thought he was. It's a movie you have to keep to the end because the movie is forever going on to be something else. It's also a movie that has a lot of in mind and the themes they're playing with are constantly explored in different ways. The movie has enough that a person can and people will probably write books to discuss the film. Two of the strongest parts of the film are his vampire elements and his romance The vampire part of the story is brilliant. There is something about how it sets the basic rules and the nature of "suffering" that makes such a perfect sense that it kind of pushes old vampire ideas aside. I sat in the theater last night and was amazed at how great it was. I think that playing more or less straight is what an earthquake is. Here's a vampire who wants to have a normal life. This is in contrast to what happens later, it is clear that the life of human hunters will not really work. It is not the dark world of Twilight or Lost Boys, rather its something else. Personally, I think the film changes the playing field from a modern, fantastic or dream dream to something more real and tangible. (Sequence in which the power of kicks is fine) Romance is also beautifully crafted. Sure, sex scenes are steamy and well done, but it's another thing, look, talk, gestures outside sex that makes it special. I love the look, the silent glances when the forbidden couple looks at each other for hunger and incapable of acting, disappointment and sorrow of betrayal, both real and suspicious, and insane passions of possible consumption. This is one of the great novels of all time. It perfectly captures the feeling and emotions of deep passionate love (and lust). If you've ever loved deep, I guess you will find some part of your hearing on the screen, I know I did. The statement "I wanted to spend with you an eternity" has a sad honesty. It is both a statement of what was intended and a depth of emotion. A tragic romance will break your heart. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to lie to you and say the movie is perfect and great. It's not as good as the pieces and almost all of them are great (especially the actors I have unjustly failed as amazing), the whole doesn't always meet. Different genres, thematic elements and tones intersect occasionally. I have often wondered where the film goes. I hung up there, though the film seemed to be wandering aimlessly. I liked the movie very much. I loved pieces more than film as a whole. Since I saw it, I was swinging in my head and I guess it would take a few more days. Like or love is irrelevant because it is a movie that should really be seen because it has so much that it will give you enough material to think and talk a few days later. One of the largest films of the year.
