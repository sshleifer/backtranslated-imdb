"Classe tous risques" feels like grandfather of "The Sopranos" in mixing a criminal and a home, and a comedy movie that seems contemporary as "Reservoir Dogs". Although these gangsters are affectionately involved in wives, children, lovers and parents, they are coldly ruthless and constantly remember that they are, no matter where we see them. . The key is loyalty and male camaraderie is beautifully mediated, without ethnic or class stereotypes, even though their network of past duties and returns narrows to suspicion and paranoia because the old gang is at different stages of release, retirement, out or into new, less profitable businesses. The intense accusation is to send a stranger to make an old escape scenario. It is a high point of emotion when a woman is told that she is not the one with whom the gangster is friends, while practically the only time we hear the soundtrack is when he remembers his wife. Streetscapes in Italy and France are amazingly used, in blinding daylight to the dark waters and highways, since the opening of a pair of harsh robbers - who travel with their wife and two children. The robust, goofy Lino Ventura instantly captures the screen as a criminal dad. And the second thief is apparently indifferent in their lives because they seamlessly coordinate thefts and escapes, in cars, buses, ships and motorcycles, in simple tandem. This is not a clich√©, a hairy old guy softened by an orphan with big eyes; they are their jobs and their families, and they intersect in terrible ways. The film offers no strikes in the unexpected killing of characters, directly and as collateral damage, and calls for their liking for them. an unsentimental ending, which is probably why there has never been an American remake. It seems so fresh that it is not until Jean-Paul Belmondo enters almost a third of his way to the film, and it looks so negligible as a young punk that he realizes it is Since 1960. Sultry Sandra Milo has a smart and amazing chemistry with him, from the ambulance to the elevator to the hospital bed. While the Film Forum showed a new 35mm print with newly translated headlines, it wasn't untouched. The program states that the name refers to a certain type of insurance policy, and it is a pun of a "tourist class".
