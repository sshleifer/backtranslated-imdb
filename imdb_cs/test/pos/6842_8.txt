He came over this film recently after such a long hearing about it. It is an excellent, unpretentious film for people who love film noir literature and films. Not "camp" but funny. <br /> GREAT CAST! From the spectacular Carly Gugin and Emma Thompson to the German superstar Til Schweiger, this film is a feast for the eyes. Alan Rickman is very entertaining as a gang antagonist. I'd like to see a spin-off movie with this character and Emma Thompson solves the cases and arguments between them all the time (like Tracy and Hepburn, etc.) 'watch if it's not range because the songs are very rich). Sexy sexy sexy and very fun time. Best Cure Ever Like Heaven Ever (Must Be!) <br /> <br /> ********
