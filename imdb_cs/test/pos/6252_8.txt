Do you hate them that they will never start? Sometimes they take an hour of lame red herring before some real action takes place. "Tourist paste" is not so! If it's typically horrible chopping you want ... before it's typically horrible chopping you get! Lots and constantly from start to finish! This film contains probably the biggest opening sequence in the 1980s horror movie, when a teenager is trapped in an abandoned house while strolling through engine problems and attacked by a haunted collection of wax sculptures. Four more lambs for slaughter arrive at the house and meet a totally crazy maniac who looks a bit like a mix of Leatherface leather (from the Texas Chain Saw Massacre) and one of those crazy old wax sculptors. "Tourist Trap" is an exciting horror pastime, with some real tensions, terrible images, ultimate weirdness, morbid humor and amazing makeup effects. Plots aren't always original, and acting is pretty bad, but seriously, who cares? Fast pacing and groovy killer-icon caused the "Tourist Trap" to make a place among my 5 favorite slasher. However, the total lack of nudity is a bit surprising. Too bad because all the girls look stunning, and after just 10 minutes the line "Who needs a swimsuit?" they talk.
