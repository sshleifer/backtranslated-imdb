Lots of things in this futuristic satire are theoretically wittier than actually funny (though it has some laughing-out-loud moments), but much of it is because it looks like it was interrupted by the studio to get a better look at the idiots it's a mock . Many situations are not allowed to evolve, it is obvious that this is a surplus material, and EVERYTHING explains the worst of all (most of them do not need any explanation), probably because some viewers did not understand what was happening. In other words, the dumbing down movie was ... you guessed it. We hope that a longer, better version of this comedy will eventually appear on DVD, and that becomes a cult fave deserves to be, but even in this disfigured and somewhat complicated spirit it is one of the most memorable films of the year - the smell of disgust against our culture and all the ways to crush, stupid and uglifuje in the name of appeal to yahoos. I watched it right after Land of the Dead, George Romer's last milking of one thought that consumers = zombies, which is basically the same point of the referee; yet where Romero's countercultural view (now a zombie = subclass that has to rebel against the rich) seems hopelessly outdated, the referee is fresh, dead, and far more disturbing. Just listen to yahoos in your movie audience, who will do it for Union Camach's Union State, as well as their on-screen counterparts, and you'll know we're all doomed.
