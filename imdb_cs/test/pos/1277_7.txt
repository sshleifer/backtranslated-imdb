Following is a small-known 1998 British film that was made with a budget of Â£ 8000 and has a running time of 70 minutes. When you watch him, never expect his director to continue Hollywood and become one of the most respected and famous 21st century directors? Well, everyone has to start somewhere I suppose. After that, as you probably already know, is Afterno's Englishman Christopher Nolan, who directs the critically acclaimed independent film Memento directly after After; A few years later he would be hired by Warner Bros to run the new Batman series, which brought him more appreciation, and so on and so on. My opinion is that everyone has to start somewhere? even though it's not in the most amazing debut ??? and Christopher Nolan introduces himself to the world in 1998 with After. When I watched him, I couldn't help but draw similarities to another directorial debut, avant-garde author Eraserhead, David Lynch. To follow is not a surrealistic psychological horror film, but similarities are noticeable; Most notable is that it is shot in grainy black and white and has an atmosphere that makes it unique. It's hard to describe in words, but it loosely resembles a smoky atmosphere found in the film's old noires. It can be said that the following is a contemporary film noir or neo-noir. Overall, this is a merger of this and the psychological thriller, and the story is best suited to these two genres. The main character is nameless and the title of the film is based on an early, obsessive-compulsive feature owned? randomly pick people on the street and follow them, sometimes for hours. During one of these "persecution expeditions," one of the people he watches sees the main character and is confronted. It turns out that "confrontation" is a man who is willing to befriend our narrator and introduce himself; his name is Cobb, and he is a small thief who invites the narrator to follow him on his burglary. From here, the main character gets to Cobb's world and he becomes involved in crime, passion and violence when he is more and more intimate with Cobb. There is not so much a character study to follow, but a film that follows the turbulent relationship between the two main characters and the devastating consequences it has on our narrator. Nolan succeeds in making a film that resembles film noir, and emulates the appropriate atmosphere well. As a thriller follows tense and atmospheric; However as a film in general, it is somewhat disappointing. If not, then it could be said that it was unmanageable. The whole film is filmed in a non-chronological and non-linear way, making the story and film experience unique? this style has been done so many times that it's almost everyday technique? and the story itself is to some extent unique. However, the following is finally overwhelming for the entire movie, and is unspectacular disappointing. The story calls for more ??? More action, more tension and more excitement? but he becomes too involved in his own story, and instead focuses on creating a complex story. Following it is successful, but without any other elements it is a film noir that fails. it is a feeling of emptiness that is not enormous but still noticeable. Furthermore, the shocking revelation of the film at the end? an almost mandatory film noire convention? it is he who makes us cheat; it is unpredictable and comes out of nowhere, but in relation to the story it is disappointing because it basically makes the previous scenes and the whole movie a huge waste of time. But the positives far outweigh the negative, and finally it turns out to be a flawed but satisfying movie, Yes, everyone has to start somewhere. Christopher Nolan does it with After, and he does it right. Quiet, humble but gentle. It's not the strangest movie, and it's not quite a worthy award director should continue the following decade, but it's still a good movie however. When you choose Next, you will find a well-executed, tense and atmospheric thriller that lacks noticeable nuances or innovative style, but still manages to capture viewers.
