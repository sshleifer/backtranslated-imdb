When I see this film, it always reminds me of what I remember summer as God! so long ago. The whole scene, including the "night", from the canoe parade to the end of the journey, is rare and Tripper's story of the murderous maniac is an urban legend right after my youth. A highly entertaining movie that was many times better thanks to the terrible sequel that followed.
