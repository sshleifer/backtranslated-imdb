I had to call my mother (WASP) to ask. Was it really so bad in New York's 40s? Surprise, she couldn't remember. So I told her to see the movie. Arthur Miller, not in the screen, but NOVEL for a change, was 30 when he wrote it in 1945. It's a painful depiction of anti-Semitism. Surprisingly, however, there is a tender story of human relationships (Finkelstein, a Jew, with Newman, a non-Jew) that is the basis of a cruel story. Acting is competent and cinematography is very good. The only reason I don't think it is in the theater is that it is >> aaagh << controversial. Actually, I gave her ten out of ten. Maybe a little high, but it's worth seeing.
