I can hardly call it a great movie, but it's fun. In my case, at the time this movie was released, I was at the same age as some young campers in the film. For me, this film brings back memories of my camps. While some of the jokes that take place in this movie, such as carrying the camp director in his bed and leaving him on the side of the road, strung on trees or on the lake, are a little above the top of some other pranks not. When I went to camp campers and counselors pulled out similar stunts like running the flag on the underwear, canoeing battles and the boys attacking the girl's cabin. When I got older, I realized that the nighttime raids on the girl's cabin I had been involved in were carefully organized by the counselors, so we didn't find girls in those awkward situations, but at that time I thought it was real and was it fun. That's what MEATBALLS (MB) is. MB captures not only the picturesque beauty of camp surroundings, but also the beauty of youth and carefree. MB gives a great example of pre-teens, teens and young adults living their summer without any interest other than hooking up girls and girls hooked up with boys and stalls with as much fun as they can before they return to junior high & high school and universities. The introductory title song that goes "Are you ready for the summer? ... no more homework any more books, no more dirty teacher looks ..." describes how precisely summer is seeing school kids. <br /> <br /> I personally enjoyed two campers Spaz and Fink. What boy, nerd or athlete didn't spend the whole camp trying to calm down on a pretty girl? What guy didn't want to accept other campers and advisors? Although these two characters are somewhat above the top, I bet that anyone looking at a movie can't help but love these two guys. These two characters are a mixture of Charlie Brown of PEANUTS and Jack Tripper and Larry Dallas of THREE. I bet most viewers even spoke to Spaza in a competition with eggs and Fink when he tries to "beat his stomach" in a hot dog competition. Finally, this movie had normal looking kids and counselors. No super models for counselors or campers who wore fashionable clothes. It's fun just to kick back and watch this movie and remember when life was as fun as this movie.
