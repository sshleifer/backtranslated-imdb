For the first time I saw this film at the audience film festival. 10 minutes after the movie ended the gay couple went to me and asked me if I needed help - I was still sitting, crying like a maniac. The film is cheesy, it's bizarre, it's on top, it's gay - but it's amazing. I think every character is credible. Everett's character is brutally throwing his (terrible) friends out, in the mood, he can hurt flies, "flies" that have killed his life's love, twice for a woman who is just trying to help. Bates is a miracle, perfect as well as role. A woman whose love and admiration is so strong that she loves her idol's homosexual lover is the essence of true love for me. I even understand Max (husband), bored with his life, has a middle age crisis. He moves, tries to lead an exciting life just to realize a) that he is really boring in the relationship and b) loves his wife. I like the fact that he will eventually return to him because I think he gives the film the right balance between dream and reality. Finally, she is her husband and may not be as exciting as Victor, but he's real, he's a man he loves very down. I saw it about 50 times and I love this movie, all about it unconditionally. BTW, just read Rupert Everett's autobiography and UL is the only movie he talks about as one of the best movies he ever made. For me, it's the best movie he ever made.
