Darling Lili is a blend of perfection and magic! Stars; Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson couldn't make a better attempt if they tried. It's full of all the magic a young lady wants, and it really seems to happen to you. Director's Brilliance; Blake Edwards turns out to be the best. He really caught the woman he loved on the screen! The mixture of each song went perfectly with the moment in the movie. The film opened with Julie Andrews singing Whistle Away in the Dark and closed with the same song Andrews. <br /> <br /> For the film of this perfection to be such a failure when it was released, it is a total shock ... <br /> <br /> As it is: "Inspirational ... Pure ... . Inspiring! " ~ One of Andrews most memorable lines in this movie!
