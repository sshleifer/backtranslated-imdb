The city in Japan is taken over by a terribly brutal abstract shape: a spiral. It becomes a theme in everything from animals to clouds to people and their twisting, mentally and literally. This film shows that it happens to several groups of people. Some demonic possession is implied, but nothing is entirely certain except that the best bet is to get the fuck out of avoidance. The film goes really well from normal life to abnormal phenomena (giant snails and crazy people) to truly supernatural (walking dead). As a tired American horror movie fan, that was what I needed. Maybe it was just a novelty of another culture's film, but it seemed to have a very original approach, the characters and assumption were definitely new. The Japanese may think that "horror shapes" (uzumaki means "spiral" as I said) are already old, but it was nice for me because I'm used to monster / alien / virus / disaster / undead movies. In American film you know who will die (annoying / ugly / lascivious / racist characters) and who will live (kids / heroine / dogs / cats / nice guy). This is not true in Japanese horror. It was not predictable how they would fight evil or how it would end. It also had this really new (but probably typically Japanese) color that had worn off the Pacific Northwest-style day, which was a fresh visual effect for me. The creepy moments were really scary, relying on the little gore, but mostly on the impossible exaggerated facial expressions (I mean The Ring) and physical manipulation. It should be one of the greats, there with one-original ideas like the first nightmare on Elm Street or the Night of the Living Dead.
