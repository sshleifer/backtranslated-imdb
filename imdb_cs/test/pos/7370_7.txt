This movie crushed Dr. Giggles as the best horror movie I've ever seen. The plot was great, the plot conspiracy was even better and the cast was great. It's hard to believe that 8 years ago they assembled the most famous people and today they would be big names! The storyline is simple. 4 teenagers destroyed their car in the middle of nowhere. They stumble on this campsite and do what everyone in the accident should do. Build the fire and tell the scary stories. <br /> <br /> 1. "Hook." Great opener. Anyone in high school has heard a variation of this story on Prom Night. But they do it really well in this movie. <br /> <br /> 2. "Honeymoon." OK, it wasn't the best of 4. It was pretty good and you'll see some breasts. Emphisis on the word "some". It's just your basic creation in the forest story. <br /> <br /> 3. "People can lick too." This is a warning story about what's happening in internet chat rooms across the country. This segment should only be required for parents whose children have Internet access. 4. "The Locket." Now it's the best story in the whole movie. The guy on the motorcycle breaks down and goes to the house of this dumb girl. Very good twist storyline. The main plot, "The Campfire" has the biggest and best twist in the film. I'm not going to say what it is, I don't want to destroy it. I've never been shocked in that movie in my life. Plot: + <br /> <br /> Acting: + <br /> <br /> Writing: + <br /> <br /> Directed by: + <br /> <br /> Music: A <br /> <br /> Overall: A + <br /> <br /> I recommend it to all who are over 13 years old, except "People can Lick Too. "Any parent who has a child has access to the Internet must follow this with their child.
