In 1968, when he was "SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One", he was released, it came out of nowhere, and struck like a psychedelic thunder lightning. The African-American actor and filmmaker, William Greaves, has forever changed the style of the "film movie" that takes place in the newspaper, and it has never resembled anything like that. The film is a film about "making a movie" and intentionally written and directed to create as much controversy and contradiction. Meetings in New York, Central Park, events and fear of dialogue concern the couple who fight and bickering about homosexuality and abortion. A woman wants a relationship and a man wants an explanation. At the end of this interaction, a drunk homeless man interrupts the proceedings and offers a commentary and personal story. After basic footage has been shot, the film crew adds its own view of the filmmaker and what he feels is his awkward handling of the film. Throughout the film, several cameras are used to record the action within the scene and the external comments of the cast, crew and spectators. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone interested in filmmakers Avant Garde such as Andy Warhol, John Cassavetes or Jim Jarmusch. William Greaves tries to show that the thing cannot really be observed and understood, because the image itself would change reality. "SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One" can be understood as a film representation or application of the uncertainty principle. That's just one possible explanation, and Greave's true intention is certainly open to speculation. Above all, this film tries to confuse, confront. and incite and undoubtedly succeed admirably.
