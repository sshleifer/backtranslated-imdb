Brian Keith as Cole Wlikerson and Richard Jaeckel as Wade Matlock make excellent villains. They just love the intimidation of local people in the most brutal way possible, and they make a ridiculous sneer at any sign that it might be a more humane way to achieve their goals. It's a pity that a good kid, Glenn Ford, gets in their way.
