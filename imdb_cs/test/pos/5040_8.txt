Maybe the best John Travolta role ever. Saturday Night Fever was a great movie and role, but before LONG. I can't think of many of his films or the roles I liked, and it's easy to imagine it being rotten. He can do something like Pulp Fiction, but he's doing a perfect funky angel and it's hard to imagine someone doing better (just as free) work with him. Plot summaries are available everywhere, but the plot is not a point. Just go for a ride and enjoy the cunning of the small funnies along the way. There is nothing in this movie that doesn't like it if you don't look for something deep. I wish there were more movies. We need a break from deep or amazing, or grisly or complex or hysterical.
