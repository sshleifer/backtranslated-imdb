Thank God there are movies that don't follow the same old Hollywood crap. In my opinion, the digital revolution and the DVD revolution actually make it more interesting to work, even if you have to find a harder job. I love it when the film takes time to drag you deeper and deeper into your inner emotional reach. It was actually like a trip to the soul of America and the soul is disturbed and confused. What really occurred to me was the way they used the speeches of Martin Luther King on Vietnam and references to his assassination in a way that hit me hard. Every time I heard his voice I found myself clogged. Of course, I heard him speak, but the way they used speeches made me feel that I understood his message as I had never thought about it. What can you say about a movie that has heavy statistics about war, oppression and pleading for compassion at the end of a place where credits would usually appear? There are actually no credits in the movie. You must access them by selecting them in features. Somehow I thought a lot. All in all, I can't say enough about this DVD. Brilliant.
