That was my second experience in Monkey Island, seven years after I was on the first game. What was my answer? "Oh, great, we're playing a cartoon." I'm glad my brother shut me down and played on, because the jokes caught my attention again, as did Armata's amazing Guybrush voice performance - no matter that everyone else did well (I still think Elaine CMI sounds better than EMI) . Cutscenes do well to show something that is happening, and the art of play and cutscenes is excellent. When we found the original CD, Secret and LeChuck's Revenge, we were both ecstatic and spent hours working through Revenge - one such moment where we just sat down and kicked it out for half a day. However, CMI must be the monkey island game I have played the most, especially for the fight against swords and fighting on the high seas. The moment you meet Kenny and he tells you he's straight and then, "I'm going with guns!" I had both brother and I in tears of laughter. And that's not the best part of the game, not by far.
