This story of the problems caused by the excessive possessions, exorbitant, dominating, and reckless mother (Laura Hope Crews) for her two adult sons and their girls, is a powerful tool for star performance by Irene Dunn (New Daughters). Law), Joel McCrea (son number one), Eric Linden (son number two) and Frances Dee (son of number two). Here's a show of the pure tyranny of mother's jealousy and respectability that happens when four good people find that their own lives are damaged, their plans have changed, and their own identities have been compromised. Irene Dunn is starry in her role. Joel McCrea's performance is open and clear and Laura Hope Crews is a master like mother. Yet this reviewer has found that the performance of Franco Dee is the best of all. Her first character in the story shows the strength of her inner feelings. Her portrayal of her broken engagement scene is shady and even raw. Dee throws the viewer and drives you into her pain without even showing her face! Frances Dee, like Laura Hope's crew, has been overlooked for too long and is almost forgotten as a beautiful actress she had. No actress who started the film after World War II had anything to say about Frances Dee. If you are lucky enough to see a silver line that has never been released for television, you will find this "old-fashioned drama drawing-room" to be an excellent film that shows very well 74 years after its 1933 release because it is filled with excellent performances.
