This is one of the classic episodes of TWILIGHT ZONE, where in the simplest situations the viewer has drawn into a seemingly symbolic conflict, only to find a solution surprising and strangely acceptable. There are five characters inside the container / prison: major, ballerina, bagpiper, clown and hiker. They are certainly the odd choice of types to be in this isolation chamber, but they are all in it (yet) and try to figure out why they are there. What do they have in common? Nobody can figure it out. Major, however, gradually organizes them and tries to bet when he stands on his shoulders. And a major who goes to the top of a series of characters gets to the entrance, and ... I leave it that way, though one of the other critics of this thread actually gives the story away. The title seems to be designed by SIX CHARACTERS IN SEARCHING FOR THE AUTHOR, the famous Pirandella game. Whether the actual purpose of the show was a spoof that the game is disputed: Pirandello characters analyze their roles and relationships with each other. But the five characters here while they are trying to understand their situation are absolutely in the dark - they are not in the situation of six characters in Pirandello who know their present situation. This uncertainty of what is happening allows viewers to think that it is an abstract drama. Actors, William Windon as Major and Murray Mattheson as Clown in particular, give good news about themselves. And the conclusion, whether planned as a spoof or not, is quite effective.
