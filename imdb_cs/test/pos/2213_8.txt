I really enjoyed this film and I think most of the fans of Lauren Ambrose. Her character is much softer than her role in Six Feet Under and all performances are strong. I especially enjoyed the way the role of Emily, the mentally handicapped savannah, was mastered. Despite some other misinformed user reviews the role was performed exactly and without the clich√© by the actress, Taylor Roberts. Also the standout was Fran Kranz, whose natural well-being was complemented by more seasonal veterans. Although the direction hit here or there, the only problem seemed to be a backward scenario. What might have worked well as a scenic game didn't look so good on the screen. On the other hand, Paul Ryan's beautiful cinematography, as well as the pace of the film, will surely make it surprisingly slow. I recommend this movie to fans six feet under and also fans of good acting and cinema.
