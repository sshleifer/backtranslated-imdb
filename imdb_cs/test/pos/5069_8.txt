I'm Egyptian. I have a green card. I live in the USA since 1991. I have a very common Arabic name. I am married (non-American, but not-Egyptian, non-Arab wife). I have children born in the USA. I have a doctorate in cell biology from the USA and I travel to conferences. I do a six-digit income and I have my own home in Washington, DC. I pay my taxes and off 1 or 2 parking tickets I have no defect on my record because I came to this country in 1991. I look more Egyptian than the character of Ibrahimi, but my spoken English is as good as its. A few months ago I returned from a conference / business store in Spain via Munich to Washington, DC (Home). When I got off the Madrid plane, I was taken at a Munich airport by a German officer. He was waiting for me. He was going to listen to me until I just said to him, "I don't have any business in Germany, I'm just walking". He let me go with maximum disappointment. That was nothing compared to what happened in Washington, Dulles Airport (which wasn't as bad as what happened to Ibrahimi in the movie). The customs officer asked me a few questions about the length and purpose of the trip. He then wrote the letter C on my own statement form and let me go. After picking up my bag, I was stopped at the last exit (Some Crap of the Homeland). I sat there for 3 hours with many different people of different nationalities. I wasn't told why I was detained. I couldn't use my phone or any other phone. At first I was a feisty and I asked me to give him a reason, or he let me go, but he decided to suck and just wait and see. I asked if I could call my wife to tell her I'd be late, but I was told no. When I tried to use my phone and as soon as my wife said "hello", the officer pulled the phone out of his hand and threatened to confiscate it. When I asked about the need to call home because my family is waiting, they said, "Three hours are nothing, we will contact you after 5 hours". When I asked to use the bathroom, an officer accompanied me there. The toilet was fun; I think it was a prison-style toilet that is all-metal without a seat. Finally they called my name and gave me a passport / green card and said you could go. I asked what the problem was, they said "nothing" !! I know it was only 3 hours, but I was tired and wanted to go home to see my wife and children. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, it was very well done. Unlike most films that are related to Arabs and are used by non-Arab actors who speak only silly, this film was 100% correct in Arabic. I suppose the country is Morocco (North Africa).
