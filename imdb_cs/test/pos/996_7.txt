Welsh poet Dylan Thomas apologizes for serving in active duty, doing his bit for the war effort that produces pieces of prose for some government propaganda industry in Whitehall. Thomas is portrayed as a freethinker believer in free love married to a woman with an equally challenging artistic stripe and the like with a fondness for extramarital romance. Thomas writing and reciting his poetry in a systematic domestic chaos throughout becomes somewhat priggish to the end, resting somewhat uncomfortably on his company links and pulling a position on the war veteran, who shot his house, and who was accidentally married to a woman he had The Real Story of this film is the love of two women, one (Keira Knightley), whose first love was Thomas (Matthew Rhys), the second (Sienna Miller), who is Thomas's wife. Sometimes it reminds a singing detective, as in a very good television with a slightly ominous subtext laid on the scenes of the surrealist camp of absurdity.
