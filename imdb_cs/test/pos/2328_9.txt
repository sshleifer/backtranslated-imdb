It's not the best storyline in the world, but comedy in this movie rules. Kelsey Grammar is amazing in this movie. Another funny guy is Rob Schneider, who will do with his segments with Ken Hudson Campbell, who plays Buckman. Lauren Holly plays probably more serious character in cast like Lt. Lake. Bruce Dern is a great actor in this movie, playing probably the most serious character in the movie. The actor I liked most was Toby Huss as Nitro, all the electric shots of his character in the movie are merry. The fence is a bit uneven, about Lt. wanted to command his own sub. When he finally gets a chance, instead of brand new, he gets rusty WWII Diesel Sub, Stingray. His crew is no better, missing the US Navy. He is then put into a series of war games, which shows how old the Diesel engine manages itself against the current nuclear navy. Things that aren't even better when he finds out that his diving officer is actually a female officer to see how women do on real businesses. To gain the position of commander he wants, he has to win war games and blow up a fake ship. theater. I loved when they were in silence and Buckman's farts, and all the reaction to the smell was merry. <br /> <br /> Overall 9 out of 10, this movie is just fun to watch, it's nice to have a movie like this I hate movies that try to be 100% serious.
