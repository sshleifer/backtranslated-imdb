I think this movie is the worst movie in Jerry Lewis's career. It's kind of a slow start, but after it gets it, it's Jerry's use of irony like never before in his earlier movies ..., ie Who's Minding the Store, Nutty Professor, etc., The idea is clear , the fake Dirty Dozen, instead of the death row soldiers doing a suicide mission like in this movie, you have the 4, 4-f's & 2 brand at hand. Dodgers, Willie Davis as Linc! HILARIOUS! I love the movie!
