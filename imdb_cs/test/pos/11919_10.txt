Not only is this movie a great title, but it's just the biggest drama I've ever watched. The viewer is drawn into the film, which involves 5 young men working together to try to overcome inimitable courses, Sean Astin as Billy Tepper is brilliant along with great support roles from TERussell, Wil Wheaton and Shawn Phellan, leadership management of Gosset. Astins characters make the film much better. As time goes by, the film is still gaining momentum and its disappointment that none of the young actors has shown themselves in the film industry after this wonderful movie.
