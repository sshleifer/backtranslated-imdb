Semper Fi! I saw "The D.I." in 1957. Two and a half years later I joined the church. <br /> <br /> The web and company got it as good as it was in '57. Boot, in '59, was actually exactly like Boot Camp shown in "Full Metal Jacket" - Yes. Black recruit, in my training squad, was called "Snowball." I was called "Stick" because I was skinny like a railroad. Each recruit had a nickname, some somewhat ugly, who had joined him in his congregation. When you broke or knocked on your butt when you pressed it, it was SOP. "Drop, and give me fifty," must be a drone. Then it changed to: "Drop, and give me two hundred!" DI was a bunch of sadistic bastards, but it was driven sadism, with the primary goal of keeping us stupid MoFos alive when we hit the fight. 200 years of experience has been rooted in this "sadism" and all that D.I. He did, or said, had a purpose aimed at his mission. <br /> <br /> Bad D.I. gets killed. Good D.I., though he seems to be the biggest asshole in the world, he's still alive. You can't kill an enemy if you're dead. <br /> <br /> In case you didn't know, the Marine Corps has one primary mission: to kill the enemy. PFD. <br /> <br /> Everything else is pure bravo sierra. <br /> <br /> MstGySgt WHT, USMC (ret)
