Originally I watched it because I thought it would be a continuation of the League of Superior Masters and this film is a completely different thing going on here - comedy! However, I loved it anyway! The Lords League is probably some British TV series with some rather odd characters and some sharp humor. This is a British comedy, so it revolves around being very stupid, dressing up in costumes and doing a lot of fun from German and French, homosexual links - it's just very funny! This chart revolves around TV writers who decided to abolish some of the characters and figures that emanate from their dimension into the writer's dimension to prevent it. It's a fun turn and there are plenty of great scenes in this idiotic adventure. Many times I laughed loudly and applauded the harsh humor. This makes Mr. Bean look like an irrigated haircut that is. (Rowan is much better in the Black Adder btw series) <br /> <br /> This is not Monty Python, but you can never escape comparison when you speak British humor, and there are few similarities, but not as much as keeping it from being his own thing and be fresh. It is more inclined towards young people and the Paradiso in its comedy style. If you liked it, check out The Young Ones and Guest House Paradiso, and of course I suppose the TV series League of Gentlemen must also be funny.
