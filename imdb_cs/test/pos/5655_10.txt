Any American who thinks he understands World War II should see this film. Few Hollywood movies about the war defied the stereotype of Japanese soldiers as ruthless brutalists who listened to orders without thinking. We would like to think that every Japanese man was ready and able to fight to death until the day we bombed Nagasaki. "Fires on the Plane" show a different reality: troops pathetically subject, demoralized and starved to the point of cannibalism. They euphemistically refer to human flesh as "monkey meat". The film and the novel on which they were based also died the myth that Japanese soldiers preferred death to give up: They had good reason to believe that their enemies were not in the mood to marry prisoners. For me, this raises the question that most Americans would rather avoid: If the Japanese army were so defeated at this point in the war, why did Hiroshima need to be pushed?
