The German freshman, Stefan, who embarked on Paris in the summer, embarked on a mysterious young woman in the summer with whom he meets in Paris. Then it follows in the famous island of Ibiza, a hippie joint met by Wolf, a man who throws Hitler-Jugend knives, owns bars and hotels and keeps Estelle under his thumb with the drug. The couple trying to escape Wolf, Stefan is addicted to the drug and jealousy for Estelle, who is groovy and free spirit. Great photography and music, conspiracy is common for this period, but it's not a kind of exploitation of the film, cold and dramatic. Morality is quite strong (looking for the sun ...), but I wouldn't say it's a drug movie, even if it's used in drugs.
