First and foremost, this film is a well-done work of art. Some sort of combination between "American beauty" and "how good as it gets". And of course something especially for all Russian films (of course valuable, no dirty propaganda!): The problem of loneliness of man ... Especially recommended for people who really want to see behind all the vomitous propaganda about communism (how positive or negative propaganda!). A film about ordinary people, their problems, lack of satisfaction - especially for young people, fear when they touch the real and too dirty face of society ... and false "solutions": alcohol and violence ... and probably just a real solution: true love. Of course it's very "localized" in space and time of "Russian perestroika", but it is true for the whole society (except perfect, but don't worry - it's not possible to find it on our Earth!). Last - definitely recommended ...
