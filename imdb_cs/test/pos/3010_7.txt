This one started great. Photos and sound are the best I have experienced (years, months). Especially the use of "warm" and "cold" colors in individual sequences is amazing. Also, for Jennifer Lopez to whisper most of her lines, the idea is in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to do with it. <br /> <br /> Now for mines. The script was terrible. Lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or utterly worthless. He seemed to play the movie just to sell herself and a pic. Three beds seemed too obvious. Baptism of a child Carl was a mentally overly underlined way to embark on the motive Carl "worked". And so on .. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie had a great way to show where Singh came from. Why are today's most talented directors apparently emerging from India?
