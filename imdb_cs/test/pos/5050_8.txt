This is a charming movie to say the least. The main character, Fan, is an old man who refuses to be among the living dead he is surrounded by. He and his accomplice go around pulling pranks and getting into trouble all over the city. Meanwhile, his family is in arms about what to do with him. From here you can see Fanda's relationship with his wife, best friend and son. This eventually leads to one of the best movie endings I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are rich and deep. They evolve well throughout the film. The film has a variety of moods. It goes from light and funny to grim and dark. Any slow parts for you in this movie will be ready at the end. Autumn Spring has a similar message to that of many other European films - do not lose sight of the little pleasure in life. If you enjoyed Amelie, The Eighth Day or Life is Beautiful, you will probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
