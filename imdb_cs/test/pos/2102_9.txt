The unscrupulous evil warrior Samanosuke (superbly playing the hateful handle of Yutaro Gomi) cruelly mistaken the peaceful inhabitants of a small village. The giant stone statue of Majin eventually comes to life to destroy Samanosuke and his malevolent minions. Director Kimiyoshi Yasudo and screenwriter Tetsuro Yoshida give the convincing story all the power and simplicity of the ancient legendary folklore: there's a very strong sense of ancient time and a distant distant place (that's specifically set in feudal Japan), good guys are noble and appealing while villains are really ugly and repulsive, occasional mixing swordfights are held with considerable skill and taste, special effects are fine and impressive, serious tone and steady pace never fall for a minute, and Majin's last rampant wildlife attack is extremely lively, exciting and more than a little nightmarish. In addition, the fantastic elements of narration receive substantial credibility by being firmly rooted in a credible dark, rugged and bold world. This film earns bonus points for displaying Majin as a more brutal and frightening force of angry revenge instead of a pure spirit of absolute goodness. The veteran composer Akira Ifukube adds a typically rich, robust and exciting score. Sharp, whimsical cinematography of Fujia Morita also hits the bull's eye. All capable casts give a remarkably sound and sincere performance, with the particularly commendable work of Jun Fujimaki as a brave, protective Kogenta and Tatsuo Endo as a Gunjuro follower. Highly recommended.
