Sonny Chiba, as everyone knows, is the man. In this film, he portrays Mas Oyama (1923-1994), a real martial artist who fought over 50 bulls with his bare hands ??? and won (interesting guy ?? look up). By the way, Chiba kills only one bull in the movie, but it's an unforgettable scene and as the liner notes say, right there with zombies vs.. Shark Scene in Zombi! The film also offers plenty of hand-to-hand fighting and a decent start-up plot, although I don't believe it's all true. This movie is the first of the Oyama Chiba Trilogy made and is recommended for fans of martial arts events. Finally, three neat little pieces; part of the introductory theme was used in Kill Bill Volume 1, Oyama himself appears in the opening sequences, because Chiba has been training in real life for five years!
