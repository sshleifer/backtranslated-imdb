I have seen movies come and go in my years, and when I see a catastrophe film I continue to hope that I wont be disappointed.And with this I was not in the smallest. The story of the whole country sinking into the ocean was a great concept written by Sakyo Komatsu, a novelist with intense theories about where this country is going. The characters were top-notch, and although I am not a Japanese, I didn't need a translator to give an idea of ​​how people in their desperate need could meet for the common good. Special effects threw me away, I was literally on the edge of my seat and watched the tidal waves of lava flows and explosions on the ground that had to last months of work at perfect levels. So, this is the best, the emotions run rampant throughout the movie and I screaming at the toughest scenes.On film visitors alike, you don't need to talk or understand Japanese to watch this movie, you can get the idea and feel of each person and character to keep her well They understood and followed it together like you were there. My hats off at Shinji Higuchi for driving, I hope they can surpass my job with another mind blowing experience.As ... Fantastic Film.
