"House of Dracula" really has nothing new to offer in the way of chills or excitement or new twists on an already tired story. This film was made as a rash sequel to a fairly better made "House of Frankenstein" from the year before. In the "House of Dracula" you can see the factory as a production value from 1945 with their tax on an otherwise potentially scary movie. Stock footage from previous movies in the series and then the end of "Ghost of Frankenstein", which is used here as the end, is for the movie "el cheepo". That is the shame of the studio and the producer because they think they have top talent and just wasted time and effort on a quick return of money. But it seems to have been a trend throughout Hollywood at the end of World War II. This is what brought some of these mindless SciFi images from the 1950s with all their shots of harmless lizards to appear like dinosaurs. The days of James Whale and Val Lewton, mentioning the two, were over as far as creating a real mood and atmosphere in this genre. Also keep in mind that the make-up genius, Jack Pierce, who actually did medical research to create all our favorites, was collectively fired right after this particular movie was released. As head of this department at the university he was soon hired by a smaller male makeup named Bud Westmore, who was soon Universal-International. Not to undermine Mr. Westmore's ability, but the horror movies just weren't his forte. OK, watch or watch. Watch this movie, but only as part of the chronological order of the Frankenstein series and see how it all ended up being a comic feed for Abbott & Costello.
