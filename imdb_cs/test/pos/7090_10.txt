Meryl Streep as Kate, a woman dying of cancer, performs her role admirably. No wonder she was an Oscar. The section proves that the care and care of housewives is as important as their nurses in the business world. And the lessons that teach about life expectations and their lack of fulfillment as the relationship grows is the most important thing they teach their daughter. We can expect too many of our friends. Be aware that there are many slips and forgiveness or understanding are the main components of a happy life. This is a pointless film and a sad ending, showing reconciliation between father and daughter. I'll give it ten.
