Love and war have happened on the other side of the Iron Curtain, and in view of it love was as strong as in the West, and war was often a little worse (should I say more realistic?). This film is about war and love as well as about the Soviet melting era K. It also reminds us that the best war films were not necessarily made in the 1990s with hemoglobin rivers and millions of dollars spent on special effects and in the actors market. This film is a classic of Soviet cinema. an excellent picture of one of the greatest human tragedies: war. <br /> <br />
