...this. What came to my mind was Loving Annabelle because she has the same kind of mature mood and differentiation from topic. We simply observe how the story unfolds without standing up or facing any "moral" questions (or of course we are, but they are not a spoon). Sure, there were a few difficult facts and decisions that could be made, but it just flows. Basically it was like any other love story, in any other life, with other sexes. I personally found girls who have good chemistry and talked to them about their night outs. The only thing I could pinpoint as a problem would be if it was a little ... preserved. He held back. It's not about sex scenes (or those who are missing), but since I felt the movie at his liveliest place when they were having fun, it's a bit different from the rest. Lowkey is good, but it just never happened like Loving Annabelle, nor did it touch me so much. <br /> <br /> That said, I highly recommend, it is by no means a waste of precious time, on the contrary ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
