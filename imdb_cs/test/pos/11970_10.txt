I can't believe people give bad reviews about this movie! I wonder why ...... maybe because the book ..... i have to admit that it doesn't really follow the book ... sure ... book dean koontz is much better .. but the movie is also good! it has tension ... acting is good ... especially michael ironside who gave excellent acting in this movie !!! <br /> <br /> Come One Guyz ... Give This Movie A Chance. ... they're much worse than this ... as the sum of all the fears ... the phantoms ... the da Vinci code ... these are some of the worse movies I've seen ... really boring when compared to observers who have really great elements in the movie ... this movie contains great tension and continuous action !!! I'm looking for this movie ... but it's really hard to find on DVD ... <br /> <br /> by the way ... I really recommended this movie to everyone ... watch it! !!! you will never regret it !!! <br /> <br /> 10/10 *
