No bullets, no secret agents, a story that is fun, fun and believable. He met some of the producers / actors in this movie in the theater. They seemed as interesting as their characters on the screen. You may not hear about this movie on TV with high dollar advertising spots, but it's definitely worth a look at this movie. I spent $ 8 on a movie ticket on many other movies that weren't fun. We look forward to future projects of this manufacturing company.
