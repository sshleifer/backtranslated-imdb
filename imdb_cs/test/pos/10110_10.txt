"The Story of Two Sisters" is a brilliant South Korean psychological horror movie that left me alone. The film offers some great moments of terrible horror and is extremely fearsome. The small cast of the actors is really excellent, with Im Soo-jung leading. Kim Ji-woon is well-done and cinematography is absolutely beautiful. The plot is slightly confusing, but some scenes are beautifully scary. the smallest, I was very curious and biased. The house where the film takes place looks incredibly menacing and isolated. "The Story of Two Sisters" is one of the most original Asian horror movies along with "Ring" and "Kairo". This work looks as soon as possible. My rating: 10 of 10.
