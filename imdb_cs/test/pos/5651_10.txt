This film is a knockout, The Plains Fires Talking About (End-of-Harvest Burning) A Happy Remembering of Tamura, Many times in the mind, and at the end of this dreary movie, a man dying of thirst believes he is home and the last illusion is all that remains. Billy Wilder's Big Carnival (Ace in the Hole) is the only film (it comes to mind) which is as bleak as this little masterpiece Kon Ichikawy. While I think the whole movie is brilliant Two scenes that come to mind are when a platoon of Japanese soldiers trying to escape (Crawling on the Belly) are ambushed by Americans and massacred, True Horror, And as an American soldier and pretty Filipino girl soldier she has a cigarette on the side of the road, smiles as she weaves with her esophagus, then her face turns into anger when she sees two Japanese soldiers trying to surrender, grabs a gun and kills them with joy, an American soldier attempts to stop her, But they have no chance, for me it talks about the amount of atrocities committed by the Japanese in the Philippines, all in a big movie if you have a stomach.
