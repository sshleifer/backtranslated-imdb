This is a brilliant, rich Czech film from the Sverak's father and son team, all two Czech pilots who flee to England to help the RAF in the Battle of Britain, but also drop out over a woman (beautiful Tara Fitzgerald). Does it contain some outstanding and incredibly realistic aerial combat scenes? Probably the best ever and much better than Pearl Harbor or even the Battle of Britain movie - and a number of interesting general topics like love, war, romance, camaraderie, loss and slavery. Also, attempts and trouble moving abroad and learning a foreign language (although it is easier here with a great devotee Anna Massey). The film has several big tiny motifs, such as the world famous RAF bullseye, shown through and at one point nicely reflected in a black vinyl record, spinning around sharply (music is another movie theme, of course). In addition, all traditional English life icons: beer bottle glasses (as opposed to post-war straight glasses used in Pearl Harbor), tea in a nice porcelain tea set in an English country garden (though shot in the Czech Republic?), Mascot dog, vintage bottle sauce HP, even darts! Of course, the airport and surrounding landscape is ridiculously unlike anywhere in the south of England, although the virtuoso airy sequences make up this, showing Eastbourne and seven sisters, always synonymous with South England and the Battle of Britain. The best of all is the sensational musical score of Ondřej Soukup, which is as good as anything from Hans Zimmer, all in the tradition of the late, excellent Ron Goodwin, who scored the original Battle of Britain among other classic English war films. Is there even a nice little portrait role for? zodob ?? famous Czech musician and actor (and Kevin Kline lookalike) Oldrich Kaiser, who plays the title song Dark Blue Sky on the piano. Great! He also has a few clumsy but funny little Freudian devices, such as the always inflated condom that floats above the ceiling when Charles (calm but brilliant Krystof Hadek) is trapped at the airport while his loves opponent and colleague František (Ondřej Vetchy) is with Susan. Another great English actor in this movie! Of course, Charles Dance is fine as Wing Commander Bentley. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend and worth watching / hiring ?? get a DVD with special features (things like how they created dog fights and stuff). Probably the only film that has ever combined headlines with English, German, French and Czech.
