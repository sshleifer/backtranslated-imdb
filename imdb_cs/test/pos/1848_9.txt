Yesterday I watched this movie with a 20-year-old from my office (OK - that was a quiet day after Thanksgiving) and we both liked it. I love the unique storyline of David Duchovny, David Allen Greer and the way the dog waits at the door. Isn't he a part of each of us just like the dog, when someone we love dies? I also like old people in the restaurant - they remind me of some older people around Southern New England where your ethnic group is a very important topic of discussion. And I love the wedding at the end. Minnie Driver is great in this movie - and Bonnie Hunt should win the award for everything. Bonnie - Do More Movies!
