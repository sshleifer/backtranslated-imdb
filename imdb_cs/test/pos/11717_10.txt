Best Burt Reynolds! Even better than Smokey and Bandit. This was probably the first real bloody cop of the 1980s thriller and added a perfect blend of humor, action, mystery and style that is missing in today's movies. Raised on PCP, $ 1000 and night calling girls, ninja killers and Burt Reynolds get their fingers sliced, one by one, with a butterfly knife. The film is based on William Diehl's novel, which was also written by PRIMAL FEAR, another of my favorite favorites. This film is worth watching as Henry Silva shot six times, fell through the window and thirty stories fell from the top of the high-rise Atlanta. This is probably the most beautiful piece in the history of Hollywood, performed by the legendary stuntman Dar Robinson. Stick presents another great gift Robinson bit. Robinson falls from an apartment building in Miami and unloads all six .44 magnum shots down the road. Very cool stuff. SHARKY'S MACHINE is my favorite police drama. I never understood why the film fell as it did. If Burt made more films, he would build a better reputation for himself. It turns out to be a talented director with Sharky, as well as a talented actor. Burta is supported by Brian Kieth, Charles Durning, Bernie Casey, Richard Libertini, Rachel Ward, and all the favorite evil guy Henry Silva. PLEASE this classic movie! Get Affleck and Samuela L. and some other hot actors and you have a great movie waiting to be filmed. I'll give him 9 out of 10
