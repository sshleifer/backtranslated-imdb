If there is one motive for this film, it is that people can cope with the difficulty of having a good imagination. This family is poor, their father works in a cemetery, and their mother works double shifts, and Peter is constantly picked up for various reasons, and becomes increasingly frustrated that he is often mistaken for a girl. He is just beginning to approach this age of 10 or 11 when your perception begins to change and he thinks your appearance is becoming important. The background to this story is the 1967 World's Fair and Centennial Canada. The greatest moments of the film come during various fantasy sequences, where we can see how they are coping. Watch flim, and if you've ever had a childhood friend you dreamed of, and then for some reason lost, you really like this movie. Perhaps this film likes children, but only adults really respect it, including references to the Bolsheviks and what a parent does for their children.
