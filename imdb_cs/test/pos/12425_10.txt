I first saw it on Demand. Or on TV. I'm not sure. But this must be my favorite movie of all time! This film has blood, gore, laughter and winter. I recently ordered "Monster Man" from Amazon and I've been watching "Monster Man" since I got it. Trust me, you'll love the movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. The DVD commentary is fun. They also said something about "Monster Man 2" during the commentary. Let's hope they do "Monster Man 2"! If you have a chance, rent a movie or buy it. You will absolutely love it! This is the best movie that was released in 2003. <br /> <br /> 10/10
