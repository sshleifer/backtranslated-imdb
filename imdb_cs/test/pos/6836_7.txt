This movie was a pleasant surprise for me. Honestly, the previews looked terrible until Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman appeared. So I rented it with a reservation, but I enjoyed this movie. It had a great performance, some good plot, and of course Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. Certainly worth a try.
