If you want a movie with a whole range of emotions, look NO further; dramatic and funny and scenes of exciting emotions; I can safely guarantee VERY little they will be able to see this warm and very human movie without shedding tears now and then. It's hard to believe the actions of both leaders; you would swear that two young men actually suffer from muscular dystrophy (Rory) and cerebral palsy (Michael); quite simply, two of the best performances I've seen; these are also two very credible characters, and you will never feel that things have been "thrown away" for dramatic purposes or that they are sympathetic. In the DVD release as "add-ons" they have "deleted scenes" (including an alternative ending) and "extended party sequence"; Why these clips weren't included in the final film is hard to understand because they are perfectly connected with the rest of the film and are by no means superfluous. But I can warmly recommend this film to anyone; one of the best I've ever seen.
