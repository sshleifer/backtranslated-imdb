I don't have a really solid job here, so I just threw some observation. First, the movie is absolutely gorgeous. It is a high-contrast black-and-white image, and some scenes are so well composed that they are almost intrusive. Some intense protests have a number of sequences, some of which were amazing - three boys who start tear gas at the protesters, etc. The biggest indication that this is a recent film looking back to the 1960s is that it is really about how the idealism of revolution has morphed and moved into something else. Accepting this shift is really interesting - I think that both the political phase of things and the artistic and more confident phases have strengths and weaknesses. The film does not necessarily take the view that things have fallen apart. Third, I think romance works very well. Finally, I really really hated the end. It was too melodramatic. You could even say that the end is not worthy of the film that preceded it.
