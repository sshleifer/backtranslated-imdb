Jamie Foxx has done an incredible job in Ray Charles's game. I loved this movie because every so often there would be a flashback scene and then on the current movie. When Ray Charles was small, he was blind and his mother had no child. She was a strong woman who had nothing else with him because he was blind. She made him do things on his own, and that really made him later become a great musician in life. His mother also sent him to school. Then when Ray Charles became a man, he could stand up for himself and take care of himself, but there was a fall in narcotics, sex and betrayal. If someone discourages me from thinking about this film, it will inspire me.
