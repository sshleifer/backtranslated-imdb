A very credible and disturbing film depicting the consequences of war on the general public, Shame gives us a chilling understanding of Ingmar Bergman's faith. The absence of color and sound (as in the soundtrack) helps the film to provide a more realistic feel. There is no soft or hard lighting or different camera angles to give the story a charming or dramatic effect. Everything is very simply rendered as it would be in reality. Occasionally the story was confusing, but maybe to give a sense of 'mind mind' characters? as they now know what is happening or why. The simplicity of the film bored her somewhat, but I understood how the director was trying to charm the story and the points. He depicted the cruel and disturbing events and effects of the war. Initially, the characters were introduced and shown as content with lighter settings and very long stretched shots. When war suddenly hit them, they were much darker and quieter with less intimate shots. Bergman did a good job of allowing us to be consumed by the war and imagining the form that corresponded to the war. Although the story itself was not very impressive, the content of the film was.
