I've seen this movie many years ago and I've never left my list of the best movies ever. When I first watched him, I started what became a lifelong passion for justice. It gave an interesting look at the death penalty and also gave me a few things to think about. <br /> <br /> When you have such a cast, you're right when you assume it's nothing less than wonderful. This is by far the best role I've ever seen playing Sean Penn (along with I'm Sam). He nails roles, not glamourize his actions while doing so. He managed to keep the film level, which in my opinion is very important. Until the very end, he's not trying to be seen as anything more than what he is. He's a sick man who regrets his past, but still apologizes. Eventually, he is able to redeem his sense of self-esteem, just as a convicted (and guilty) murderer can help Susan Sarandon, Helena Prejean's sister. Her character taught me about good will towards others without forgetting how terrible the actions of a man can be and without apologizing for them. <br /> <br /> The support cast was also top-notch. I was surprised to see a little portrait of Jack Black in this movie, which became a witty man who became today! I loved this movie for personal reasons and just because it was a film art work. And in my opinion, this is one of the few exceptions when the film went far.
