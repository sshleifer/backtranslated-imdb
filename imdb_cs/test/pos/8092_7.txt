That was Chaplin's first interview, and the results are mixed. The film is a biting satire of Hitler and Mussolini, their followers and their fanatical way of life, especially when it comes to persecuting Jews. It was bold and forward for 1940 and it had to be done by a lot of people. The sweet, humorous style of his silence, in my opinion, is much better than his first talkie. There are lots of nonsensical pieces that go on. If it were quiet, it probably wouldn't happen. One of the most fun moments is that it is a music hairdressing moment and world dance. One of the most touching moments is, of course, the end. The Great Dictator is an effective and sometimes moving film that is a very large part of Chaplin's history and film history. It's wrong, but Chaplin is in great shape.
