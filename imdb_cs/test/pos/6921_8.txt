Tell me what it was. Dylan Moran is just the funniest actor on screen (and on stage) and with Micheal Caine, because your partner isn't even bad, they're both great at watching a really funny movie. true, not all gags are leaving, but it is worth keeping for those who do it, but they will find out that they are wearing Micheal Caine in the dress (all pay is worth it) and every time Dylan Moran is on screen as a Bernard movie of blacks. the story is two actors (Moran and Caine), who decide to steal money from a group of gangsters by getting out of different personalities to deceive them all, but it is another matter to get rid of them. Basically "Actors" is a great British comedy that has been somehow missed by many, seriously, if your Moran fan (or want to see Micheal Caine in the dress) is sure to see it
