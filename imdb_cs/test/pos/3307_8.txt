You can't take this film seriously ... ... the story is predictable and banal, often out of bounds, dialogue laughs; but it all adds up to great fun! Three "career girls" in the late fifties found their way into the big city, and their mothers' evil and temptation probably warned them: married men, alcohol, premarital sex, abortion, etc. <br /> <br /> Then there is Amanda Farrell (Joan Crawford) who succeeded professionally but whose personal life was sacrificed for an office with his name on the door. This movie can be believable 50 years ago, but now it's just great fun! Rent / Buy and Enjoy.
