This movie was much better than I expected. ++++ Jean Peters actually does a passable job like a pirate and does a decent job of fighting a sword. (To the extent that he can have a double action, it's hard to say ... but Peters seems to be doing well and doing it well.) ++++ With a good and serious scenario, it could have been an excellent movie. But it's basically cheesy. Still fun. Not until the regular Jacques Tournier movie, but definitely over the regular film Jean Peters. The color is typical for this 50s time period, ie too realistic. The actors for Blackbeard and her first friend and drunk doctor were good. Louis Jordan was a little weak. I don't think Debra Paget was right either. Certainly, Jean Peters and Debra Paget were probably the two best-looking female stars in the 1950s.
