I totally adore this film about a columnist lady (Barbara Stanwyck) for a major home magazine that brings a monthly welcome article that includes details of her amazing life at home as wife and mother in the beautiful home of Connecticut. The problem happens when the owner of a monthly publication requires her to be a WW2 guest and hero during the Christmas holidays. Why are they afraid? Because he lives in a small apartment in New York, he is not married and does not have a baby - and cannot cook at all! Glee (and romance) follows when trying to put on a believable act in an effort to save the face / keep from being burned by the magazine owner (played by Sydney Greenstreet). This is a wonderful comedy; the one I highly recommend to lovers of classic film !!!!
