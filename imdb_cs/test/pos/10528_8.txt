I saw this TV version of the mysterious story of Christie when he appeared on Channel 5 in New York in 1980. At that time I was surprised that it wasn't shown on Channel 13, in a public television station that showed most of the Masterpiece Theater programs, but (Except some Dorothy Sayers "Lord Peter Wimsey" stores, and MOONSTONE) BBC Productions rarely engaged in British detective stories. Another series, RIVALS SHERLOCK HOLMES, has dealt with the stories of Victorian and Edwardian times, so the charm of the period contributed to acquiring these stories on channel 13. <br /> <br /> TRUST ASK EVANS? he dealt with a young couple who stumbled over a dying man who is only the last word of the story title (the novel was originally named WHY DO NOT THE EVANS EXCEED? but then the BOOMERANG CLUE was returned). The young couple starts investigating the murder and investigates the crime of a group of people surrounding the dubious physician (Eric Porter). Despite the warning of the hero's father (John Gielgud), the hero (James Warwick) and the heroine (Francesca Annis) continue their investigation - even if it is uglier and more dangerous. The death of another suspect by suicide increases the apparent dangers because the murderer starts looking into silencing two amateur detectives. It's not a bad movie, although I agree it was a little too long for one night of fun (if it was done like the later Miss Marple episodes with Joan Hickson, or Hercule Poirot episodes, in two parts it it would have been better). But it has its strengths. One of them is the proper use of Porter as the main suspect and a smarter scene in the movie, where he seems to be spying on a young couple who is exploring the mystery. If you stick to the movie, you'll be in a real surprise later. <br /> <br /> But it has one failure. When it comes to Christie's novel, the characters in the story must be in a strict movement schedule so that the reader can find out what the secret of the plot is. All I can add is that if you hear a dialogue in one place and how the little boy was almost killed (but not), then you will find all the parts of the story that come together and what was the villain's motivation. Br /> <br /> Aside from the lengthy time he calls to tell it, this is a pretty good movie and is worthy of one of Christie's best programs based on the story of a sudden renaissance in films based on her novels.
