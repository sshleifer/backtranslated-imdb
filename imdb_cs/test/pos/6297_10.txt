From the opening image of the bank's conveyor belt, you could say it's a great movie. The touch-sensitive, minimalist feel of the retro-style film radiates style - a great camera - the work, play, script, and way in which the protagonist's secret life unfolds, in that they may make the best Italian movie I've ever seen (there with La Stanza Del Figlio - albeit differently). Shame on people who were sitting behind me and it was obvious they didn't see the importance of slow but painfully beautiful scenes carefully crafted by the camera. Do not miss.
