When I saw it, it's hard for me to believe that it's not better known. This and a little known, but almost equally shamefully neglected COME A SEE (Klimov, 1986) must be two of the greatest war films. They are meaningful, powerful, penetrating. The ASCENT is also gifted with a limited but brilliantly trenchant Schnittke score.
