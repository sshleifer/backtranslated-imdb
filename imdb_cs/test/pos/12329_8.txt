I have amazing memories of this movie ... <br /> <br /> I was only 12 when I was released and it scared me. I really miss my bejesus ... <br /> <br /> Zombies, cemeteries, mausoleum, how can you go wrong? It's like retarded cousin Phantasm. This film was released one year before the introduction of PG-13. Submitting that One Dark Night is a GORIEST PG movie (not the scariest, mind you) ever released. Can anyone come up with a gorier pick? <br /> <br /> (FYI: I don't consider Poltergeist a gorier), but not a gorier ...)
