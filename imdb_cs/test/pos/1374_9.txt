This is my second day from the Creators on DVD. I saw it advertised in a free magazine, while the family stopped at the hotel, never heard of it. After reading it, it was shot on Balmedie Beach, which I had to buy. I used to put kids into dunes in the movie all the time while they live in Aberdeen. 1. off Im not a big Sci-Fi fan (Star Wars extraction) I was really just wanted to see what they did with this movie site, I was currently surprised. This will not become a standard Sci-Fi, more like a mix of science fiction and horror survival. If he had a good story that was different, great budgeting effects were made with Â£ 8000. Acting was better than average for a low budget movie. The way they set off the whole coast to feel like the dry desert planet they were on was nice. The guns in the movie were realistic and the animals were as cool as a predator in invisibe mode. All in all, I will buy these future versions from these guys, maybe another horror (Hint Hint). DVD accessories were very informative, giving background to producers, I would like to see some of them that are included as add-ons on the next DVD. <br /> <br /> Excellent work.
