He did one for Christmas to try to bring back the number one song, and now the amazing Justin Lee Collins wanted to put up the cast of members and maybe some crew of one of his favorite TV shows as a child, the A-Team team. The only member he couldn't get was the last big George Peppard, who played the main character Col. John "Hannibal" Smith, but got some sort of psyche to try and help. He managed to meet all members, including Dirk Benedict (Lt Templeton "Faceman" Peck # 2), who went to Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, Dwight Schultz (HM "Howling Mad" Murdock), Melinda Culea (Amy Amanda Allen) , William Lucking (Col. Lynch) and Lance LeGault (Col. Roderick Decker, the only team member to die). He spoke to Mr. T (Sgt. Bosco "B.A." Baracus) in the expected interview, but he was inaccessible to turn to the meeting. It was really fun to watch them try to find them and talk to them, though they probably don't want to, and of course it's a great peak. Very good!
