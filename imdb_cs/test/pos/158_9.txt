Thirsty <br /> <br /> I found that this movie was beautifully created. The film was high above excellent. Although almost every frame could be frozen, and you would make a great photo. Color usage excels most. In many cases, the camera slid down the scene and the work was flawless. <br /> <br /> Chan Wook Park was fantastic. He let me trust in the universe, which was brought to himself. There were several touches of verbal and visual humor (dark nature) that only added further depth to the image as a whole. Acting that I wouldn't call excellent but it suited the film and worked well enough. For me, the only place where this movie was missing was in the story. Sometimes I will not lie, the storyline between the characters made no sense. Sometimes the story was clumsy. Overall, I was disappointed by the subdued narration and felt that it had been running for a long time. But I still recommend this film for his vision, his flourishing visual, dark humor, and an interesting film at the end of the day, even if it's imperfect. 9/10
