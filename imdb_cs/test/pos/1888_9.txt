I saw it last night and I laughed loudly at the other half of the movie. The whole audience was. Bruce Campbell made a damn funny movie! I don't want to give up, but when the film turns and gets into a shock, it gets really miserable. Just one fun scene after another. Mr. Campbell's hats and the crew to pull on such a small budget. Bruce was there to introduce the film and make Q and A, which was a gift. Many of the questions people asked were rather lame, but Bruce would turn to them and be sarcastic. Was great! The film loved. I'm looking forward to seeing it on DVD at the end of this year. B be sure to check out the Sci-Fi Channel this fall. I highly recommend this.
