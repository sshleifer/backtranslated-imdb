Used submarine is NOT Varangian! "It" was actually two ships, the P614 and the P615, both built for Vickers Armstorng Turkey at Barrow-in-Furness, but throughout the war they held the Royal Navy. The P615 was sunk but the P614 was finally delivered in 1945. The confusion was undoubtedly created because someone looked up P61 (as I did) and found Varangian! When in fact, the last digit of both the P614 and P615 was actually just painted out .... <br /> <br /> There are some very realistic moments in the movie. These Turkish ships were very similar to S-class. As no S-class submarines survive, shots of them (like P61) and depot ship "Forth" form part of an interesting record now, as well as an excellent movie.
