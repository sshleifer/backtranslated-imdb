Lately, I got into the Hitchcock series. I'm always there when I'm on Blockbuster or Hollywood Video. As I said earlier, Hollywood is incredibly losing touch, I needed a reminder that there are amazing movies. Not to mention, I want to be a film expert, not a movie enthusiast. Is there any better way to do this than with Alfred Hitchcock's films? The man who knew too much is another great and exciting thriller starring Alfredo's favorite man, James Stuart, and the woman who steals Dorris Day. They play a husband and wife who go on vacation with their son, but when he spies James some information that could arrest another spy, his son is kidnapped and held for ransom. James seems to doubt Dorris and her ability to get her son back, but she makes a great comeback and just about to end up being a movie hero. she said that Dorris was the one that overcame the entire cast. James did a great job, keeping up, together these two made you sit down and never sway throughout the movie. I loved a little comedy at the end that Alfred added. You'll see what I mean. I would always recommend this movie, even though it's not the best Hitchcock movie, it's still a treasure. 9/10
