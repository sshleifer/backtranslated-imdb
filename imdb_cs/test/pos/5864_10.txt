I remember this film as the second person to comment on it. I noticed it, but I wish I had it now just because it had to be one of the worst movies ever. Funny, in a real bad way. I remember the mark on the box was "Final Frontal Lobotomy". I got it from my mom who got it from a friend at work who said it was the worst / holiest movie she ever saw, so my mom said, "My son will probably love it." and the woman gave her just to get her out of her possession. Later I taped it, which I'm sorry. Also, I remember that the "corck screw" thing was one of those things that caught the ball ... a yellow cone in the shape of a thing, with a red "button" at the end, and when it hit the red thing, it sends the ball flying. They used it with a crank at one end and a corkscrew in the funnel. When he killed the killer, they showed him that he was coming forward with a "gun" and then slicing himself into what seemed to be raw chicken and false blood on the victim's head. I don't know what else to say about this "gem", except that if you like bad movies, it's not worse than this.
