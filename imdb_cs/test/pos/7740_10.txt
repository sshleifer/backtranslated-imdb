I have often heard that people are disappointed that the Masurian "Tempest" has nothing to do with Shakespeare's original. In my opinion, this is both true and false, but above all it is a bad starting point for offering critics. A work of art should never be criticized for what it is not, but for what it is. "Tempest" is nothing like a faithful representation of the game, but in my opinion it is true to Shakespeare's work in spirit. Thus, "Tempest" is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time. No, not experimental, as in a hand-held camera, and mumbled the dialogue, but experimental, as in exploring the tangle of the story without undue respect for the cash receipts. The Masurian Tempest is epic, sad, realistic, joyful, full of life, but above all it is imaginative. Cassavetes' portrayal of Philip / Prosper is in itself a valuation of 10/10 and when you add Gena Rowlands, Susan Sarandon, the beautifully deep Molly Ringwald, Raul Julia, dialogue, music, and the beautifully suggestive little tableau scattered throughout the picture ... I rest my case. One of the best films of the 80s. Don't miss it.
