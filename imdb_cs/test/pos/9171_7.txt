In the past century, there have been many advances in gender equality, but not so much in the world of movies. I'm not talking about what's going on behind the camera, I mean audience taste. The idea of ​​"flicking" is alive and well today, while there are still a lot of action and horror movies that appeal to men in particular. Sure, there are men and women who like movies that do not fall into their typical demographic, but there are not many movies that have appealed overboard. Hitch, the last Will Smith car tries to change this trend by being a chick throwing in a male perspective. Smith's stars in Hitch as the title character, Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, "date doctor", who trains men on how to approach a woman and have a successful date. Hitch enjoys his work and loves to see a man successfully meet his goals to go out with his dream woman, but because of bad experiences in college, Hitch himself is somewhat shocked at the idea of ​​love. As the story unfolds, the film presents two seemingly separate storylines. The Last Hitch Case is Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), an accountant who is very attracted to one of his clients, the beautiful heiress of Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). Hitch has his doubts about Albert's chances, but if his clients desire to be honest, Hitch supports them. Meanwhile, Hitch meets with the rough columnist Sara Melas (Eva Mendes) and is immediately attracted to this strong personality. woman. However, the doctor cannot seem to follow his own advice in pursuit of Sara. Things become even more complicated when Sarah's work leads her to investigate the relationship between accountant and heiress. Will Hitch be able to balance his private life and work? More importantly, can Hitch again believe in love? If you are a true movie fan, then there is at least one time in your life when you complained about the redundancy of the Hollywood film factory and shouted for something new and original. Well, Hitch isn't the movie. However, most movie fans also admit that sometimes a formal film can only work at entertainment level. Hitch qualifies as the movie.
