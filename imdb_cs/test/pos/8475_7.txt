Recent years have seen many biopics of famous singers, and "Ray", the story of Ray Charles, has much in common with "Walking Line" which was made the following year and narrated the story of Johnny Casha. Cash and Charles were almost precise contemporaries, both born in the early 1930s and dying in 2003/04. They both grew up in poverty in the American deep south. They both lost their brother in a childhood accident. Both achieved success in the 1950s. They both had problems in marriage and both were drug addicts. All these issues are highlighted in both films. There are also similarities to Ron Howard's "A Beautiful Mind". Though the film was more about a mathematician than about a musician, just as both "Ray" and "Walk the Line" emphasized the role of her subject's wife in helping her husband overcome his problems. Ray Charles was born to a mother in a poor black community in Georgia in 1930. (His original name was Raymond Charles Robinson, but when he started his career as a musician, he dropped his surname to avoid confusion with a boxer Sugar Ray Robinson). In some ways, Charles had a harder time than Cash, he had to cope with two other disadvantages in the form of his blindness and racism that hit all black Americans, especially in the south, during his life. Charles had a particularly traumatic childhood and witnessed the death of his younger brother, George, in a drowned accident and blind or blinded a year or two later. He seems to have been haunted by nightmares and guilt over George's death for life. The first half of the film is rather slow and it's a standard rag-to-wealth biopic showbiz, narrative The story of how young Charles learns to play the piano becomes a nightclub performer and then rises to fame as the main artist who fell in love with the beautiful Dellou Bea. The best scenes in this part of the movie are flashbacks for childhood. There is an effective repetitive image of colored glass bottles hanging from a tree in front of his house; perhaps it was one of the few visual memories of his life before he blinded himself. There is also an unforgettable scene in which teenaged Charles shames a busy bus driver to let him on the bus by pretending to have lost his sight on Omaha Beach (in fact he would only be thirteen at the time of Normandy landing). The second half of the film becomes more interesting as it moves into a more controversial territory, focused on Charles's drug addiction, marriage problems caused by his affair with Margie Hendricks, one of his singers, and his battles against racism. In the early 1960s Charles caused a feeling by refusing to play in front of a racially segregated audience in Georgia (though, unlike what is featured in the film, this did not result in his being banned in securing the state). He also fought against racial differences within the music industry itself, performing not only traditionally "black" styles of music such as gospel and rhythm and blues, but also traditionally "white" ones such as country and western (regarded by many black Americans as the music of the redneck community choice) ). As Peter Bradshaw, film critic "The Guardian", remarked "Ray" is a sunny film that turns diplomatically away from the darker side of things. It omits any mention of such issues as the death of Charles's beloved mother Aretha during his teenage years, his short marriage to Eileen Williams in the early 1950s and his eventual divorce from Dell Bea in 1977. It also lowers the range of his effeminate and count his illegitimate children. There are similarities here with "beautiful mind" which also omitted a number of controversial details about his personal life, including divorce. Ray Charles fans will undoubtedly enjoy a movie for music, but it's also worth looking at those who don't know much about it, especially because of Jamie Foxx's Oscar-winning performance in the title role, which reproduces Charles's mannerisms so precisely that we think we are actually watching a blind man, even though Foxx himself is seen. (Unlike Joaquin Phoenix in "Walk the Line," but Foxx didn't make his own singing - his voice was too hard to reproduce Charles's distinctive singing). He receives good support from some other performers, especially Sharon Warren as Aretha and Kerry Washington as Della Bea. The film is uneven and elongated, yet rewarding. 7/10
