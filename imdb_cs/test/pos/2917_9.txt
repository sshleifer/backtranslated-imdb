After reading all the notes on this movie, I am still amazed by Fox's unwillingness to release a full screen of the restored version on DVD. Yes, history can be a bit inaccurate and certainly not as powerful as a book, but it was Fox's second film made in Real Cinemascope and the very merits of the merits of recovery and distribution. I saw this second class movie and launched my lifelong interest in all the Egyptian things that culminated in my visit to Egypt 4 years ago! The amazing power of film on child imagination, huh? In high school, I read the book and promised myself that one day I would take the dream trip. Now, this film was made in the "old school" style, meaning that the Egyptians were depicted in pink and blue-eyed British. However, has anyone seen the current HBO series "ROME"? Everything old is olde again. We cannot imagine why we are still casting actors nowadays who argue in the Roman turn as Mayfair aristocrats. Neither actor in Rome could go through ancient Italian. As already mentioned, the AMARNA period in Egypt is still one of the most fascinating events in human history. This film is extremely appealing (borrowing a word from NEFER) for its historical information (BEER! BRAIN SURGERY! IRON!) And its wonderful cinematography and score. I have a terrible version from Taiwan that I pray over and over again that one day a really renewed wide-screen version will be available. For all those interested in this subject, I highly recommend the historic novel "God Against the Gods" by Advance and Consent. If any of you movie enthusiasts knows how to contact Fox to force them, please let me know!
