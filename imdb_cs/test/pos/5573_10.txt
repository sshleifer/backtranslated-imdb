Not since J. Michael Straczynski's Babylon 5, has a television show captured the wonderful art of using the arc of story on a television show. This is the best thing on TV! The characters are nice and you can easily join them and take care of their well-being. Villians are the type you love to hate and let you wonder what they are up to next. Brian Hensen's puppet work is most innovative. Kudos Rockne S. O'Bannon for a job well done!
