I cannot comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I liked it. If God exists, the soundtrack will be released, the work of Ilona Sekacz is truly persistent. After twenty years, I am still driven by the haunting themes of this production and I often come back to it. The story surrounds Catherine Moreland's entry into society. Catherine somewhat awkward and obsessed with the unhealthy interest in Gothic stories (early fiction?) Catherine descends to Bath in the Allen company where she meets Henry Tilney. She is invited to visit Tilneys at the Abbey of Northanger, the seat of the imposing (and somewhat financially challenged) General Tilney, who has an unfortunate misconception that there is wealth on foot. Where mutual attraction mixes with family finance, the dispute is inevitable. Along with the lively imagination of Catherines, it leads her to worry about her safety. Her possible leaving is marked by allegations and accusations of fraud and mutilation. However, the attraction between Catherine and Henry is worth the effort. He'll come back to give a happy ending. This final scene is particularly persuasive, given Ilona Sekacz's random music. It may be "bad" production from a purist point of view, gaudy costumes, and shaky performances that can't resist, but for me it's 88 minutes of bliss.
