I was happiest this year when I saw several films in my university art museum. Occasionally, well, over half the time, I can't watch movies there. I systematically tried to see all the movies I missed. So far Plagues and pleasures on the Salton Sea and who killed the electric car? these are other movies that I had to watch like this. The film covers an interesting subject and is well theoretical (emphasis on it later), but not as successful as Plagues and Pleasures, but far better than Electric Car. Film work deals with the future of the American concept of suburban housing. It questions the feasibility of such a practice where oil prices are rising. Thus, the film deals with the origins of the suburbs and its development until the early 1920s. One of the topics that has been discussed over a long period of time is the alienation of the suburbs it creates among its inhabitants. While several people can live together, they do not recognize each other when we define a word. For me, this represents the power of film: its appeal to real human emotions. We can understand the creators' arguments so much easier because they may not convince us of the legitimacy of their arguments. This is also one of the reasons why the Salton Sea is such a wonderful documentary. Unfortunately, Suburbia loses its message in FireBrand's explanation in support of its central argument. As those we talked to speak, their arguments are gradually more similar to those of militant environmentalists. It is said that oil production will hit its peak this decade, but will not receive any scientific evidence to support this claim (expert reports, statistics, graphs, etc.). We're getting little information about how this date was calculated. Fortunately, it was the only significant mistake I could find in the film's argument, yet it was glaring. Another less significant contradiction I noticed was the liberal (political) bias that could polarize some viewers. This prejudice, however, reveals in-depth clips of various events and not the filmmakers themselves. Clips, especially those from the 1950s, seemed unnecessary. The film was no better with their presence and would be more concise in their absence. As I remembered this movie before creating this review, I was thinking about why I found out that his argument was more convincing than the other documents I saw recently. Finally, I realized that the filmmakers really offered an analysis of the suburban problem. They propose a decentralized village system in which people's pockets live together. They represent that this practice would reduce the need for fossil fuels and reduce space waste. They define unnecessary space, such as long stretches of parking areas between shopping areas. What is incredible about this assumption is that it is really possible. Most of the documentary films vaguely state that a problem should be ended, but no method offered. I was thinking more about the movie and decided that this analysis was what saved the movie and why I gave it a good review. The End of Suburbia, which is neither perfectly convincing nor fluid in presentation, is a valuable investment of its time. It deals not only with the current problem of sprawl but also with a realistic view of its change. Viewers can also enjoy high production value with various 1950s clips associated with modern arguers. People living in Atlanta, Georgia, or in the North Carolina Triad region will enjoy this document because it is most widely used.
