The man is accused of having killed his friend in a fire of an aircraft power plant and has to travel through the police to avoid the police and discover the true sinister nature of the situation. A plot line that was later used to propel Hitchcock's classic north-west, Saboteur benefits from some very good performances, as well as several master voltage sequences from Master himself. <br /> <br /> For all Hitchcock fans, the plot is a little too familiar, but it has always been able to release the story with its own memorable characters and charadas. Here, the sympathetic and charming Robert Cummings is a leader and will soon be visiting many strange and unpredictable characters, not resisting a group of circus artists, a wealthy hidden motive trader, and a blind loner who shows him the best way to judge someone. <br /> <br /> In terms of absolute originality and quality, it is lacking in some areas, especially antagonist motifs. But there is some nice chemistry between Cummings and his main lady, which is an underestimation of Priscilla Lane, as well as a truly moving performance as blind Vaughn Glaser. The best part is the final sequence, which perfectly reflects what Hitchcock would use later in the North Northwest, this time the peak on top of the statue in New York. Certainly not his best, but Master of Forgiveness gives us some great moments to wait.
