While cartoons and / or links to the entertainment industry people or things or even brand products is usually the basis in shorts like this, they are not used in quantity here. Most individual gags are rather general. As I will give examples, there will be spoilers: <br /> <br /> There are only three (four technically good - one quick at the end of the cartoon) cartoons I have noticed, which is so low for this type of short types although one is a character that has sufficient activity. They are Jack Benny (like Jack Bunny), Leopold Stowkowski and the inimitable Ned Sparks (as a crab on chances are very good, if a crab took part in Warner Brothers in the 1930s and 1940s, Ned Sparks used the cartoon). There are also references to Billy Rose's Aquacade and riff on the radio show character called "Henry Aldrich" (Coming, Mother!), The Superman Game (Superguy Here) and the villain's takeoff on "King Kong". That's it for this kind of grafts. The products themselves are mostly generic and gags are more of a basic item in unusual situations, such as turtles that come out of cans of soup to attack bad guys like tanks. , tomato soup cans make a "can", gingerbread men who turn into paratroopers, using tissues for parachutes and so on. Gags are very good and it's an excellent example of Bob Clampett's cartoon. The director of this point, and when it's not anywhere near his best job, it's nothing to sneeze on both. These shorts can be found at Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume 3, which is an excellent set that I highly recommend. is also recommended.
