Funny ... a lot of good twists and turns! (and we weren't even roasts!) <br /> <br /> I didn't know that this movie was still there until he was watching other Monty Python trailers ... (strangely it was with City of Lost Children, and The Adventures of Baron Munchauhsen) \ t Acting was amazing ... Hank Azaria again shows her talent, Bill Bob is Billy Bob ... (wecis?) It's definitely worth watching.
