I usually avoid film festivals and I don't like the slap-stick comedy, but I have to say that this picture was great. I immediately met David Krumholtz from the TV show "Numbers" and Lorraine Bracco, Roseanne Arquette and Karen Black were at their usual best. This is an incredibly high-level comedy with visual, spoken and satirical interludes that kept the audience and me laughing at a somewhat deep-rooted plot. Kudos to Mr. Parness for dealing with a subtle but real, subordinate in a way that can be used, but fully absorbed by his audience at every level of intellect. The graph remains intact throughout the film, and the comedic relief adds to the message without being placed so strongly as to disrupt it. Mixing segway is done beautifully and the overall product is beautifully tasteful. I can definitely say that this film is the one that will go a long way and should be seen by viewers of all ages; This problem is real, and so is the strong impact of this production.
