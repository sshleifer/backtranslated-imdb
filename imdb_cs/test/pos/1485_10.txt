The 1990s was a great decade for a British sitcom with many popular creations such as ONE FOOT IN GRAVE, ABSOLUTE FABOULOUS THIN BLUE LINE. However, MR. BEAN's, hands down, the biggest sitcom of the 90's. <br /> <br /> MR. BEAN is the first major attempt to return to the era of silent greats like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton for several decades. Bringing one character to the audience - Mr. Bean - Rowan Atkinson played to perfection. Many people who commented on this site, as well as the message boards on this and other websites, are discussing whether Mr Bean has a mental disability or a serious learning disability resulting from such disability. . However, I think that this debate is unnecessary, because I very much doubt that the creators of this show expected someone in the audience to consider Mr Bean in such a context for one moment. Mr. Bean is shown to be a character who seems to have very few friends, rarely speaks and decides to solve problems himself without leadership from others. Some of his methods of approaching everyday tasks, such as preparing lunch or visiting a dentist, are bizarre for anyone looking at the show. Humor comes from here. Mr. Bean is not necessarily someone with intellectual disabilities, he can only be an eccentric person used to dealing with things in his own way. And of course some of his methods to complete one task often result in a catastrophe that we see when Mr. Bean tries to solve it. Sometimes we see that Mr. Bean shows an average or tiny stripe, often trying to compete with those around him or play pranks on those who least expect it. At the end of the day, however, no one is harmed and the results are always reassuring. Unlike most examples of British comedy over the past 30 years, MR. BEAN is a simple, harmless, harmless U-rating fun for everyone in the family to enjoy. For this reason, the TV series has become a big hit in dozens of countries around the world. That is why it will still be remembered in a few decades from now, when a lot of other TV shows will have come, gone and forgotten. Some critics claim that the show only appeals to children, but I just laugh just like Mr Bean when I first saw episodes as a child in the 1990s. Rowan Atkinson took advantage of his natural ability to create effective visual gags that seem just as fun on repeated tours as they did for the first time. The TV series results in two spin films, BEAN and PAN. BEAN'S HOLIDAY. As is known with the type of humor in the TV series one would expect, it does not translate success on the big screen. The two movies do little justice to the TV series and can't really capture the episode magic. The biggest failure in both movies is likely to change settings. In both films, producers take Mr. Bean out of his normal British environment to America (the first film) and France (the second film). As a result, the characters of the film around Mr. Bean react differently to his behavior than their television series counterparts. Both films re-use gags from the television series, and evidence shows that gags were made right the first time. In the second film, Mr. Bean is shown to be acting out-of-character with some aspects of his personality exaggerated to the point where some gags seem stupid rather than funny. At different times I thought the character I was watching was not Mr. Bean, but a pale cartoon. It is clear that Rowan Atkinson did not feel as good as in the TV series. His heart just wasn't in the show. After the second film came out, he publicly stated that he would not play Mr. Bean again. I realize how he felt. Returning to the TV series, each episode shows evidence of careful planning in terms of writing and performing in each individual scene. Even the weakest episode is still very fun and good before both movies. <br /> <br /> My favorite episodes are the first three - they set a high standard to continue. I consider the final episode to be the weakest, yet cheerful. <br /> <br /> Summary: MR. BEAN is a really great sitcom for the whole family. Rowan Atkinson is a true comic genius and the evidence is in 14 episodes of this TV series. My recommendations - watch and enjoy. But you will only see movies when you consider the TV series to be a tough fan.
