At first I thought this movie would bother me. It was like I saw this movie somewhere before. A disillusioned hero, a father figure and a nine-year-old sister who is older and wiser than her years (see Gregory's girl), but then no 15 minutes, it became a laugh out loud, a comic book gem of the film. Dylan Moran (who thought he would want to throw me away) was excellent. Like Mr. Gambon and the mad Scottish hitman. Lena Headey was very sexy. After half the film, I tried to remember where I had seen it before. Release Officer. She has the most amazing smile. But the real hero of this film is Mr. Caine. This man should do a lot more comedy. It ranks among some of his best comedy roles (Without Leash, Dirty Rotten Scoundrely). It's a pleasure to watch in all his scenes, but mainly at the end. No one can quite tell how Michael can. <br /> <br />
