I've never been so surprised by a movie that was old. Only the "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" handles it well. As someone who saw heroin addiction first hand, I was shocked at how realistic this film was. His performance is absolutely uncompromising, realistic and heartbreaking. The direction of Otto Preminger is ideal for film, with long shots and a very mobile camera. The performance of Kim Nov√°k is good, as is Eleanor Parker. In fact, the entire supportive cast works very well, with undervalued performances to throw the style of this film. Documentary style is part of what keeps this film up to date. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8.0 z 10
