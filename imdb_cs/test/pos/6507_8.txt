Skipping Jazzy Jeff, the creator of the chirp and the transformer scratch, raised a few eyebrows, but it's good to see that he eventually got into a DVD combo. Doug Pray, who had previously recorded the grunge phenomenon of the 90s in HYPE (1996), with SCRATCH, made an excellent documentary about the world of hip hop DJ and the development of turntablism. His latest documentary INFAMY (2005) explores contemporary American graffiti culture. After a few guided tours four years ago, my DVD has been collecting dust since then, but I have watched it recently and, in addition to this material, I was surprised to see how this documentary is filmed and edited. Extremely enjoyable soundtrack and not just talking heads, but lots of music, old school shots, party, break dance, you name it. One of the best things about the film is that it explores first of all where the art of turnover is today (in 2001 it is), without, of course, ignoring the pioneers. Good things. <br /> <br /> Obscura Camera --- 8/10
