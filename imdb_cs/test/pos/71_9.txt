I've always loved this movie. Music, story and action. I especially love opening and closing the movie. Music has stayed with me for years. World War I battle battles were great and comedy is typical of Blake Edwards. After all, Slaptick is his strength. Julie singing is amazing and keeps me on screen. The sets and scenes are beautiful. The characters are attractive. I loved the scene with wounded soldiers and Julia's singing. I wish she would sing to me in Vietnam. I also enjoyed old cars from the period and the music of WWI. I was glad when the DVD came. Now I can whistle in the dark and watch it over and over again.
