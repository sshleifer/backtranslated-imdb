I remember seeing this movie when I was 13 and fell in love with it and I was a big fan of the movie and the characters I loved. My favorite character was Stacey (Heidi Holicker) because she made me laugh when she wasn't interested in Fred (Cameron Dye) who really liked her and hoping to get together, then her boring friend Ralphie (Christopher Murray) because he ignored her and hung with his friends. I love cast and story. I always like the part when Fred tries to get in with Stacey, and I always remember when he was chasing her around the car. But it was so good. I'll always remember that in my teenage years. Now that I was 33, I picked up my copy on DVD and look forward to it.
