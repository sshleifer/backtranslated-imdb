Christopher Nolan's directorial debut is unforgettable. The film was very well received and helped the Land Memento contracts and quite rightly. <br /> <br /> Here's an excellent example of how films should be made. No spectacular effects or blood dripping gore ... just brilliant writing and good play. Nolan will be enchanted by his writing again. Actors, all unknown to me and I suppose most people have done a good job that has brought the characters to life. Everyone was believable, and that's all it has to be. The film is confusing because it plays a lot with chronology, but in the end it is very beneficial. The film is a bit short to be full-length, but each additional length would destroy the style of the film and the writing brilliance would diminish. Although short, the film has every aspect that makes the film attractive (IMO): an interesting start, an exciting center and a surprising end. I dare say the following is almost as good as Memento, his best film by far. Mixed chronology is equally masterfully used in both movies, amazing plot twists are present and acting is very good. all) millions of dollar hits. The use of b & w can be a hard pill that could swallow for a large audience, followed by Nolan, who shows off her skills to the studio boss :-). And what skills are ... rarely I enjoyed writing as much as in 'After'. Even Pi does not even come close to the IMO, although it is also very good. Definitely no movie lover will miss this movie. If you like Memento, 'Next' is definitely for you.
