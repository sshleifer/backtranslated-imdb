To my eternal shame I have never seen a silent film - not even the mother of all the vampire films "Nosferatu". However, if they show half of the creativity and the sheer joy of this effort from Buster Keaton then I will try to look at a few more. This is really funny as well as a stunning introduction to the world of quiet comedies. The premise, such as that is, focuses on the unfortunate case of mistaken identity as Keaton is mistaken for the renowned bad-guy Dead Shot Dan (co-director Malcolm St Clair). This leads to a number of persecutions and escapes when the authorities are increasingly approaching the more and more desperate Keaton. <br /> <br /> You'll be amazed and have fun on the same scale. Keaton is a natural comedian, but also a perfect stuntman who judges how he jumps and jumps around like Jackie Chan on speed. And comedy also has an exceptionally high standard - my better half had to cut the phone call to her parents because she laughed too much! If you have never experienced a silent movie like this, then it is nothing less than the revelation you are watching - it certainly blew away all the thoughts I might have about silent movies. Naturally, it's not as polished as today's movies - acting is terrible, the truth is said, but it doesn't matter because you're enjoying the movie. Anyone interested in films in general should try to watch this because they will not be disappointed. Brilliant!
