This is Classic Disney in its live action cartoon best! Bumbling College Student Dexter Riley (Kurt Russell) develops a mysterious liquid invisibility formula that actually makes objects disappear and helps him save his cash strapped college. Other experiments show that people work amazingly well! Riley's surprising discovery brings a few merry new twists when a gang of cheaters headed by notorious A.J. Arno (Cesar Romero) stole the formula and tried to use it for his less than legal activities. Dazzling special effects and a quick story make this live movie a textbook case of college comedy! I love this movie! This film has always filled me with a sense of wonder and joy. A pleasant comedy that the whole family can enjoy. There is not much violence or sex and absolutely no curses, it's a movie that parents can watch with their children. One of Kurt Russell's films at Medvale College. Pleasant little series placed in healthy America before terrorists when people appreciate integrity more than cash! I highly recommend this movie!
