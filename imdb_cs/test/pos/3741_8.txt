NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in just a beautiful story of a man and woman who have something smoother in life than they currently have. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene in the film to their last hug. Places, the beauty of their attraction to themselves as they unfold when they first meet, and the story that follows, and how they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel to each other is real, is a romance that translates into a candidate. James Franco in another micro role is just the right casting and Lane elegance combined with the Beach House is a true fall 2008 movie that remembers forever, just like NOTEBOOK.
