The title is a reference to the destruction of the remains of the harvest, such as rice husks, by the farmers who burn them and create fires on the plains. This is a bleak story about the destruction of a Japanese soldier. The story takes place in the final days of the Philippines campaign as a TB soldier returning from the hospital because because he can walk, they have no room for him. His superiors don't want him because he is really too sick to work or fight. Abused by his officer is sent back to the hospital with the order to either be accepted or killed. They are still not taking it, and he is soon left to wander across a war-ravaged landscape that is trying to find help or a place to stay or even just food. It is a grim journey without hope in sight and only death and human inhumanity to man at every step. Invoiced as a terrible journey into the dark heart of man and war, it's also a very funny movie. However, this does not mean that it is not scary, sometimes it is, but also its dark comics. How could it be? Here's a movie where insanity and madness are running uncontrolled, people are constantly trying to tear down tobacco leaves for food, trying to get a little better pair of shoes, trying to stay a Japanese soldier in the face of absurdity by constantly marching but never getting. anywhere and you can't help but laugh. To be sure things are getting darker because it is obvious that cannibalism is perhaps, literally and figuratively, the only way to survive, but at the same time something unpleasantly funny about human comedy. Hello as a great anti-war film whose sharp photographic style clarifies the madness of war, even if it dazzles our eye with its beauty. Here we see landscapes full of bodies, including a soldier and a civilian. in the middle of forests and trees that would otherwise be, and to some extent still, quite beautiful. It's an uncomfortable feeling. Interestingly, I read that it is based on a novel about the redeeming power of Christianity. The director removed all religious references to hope and salvation, and instead used it to show that life stinks, the war stinks worse, and that ultimately there is no hope. Intellectually admiring the film, emotionally No. Included is a sharp downbeat score that more for me emphasizes what we see on the screen. It's almost a gilding lily, because the images are so strong that they don't really have to force the music to make you feel one way or another. It's a great movie, that's your decision. For certain of his distinction from any other war film, bloody, horrifying and real in ways that great budgeted movies claim to be but never to be. This is not for those unfavorable to blood and gore because of its here in the spade. It's definitely worth a look.
