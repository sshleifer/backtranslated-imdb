At first glance, The Bothersome Man seemed like several other films / books that rolled into one. Kafka's Trial, Melville's Bartleby, Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin and Groundhog Day instantly in the spring to mind. The man, Andreas, arrives at a nameless city where he is immediately employed in the office and finds a beautiful new girlfriend. However, there is a catch: his colleagues are friendly, bleak and utterly insignificant, and everyone he knows, including his girlfriend, seems to have only one topic of conversation - interior design. Welcome to the hell of modern consumerism in which people are throwing out of buildings and nobody raises eyebrows, or spend days reading furniture catalogs and food that tastes useless. Andreas quickly realizes his difficulty and tries to escape the rest of the movie in various ways. Suicide does not manifest itself, and when he finds a new girlfriend, he is as deprived of feelings as the old one - in the restaurant there is a wonderful scene where he asks her to move with him and all he can say is "I don't mind". In fact, much of what The Annoying Man says has been said before, and after about 45 minutes you will begin to feel that you are experiencing a certain sense of deja vu. But its meaning is one that is worth repeating, over and over: an unmistakable life is one that has no value to live. Added to him, it provides a decidedly modern take on the lasting theme of how capitalism destroys our souls. More than one character reminded me of the people I know, especially his obedient girlfriend, and if filmmakers came to ideas by the end of the film, maybe it is - it's not going to end if you can't find other people who share your alienation.
