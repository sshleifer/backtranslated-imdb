I was one of the few who got into the theater. Since then I have often thought about it. After two DVD views I am glad that it has succeeded. Like every big comedy, I laughed more at each watching, both in anticipation of gags and after catching things that were missing. Mike Judge is doing very well with creating insanely comedic characters and deploying to their world, so they make sense. In office environments, the character makes the characters believe. The future of Idiocracy gives him the freedom to write incredibly stupid characters and do them. I'll wait until I release a better DVD with some real features before buying it. But this film deserves to be supported by a DVD that was not offered to him in the theater.
