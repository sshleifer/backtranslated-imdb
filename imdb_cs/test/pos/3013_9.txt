It has to be said that the director The Cell, Tarsem Singh, has established himself very well with his first feature film, which is one of the most stunning films in contemporary cinematography. The Cell is more visceral than film. As a thriller, she rises above most of her peers, with competent cuts and a chilling score that provides an extremely exciting atmosphere. Ultimately, however, Tars is a skill for sophisticated and intrusive scenographic design and ideas that bear the horrible feeling of horror. negatively commented on The Cell; in defending the film, I will address some of these questions. The plot seems to be a major concern, and although it is not revolutionary and borrows heavily from Silence of the Lambs, it has never been intended as the most important aspect of the film; The storyline itself is a means by which viewers are introduced to Tarsem's vision - at the same time frightening and wondrous - just like the Conspiracy of Silence of the Lambs, which is secondary to the fascinating study of two main characters, Lecter and Starling. While Silence of the Lambs is clearly an excellent film, it is irrational to condemn a cell plot, and in the same breath praises the conspiracy of lamb silence. <br /> <br /> My last concern is the mention of "MTV style" directing. I'm sorry to see the condemnation of directors using innovative camera and cinema techniques. The camera has the potential to be much more than just a tool for recording events; Angles, pans, color settings and so on are all used in the cell in its entirety in order to create a feeling of a state of a similar dream that could not otherwise be achieved. This is necessary for the film because the whole assumption behind it is the visualization of the serial killer's subconscious. If you only want static shots, stick to the plays and give up the cinema completely. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, The Cell is thoroughly entertaining, frightening and breathtaking in its stimulation and design. Anyone who can look around - perhaps uninspired, but never boring - scenarios will find one of the best 2000 movies.
