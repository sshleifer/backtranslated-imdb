I watched this movie "miniseries" on television in 1989 and it was an amazing movie. I'd like to look at his copy to watch it over and over again. It has been 15 years since I watched it and keeps me in my head. <br /> <br /> It pulls you in from the very beginning. The end was excellent. The feeling and anger the son showed when he discovered the truth about his father are unforgettable. The tension on how it turns out and how he confronts his father is really intense. <br /> <br /> If you can get a copy of this movie, you'll be watching it carefully. Then write me and tell me where I can get a copy.
