Wrestlemania 6 is a fun Wrestlemania, if not quite successful. The Ultimate Challenge, of course, is worth the price of entry itself, but again, as with many early Mania, there are too many fillings between them. The crowd appears for almost everything, and as always, Gorily & The Body is a reliable reporting team. Having a face vs face match as a major event for the Wrestlemania, was utterly unheard of at this time, it just made things that were much tense. <br /> <br /> Matches. Koko B. Ware / W Frankie Vs "Model" by Rick Martel. For a 3 or a minute match it's as good as it is. I wish it was a little longer, but what I got was pretty damn good. Martel wins, with Boston Crab. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> WWF Tag Team Championship. Demolition Vs Colossal Connection | C | Bobby Heean. Huge pop for demolition. The game itself is quite boring, I have often had trouble paying attention. Andre didn't really do that, so it was more like 2 on 1. There's a strong talent involved here, and it's a shame they couldn't produce better. Demolition wins those titles, with that Pattened maneuver from the top. Crowd blows roof to target. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Earthquake / Jimmy Hart. Vs Hercules I got what I was expecting here, a standard boring filling match, with an earthquake. I'm not a fan of either, so I wasn't interested. Quake wins with his sit down splash. Brutus Beefcake Vs Mr.Pefect / W The Genius. Deaf pop for Brut. A really good match, unfortunately there is not enough time for further development. It's really my interest and will remain one of my favorites on the card. Beefcake wins with a slingshot on the post, much to the crowd's approval. <br/> <br/> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Roddy Piper Vs Bad News Brown. Huge pop for Piper. Nothing more than a boring brawl that doesn't know what it wants to be. Some fun rumors from The Hot Rod, but nothing else. Remarkable for Roddy paints himself half black, and call himself "Hot Scott" <br/> 1/5 <br /> Hart Foundation Vs Bolsheviks. Record breaking, but other than what is seen here. Harts wins with The Hart Attack. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Barbarian / W Bobby Heenan. Vs Tito Santana. Average for the time he got, but attentive. The crowd was rather dead for him, except for Heenan's intervention. Jessie is a hilarious crack, about Tito's food is more fun, then a match alone. The Barbarian wins with an ugly glance, flying a clothesline from the top. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Mixed tag match. Dusty & Sapphire / W Elizabeth. Vs Macho King & Sherri. Big pop for Dusty and even bigger for Elizabeth, which looks absolutely stunning, I can add. I thought it was OK. It was at least alive, if not so great. I'm not a Dusty fan. Dusty and Sapphire win when Sherri rolls up. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br /> Orient Express / W Fuji. Vs The Rockers. The crowd is surprisingly surprised. Good no doubt, but it should be better with those involved. The constant focus on Fuji is a bit of a contest. Express wins when Janetty gets nailed. Jim Duggan Vs Dino Bravo / W Earthquake & Jimmy Hart. Duggan as an idiot, earns an American flag in Canada. Duggan will also get some solid boo for that, but that may also be due to Bravo's Canadian heritage. Bad game all around, I don't care about Duggan, but that's not why it would be. It's too short at the end, it really matters. Duggan wins when Bravo bangs in the back with two by four. Duggan took care of his worries. <br /> <br /> The <br /> <br /> Million Dollar Championship. Ted Dibias | C | / W Virgil. Js Robers / W Damien. Some slow places, but when I was told and done, I had a good time. Two solid wrestlers who put it there resulted in a fun match. The crowd noticeably gets Ancy during its parts though by making the wave. Dibiase wins. Jake has the last laugh by giving away some money, a lot to delight the crowd. Big Bossman Vs Akeem / W Slick. Nice pop for Bossman. Too routine and too short to really mean it. Akeem was a trick, I was never very happy. Bossman wins with his straw. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The Rhythm & Blues segment was somewhat unsuccessful. The crowd wasn't there. Rick Rude / W Bobby Heenan. Jimmy Snuka. For the match to perform, before the main event, it was not too bad. If he had time to go more, it would certainly be great. Rude wins, with Rude Awakening. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Title of the title. Ultimate Warrior | IC Champ | Hs Hulk Hogan | WWF Champ | This one is about the atmosphere from the crowd and about the split of the crowd reaction. Warrior got quite a decent pop, but in my opinion it was a little overwhelming. Hogan overcomes it, with his. It's one of Wrestlemania's best matches in history. With two people who are not very well known, they have managed to create an amazing match that has been discussed for ages. I've seen it many times, and my respect level is growing higher for each one, for their efforts, given that I'm not a fan either. Even the dead fanatics who are longing for a clean match can't be a bitch about this! Warrior wins with his splash. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Wrestlemania 6 is a fun entry if there's nothing special. It's unforgettable for the main event, place and crowd, but it's not one of the best when you ask me. They say I enjoy it, and I give it to my colleagues. <br/> 7/10
