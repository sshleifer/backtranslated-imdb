This film is so different from everything you've seen before. It is an honest and chilling description of the struggle of a whole family with terminal disease. <br /> <br /> 'Closer' is shot in a very unique style. Craig Oulette films in a very different wayâ€¦ using different angles and angles, in what I find is a very interesting way (maybe because of his experience with photographic work). His style gives such a clear picture not only about what the patient faces, but also about what close relatives have with her. Very sad, but very interesting and unique movie. One would definitely recommend watching.
