After I was a college student in Western history, when I saw the views of World War II, it's quite inconvenient and totally bad overall. World War II was the most graphic and bloody issue ever occurring in world history. While the Axis powers carried out many crimes against humanity that are still in today's view, and the right number of people forgot that not every German soldier drove out the Jewish population, not every Japanese soldier plunged on a samurai sword and flew kamikaze and not. every Italian soldier was a fascist. Most of these Axis troops were normal people like you, and I found myself in a terrible conflict and just happened to be fighting for the country he loved. The Battle of Stalingrad was probably the most deadly battle in world history with over 150,000 casualties in battle. The film Stalingrad follows the German platoon and its leader Lieutenant von Witzland as they are transferred to the Eastern Front to the Battle of the Soviets at Stalingrad. Von Witzland acts as the main character with two other men, Rollo and Fritz. They are all normal men, and they seem totally unaware of what is happening in Germany and Poland. The film follows the course of the battle. The film is generally very grim as to its portrayal of the struggle and life of the soldiers during the battle. It turns out that outside these battles there are numerous terrible battles and intense violence (including the firing sequence). Overall, these struggles are the earliest examples I know show depression of limbs and overall in the faces of death and violence. Much of the inspiration for Saving Private Ryan's battle sequences apparently comes from this movie. The film does not aim to make the Germans totally innocent of everything in the film. Some of the senior army officers are depicted in the usual view that most people use, evil. Most soldiers are just normal people who often talk at home. The film very quickly shows that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, most of the country and the army were completely forgotten that genocide was being held. The film makes it clear that soldiers in the German army simply fought for the cause they did not really understand and wished most to return home instead of freezing at negative temperatures in Russia. The film really shows how war is hell, especially World War II. Battle scenes will shock you with their daring realism, and the story is easy to follow because you simply follow a platoon during battle. As with most war movies, do not expect much luck after seeing. He'll leave you in a little depressed mood only when he sees the life of most soldiers on the Eastern Front. Not recommended for children. <br /> <br /> 4/5 stars
