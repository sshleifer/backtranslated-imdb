I've seen most of Tarzan's episodes. Sure rated X with O'Keeffe & Bo Derek, who is utterly deplorable. <br /> <br /> I've seen this version several times since it was originally shown. All the casts had unforgettable parts, great Ape actor sequences. Last night I watched the Spanish station and other than some French dialogues in Spanish. If Hudson didn't want Andie's voice to the end. He looked at the diaries and could hire a dialogue coach. It seems stupid that the story of the apes and the man who encouraged them all spoke of Hudson attacking Andie. she was an American cousin. The last time I checked Carolina was in the US. She was beautiful in film and her eyes and beautiful hair, alabaster skin mystified all our men. She didn't have to resort to Bo level. She remained LADY through the rest of her career and should watch this movie (half her life earlier) as a starting point. Her performance, honesty, made this film pleasant, believable that half the wild man could find out his inner beauty. Great broadcasting point for Sir Richardson, he stole the movie.
