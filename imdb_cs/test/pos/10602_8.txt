When I first heard about this movie, I was slightly involved. The conspiracy seemed to be an opportunity for merriment, and Bam Marger, as an actor and director, looked like something could be good. When I found out that the film played Ryan Dunn, I was even more impressed (I was a Homewrecker fan when it was ... Yeah, I'm the lame). But I didn't have much faith that it was good. When I sat down to watch it, I was afraid I was wasting my time. But only five minutes turned out to be wrong. I thought the film's comedy was beautifully idiotic and certainly not suitable for all kinds of people. Behavior was good enough, much better than my expectations. I thought it was fairly easy to relate to Ryan's character who gave the movie a center that was believable. This is the key in the film as insulting as this (and is probably why I wasn't a Borat fan). The film is not suitable for younger people, DUH, and will certainly create more than just a fair share of clumsy turtles if you watch them with your parents. But it's good for you and your friends on a movie night.
