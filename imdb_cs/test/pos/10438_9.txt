I totally loved this movie, tried to buy it and can't find it. You must see a movie that you can watch over and over again, a humorous but also jerky blockbuster in one. a really good movie album. it's a really good 80's movie, I wish I could find a copy to buy this movie because I would, the actors did it really well. film so good. So go out and try to rent this one, you won't regret it. It's an older movie, but it's worth a look, I wouldn't be surprised if this movie came back soon, but I'm sure it won't be the same. Anyone who didn't see it rented it.
