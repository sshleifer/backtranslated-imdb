The first few minutes of this movie don't do justice, it's not funny for me until they get on board and those cheerful characters start to gel. I was born and raised in Norfolk, Virginia, and I met my share of "different" sailors. Most of my favorite movies are just funny, not current, independent of sex or violence and funny every time I see them. Groundhog Day, Bruce Almighty and Down Periscope are still funny even after I know the dialogue with my heart. Kelsey Grammar with his "God I Love This Work!" He was honest, real and kind. Rob Schneider is hysterical because the crew returns to him for being uncomfortable. I'm still overwhelmed by the size of this fishing boat beside the sub! I see why the people who live this life will notice uh-oh, but it's not a documentary throughout his comedy and I love it!
