Well, I think we all agreed that Michael Jackson was the lowest point. <br /> <br /> And special effects. But please keep in mind that it wasn't a big budget movie, okay? Not every movie gets as much budget as Harry Potter or Star Wars. However, I thought it was pretty funny. B-? Nothing in my opinion wasting time. Parody is always fun to watch, and because it wasn't a big budget, it doesn't mean it's bad. I think it was a good movie if it is weak on some points. <br /> <br /> I hope this comment will help. ~ Angela
