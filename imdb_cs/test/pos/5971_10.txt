If you have a chance, take a look at this Russian (how should I tell them: gems, masterpieces, hidden treasures?), War movies like this or dawn here are silent, or Proverka on dorogah ... And right after Here again, look at American war films or international productions, those that have allies and Germans, etc. Or worse, watch Italian war movies. Everything from the West will seem shallow, fancy, ridiculous compared to Russian movies. I am sooooo impressed by the quality of the above-mentioned Russian war films, which I cannot find words that would praise their breaking dominance over Anglo-Saxon war films.
