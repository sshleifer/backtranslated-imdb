My sisters and my cousins ​​made me see this movie. It's not the kind of movie I'd rather see, but it wasn't really that bad. I wouldn't see this movie, but after watching it I couldn't say it was wrong, just not my movie. It was very accurate in what a woman actually speaks and does in certain situations. As a guy, I wasn't amused, but the man who was sure. They related to the movie and yeah, it was fun to see the big screen. "OH EM GEE I'm doing it HAHA" I've never seen an original, nor would I care. If you are a girl, you need to see it, but maybe the girls would say that the movie is probably. I don't see a 13-year-old, "Wow, I remember throwing it when I was 30 years old." , so let me.
