Tamakichi Anaru's "Tumbling Doll of Flesh" is Japanese shocking about three criminals who sexually abuse, torture, and crush a young woman while filming her terrible actions. Typically twisted Japanese sick, who offers a lot of sadistic sexual violence and grisly gore. No conspiracy to talk, just a lot of hard core sex scenes (optically censored again) and lots of blood. Special effects are quite impressive - dismantling Japanese porn actresses is shown in unwavering detail. His hand is also cut off and her stomach is graphically cut and finally one of the sick has sex with the intestines. In fact, "Psycho: Snuff Reels" reminds me of "Guinea Pig: Flowers of Flesh and Blood," but it's not as memorable. So if you are a fan of ultra-spoiled Japanese patients such as "All Women are Whores" or "Rape of My Virgin Slave", give it one look.
