I have always been fascinated by ninjistsu, who would know it would go further than that. In "Ninja III", it's fun scary and interesting. Ninja is shot dead by the police and uses his spirit for revenge. Victim, a beautiful young woman named Christie (Lucinda Dickey). He falls on the cop who was involved in the filming. The love scene where she pours V8 on her body has driven me out! Ninja Death gets another's attention in Japan named Yamada (Sho Kosugi) he comes to America not only to save Christie, but to put the ninja back to the grave. Simply because he gave Yamad the left eye with a shuriken (throwing a star). The battle scenes were excellent. I liked the part when plywood falls on Yamada and he splits it with his foot. And when he was caught, he says Officer Christie was involved in making everything go well. Rule: Never under the ninja estimate. He pulled out more cops without killing them. And he did his thing without fear. Of course, Chirstie tried to put the ninja in her place to take her for revenge. It was a good movie, great for martial arts enthusiasts. 3 of 5 Stars!
