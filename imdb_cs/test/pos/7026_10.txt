I have to admit, before I watched this movie, I thought it was one of those fleeting love stories where everything works to the end. but I was wrong when I actually sat down to watch it. I found out that in fact it was a really good story about a family who goes to a dance park for a 3 week vacation and there the youngest daughter, a child, finds love, but has trouble getting there with her newfound love because of disagreements with her father. But on the way, he helps another dance instructor and risks the whole relationship ... Really pleasing film like no other. <br /> <br /> 10/10
