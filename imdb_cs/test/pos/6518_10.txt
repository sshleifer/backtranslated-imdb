A wonderful family movie that should be the basis of Christmas. It's a mystery to me why it isn't. The real lost film I first met, flickering on my old 19 "black and white RCA movie, when the Million Dollar Movie was still in the fashion of Channel 9 in New York. on the home video it was never released too badly, I believe I saw it on the AMC a few years ago before alternating with their older movies from spin. Easter or Christmas Eve, no Santa movie, Aunt Bee, Hostess Cupcake Lady and an actor with a given name can not be bad, Ann Blyth as "Sally" is a bundle of energies hurries to the chapel to pray for St. Anne to help her and give her instructions for a mixed and attractive family, so graduating places a statue of St. in his bedroom, the entire O'Moyne residence is moved to another address, I think it was done to end the neighborhood dispute between O'Moyne Blyth is cute as a button, Edmund Gwen can play a lonely grandfather in his sleep. All-in-all is a satisfying cinematic experience.
