When you stop to remember Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland's frequent encounters on the screen, "Most likely they died with their shoes" (1941), the movie is most likely the best. It is a general Custer saga (Flynn) - narrated since joining the West Point military military academy, and falls into the curious Elizabeth Bacon (DeHavilland) through his work during the American Civil War, and finally with his death in Little Big Horn. Director Raoul Walsh joins his historical epic on the laurels of highly controversial reinstants of historical texts, rewritten by screenwriter Wally Kline and Aeneas MacKenzie until all the truths and fiction are overcome. That is why the Battle of the Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) is portrayed as a crooked agreement between politicians - Californian Joe (Charley Grapewin) and a falsely absent corporation who wants to cultivate the land that Custer gave the Indians through the systematic genocide of the nation. first nations. Flynn, who cleverly plays Custer, as if he were one of Arnold Schwartzenegger's parts in two parts of Albert Schweitzer, has never been bigger. It literally radiates the charm and sexual attraction of every pore that easily dissolves the heart of his loyal heroine. Resident Warner players, Arthur Kennedy and Sidney Greenstreet bring beautiful portraits that seem to have a lot more depth and character than they are actually written in for them. Overall, despite the free plot of history in favor of a good romantic yarn, "They have died with their shoes on" is enough feed for Saturday matin√©e or Sunday evening cooing with one's pet. Warner's DVD is pretty looking. Although the film grain is often obvious, the gray scale was very nicely drawn by deep, solid black and very clean whites. Some transitions are evident during scene transitions. The sound was very nicely cleaned and presented at the appropriate level of listening.
