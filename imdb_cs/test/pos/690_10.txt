I watched as I expected to see the usual British stiff stereotypes of the upper lips, and I was surprised to see this dialogue remarkably natural and tinged with black humor. It was more like Eastenders going to the sea than in which we serve. Approach and attack scenes are remarkably realistic in how they depict a battleship and advance and joke among shipping companies (at least based on my service in the 1970s). Some of these hooks are very funny. or tattooed PO and its "I Love Arabella" tattoo!
