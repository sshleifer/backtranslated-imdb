When you think 'Oliver Stone', the movies that come to mind, will be his biggest and most controversial films like Platoon, JFK, Born On The Fourth of July, or Natural Born Killers. Talk Radio usually doesn't. Actually, it's a pretty small movie. More than half of the film takes place with Barry Champlain on his radio station, which speaks to his microphone. But believe me, it's one of Oliver's Stone's biggest films and you shouldn't miss it. Over all things, it's a character study. Barry Champlain is a rude, self-destructive, risk-speaking radio organizer who says too many things and gets into trouble with his boss, his lover, his fans and even some Nazis. He doesn't like his audience and callers, and many don't like him (or he likes it, but he has no idea why). Finally, he says at his show, "I think we're stuck." <br /> <br /> See Radio Talk, even if you don't like Oliver Stone movies. You may be surprised. I'm sure I was. <br /> <br /> Rating: 10/10
