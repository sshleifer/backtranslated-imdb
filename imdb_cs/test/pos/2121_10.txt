He went to the preview of Engaging "Grand Champion" today (Dallas / Fort Worth, Austin, Snyder and a few other cities in Texas). There are so few movies suitable for small children ... but this is and it's great. Although the storyline is small "Hokey" (also the name of an ox in the film), it is a wonderful story for children. And I also enjoyed it. The film very well represents ranch family life in West Texas, though a bit exaggerated. Director / director Barry Tubb should get it right because he grew up in this environment. He called the film a "love letter to Texas." Joey Lauren Adams plays Buddy's only mom (Jacob Fisher) and Sister Blow (Emma Roberts). Watch Emma Roberts (Julie Roberts' niece); It is very good and I think it will be in more movies. There are also portraits of performances by Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis, musicians George Strait, Charlie Robison, Robert Earl Keen, Joe Ely and rodeo legends Larry Mahan and Tuff Hedeman. <br /> <br /> If you have small children or just want to see a good movie, check out "Grand Champion" for your city (allegedly later this month). Y'all will like you and it will feel good. I think because I'm from West Texas, maybe I'm a little biased ... nah, I'm impartial. The film is excellent!
