When I watched "Plots with a View" (in the US), I felt there was a need to make more films in Wales. He portrays a woman (Brenda Blethyn) in a small Welsh town trying to get away from her cheating husband. And so, along with the burial manager (Alfred Molina), they come up with a plan ... but there will probably be some glitches on the way. Actually, I would say that Christopher Walken's character is the most beautiful in the movie (how could he not be?). But overall, the whole idea is really pure, stacked with some "uh oh" moments ... especially the haunted house scene. It's the kind of movie that I would like me to enter, just to experience it. Also starring Lee Evans, Naomi Watts and Miriam Margoyles.
