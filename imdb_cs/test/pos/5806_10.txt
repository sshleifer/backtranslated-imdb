This concert is a type of concert that takes place about every twenty years, and Madona's Confessions on the dance floor will surely be remembered as one of the highlights of her career. She is 48 and looks just divine, sticking to dancers who are nearly twenty years younger. I am also very pleased to announce that all the songs were sung live, which is good because it actually sounds better live. Each song was so unique, the visuals that astonish. The performance "Live to tell" was fantastic and let me surprise, 'Isaac' was exotic and gorgeous and was rich in political symbolism, the Arabian horn, the American eagle that was liberated. I especially liked the rock show "I Love New York", almost stood in my lounge and cheered when she told her critics to suck George Bush ****. And then I was amazed by the inspired music of the 70s (inferno remix). This Spectacular Decedent Concert made me a fan. Verdict: Highly recommended with capital H.
