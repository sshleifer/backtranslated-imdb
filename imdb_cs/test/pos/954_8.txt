Fortunately, the Ghillie remake of Telugu "okkadu" is a clarified version of the original that packs the same blow and Dharani, who will fulfill his film brilliance and add style and panache. Vikram got this much-needed growth with this film at this battle, which might prove to be the best movie Vijay ever worked on, considering the possibilities he has been doing ever since. what industry and the public accept with talented new entrants. The tight-fitting scenario that runs, spreads around the neck around Velu, a deliberate young man who seeks the award of the Kabaddi game (a popular game among boys in India) Events after accidentally meeting Muthupandi His rescue of a girl in need and how to juggle with the aspirations of his friends and his own forms of axis and end of Vijay fits like a 'T' to the role and essays of the subdued and believable depiction of the boy next door. Trisha has more to play than the stereotypical cloak of a Tamil heroine. The task is more complex than just a girl in trouble. With limited dialogues, Trisha uses her casual muted expressions and subtle vulnerability to add color to the role. This is a classic case of a cover girl who comes to age to become a professional actress. Trisha became my personal favorite after this movie. The film ends on predictable lines, even though one must attribute to the director that viewers argue about many things, including changing Trisha in the decision to leave the country. Prakash Raj deserves praise for providing a perfect counterweight to Vijay's role. His almost unruly character in the role of a villain and the apparent rift in the hero's armor is the perfect trick to keep the audience guessing. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a great movie that deserves at least one browsing experience. I give it clearly 8 out of 10.
