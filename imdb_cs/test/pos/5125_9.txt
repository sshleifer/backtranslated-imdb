The story is incredible, it starts with a new guy in the city called Roy, while on a bus to school he notices a run without a shoe and the same day breaks a big tyrannical nose trying to fight him. Roy soon discovers that the boy is runaway, and he and his sister are trying to break a building look that could kill all the beautiful owls that live there. Roy has decided to help them fight there, They can win this fight against a clever but disgraceful cop Dave Delink (Luke Wilson) who comes across them. Pleasant movie, fun and adventurous. I admire Luke Wilson for this role. I don't think his brother Owen even took the role.
