Crossfire Edward Dmytryka is a distinctive thrilling thriller, which is an unlikely "news" movie using the look and feel of a noir cycle. their restlessness by hanging in bars. Three of them end up in a foreign apartment where Robert Ryan, drunk and aggressive, beats his host (Sam Levene) to death because he becomes Jewish. Police Detective Robert Young investigates with the help of Robert Mitchum, who is assigned to Ryan. Suspicion falls on the other of the three (George Cooper), who has disappeared. Ryan kills a third friend (Steve Brodie) to make sure of his silence before Young closes. Ryan, naturally, makes his prototype of Angry White Man (and to the hilt), while Mitchum underplays with his characteristic nonchalance warning (his role, however, is not central); The young may never have been better. Gloria Grahame releases her first full-fledged rendition of an intelligent, vulnerable tramp, and as a sad sack that plunged into her life, Paul Kelly is chasing us in a small, peripheral role she remembers. The politically engaged Dmytrik may inevitably be subject to preaching, but it is largely confined to Young's memory of how his Irish grandfather died in the hands of bigots a hundred years earlier (ie, by the way, stretching the borderline chronology). At least there is no attempt to explain, however glib, why Ryan hates Jews (and peaks and ...). Curiously, Crossfire will survive even the major changes that came to it - the novel is based on (Richard Brooks' The Brick Foxhole) dealt with homosexual murder. But homosexuality in 1947 was still under light. The Holocaust news, however, began to emerge from the ashes of Europe, so Hollywood felt encouraged to register its protest against anti-Semitism (studios were always confused with the prospect of insulting potential ticket buyers). But while the change from homophobia to anti-Semitism works in general, the specifics do not fit so smoothly. The victim is told by a lonely, drunk young soldier and then invites him back home looking strange, though (or since then) there is a girlfriend. It raises the question of whether this scenario has been inadvertently retained or left as a discreet tip on the original engine generating the murderous rage of Ryan.
