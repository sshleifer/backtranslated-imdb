I was a huge Errol Morris fan since I saw Thin Blue Line and I heard he saved his life. To date, this movie is his best piece of work. The storyline is mixing Stephen Hawking's book of the same title intertwined with human life. The story is told through interviews with family, friends and Hawkings himself. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled; It's totally boring, but the whole package is dynamic and provocative. Mixing life and theories is seamless and fun. In particular, I was moving about how well this genius and omniscient man humanize. Hawking's size and shear brilliance are physically helpless and are encapsulated in a real living human being who can laugh and laugh again. <br /> <br /> Find this movie. Watch it and enjoy. And if the studio that owns this picture reads this, the 15 year anniversary release would be perfect ...
