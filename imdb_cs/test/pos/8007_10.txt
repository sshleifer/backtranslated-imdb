And the perfect movie to watch during the holiday season as the winter / Christmas atmosphere that Burton creates for Gotham City is the way to cool. It's strange that Warner decided to release it as a summer movie. That is not adequate. But what's even stranger when you're thinking about the content of this movie is that it was focused on families. A higher-class family throws their mutant child into the sewer, a sociophobic billionaire dresses like a flying rodent, a lonely secretary dresses like a feline in the skin, and gets mad at a political office. And S&M and slavery are presented in a very perverse way. But Burton got rid of it. His visual style in this film is at its best. This and Batman: Dead End are the only true incarnation of the comic book character. It is true that the animated series was closest to the source material, but compared to Batman Forever and the one that is inimitable, Batman Returns is the best of four. Darker and more violent than the first film, the sense of Gothic pathos reaches a new high. I was quite excited about Michael Keaton when Bruce Wayne (not even me at George Clooney!), Showed the right balance of the strange lord and cool criminal. Michelle Pfieffer is great as Catwoman (a much sexy and more realistic cat), wearing leather clothes better than Halle Berry. And Danny DeVito was as convincing as a penguin that his scenes became worrying. And Christopher Walken is brilliant as the creepy Max Shreck (if you think you recognize Chip Shrek, it's none other than a very young Leatherface / Butterfinger). Danny Elfman's score is so better than it was for the first time round. His powerful and engaging motifs are much better than the debris that followed in the later two Schumacher films. This film is a phenomenon of Batman in his Zenith. Forget the sequel and stick to the animated series. Hopefully Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale can bring some live Batman action with their movie next year. This DVD was one of Warner's first DVDs (almost 7 years ago!). and, as a result, there are no functions and the case is a snapper. Choose it cheaply as I did and hope for the future for SE.
