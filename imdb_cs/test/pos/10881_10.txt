definitely the best game for N64 ever. The most I say I was tomorrow disappointed tomorrow never dies, but the world is not promising enough to be better than goldeneye (by website). I love goldeneye so much I find something to do every time I play it. I even created my own mission levels. Multiplayer is the best of all games outside, and the graphics are overwhelming even now. The first day I remember it, they wish to come back and make all bonds movies into games. You can imagine driving on this boat at a speed of living and letting you die and make incredible jumps, or fight ninjas or fight jaws in a spy who loved me and the moonraker. (I think the fight against him in these games would be more fun than in Aztec) about chasing Sanchez in the gas trucks or whipping St. Cerils just for your eyes. oh well, let me go back to the game. All levels are unique and create a very entertaining environment. There are many places to hide, so you can snowshoes on people (especially sculpture park) well this game is not worthy of renting you really need to buy today.
