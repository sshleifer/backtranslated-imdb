This movie was as stunning as it was! The storyline is extraordinary, and impressive spectacular. At first I thought it wouldn't be so great for a summary, but after the first five or ten minutes of the movie, I thought I was dead. I literally screamed about four or five times in this movie and despite that I had to watch the same scenes again and again about thirty times a week! No, the song scenes were not as amazing as they could be, but the plot is what really gets you. American or Asain, I would recommend it to everyone - and now I have it. I guarantee that after seeing this, you get the best of it and its plot. I hope you will feel the same way and you also write an enthusiastic review!
