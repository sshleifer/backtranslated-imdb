As a former (nuclear) submarine officer, I have to admit it's my favorite submarine film (even exceeding the Red October Hunt). Someone knew about submarines when they wrote the film. OK - not realistic - but it's a comedy - and has all the "inner jokes" of the submarine. Great cast with stereotyped excited submarine boys on "Orlando" and our heroes on the oil ship. Definitely "DBF" by the way = that means oil ships forever. But they want ten lines to send this - are you an Admiral here? <br /> <br /> Line 10.
