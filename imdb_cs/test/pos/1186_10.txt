It could not come out in a worse time - just as the nation entered the Reagan years, the boom-boom of the 1980s, time without regret, no worries. He had no word of mouth and opened himself badly. The studio threw it away. But Hair is perhaps the best musical he has ever made - with Forman and Tharpe, it's a surprisingly beautiful, well-functioning, well-written victory that few people remember. Casting is perfect, music numbers are unforgettable, and even the weaker end does not reduce the incredible ghost of the film. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, you haven't seen the best musical ever. Seriously.
