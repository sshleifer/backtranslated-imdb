I think Never Been Kissed was an absolutely amazing movie. The cast was really good and he did very well. I really like Drew Barrymore and of course it was great. At first I was scared because she said she wasn't coming out on the video. Boy, I'm glad it's because it's a great movie. Go if you don't!
