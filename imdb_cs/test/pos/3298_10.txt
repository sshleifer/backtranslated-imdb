He was pleased to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival, where he won the Audience Award. And I have to say that it was deserved because Boy Next Door is a very funny short movie! The script is well written and keeps things escalating. It also has a large current of tension thrilling through it. You do not know what will happen next when the main character tries to cope with the knowledge that his new neighbor may not be the most suitable person to live opposite him. Jokes are fast and unexpected. The plot leads us to guess. The dialogue is very real. I thought the direction was first-class, and director Travis Davis showed great potential to be big in the world of studio comedies. It is not a small praise for being also the main actor of the film, so he had to do threefold duty, writing, directing and playing. If you have a chance to see this movie on iTunes, it's worth downloading. It will laugh a few times. And this is more than most shorts today.
