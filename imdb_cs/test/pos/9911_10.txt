This may not be the worst or incredible episode they've done, but in my opinion it remains as one of the most original episodes of Star Trek and Sci-Fi. Most ideas from the retro Sci-Fi series especially including Star Trek have been repeatedly used several times, this one hand remains mostly as one time triumph. This is among the episodes that most interested me in the end. Another thing I like about this episode is how it managed to create such a radiant and captivating story with so few special influences. Now, without criticizing the episode, I must admit that the effects are very dated, but then again what you can expect from a 1967 TV show? But the creation ("Horta") in this episode is basically just a carpet with some colored rubber. Yet you will forget about it after 1 minute and start thinking about it just as it should be. Also, caves do not look exactly like rock, but you will forget it again after a few minutes. This episode is a living proof of how good acting performance and good story can ignore visual effects. As usual, playing from the main cast is great. This episode presents Meld Spock's second mind series and is one of my favorites. To say it's simple, Leonard Nimoy is definitely a stealer of the scene and his acting performances are excellent. Not that Kirk or Bones did not get their share of the episode, but Spock is the most interesting in this episode. I like the fact that the episode is not about one particular character, but it is evolving around a trio that can handle an alien problem. It's also nice to see an episode that doesn't just happen on the Enterprise. Like most Star Trek episodes, this episode says we have an open mind. I'm not going to mess up the story, but it's evolving around what seems like a typical monster story in the beginning. She killed several people, and she must be killed. But is it really all there? I can assure you that the explanation will not disappoint you in the end. This is still my favorite Star Trek TOS episode and I give it 10/10.
