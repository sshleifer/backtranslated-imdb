But I liked this film, but it wasn't easy. What makes the movie great is music and scenery. The songs are beautiful and the musicians are talented. Great work has been done to show the different settings for the Roma. However, the viewer was not sufficiently guided. The deeper history of the Roma would be nice. Only a fraction of the spoken words got English subtitles. In addition, more explanations about the setting and who they were and some of their challenges would be appreciated. It would help if the narrator also explained the habits, clothes and music.
