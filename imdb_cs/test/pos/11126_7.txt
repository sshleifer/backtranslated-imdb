"Glory" is a very well done portrait of students living in New York High School. The film focuses on a group of students dreaming of creating a great work in today's famous school. Director Alan Parker allows each of the highlighted students to wake up on the screen, allowing you to feel connected with each of them. Music is contagious and entertaining. Dance is exciting and fresh. The film eventually became the basis for the Emmy-winning television series starring Debbie Allen and some other actors from the film. One of the more entertaining "dance" films of the 1980s. They received Oscars for music. 8/10
