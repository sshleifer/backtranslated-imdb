When the idea was successful during those "Silent Days" Golden Days, you can bet your lower dollar to repeat; although "reprocessing" is a term that is used. Of course, it could be argued that this overworked business has never left us because success in films or television always leads to a trend; with all competing parties who compete to come up with their own version of that movie or TV program. We definitely disagree with this last assumption; This is copying or plagiarism, simple and simple. This, the last Silent Laurel & Hardy Short, must have been pretty well received; for ANGORA LOVE (Hal Roach / MGM, 1929) was redesigned to Roach Lot, not once but twice in the next three years. We were treated to get into play (Roach / MGM, 1931), in which the goat was replaced by a cute little puppy. Also, the weather turns into a dead winter in the middle of a blizzard. They also made additional line-up changes with the replacement of Landlord Edgar Kennedy with the charter charter owner. The second revision of the hidden animal assumption is 3 Reeler, CHIMP (Roach / MGM, 1932), replaced the female monkey from the dissolved and extinct circus to which Stan and Babe were former employees. The circus paid off his property to his employees and the boys received the chimpanzees for their last paycheck. BACK to our original "victim" today's topic, ANGORA LOVE. Recomember? The short start starts simply. Boys meet Goat on the street and the nanny follows them back to their house; after Stan feeds her donut. The following comic moments are generated by the interplay between L & H and the slow burning exponent, Edgar Kennedy, their landlord. The impact of the incident is amplified by the fact that the game takes place at night. And how lucky it will be; their room is located directly above the landlord's hostel. In addition to the noise, goat bathing, its smell and the persecutors of Edgar's suspicion of Laurel & Hardy, he has another person in the room; most amused us by the small blow that Censors could have missed. While he admonishes the boy about the noise they made, he reminded them of the rules of the house that there was someone unauthorized at night, regardless of their gender. over the shoulder. With Edgar in the hall and facing them; "Remember it's a decent device!" As she says, a lady dressed in evening dress walks across and behind the landlord; followed by a uniformed Sailor who leans over his hat as he passes! POODLE SCHNITZ !!
