A funny cruise to a normally dark funeral home. It's easy to follow and even offers Blethyn & Molina to steal the scene from the old movie Fred & Ginger. Walken is above the mountain as a keen Molina competitor in business, trying to bring a new style to the old Welsh city. We see some very funny examples of "new style". The story thickens with Pugh, who has a relationship with Watts, and suggests they're doing Blethyn inside. Meanwhile, Molina has revived her long-suffering romantic feeling for Blethyn and convinces her to let her die to escape to the southern seas, and dance with them. During a "false" funeral, Blethyn learns of his husband's infidels and conspires to her revenge. Look at what funerals they should be - a celebration of life!
