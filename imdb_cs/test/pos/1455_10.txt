Frank Sinatra has done so many great things in the world of entertainment that it's hard to decide them as the best. If I had to name the best he ever did, it would be his performance as Frankie Machine, a heroin-addicted musician and poker trader who is hardly rescued by the love of a good woman (which exceptionally plays babelicious Kim Novak). The "cold turkey" scenes between Sinatra and Novak are frightening and heartbreaking. In fact, the film is almost perfect, from the title graphics of Saul Bass to Elmer Bernstein's breakthrough jazz score. It may not be something that someone thinks about in the 1950s, but still has to be seen.
