With the arrival of the Nazis to power in Eastern Europe in the late 1930s, Charles Chaplin turned his attention to creating a response to it. The catalyst may also be a propaganda publication referring to Chaplin as a Jewish sympathizer. In The Great Dictator, Chaplin created a dead parody of Hitler, which is sometimes so frightening. The film follows Hitler's experiences in the German army from World War I to the present day. At the same time, Chaplin plays a Jewish barber who dresses as a hiker who walks out of the hospital for a long time to find out how different the world is from the Nazi government. Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's wife, plays a young Jewish girl whose family is oppressed in the Jewish ghetto. Jack Oakie has a great, Oscar-named supporting role as Mussolini's appearance-like (Benzini Napaloni) who gives Chaplin's Hitler character, Adenoid Hynkel, a lot of fits. Henry Daniell is his usual private owner as Garbitsch, Adenoid Hynkel's chief advisor. Chaplin wrote and directed the film and received Oscar nominations for his screenplay and his play. The film was also nominated for Best Picture. Chaplin made the film under enormous pressure for several obvious reasons, and some not so well known. He financed the whole film with great risk because of the topic and there were no other significant films about Nazi Germany until then. The film spent about twenty-one months in production with Chaplin even rebuilding the set and re-shooting the scene to get things right. At the time of the film's release in October 1940, the war in Europe was in full swing with Hitler to conquer one country after another, so the film became much more current in its release than when the first production began. Looking at the film in retrospective is not a lot of conspiracy; the film looks more like a series of comedic sketches and / or misfortunes that are linked to get the purpose independent of the movie itself. Some examples of this happen in the last third of the film with the meeting of Hynkel and Napaloni. The scene is very funny, but it does not lead to conspiracy. Likewise, the escape of both the barber and Schultz simply leads to the false identity of the barber for Hynkel to allow Chaplin (despite the barber's character) to pontify the audience at the end of the film. On the other hand, what better way to mention the wrong narcissism of Aryan superiority than to have a Jewish barber mistake Hynkel? Nevertheless, the film contains many high comic moments such as rally speech, new war development (bulletproof uniforms, etc.), dancing ball scene, pudding scene coin and the entire scenario between Hynkel and Napaloni (including scene of a barber chair) to make the movie highly recommended. Nor can we forget the risks Chaplin has taken in creating his first talking film, anti-Nazi film and financing the film itself. *** 1/2 of 4 stars.
