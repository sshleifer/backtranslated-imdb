I wanted to write a review of this movie for a while, but only now I managed to get my thoughts down to find out about them. I've never had the pleasure of seeing the movie on the "big screen", which is a shame, because it's often visually stunning, but I've seen it on the video several times over the years, and I always have it he used immensely. It's definitely on my personal favorite movie list and more than just playing Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon, two of my "watchers." Maybe I appreciate this movie because it appeals to my slightly off-kilter taste in entertainment. I love my movies a bit to the left of the center - unpredictable and fresh. And if you think it's the story of a movie story, you have to admit it's different! Everyone has different tastes and opinions, but my impression of some negative reviews of this movie movie is that viewers have never seen around the surface of this movie. They went into technical matters: "Why should green lighting be underground?" or "Why would medical students get such a stupid piece?" and didn't see the art and psychological depth of the work. Yes, there are some health and technical aspects that do not give a logical sense, but if you are willing to suspend distrust only tad, it can be a very engaging film. First, a note on the artistic quality of the film. Some have complained about the dark lighting and the illogical nature of the kits - but for me, the use of innovative lighting techniques, plastic and leaf kits, unusual settings in old buildings and dun, tunnel tunnels, sculpture, rainy and fluttering curtains all add to this film's poetic flavor, spooky beauty that suits the dark nature of the questions put on life, death and forgiveness. I'll focus only on two examples; in the aisle scene, a change in illumination allows certain elements of the set to dramatically get into focus, then weaken once the light returns to normal. It is an innovative way to shift the momentum in reality and work beautifully. We can also see the interior of the apartment characters - contrasting with warm wood, bright colors, golden lighting and the crowded comfort of Labraccio's rooms with the sharp, white blank of Nelson. Both are reflections of the characters themselves. Nelson's lack of "objects" reflects our lack of knowledge of his past. and his carefully designed mask that keeps his companions at a distance. His past, which we learn, is chaos and conflict. He decided to leave it in favor of a cluttered emptiness. Unfortunately, emptiness also reflects its relationships with others, the awareness that comes to its personal journey of self-discovery in this film. Flatliners is not your typical horror movie. A typical drama or thrilling film is not a fusion of all that has the best elements of all genres intertwined in a complex, exciting plot. This is a file set and the cast does a great job of breathing life into their individual characters. Your immediate impression is that the characters are always a representative of a well-established "stereotype": a female queen of ice, a slightly neurotic "doctor", a playboy, and a socially conscious "nice guy", etc. and depth. The most interesting of all is the character of Nelson Sutherland. Nelson is not an easy-to-admire character - he is a bit of a bard, a master manipulator who definitely places his own interests above everyone else. But Sutherland plays it with a hint of uncertainty that gives him some challenge. As events evolve, you realize that much of Nelson's unpleasant personality is a smoke screen, a protective mask that hides a very uncertain and vulnerable young man burdened with a terrible secret. Revealing pieces and pieces of Nelson's complex personality throughout the film, writers, directors and casts lead you to greater understanding and sympathy for him. A character who started out as a "jerk" becomes important and appreciated in his own right - how to learn to "forgive" his previous behavior in light of new information. Your journey of exploring with Nelson reflects your own paths of character toward self-knowledge, as they also realize that everyone has value, and "everything that matters." <br /> <br /> Which leads to my last remark. Though many of the posters have taken on the subject of defying death here, little seems to have touched what I see as the main premise of the film - the importance of forgiveness and the need to know everything you do because it "matters". <br /> <br />
