This is really the only chance to see the magic of James Joyce's writing that has come to life. His novels are all unfilmable (in any real sense) and that's the only long story he has written. It was John Huston's last film and didn't reach the screen until he died, and it's easy to see his touch of size. The dead is poetic in his on-screen approach, telling us more about Ireland than any modern IRA movie and "trouble" that could ever hope to tell us. Hopefully, more people will see this movie and experience the best of John Huston and James Joyce and maybe visit this story at your local bookstore (and find that it's probably the biggest story he has ever written on paper).
