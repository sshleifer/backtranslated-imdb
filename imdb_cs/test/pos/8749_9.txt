Compared to a recognized Hollywood remake, this film is less flashy, but much stronger in providing an overall picture of the drug problem. The remake loses the most interesting of three topics, such as a farmer whose poor livelihoods depend on drugs as a paid money crop, and whose increased involvement in drug trafficking in an effort to destroy themselves and their family. Moreover, the story of the daughter's addiction is related to problems not only of withdrawal but also of high probability of relapse. This original miniseries makes good use of the extra time to get into the issue and stay stronger on this controversial subject.
