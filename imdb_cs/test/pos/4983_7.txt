Western through and through. As the title title portrayed by Glenn Ford says, "No, I don't want to fight, but I'll be if it's forced on me." This film is about being intelligent, strong and fighting for its beliefs. With courage, never stop pursuing what you feel is right. Great action and mostly fast. It's good to see Brian Keith in this role and Edward G. Robinson as an older western man. Glenn Ford lives up to his western image. A thoroughly enjoyable film involves strategic non-military warfare. Of course it is violent, as stated in the title, but not too graphic as in computer movies. These are mainly strong conflicts of personality.
