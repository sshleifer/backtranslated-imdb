Another wonderful movie by Catherine Breillat, this time about the difficulties of filming the sex scene in the movie. Using Comedy? new genre for Breillat ??? We get a backstage view of the film, but in a documentary style. The character who plays the director in the film is based on Breillat, the sex scene in question is taken from her earlier film "Ma Soeur" as the main teenage actress. But the film, like all his work, is not entertainment alone. It is dotted with philosophical observations on the nature of sexuality as well as demonstrating allegiance to purity (as opposed to pornography) that is the cornerstone of Breillat's work and devotion to real emotions. We see that the director's character is chasing a young chief actress and actor to get the best out of them, hypnotizing them into the parts they need to play to bring out the part the director sees in them, but not seeing themselves until they see the height of acting which it requires. He makes meaningful movies, not titrations, but shows the work that is needed to create it, and so gives us a look at both the (definitely French) film making process and the psychology of men? female sexuality.
