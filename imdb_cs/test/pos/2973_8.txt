I saw this movie when it came out first. At that time I was a teenager and I saw it with my girlfriend who later became my wife. I remember the film felt that it was possible to beat the odds. The camera was very good if my memory was right. The boy was a little too much, but the girl's character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and that it could be the intro for the first time with my girlfriend then. I haven't seen the movie ever since and I'm wandering why it went on a secondary road. I'd like to follow it again to see if it's as good as I can remember. Elton John's soundtrack was excellent.
