I really like the show! As part of Greek life, I can say that some things are exaggerated, but overall it is still damn funny. in their own rights. I like the fact that it focuses on individual situations as well as on human relationships with organizations. This show concerns everything and does it without a curse or anything so bad (how else could it be on ABC Family?). <br /> <br /> My favorites are Cappie (of course), Rusty's roommate and almost all Kappa Tau. This show is a great starting point for them and I am thrilled to see the door open. Please refresh this show next summer, ABC Family. As I said, love to love!
