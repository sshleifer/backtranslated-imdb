Since Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern Anglophone poetry, I was expecting a film that was prone to hagiography of the subject. Conversely, the poet is presented as a sexually irresponsible, drunk, bad father, lier and hypocrite and perhaps a coward. Of course, it could be argued that all these things are an advantage when someone is an artist and especially a poet, because one of the purposes of art is to subvert the standards of conventional morality, but I still do not remember that a positive model could produce such a bundle of personality traits. Anyway, I found the second male hero of Captain Cillika's story, who is more cute. Two female roles were played by actresses Knigtley and Miller and were really charming especially the first when she played songs in slim outfits to inspire bombed Londoners during WW2. Another good point is the role played by sexual jealousy even in a relatively progressive environment that thinks that age conventions can easily be overcome. Unlike those who talk about it, it's possible political results. I think he would recommend such a movie.
