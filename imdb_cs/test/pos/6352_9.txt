An excellent introspective / interpersonal piece that has really had some teeth without feeling hopeless or worse, manipulative and gratifying. It could be a good double feature with American beauty as well. The best performance I have seen so far from Anita Mui, and every actor looks like a powerhouse. Hats off Ann Hui for direction and Ivy Ho for brilliant script. Seriously one of the best dramas I have seen in a while, especially if you want the classic literature of ALA poetry. Again excellent.
