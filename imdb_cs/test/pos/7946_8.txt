Many accuse Rod Steiger of overacting, and anyone who has seen Amityville's horror and 'fly' section would try to say otherwise. That means he's great at it. <br /> <br /> It's never on TV, you can't buy it on DVD (legitimately). In 1988, when Channel 4 still had a recipe for innovation, they showed it among the small amalgams of the 60's, Privilege, etc. - and I remember a basically theatrical experience that is well projected into the film. The great thing about theater is that it's closed - how to make it available and interesting on screen? PH just pulls something away. Since this kind of film is never even on Sky cable or television, it is hard to get a debate, but for anyone who has seen or recalls it, my memories of Sally Geeson 's being all taken care of ( which avoids almost various general performances of her and her sibling in many early 70s offers) she says ref concept. There are several of these key lines you remember for years, decades. This is the power of a movie like this. PS I saw it again and it's just as good. One day the television will be enlightened.
