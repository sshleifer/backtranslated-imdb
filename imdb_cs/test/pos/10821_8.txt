He was in the mood for a French film and saw it on the blockbuster. What a little gem has turned out to be! Not sure how I left Gregori Deranger all these years, but he's fantastic. Such innocence and grace! I love his face and the way he moves. Isabelle Adjani was cheerful - reminded me of Nicole Kidman's best performance at the Moulin Rouge. It looks just like 20 years ago ... really remarkable. Gerard Depardieu did not abstain, but his actions are still astonishing. He's perfect in this movie. It'll probably buy it, I enjoyed it too much. If you want to see another great French movie, rent Joyeux Noel. Stunning.
