Well, I think I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning. This movie wasn't. For the first 40 minutes, she stretched out at a slow, deliberate pace, but there was nothing I was really interested in - it was an interesting and mysterious dispute between Jean Reno and the old man, but the first 40 minutes were dominated by the wandering of the main character that I am too she did not know and could not really relate at that time. Mostly he wanders alone, does not meet anyone; I imagine the director trying to capture the loneliness of the human condition in this post-apocalyptic world, or something that is all good, but I still want him to cut it from 40 minutes to 15 because it can be incredibly boring. But after those 40 minutes things start to be very interesting. I think I won't be more than saying because I don't want to spoil anything. So if you saw the first 15-30 minutes of this movie and are thinking of turning it off (like me), stick to it - it gets a lot better. One of the most interesting things I found about this movie was the fact that it had no dialogue at all that made me think about what was happening, how the characters felt, and what their motivations were. Why it was in this post-an apocalyptic world that gives the story a lot of space to interpret the audience. And it's amazing how much more satisfying the movie is when the actors don't tell you exactly what's going on.
