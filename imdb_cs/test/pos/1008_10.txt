That was one of the few Norwegian films I was looking forward to. It started out as a few ads with varied games on football matches. Then they made it a movie. Leadership is not for professionals (and you see it), but they still do a very good job and the film blew me all out. Norway is known for making lousy movies (no offense), but I felt good about it. Although I don't care about football, I wanted to see 2. The story is much better than expected and laughs only accumulates. There are plenty of portraits from Norwegian celebrities and players. the characters are well drawn and feel to them. IF WE ARE ONE GONNA SEE NORWEGIAN MOVIE. IT'S IT ONE !!!!
