My God, this is a funny thing. Yes, it's cruel in extreme, but also somewhat funny ("Here's the page with all the wines on it." "I'm afraid it's a little earlier for us." top level. Despite what you may have heard, laughter continues to do so and, surprisingly, generously. Rico Mayall's clean comic skills and Adrian Edmondson's help keep him stupid. wringing every drop of comedy out of the script. I can only compare it to "Fear and Disgust in Las Vegas" - either find that the film is hysterical throughout or not; the same applies here. It's probably the funniest British movie from "Withnail and I", but to say it's the taste I got is something gross (sic) underestimation.
