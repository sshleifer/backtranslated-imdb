I would like to present the following phrase. <br /> <br /> During the bridge scene, soldiers are seen in the ford in the ford and ask to be led away and try to escape. Some soldiers approach Captain Willard's boat and try to carry suitcases with them. Soldiers are not issued or carrying suitcases to the combat zone. They have duffel bags, packages and footlockers, but not suitcases. The use of the suitcase in this scene is absurd and unruly. In addition, if you look closely, you will see that the trunk is floating on top of the water. This is probably a very good sign that it is empty, otherwise it would fall.
