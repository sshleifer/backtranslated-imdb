I loved this series and I was very sad when I saw it. Yes, it is Christian and traditionally also. It deals with some of the hard issues, as the second reviewer points out, but I think it depends on your view of these issues, and as a teenager growing up and now as a mother myself, I was so glad I saw a TV series that was clean and, frankly, , wonderful! Unlike other reviewers, I was happy to see them dealing with a condom. Instead of hearing the typical wisdom of washing on condoms, they showed the son that he was actually working on being chaste and applying it to his later relationships that were pure and divine to him, making him much safer (100%!) . br /> <br /> After watching this whole series, you become extremely attached to all the characters in the family and outside the family (once they settle more permanently) and the moral values ​​they teach in each episode are invaluable. I found Angela's Toucheda (made by the same producer) to be here and there (but I liked it overall), but this series, in my opinion, was much better and had a better performance. . It was good for the whole family and was interesting for the whole family, which was a huge plus. The family was not excellent, they had their own mistakes, but in the long run they did what was right and saw them grow and change and fight like any real family. It was my favorite show at the time and will always be on top of my list, I hope it will come out on DVD!
