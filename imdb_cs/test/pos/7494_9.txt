It's a hell of a good movie, with some startling twists, a good cast and a great script. Just a few stupid pieces like the Rasta hit-man scene (But this guy is a professional?), But it has already been commented. The fact that I only heard one guy at work, mentioned it earlier and didn't have many opinions or reviews, which would make him even more enjoyable. It gets a higher score than some people might think they deserve, but I have to deal with a low budget and a good casting effort. I feel bad that some movies get into a budget whose budget is equal to that of a small country, with exaggerated dismissal, good reviews, a director and / or actors who are Olympic actors, and who will be disappointed with the actors going through rolemi. and uninspired directing, with predictable plot lines and a story with holes in it so big, Sandra Bullock could take a bus loaded with a bomb. (Examples are, in my opinion, Terminal, Castaway, Matrix: Revolutions) Extra points are awarded to the wardrobe department that chooses great clothing for the cast, especially Paulina Porizci who wears rubber dress on one stage, and a "c * nt" jacket. on the back of the big letters in another! The sex scene that shows off her hard ass and a good soundtrack, bonuses are added! " And PLEASE, enough to compare with Tarantino, it didn't remind me of Tarantino's flickâ€¦ and Tarantino borrows virtually every idea he ever had from other movies! While this is your opinion, we say that when a particular film or book is written or managed in one way, no one can ever use the same ideas again? recover yourself. This film has its own style.
