This film is a love story set in the background of the war. Everything about the film was perfect. I saw the movie yesterday and I want to buy my own DVD and watch it many times. The story ends as it started. I was very happy to come back and I was proud of her that I became a doctor and fulfilled her father's dream. She honored her father, her husband-friend and her lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also a phenomenal actor. Some stories have happy endings. Aside from the love story, I was wondering how a beautiful, calm and calm island was struck by war, and that made me realize that a true devastating war might have on its people ... the government decides while people suffer. Her father was a very educated man and wanted more for his daughter when she had regular dreams. I loved the scene where she complains that she doesn't get dowry, and I also loved the scene where they both lived by the earthquake. They were survivors.
