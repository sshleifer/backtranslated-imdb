For years I had a distant memory of watching this movie, I was looking at the net to find it somewhere and couldn't find it anywhere, so I thought it must have disappeared. BEFORE ... my gran showed me the box kit she sent to the Daily Mail, and although there is nothing decent, but to my great surprise among the other gems belonged The Water Babies! I wasn't so excited for so long! It's a great lightweight movie, songs aren't memorable probably if I was a kid when it came out that I would get stuck in my mind more. Unfortunately, it was just a movie I watched on my grans 10 years ago when I was a little impatient. And watching it now animation is terrible! and re-recored voices that make getting wealth to sound in movies is absolutely gone! But who cares that these kids never think about these things, even when they are a boy about 10 years old and sounds like a boy in the middle of puberty. <br /> <br /> Great classic movie for kids!
