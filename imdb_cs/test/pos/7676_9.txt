I've been looking for this movie for years. I have great memories of first-class acting and singing in this movie. I never knew that the reason why the film was unreachable was due to the action of the Gershwin family - SHAME ON THEM for trying to suppress the American Classic !! I can only hope that they will succeed and allow this film to be published and used by the American public. Sammy Davis, Jr. The only other performance of his game is that it's the same, it was "Anna Lucasta" - another amazing movie I would like to release on DVD. Porgy & Bess featured a first-class, stellar cast. Hopefully one day you'll see for yourself.
