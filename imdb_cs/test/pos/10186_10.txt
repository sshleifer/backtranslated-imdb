It is the best 3-D experience Disney has at their themeparks. This is definitely better than their original 1960s movie, which is in its place, is better than the "Honey I Shrunk The Audience" league (and much more fun), barely throws MuppetVision 3-D movie on Disney-MGM Even beat the original 3-D "Movie Experience" captain EO. This film will experience some of Disney's greatest music hits from Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and more, and brought a smile on my face throughout the show. It is also a film that is completely child friendly, unlike "Honey ..." and has more effects than the spectacular "MuppetVision"
