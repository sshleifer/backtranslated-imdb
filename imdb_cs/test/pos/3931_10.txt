I don't think I'm alone when I say that 2005 was not particularly kind for a horror genre. While "Cursed", "Hide and Seek", "The Ring Two" and "The Amityville Horror" all showed glimpses of interest and potential, there were more than hits. For proof, see: "White Noise", "Boogeyman", "The Jacket", "Mindhunters" and "Alone in the Dark". Imagine my surprise when "House of Wax", firmly written by siblings Chad and Carey Hayes, proved to be ... well, surprise. Carly Jones (Elisha Cuthbert) is a young woman traveling with her troubled brother, Nick (Chad Michael Murray) and friend, Wade (Jared Padalecki). They are, along with Paige (Paris Hilton), Blake (Robert Ri'chard), and Dalton (Jon Abrahams), hoping to score tickets to the final football match of the season. Along the way, they get into some car trouble, and are forced to enter a desolate city where nothing is what it seems to be. <br /> <br /> When he heard this, remake of the classic Vincent Price B-, I rolled my eyes. I didn't even want to think about what Jaume Serra, the first-year disaster director, had prepared for her audience. At a time when the most prominent horror movies are disappointing, latent with poor writing, static direction, and amateur acting, I find it happy that Serra and the Hayes brothers have taken on a good, old fashioned, haunted festival. Unlike the disappointments I named earlier, this film does not take any strikes and uses every movie trick in the book to give everyone exactly what they came up with. I'm glad that Hayes took the time and effort to create likeable and credible characters, making events that are much more urgent. It also gives young actors who portray them. As she did in "The Girl Next Door," Elisha Cuthbert shows the audience what a really skilled actress is. In the 2003 remake of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", Jessica Biel silenced the naysayers by providing raw and emotional performance, the one he gave the viewer there with her. Here Cuthbert does the same. Chad Michael Murray ("Cinderella Story"), in one of his first mature roles, is no Nick like Nick. Murray radiates charisma and hard edge, as well as some impressive athletics on top of it. Murray and Cuthbert gel perfectly and have tangible, familiar chemistry. More than anything else, the press and the American public have made a field day about Paris Hilton's main debut. As I expected, Hilton is not ashamed. In fact, he is as good as anyone in the movie (with what you want). Like Cuthbert and Murray, Hilton has a presence on the screen. She's sexy and playful. I don't think one of the reasons she got to the worst movie was different than just collecting on her. Jared Padalecki (television 'Gilmore Girls') has overcome his underwriting role. Robert Ri'chard (TV series "Cousin Skeeter") and Jon Abrahams ("Meet Your Parents") have little to do with him, but they did the job. With a single scene, Damon Herriman ("Soar") makes an unforgettable impression, and his presence hangs over the rest of the film. Finally, Brian Van Holt ("Basic") is excellent and threatening in a dual role. Kudos has to go to the screenwriters once more to avoid clich√© whenever possible. Despite the popular opinion, "Wax House" is quite unpredictable for most of its run time. Take this for example: It seems the killer is for the Earl and Carly bends down to get something from his pockets. What do you expect? Watch the movie and understand what I mean. It is also refreshing to see a horror movie in which the characters also show a modicum of good meaning. Unlike most horror scores, John Ottman is never distracted by exciting work. However, as with other Dark Castle news, the visual aspects of "wax" are cost-worthy, and pick up the film over its genre traps. Ghouistic imagery is highlighted by cameraman Stephen F. Windon, designer Graham Walker, art director Nicholas McCallum and editor Joel Negron. Speaking of paintings, I believe that gore hounds will be thrilled with the many makeup effects and tricks in the shop here. Every scene of death is more than the last stomach. Given his past in music videos and commercials, it is clear that Jaume Serra has a great look at style. His "in-your-face" approach is a great asset to the success of this film. Just when you think the camera turns around, no. Particularly good is the construction of thick layers of fear and atmosphere. One standout shot is our introduction to the killer slowly emerging from the trap. In that case, I would usually admit that when I'm in a minority (Shut up, yeah? "House of 1000 corpses"!). In this case, I firmly decided that the critics were wrong. I'm not sure why people are so strong on this movie because it's much better than recent genre recordings. Maybe she's afraid to admit that a Paris Paris horror movie might be worthy of watching ... Who knows? This is a horror movie that is extremely stylish and effective. As a lifelong fan of horror, I can only say that I enjoyed the "Wax House" in all its sheer and sadistic fame. I consider it a great success in modern horror as well as (along with "Sin City") the first completely satisfactory edition of 2005.
