I remember reading a C4 film a year ago and blowing the whole thing away. I thought the film could represent such a variety of genres; supernatural, love story, crime intrigue and many more. After a minute I was addicted to the whole thing and I was really concerned about the characters. I felt I was scared for Jimmy in one second, and then I laughed at the gangsters in the next ... and I had my fingers crossed all the time that it could be for Jimbo! Heath Ledger and Rose Bryne are great, Bryan Brown is absolute quality, and I got swept up, along with David Field, who was both fun and evil. Since I saw this movie I managed to order it on DVD and the result is that every person I show it was connected in a similar way. This film is perfect for a Sunday afternoon or lazy evening. that you can really appreciate with your friends around.
