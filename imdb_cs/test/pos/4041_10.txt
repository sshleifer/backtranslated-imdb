I know a girl who made figure skating for a leading girl. She used to go out with my brother and she was always nice! I also live in Cranbrook B.C, about 15 minutes from Steele Fortress. I went there for trips when I was in elementary school. It was a little strange to see it in the movie. I also had a chance when the movie was filming to be extra because there was a casting call for them in the mall. Now I absolutely wished I did. That was such an amazing movie that I bought from Ebay. I never came out here (which is a kind of weird vision that it was partially filmed), so I was excited when it came. I really loved the story and the bear poler was a little cute. But if someone has a question about Fort Steele, ask off :)
