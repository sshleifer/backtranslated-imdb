"Egyptian" is set during the reign of one of the most fascinating figures of the ancient world, Pharaoh Akhnaton, which, thirteen centuries before Christ attempted to introduce a monotheistic religion, Atenism, to ancient Egypt. But the main character is not Akhnaton, but rather a fictional Sinuhe. As a child, Sinuhe is found mysteriously floating in a basket on the Nile River and adopted by physician Senmut and his wife. When he grows up into masculinity, he follows his adoptive father into a medical profession, initially working (as his father did) among poor cities, but he and his friend, an ambitious young soldier, Horemheb, are in the forefront. Pharaoh's life on a hunting expedition in the desert. Sinuhe is appointed forensic physician but becomes obsessed with Babylonian courtesan Nefer. Sinuhe not only destroys himself in a futile attempt to win his love, but is also disgusted when his neglect of his duties means he is unable to save the life of Akhnaton's daughter. Sinuhe flees to exile, where he achieves success as a healer in neighboring countries, but returns to Egypt when he learns of an attack on Hittite. Although Ahnaton willingly forgives him his previous offenses, Sinuhe finds the land in riots. Pharaoh's attempts to introduce a new religion have led to civil disputes between his followers and the old polytheist faith priests, and he is by nature too quiet to take any action to face the Hittite threat. Sinuhe becomes involved in the plot of Horemheb, now General of the Egyptian Army, and Akhnaton's sister Princess Baketamon overthrow the Pharaoh and replace him with a more effective monarch. Film weaknesses mostly result from his two romantic subplots. In the course of the film, Sinuhe is revealed as a long-lost son by the previous Pharaoh and half-brother Akhnaton and Baketamon. So it might surprise the modern audience to fall in love with it; the marriage between the brothers and sisters was not necessarily considered the standards of Egyptian royalty for incest, but the standards of viewers of the 1950s were generally less liberal at this point. In any case, the love triangle of Horemheb-Baketamon-Sinuhe is an unnecessary complication and lightens Baketamon's role in the film, the voice of the cool cynical Realpolitik. Nefer's subplot, which occupies most of the first hour of the film, is rewritten and excessively melodramatic. Nefer is morally worthless, but fascinating, and the role needed an actress with great beauty and great dramatic skill to become credible, especially since Nefer has a difficult task of winning Sinuhe from a woman just as beautiful as Jean Simmons (who plays merit, Sinuhe's rival) about her affection). It is therefore unfortunate that the role went to an actress as comically incompetent as Bella Darvi, whose only qualification was to be producer's mistress Darryl F. Zanuck. Darvi was not just a wooden actress, but he also spoke with a thick foreign accent that was even more incomprehensible to the lisp. Compared to the two legendary Hollywood beauties in the movie that Simmons and Gene Tierney play Baketamon, she wasn't so attractive. The film is better when it focuses on major political and religious themes. Other actors are better than Darvi, although Peter Ustinov, as a servant of Sinuhe Kaptah, makes the same mistake as in "Spartacus," an effort to bring comical relief to a film that doesn't need it. His voice, yet, was too patrician for the "comic servant" role. Edmund Purdom, a little-known British actor, was pushed into the lead role when Marlon Brando pulled out at the last minute, but more than adequately fills his big man's shoes, though his acting style was completely different. He will well cope with the challenge of showing changes in Sinuhe's character, from a secular idealist to a loving fool, to an angry cynic to an enlightened visionary of the final scenes. Victor Mature was never the most prominent actor, but he is well suited to the role of Horemheb, a practical man who works on earth. He is better than he was in his other 1954 epic, "Demetrius and Gladiators". Simmons is brilliantly beautiful as merit. Michael Wilding (so far best known as Elizabeth Elisabeth) plays Akhnaton as counselor-king who ends up being a kind of holy fool. His inability to make difficult decisions makes him an inappropriate ruler, but he has a prophetic vision of peace and justice that lends him air of moral greatness beyond those who hope to replace him on the throne. Although Aten had more in common with the Supreme Being of the Deists than with the Old Testament of Jehovah or the Trinity Christian God, there is a rather deliberate attempt to draw parallels between Atenism and Christianity. In the film, the symbol of Atenist "ankh" is undoubtedly chosen because of its similarity to the cross, but in fact it was a common Egyptian hieroglyph for life, not unique to Atenism. The Akhnaton language often has a biblical circle; his comparison with the "wind whistling in the desert" recalls the "voice screaming in the wild" by John the Baptist (hence the title of this review). Sinuhe's finding in the river is parallel to Moses' Old Testament story. At the end of Sinuhe, the heir to the dead spirit of Akhenaten, he reaches his own moral size. The message of the film is that while we may need practical people of action like Horemheb, we also need visionaries and thinkers ready to ask the question "why?" For all his mistakes, "Egyptian" is a film that is idealistic and humane in its approach to both religion and politics. 7/10
