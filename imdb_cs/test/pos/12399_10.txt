As a cameraman, I couldn't help but admire the great look that this image achieved. The performance was excellent, just like the story. Just when I thought the movie was going to slow down, no. Hearts pounding tension, great stimulation through cuts and scores that know when to be quiet come together under a competent and competent direction. The camera has always been in the right place. I love it.
