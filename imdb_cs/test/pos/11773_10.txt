This is my favorite movie of all time. It's the best science fiction spoof ever; The fact that it was sending out Star Wars, it all improved. I love slapstick. Think about it as Marx brothers or Three Stoogs encounter Star Wars. Writing is merry. The effects are terrible. The free association, which continues, guarantees all kinds of things coming from the left field. (I almost wet my pants when the Wookie Monster brought the princess.) <br /> <br /> The spatial balls were a much longer film, but it only had about 15 minutes of good material and I felt a little torn after, like buying a burger which has proved to be mostly filler. Hardware wars, though only about 15 minutes long, would be worth paying the price, IMO.
