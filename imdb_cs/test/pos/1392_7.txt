Claude (Claudio Cassinelli) and several prisoners from his sunken ship were washing up on Edmond Rackham (Richard Johnson). After several accidental deaths, Rackham takes Claude and his two remaining prisoners. Fortunately for everyone, Barbara Bach just on the island too! Unfortunately, there are crazy fishermen who like to kill people. It seems that this Italian exploiter has everything - a touch of CREATURE FROM BLACK LAGOON mixed with DR. MOREAU with hyphen WHITE ZOMBIE voodoo and Atlantis. Despite some gloomy views of the fisherman, the film benefits from some beautiful photography and a nice twist halfway. All actors are good and Joseph Cotton even appears as an old biologist. Director Sergio Martino is doing well enough because it's always 10 minutes. It cannot be said for his belated following of FISHMEN AND THEIR QUEEN (1995), easily one of the worst and most off-base sequels from HIGHLANDER II.
