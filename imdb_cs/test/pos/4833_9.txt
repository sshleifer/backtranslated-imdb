This film is bone cooling in a way that is hard to describe. While it is fairly accurate in describing the events leading up to the subsequent investigation of the first World Trade Center destruction attempt in 1993, which is now seen after 9/11, it is almost unbearable. It would be a mistake to say this movie prophetic, but surely it's a common playground wisdom "deceive me with one shame on you, fool me twice shame on me" come to life. Our government has learned nothing of the 1993 World Trade Center attempt and the subsequent reading of the September 11 report shows that many of the mistakes that led to the 1993 bombing were repeated. Some people have criticized the first and fourth Amendments of the US Constitution, which are partly responsible for making Islamic terrorists able to fulfill their evil plans, but this is poorly conducted in all possible ways. <br /> <br /> People who argue this argument do not support a ban on free speech, free press, or religious freedom? I certainly hope they do not support our government officials who could break into any person's home or office to seek without or without permission. The fact is that the FBI, the INS and even the local police could get warrants based on the information available to them, but decided for various reasons. Besides, no matter how disgusting or ignorant it is, it's not illegal to talk badly about America or its leaders. Nor is it unlawful either for own weapons or for prayer for Mecca. Consider this until Lee Harvey Oswald actually fires his rifle at President John Kennedy, in fact, has not broken any laws. Life in a free society has its disadvantages. Yet, the road to paradise is a necessity to see a movie that I fear will never see many people. As far as I know, it's not on the DVD and 2007 is its tenth anniversary and there are no known revivals. I'm not really surprised, people don't like to document their failures, and this movie certainly shows that the various agencies that were supposed to protect us didn't do their job properly and for the most beautiful reasons, such as jurisdictional quarrels and refusing to share information. This is a shame as the journey to paradise is well done and grabbed and as many have said earlier, the last scene where Ramzi Yousef (played by Art Malik), a bomber who built a truck bomb that was used in the first Attempting to destroy two towers, flies After the World Trade Center after its capture and release simply says "Next time we will both bring down" is a film moment that froze me for a few minutes on the spot.
