This movie is excellent! Fear of watching documentaries? Cancel your scale and watch the little Dieter's story. You will not believe how compelling this fine piece of film is until you have experienced it. I am eager to say that even every Vietnam war movie, including Apocalypse Now, goes out. It's a real story, it's a personal story, a story of love for flying, a dream of being a pilot, and a nightmare being shot down over the enemy's territory. Everything is filmed in the "return to ..." style - Herzog asks questions on the spot, Dieter answers them in a memorable German-English accent and with a gentle memory of what happened where about 25 years ago. There's this part that I told again and again to my friends: getting out of the US Navy, Dieter becomes a Vietcong prisoner of war. For most of the days, he blindfolded himself in the jungle of Southeast Asia for miles and miles â€” bare feet. Torture, insult, disorientation, starvation and infectious wound cover arrive at a small, friendly village where they spend the night. The next morning, after a few hours of walking, Dieter discovers that someone has stolen a wedding ring from his finger. This is it. He can no longer take anything. She starts crying because of total exhaustion. Vietcong's men react in surprise. Dieter can explain what happened. Immediately the group returns to the village and begins searching for the person who stole the ring. They will find the man, immediately cut his finger and return the ring to Dieter. - The film is full of these amazing and surprising situations. Huge cultural differences, clashes of exits and west, fear of the unknown (ie, all that stands on the one hand for America, the Asian jungle and its secrets on the other) can be perceived as a whole film. Back problems? That's because you sat on the edge of your seat for two hours and didn't notice.
