This is the kind of movie you rent when you are incredibly tired or otherwise damaged ... The acting in this movie is so bad that it seems intentional, and to know how bad special effects are, there's one scene when puppets come to life where you see most of the hand holding a puppet moving around it. The film seemed to be filmed with a video camera. When I saw this movie for the first time, fistfight almost exploded when we were with my friends and I called each other names from this movie, it was terrible. If you like angry at movies, I suggest you, otherwise, flee as if your life depended on it.
