This is not so much of a review because it is evidence that it has been proven again that the Academy rewards money, not artistic achievements. And I have to say that I am saddened that this usually artistic and intelligent group of imbd members has left this at the top of 250. Boogie Nights is powerful, raw and gutsy through script, direction and acting. Very few movies can qualify for this triple crown.
