Christine Lahti (Sandy Dunlap) and Mary Tyler Moore (Holly Davis) worked well with soap material, Ted Danson did the best with the ungrateful role of Chip Davis. The premise that both ladies friendship, one seemingly happily married woman and a second career woman who is aware of her biological ticking clock. I found a relationship that had the character Ted Danson with one woman played by Christine Lahti. He behaved in a caddist way, but left two widows behind him. I found it nasty when Sandy told him he wanted to interrupt him after meeting his wife, telling her she was missing (calling his wife? He acted like a heel. Maybe it would make a more interesting movie if he wasn't killed. I would love the friendship between the two ladies, but it was spoiled by what they had in common: The husband's husband.
