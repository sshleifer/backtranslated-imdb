I saw this movie many years ago, and I hated it completely - I couldn't wait to end it, and I left but the girl was sleeping on my shoulder. You know what? I have never forgotten this film and I would say that it has been haunting me with my paintings and music over the years. How many movies I cried and laughed in the cinema, then I forgot, once I hit the street like ... you see, I can't even think of one! Rarer are movies like Death in Venice that enter your consciousness and change. The French say that film is art and movies like this prove they are right. I give him 10 stars, from 3, which I gave the night I saw it.
