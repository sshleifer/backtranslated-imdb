With some wine, friends, and some good humor, I had a really good time watching this movie. I especially enjoyed the performance of Jilon Ghai (like "Randy"), who was such a kick in his pants! His scenes with Charity Rahmer ("Michelle") were wildly fun. I wouldn't want him to come to me, but it was great to watch "Randy" and try to score "Michelle" and even better see the results! Of course, the girls in the movie are also fun to watch. And my friend showed me the PLAYBOY problem that Pilar Lastru had as Playmate of the Month. She's definitely a seeker. All in all, this film has fully served its purpose, to entertain us in a light and carefree way.
