Dirty Harry goes to Atlanta, which Burt called a fantastic, first-class detective thriller who borrowed part of his plot from the venerable Dan Andrews movie "Laura". Not only does Burt Reynolds play in this amazing saga, but he also encouraged her and made no mistake, neither staging an action, nor casting his characters. It's not a bad performance in the movie and Reynolds does an excellent job directing. Henry Silva is really icy as a hit-man. Detective Tom Sharky (Burt Reynolds) is a narcotics case underground in Atlanta when everything goes wrong. They whistle for chasing the suspect and shooting him at the shooter for the bus. An innocent bystand dies during melee. John Woo's "The Killer" replicates this scene. By the way, Atlanta Police Department will arrest Burt on Vice and he will take orders from the new boss, Frisca (Charles Durning of "Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou?") In the basement. Sharks are returning to the real cesspool of crime. Sharky and his fellow detectives Arch (Bernie Casey) and Papa (Brian Keith) have set up supervision of the cost-effective girl Dominoe (Rachel Ward of "After Dark, My Sweet") who has a luxury apartment she shares with another girl. . Dominoe sees local politician Hotchkins (Earl Holliman of the "police woman") on the Governor's side, but Victor (Vittorio Gassman "The Dirty Game") wants to end the affair. Hotchkins is reluctant to accommodate Victor, so Victor has cocaine snorting Billy's score (Henry Silva from "Wipeout") quits Dominoe. Billy throws a twelve-inch pizza hole in the Dominoe door and kills her. Sharky did unthinkable. Dominoe had fallen in love with the sight of becoming infatuated with her. Sharky's mission in life is now to defeat Victor, but he learns that Victor has an informant inside Atlanta Police Department. The plot really warms up when Sharky finds out later that Billy shot a bad girl and that Dominoe is still alive! Sharky takes her into protective custody and things grow even more complicated. He assembles his "machine" title to deal with Victor and his pupa. The wide-angle lens of William Fraker's action is immaculate. Unfortunately, this totally underrated classic is only available as a full screen movie. Fraker definitely contributes to the atmosphere of the picture, especially during the mutilation scene when a villain cut off one of Sharky's fingers. This is a somewhat shameful scene. Burt never made a movie that would surpass the Sharky's Machine.
