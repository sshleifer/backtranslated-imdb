"Opera" is a great movie with some amazing, imaginative images. The opera singer (Cristina Marsillach) is watched by a murderer who forces her to watch him murder everyone he knows by pulling her down and recording the needles under her eyes. the needles come from the fact that Argento doesn't like people covering their eyes while watching his movies. "For years I have been pissed off by people covering their eyes during gorier moments in my movies. I want people to see them and avoid the positive confrontation of their fears by looking away. So I thought," How would it be possible to achieve this goal and force someone to follow the worst murder and make sure they can't avert their answer I came up with is the core of what "opera" is about. "- says Argento. . One guy is stabbed in the throat with a knife causing a gushing blow, Daria Nicolodi gets shot in the eyes while l ooking over the peephole, etc.For someone who doesn't catch one more, try it.
