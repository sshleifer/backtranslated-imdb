Too much added with too much away from the Great Western, which was written by McMurtry about Texas Rangers vs Ind. This scenario takes it just to fill this mini series with many warm fuzzy relationships that were actually secondary to the main story. It ends in a totally incredible and separate end that is not written in a book that challenges you to be transported to Lonesome Dove. The protagonists of the series were very good in the truth, the filming of the places was excellent, but this mini series should remain true to what is a great book.
