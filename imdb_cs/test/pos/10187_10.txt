It's not a movie, but an experience! Not the usual eye candy I thought it would be. Too many things happen all at once, your senses can hardly handle it. The latest technology product (we were torn between just sitting in order to enjoy the show and turn on and off the 3D glasses to decipher the spell), the music is great (it's a concert!), Disney characters are in it (and get to BE your world), it's funny, it's magical, it's exciting - I know it starts to sound like advertising - but it's really amazing! Beats Christmas in bringing a baby in you! <br /> <br /> This attraction itself already makes going to Disney all worth it. ;)
