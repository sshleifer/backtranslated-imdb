I don't play video games at all, but my kids do it. <br /> <br /> I got a big kick. Would you like to see more of this type of movie. "very cool" as my youngest would say. Interesting characters and overall story were interesting. As I said, I don't play video games, but I think I will like it. It was not full of bad language and that is a nice change. This visual concept was different, which impressed me. And the soundtrack was pretty good. I could even try some of the games my sons play to see this movie. Who knows I'll be a player once.
