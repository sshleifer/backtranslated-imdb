My wife and I saw it when we were 17. The only good thing my father did (inside). This is "our movie" and music is "our songs". The song Michelle is "our" song. Yeah, today, it's a crime to show naked children on screen, but we were at 16, why not these kids? The film's rich boy impregnates poor girls, then a rich dad steals him away from her at the end, after giving birth under impoverished conditions. She's alone with the baby. It's a love story and a "grow up" story. Music is fantastic and the story is one that every person could apply to. It can be once it will be posted on DVD.
