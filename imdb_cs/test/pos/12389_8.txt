He held me on the edge of my seat. It is true that this story has several conspiracies, but its total tension, the way the director just keeps on being just fascinating. José Coronado and Adriana Ozores are the two best Spanish actors (see La vida mancha and Héctor) and appear as a happy middle-class couple. Under all this, it is true that Coronado's life is a lie. He is not an economist, never went to college or worked in the Spanish central bank reserve, as everyone else believes. We will get some observations about how he kept his appearance, or he is doing it, and although it is not very credible, he is still somewhat believable. The internal functioning of fraud is displayed intermittently, but is trusted because Coronado is a source of self-confidence and assertiveness. Not only does he believe in fraud, but he also believes in film premise and therefore carries it. Certainly, he is testing the belief that his wife will not know the inner workings of marriage finances for almost 10 years, but again, because he is said to be a great economist. It has been said, in a nationalistic tone, that the film is not "clearly Spanish" as if it were a litmus test of good film. True, no castanets or strange handbags in this, just a tense thriller. You will want to know how this story ends once you start watching.
