I first saw this film in 1959 at Hoyts Double Bay in Sydney when I was fifteen years old. I loved it then and all the time. Casting the file is great - these days the actors acted "naturally" and you "felt" for them in the respective roles. "Glossy" film periods - relationships in it are still relevant to today's world, but now the sexes are on the same level, women should not or should not afford the type of treatment shown in the past. Soundtrack music is amazing and it's a pleasure that Film Score Monthly has released a CD in January 2005. Pity scenes have been cut before release - you want more for two hours! I signed up on Amazon on DVD (now have a special page). To view this movie in CinemaScope after forty-six years pan and scan will be great. Twentieth Century Fox, please see the 50th CinemaScope DVD Catalog for DVDs - there's a big market. Expecting Coming from USA, March 2004 Vanity Fair A special article about a movie that is said to have fifteen pages with many photos on the scene. Cheers.
