Realistic championship. Thirty years later, pictures can look a little old, but in fact, it just exact 'fist in the face' effect of the film. I've never seen a movie like this in my life.

It's the best ever critical movie of the company. The ultimate movie that shows the system is down. And the system hasn't changed much in thirty years. I think this film would have to be viewed as an educational piece.
