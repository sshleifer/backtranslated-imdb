I felt that this movie had a lot of heart and had to work for Eleanor Bergstein. Primary actors (Campbell Scott, Jennifer Beals, Yancy Butler, James Goodwin III, Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron) were very well chosen and played their games with perfection. It was a very uplifting movie that I wanted to be available on tape or DVD. Precious gemstone.
