1983 saw a strange phenomenon; Two Rival Bond Movies. "Octopussy", starring Roger Moore, was part of the official Cubby Broccoli franchise book. "Never Say Never Again", produced by a competing producer, is, in addition to the horrible "Casino Royale", the only Bond movie that does not form part of this series. His great attraction was that he brought the original Bond, Sean Connery; his title allegedly derived from Connery's remark after "Diamonds Are Forever" that he would never play anymore. Some complained that Connery was, on 53, too old for the role, but he was in fact three years younger than his successor Moore, who not only did "Octopussy" in the same year but continued to make another Bond movie, \ t "Look at killing", two years later. The film owes its existence to a film rights dispute to Ian Fleming's work. It is perhaps unfortunate that the terms of the agreement included a clause that the new film had to be a remake of "Thunderball", as it was perhaps not the greatest of Connery Bonds. (Remake of "Dr No" or "Goldfinger" could work better). The storyline is much the same as the storyline of an earlier film; SPECTER, a terrorist organization, acting together with a megalomaniac mogul named Largo, stole two US nuclear warheads and attempts to dominate world governments by ransom by threatening to detonate them unless they receive a huge sum of money. It is, of course, Bond to save the world by watching missing missiles. The film is fortunate to have not only one but two of the most beautiful girls of all, Barbara. Carrera as a seductive but deadly Fatima Blush and Kim Basinger as Largo's girlfriend Domino who learns Bond after learning about her lover's bad plans. The number of Bond films has a plot that hangs on the hero's ability to win over a villainous mistress or female accomplice - there are similar developments, for example, in "Goldfinger", "Live and Let Die" and "Alive Daylights". In the official series, Bond's ally is normally considered a woman's lead, but here Carrera, playing hilarious, is charged over Basinger, who was a relatively unknown actress at the time. Of course, Basinger has become one of Hollywood's biggest stars, while Carrera is one of many Bond girls who have gone out of sight. From the villains Max von Sydow effective Blofeld, head of SPECTER, but Klaus Maria Brandauer seemed too kind and not as threatening as Largo, except perhaps during the "Domination" game, more sophisticated variations on those violent computer games as "Space Invaders" that were so popular in the early 1980s. Brandauer can be an excellent actor in his native German, in films like "Mephisto" and "Oberst Redl", but he doesn't get so much in English. One of the features of the film is that both follow the normal Bond formula and sometimes deviate from it. There is a standard world-in-danger, sequence pursuit, a series of exotic sites, charming women, sinister villains and a specially written theme song based on the film's title. However, there is no extended sequence of preliminary credits and we see some familiar characters in a new light. For example, Bond's boss M becomes a slack, hopeful aristocrat, his American colleague Felix Leiter is portrayed black for a single time, and scientist Q is portrayed by Alec McCowen as a disillusioned cynic with (despite his characteristically upper-class Christian name Algernon) a strong emphasis on working class. There is also a fun portrait by Rowan Atkinson as a blunt British diplomat. Although Connery may not have been as good as he has been in some of his earlier films in this role, this ringing of changes on a familiar theme is one of the most memorable bonds. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Impression. Rowan Atkinson says he is from the British Embassy in Nassau. As, however, the Bahamas is a Commonwealth country, Britain would have a high commission in its capital, not an embassy.
