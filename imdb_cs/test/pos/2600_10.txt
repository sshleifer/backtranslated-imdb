"Hunting Trilogy" of Fire Rabbit (1951), Rabbit Spice (1952), and Duck! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be considered a comedy brand waterworks collaboration by Chuck Jones-Michael Maltese. While in the lists of "biggest" or "most important" cartoons in the history of animation are rarely mentioned, they are certainly FUNNIEST movies I've ever seen. Michael Maltese has never received recognition that directors like Jones, Freleng or Avery have been given, but it's his dialogue and the situations that Warner Bros. makes. cartoons, and these three in particular, some FUNNIEST ever done.
