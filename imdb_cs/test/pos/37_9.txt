This is by far one of the best biographical films of recent times. I'll go so far as to be there with Ray and the Aviator. It is the story of a young, racial boy who lives in a guest house run by the amazing Miss Rachael aka "Nanny". You will fall in love with Nanny, the woman who gives herself all around her. S. Epatha Merkerson will beautifully bring the character to life and the other cast members are the same. If I praised every actor for the way they played their roles, I'd have to mention everyone in the cast. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie fits perfectly with the story, almost dictating the way it goes. What's more, this movie is really fun. You won't be bored for even a minute! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to spend the evening at home watching a very clever, very entertaining and quality movie.
