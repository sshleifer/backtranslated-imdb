This has one of the more unusual lands I've seen in a horror movie, but is based on a good, solid Universal Studios: Lots of monsters, pretty heroes, villagers with torches. But my favorite part is Larry Talbot (The Wolf Man) looking for a cure for his lycanthropy. After dying in the original "Wolf Men", he is resurrected and wanders over "Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man" and "House of Frankenstein" to seek a way to end his suffering. I think the first viewers will find his search in this movie very interesting. <br /> <br />
