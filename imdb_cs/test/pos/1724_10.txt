I write after I saw the last episode in the UK, and for me it must be hard work to keep the standard. The last episode shown, "Blink", has elements of Gothic horror that have to do with statues that aren't exactly what they seem. Doctor and Martha don't look much, but it doesn't hurt a well-made episode. The general standard is built on a high level and the last three episodes, two parte with "The Family" and the last one that was, were the best the current team did. Only David Tennant holds him together. It is worth waiting for those waiting for Series 3 abroad.
