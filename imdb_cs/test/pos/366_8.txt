It's a well done piece from every favorite tension master. As usual, technical features such as camera work and lighting are excellent (especially for movie time). I didn't find the first part of the movie very exciting, but the other one definitely made it one exciting scene after another. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was choosing Farley Granger as part of Guy Haines. Somehow I didn't consider him very believable. On the other hand, Robert Walker shines like a sinister 'evil' Bruno Anthony. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would highly recommend it.
