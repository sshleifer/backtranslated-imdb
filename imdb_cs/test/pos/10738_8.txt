After decades of turbulent riots, American films began to switch and change their cameras from war battlefields, political corruption, and general social unrest to a more intimate world of family dysfunction. The toll of the selfish Baby Boomers began to take on the American family when they grew up and had their own children to feel. "Kramer vs. Kramer" is one of the first of these dysfunctional family dramas that will continue to be so popular during the 1980s, and is one of the best. That's a bum of rap, because it's known as a movie that beat the "Apocalypse Now" for the 1979 Best Picture Academy award, but comparing these two films is like comparing bananas to marinated chicken breasts: they're not remotely the same, but we can't both enjoy them? Robert Benton does not try to do anything with his film; his power lies in his performances, those of Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep in particular, playing a divorced couple fighting childishly and selfishly over their son. The courtroom scene where they lead her to custody and in which everyone is forced to hurt another in terrible ways, is devastating and authentic. The film does not represent Hoffman's solid dad as a hero, or Streep's mother as a villain. They are neither good nor bad as humans - they are just bad in being married. The movie is a jerky but not manipulative final. She earns the right to arouse sobs. <br /> <br /> Level: A
