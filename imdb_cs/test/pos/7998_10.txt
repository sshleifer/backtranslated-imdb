This sequel proves that Tim Burton was the best choice ever to manage a Batman movie for all intents and purposes. The story focuses on Bamana for three enemies: a penguin (beautifully played by Danny DeVito) Catwoman (slinky by Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (excellent by Christopher Walken). <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best record of the series has it all: complex themes, complex characters and a dark tone that really excels. The cast is simply amazing, although it's obvious that DeVito is a multi-layered penguin. Here is a man who is evil, sad, funny and perhaps most important, scary. The infamous scene with Shreck's consultants still sends frost over the spine. In other words, casting is simply a pleasure to watch and all turn into first gear. <br /> <br /> I don't hesitate to say that "Batman is back" is my favorite of all Batmans released (sorry, Dark Knight Fans). If you want a superhero movie that has a little more to offer in addition to flashy effects and great action, then please check out this poorly underrated movie. If nothing else, it's at least the best movie Burton has ever done.
