TyNesha Mells. In this drama, Ja rule, who plays like Reggie, struggles with the loss of his father. His old friend J-Bone, who is a cold-blooded thief recently released from prison, helps Reggie find out who murdered his father. A week after his father died, the dead preacher Reverend Packer came. Reggie is supposed to be the one who kills him, is he? Did he kill Reggie Reverend Packer or was that some sort of setting? He also has a few romantic scenes back for the day. You see, Reggie falls in love with the preacher's daughter and J-Bone disagrees with his love. When J-Bone tries to destroy what they have, Reggie learns that love is about forgiveness. But what does J-bone do, does it work? Will Reggie and his girlfriend break or approach them? I like this movie because it wonders what happens next and did it or it happened. I love tension movies! It's like you want to be in the movie to detect things. I also like this movie because everything falls into place if you really pay attention to it!
