This almost documentary view of an enterprising boy who lives in the bodywork area outside of New York is real. Real lighting. Real sound. Less editing in the entire movie than in 1 minute of most movies. And although there are very few scenarios, there's a story. Shot in basic colors, almost all red, white, blue and yellow, we have a real sense of life for a boy who does something out of nothing. He has a place to live that he owns, has a good job, and tries to bring his sister to his little universe. The bunker people also give us a look at this culture I didn't know about. Mostly they seem decent and pay But what seems to be daily, and it seems to be really concerned about its well being. Actor (I think) playing But he says more with one facial expression than you can imagine. This reminded me of what the real little movie can do. It shows what children are capable of, even without much support and love. Definitely recommendable.
