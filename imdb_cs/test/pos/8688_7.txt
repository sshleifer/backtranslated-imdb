Mostly I just like the kind of film that allows a person to escape from the present time into the future or the past. This film is pure espapism. The dance starts almost immediately, and Debra Paget in her "purple harem" bikini dress just doesn't have the same in the movie in my opinion. Her dance, while sultry, is overcome by her dance in Fritz Lang's Tiger Eschnapur, available on DVD, where she played the dancer of Seetha Temple. <br /> <br /> One problem with the movie is the closed setting. There are few outdoor scenes shot, and they as well as other scenes are a bit claustrophobic. The same places are used over and over, but with some interesting secret routes and waterways. Her secret double identity is absolutely incredible with the beauty of this size. Debra even controls the saber and holds 2 enemy soldiers at the stairwell, could do it all. What is work is Debra Paget as a princess. With its beauty it will surely be the center of attention anywhere in history. This movie, if perhaps it becomes available on DVD, will have to buy. All in all, with a bit of humor, I loved it. <br /> <br />
