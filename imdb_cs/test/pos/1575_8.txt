"What Alice Found" was a pleasant discovery. As written and directed by A. Dean Bell, this is a combination of a road movie with a warning story as well as a discovery path. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie, maybe you should stop reading here. Alice is a case study of a young woman who wants to break away from a miserable life that leads in New England. Her pretext for leaving will be her best friend, who studies at the University of Miami. Alice is the product of the mother of one mother who is struggling to face, in stark contrast to the life of carelessness her friend lives. In flashbacks we see Alice's life before we go on the road. Alice, as well as her namesake in "Alice in Wonderland", embarks on a journey to the unknown, to which life has not prepared her. American highways are full of predators in search of weak and innocent. Alice encounters a catastrophe when her car breaks into the road and a friendly southern couple comes to her aid when a strange man approaches the apology he wants to help her. Sandra and Bill convince her to come in their plush R.V. On the way down to the south. Nothing prepared Alice for what this pair would show. After all, in her sheltered life she did not deal with what Sandra and Bill, her new benefactors do during overnight stays at other stops on US roads. It is a shock to her when she realizes that the kind of Sandra is nothing but a prostitute, who in these places encounters trade between the truck driver's population. Alice, greatly played by Emily Grace, is a study of how a young woman wakes up to a new reality that can't escape. In fact, Sandra makes it look so easy that Alice tries her luck on the oldest occupation on earth to raise some badly needed money. Mrs. Ivey is perfect as a seemingly normal woman, no one would suspect that she is doing nasty clients who, along with Bill, are on their way. Mrs. Ivey is amazing when she reveals the truth about her life accusing Alice. As a husband, Bill Raymond is in his portrayal as a good husband that in fact he is an agent. Under the excellent guidance of Mr. Dean Bell, the film is not afraid to go to mainstream sites. Movies don't dare go. We congratulate this director who wrote a credible story and gathered the perfect cast to play it for our benefit.
