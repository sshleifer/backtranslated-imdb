Gilles Mamouni plays with the audience the story of Max (Vincent Cassel) in search of his greatest lost love (Monica Bellucci) just before she got engaged to another woman. Mamouni uses many flashbacks sequences without warning, so the best way to know where we are in the story is to watch the actor's hairstyle. Otherwise, it can be very confusing ... Still a strong film debut for Mamouni, beautifully photographed by Thierry Arbogast (5th Element, Messenger), and Monica Bellucci is a darling who is looking ... gave 9 out of 10.
