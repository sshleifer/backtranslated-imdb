Joe is a movie about the dark side of the 1960s power in America and Susan Sarandon had nice breasts. This film scared me so much when I saw him in the theater that I never liked Peter Boyl until Young Frankenstein and I still bothered him after that comedy. Looking back from today's experience, this film seems to be direct again and up to half of John McCain's voter approval with "Joe The Plumber", and their fear of choosing a black man as US president in the coming weeks. Black Prez would be seen as the sweet revenge of "niggers," but he must bring fire to many minds, if not the streets, this time to Joe enthusiasts. Thus, the spirit of Joe in the movie is resurrected in the Joe Plumber campaign! Nevertheless, I am glad to be an American, and I will be afraid of both, and because they illustrate what ironically Gregory Peck said that our civilized law is also: "living, breathing reality!" God help us.
