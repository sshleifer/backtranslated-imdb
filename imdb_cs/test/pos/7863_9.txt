During the brief period between Clint Eastwood and his Dirty Harry films, he and director Don Siegel teamed up to create this unusual picture. Eastwood plays an injured Union Army Corporal during a civil war who is taken in the South School for Girls until he recovers from his wounds. It's been a long time since young women (most of them seem to be teens) have men on campus, so they are reluctant to turn him to local rebel soldiers. The resulting situations are often humorous, shocking, erotic, or even downright grotesque, as Eastwood is slowly gaining strength and beginning to think about the emergence. The basic story almost sounds like a porn movie. We have a male man suddenly surrounded by young women. Most of them are sexually attracted to him. And he is more than willing to spread love between them. However, the material never slips to a "tasteless" level. Eastwood, Siegel and cameraman Bruce Surtees are such qualified filmmakers that the film always retains its dignity. Eastwood's John McBurney is like no other character he has ever played. McBurney is an amoral, cheerful and lusty charlatan. He knows that most women, even the youngest, want his point and leave more than one of them to him. McBurney often uses flatter to female butter up, then uses his rough good looks to winch them in. He is like a drunk player at a cocktail party, often hitting different women even in the same scene! In the end, his lusty ways cause him a great deal of pain and loss that you have to see for yourself. This author would not dream of revealing the concrete consequences of his actions, but there is no doubt that he should come. Eastwood gives typically great performance. He seems to have a role to play with, until things get really bad, then he turns around and is ugly. Geraldine Page is a delicacy like the steels B * tch who runs the school. We know that McBurney wants to be the same as the other girls, but with her checkered past, which has been shown to us in flashbacks, we find that it's not all it is! Mae Mercer as a school slave girl also gives a great deal of performance. Apparently he knows McBurney is a skunk from the beginning, and she never lets her false spell bring her guard down. This is the character you'll want to know more after the movie. He seems to have more knowledge of the world than anyone else in the movie. Beguiled behaved badly in his theatrical release. No one was quite sure what to do, and some of his content undoubtedly raised a few eyebrows in 1971. For example, in the early scene, we see how Eastwood kisses a 12-year-old girl romantically. Is he trying to keep her calm when the rebel soldiers approach or does she really enjoy it? Probably both! The fantasy sequence later even shows Clint how he does it not only with Page, but also with her young assistant! Really some interesting events in this. It's a good thing Eastwood has become a star he has done, or it might have been forgotten long ago. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Hound.
