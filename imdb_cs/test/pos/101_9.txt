This is a very, very special movie ... one that is so special that it's best if you see it yourself. The film begins with a tired professor who talks about his class because students have the audacity to not be as incredibly brilliant as him! You can say very quickly that this person is a total cynic - he finds value in nothing but his own inner sense of self-importance. Moreover, he seems to be tired and tired of the monotony of life. Later in the film he enters a bank robbery and manages to bother the robber enough to be shot by one of them in the head. Surprisingly, it is only half the film, followed by a very bizarre narrative of the last seconds of his life. This is when the film becomes exciting because the narrative style, like one of the novels of this professor of literature, is one that is intelligently written and tells things the way we wish we can all say. <br /> <br /> Take a look at this strange movie - it's amazingly convincing and not something I've ever seen.
