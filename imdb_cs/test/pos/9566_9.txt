This film is not a comedy, its exhibit. I always hated dog shows because of the absurd ghettos that people put in their dogs and the idiotic names they give them. Therefore, it is the reason for my uncontrolled gig while watching this movie. I'll get a kick from something that is taken so seriously, even though the profits are small and insignificant. It's like miniature golf, or jumping into the championship, or needing to set some dark world record. Acting was much more refined in this film than Waiting for Guffman, and its mainly because of the more fluent characters that seem to be more comfortable with their particular actors in this movie than the previous ones. Eugene Levy was great, as was Michael McKean and Fred Willard. However, they were dogs who eventually stole the show. But then again, who wants to see people's movie about dogs.
