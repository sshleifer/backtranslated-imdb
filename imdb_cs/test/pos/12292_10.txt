I was watching Pole X because Scott Walker passed the film score and I admire his music a lot. Frankly, I was expecting a somewhat pretentious and perhaps incoherent French film. I was wrong. The vision of the film quickly caught my attention - from the opening sequence, which shows black-and-white shots of military planes throwing bombs in graves under the sounds of music and the beautiful voice of Scott Walker's voice. The film explores the identity crisis of Pierre (Guillaume Depardieu - a great choice for the role) and its subsequent (self) destruction. The story is divided into two parts? The first depicts the carefree life of Pierre in a beautiful house in the French countryside, and the second follows his utter personal disintegration after leaving everything and moving to Paris to live in misery with his supposed half-sister. Both parts contain amazingly amazing photos? the first very colorful and bright, the second completely grim and almost apocalyptic - completing a true aesthetic feast. Pola X is a fascinating and totally unique film experience.
