"Wax Kids", also shown as "killing reasons", is an interesting mix of genres. Some may think that the purity of the genre can only be good, but eclectic symbiosis is very fun for me. It is also in his story a mixture of thriller and popular action, as well as a combination of historical masterpiece and ethnic pleas for tolerance. This movie is built with the stellar presence of my favorite actor perfect Armand Assante, but is also marked by the action of the shooting star? Hal Ozan. We recently saw him in the HBO TV series "Sex". "Wax Kids" is fun for the audience, but also has eternal morality for ethnic tolerance. This is a wise way to organize well-being. Discussing the current problems of our days can be done in an attractive way, which is a very positive aspect of "Children of Wax".
