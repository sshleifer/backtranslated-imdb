I'm not Ebert. What I am is compassionate and I have never felt more compassion for a fictional character than I felt for Leland P. Fitzgerald. I am sorry if I do not offer criticism, but in this film I see nothing but perfection. I'm sure many who watch this movie will never see the same things I do, but if you look hard enough, you'll see something you don't expect. I read that the character of Leland is defective. It seems to me that the one who wrote it could not see the question this film represents. I'm sorry for anyone who doesn't see the answers to this movie. Open your heart more than your mind and you may be able to let this Leland P. Fitzgerald show you the world that really has meaning. An exceptional story with extraordinary acting. Ryan Gosling deserves to be talked about.
