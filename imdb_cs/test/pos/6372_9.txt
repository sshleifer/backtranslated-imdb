Great show. First, the people who don't like it. I don't like it, then don't watch it ... This is a wonderful show. Better than Jim (my favorite). This shows REAL family households (as opposed to 8 simple rules, etc., where everything goes peachy). They are loud, they are messy .... I can sympathize with their drag all the trash into the kitchen. It happens in real life .. Or as "Portal to hell", and everyone growls like dogs through fast food boxes. It's a show "He was there". coming but fun to watch because you were there before. Good cast, work great together, admirable enough DVD show releases. Mel Gibsons "Security Videos" were the highlight of the series as well. <br /> <br /> Opinion? Good show, it really deserves a DVD release (It deserves not being canceled as well).
