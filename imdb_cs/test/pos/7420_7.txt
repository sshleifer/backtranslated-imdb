Terry and June were, in my opinion, one of the classic British sitcoms. Did you know what to expect - and it's not that typical! :) Unlike modern sitcoms with totally fictional conspiracies, this show is still the breath of fresh air. How beautiful you do not see or hear about body functions or see the PERPETUALLY family late for breakfast or family with impossible teenagers. And there is a secret: Terry & June was based on middle class pairs living in relative harmony instead of today's tense conspiracies with the dysfunctional family "de rigueur" (made on the hip). <br /> <br /> Personally, I am voting on the "Most Far" episode as one of the best. In a way, Terry's antiquity reminds me of Basil Fawlty - they sometimes get almost incredibly embarrassing feelings! Terry & June is highly recommended. Prepare your tea and cookies!
