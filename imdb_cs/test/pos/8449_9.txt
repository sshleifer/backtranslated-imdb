A great film from the late 1970s. He talks a lot about corporate corruption at the expense of an ordinary person, so that the powerful can gain huge profits and ignore the environment and the safety of others. Nearly 30 years later, this film is persuasive about the power of some corporate players that their ability to control has increased tenfold since the movies were released; This shows the need for public regulation against strong business interests whose primary goal is profit. Jack Lemmon is great - while Jane Fonda and Micheal Douglas are just as convincing in their roles. The 1970s, where much has been lost, this film will buy a decade. <br /> <br /> A movie that gets better after every watching.
