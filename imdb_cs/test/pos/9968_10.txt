Last week I saw a Venice merchant in London. Great playing Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Finnes and Lynn Collins. Compared to other Shakespeare-based films, this production has made the game so easy to understand and follow. Bravo Michael Radford for directing such top actors. The costume and scenery are great, and since it was filmed on site in Venice, it gives the film and authentic taste. I read the game more than thirty years ago at school and the emphasis was on the anti-Semitic behavior of the characters towards Jews and the cruelty of Christians. I don't know if this movie will be controversial, but in any case I'm sure it will have few Oscar nominations.
