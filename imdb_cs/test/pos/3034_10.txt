The CONRACK (20th Century Fox, 1974), which comes to the heels of the "Blackploitation" of 1970, offered viewers inconspicuous, honest and everyday people as drama. Offering a far different market to its audience (which was far more general than those of "Gansta" films); to be a realistic dose of down, offering solitary counterbalances to those who shot, "REPLACING Lead Leaders That Was Bad Ass Detectives, Super Flies And Mega / Mats / Pimps (Take Your Choice In Terminology) , he was a lonely, humble and humble teacher. The academic we're talking about is the main character, Pat Conroy; who is the only lonely teacher he hired to take responsibility for a kind of old school house in one room on the South Carolina Coast Island. "CONRACK" (Jon Voight), the name young people give him, finds him back in school. In addition to the physical characteristics of this "Little Red Schoolhouse", the systemic and graded educational system was completely absent. By the way, by the way, we mentioned that further complications in successful education were reflected in two indisputable facts. It was that Pat Conroy was both an outsider, so he was white; with almost the entire population of this coastal cay was black and very poor. SEARCH for these unacceptable and regrettable conditions were representatives of the local Education Council; to be school principal, Mrs. Scott (Madge Sinclair) and superintendent, Mr. Skeffington (Mr. Hume Cronyn). Between the two, we understand that a teacher who is a low man on the totem is helpless in most ways to influence any meaningful, long-term progress. BUT don 't you tell a young Turk like Pat Conroy he can't. (Nothing is it). "Conrack" spends year unorthodox classroom performances and makes real progress; but unfortunately, a strong teacher does not and does not recognize the authority of his superiors. While he is, by law and unknowing to him, serving at that super's pleasure; he does not hear Mr Skeffington's specific order and prohibition to take his children to class to South Carolina on Halloween for some trick or treat; even if we go on a harsh act of stopping at Skeffington Residence. NEXT we see the Western Union Telegram telegram happily singing as it passes from mainland to Carolina to the island; where he delivers a Conroy telegram that reported his release from office at this school and district. Mrs Scott and the Board of Directors protest against his dismissal as illegal. Inherently examining both the "offense" and the law, the judge asks Skeffington whether there are any minor penalties that could be replaced by Conroy's separation from the school system; to receive a negative response. Certainly the judge will dismiss the suit when the hammer blows the hammer and says, "It's very simple!" The story is brought to a bitter conclusion when "Conrack's" performs on the mainland while the phonograph record gives us the 5th SYMPHONY BEETHOVEN. who played an important role in Conroy's educational program as well as our story. In HUMBLE's view of this writer, the story (which we believe was at least semi-autobiographical, even giving the main character the name of the author) was much more than the story of a localized storyline. To my friend Schultz and me; it is a kind of depiction of a microcosm that represents the overall regrettable conditions that penetrate government schools across the nation. (Just an opinion) <br /> HOW SO A MOVIE WAS ONLY ONE OF THE LOTS OF MOVIES depicting ordinary people's trades; They lead their lives in "silent despair" in the large inland of the country, which lies outside the DC Beltway and the urban centers of business and communications on the Atlantic or Pacific coast. THEIR OWN It is a small film that in the 20th century film vaults, Fox, will soon be associated with such works as NORMA RAE and BREAKING AWAY. (both from TCF in 1979). <br /> <br /> DISPLAY IT IF YOU ARE NOT. Schulz and his friend are recommended. * <br /> <br /> NOTE: * Why, it's me! <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
