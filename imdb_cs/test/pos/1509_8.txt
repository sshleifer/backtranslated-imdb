I couldn't help but enjoy the whole CAT IN THE BRAIN premise because it explains the director conscientiously as he keeps on seeing people murdered from past films he made. Even mundane activities such as cooking food in a microwave oven or running a water tap have in the past brought some scary butchery out of the movie. Director Fulci plays alone, directs GHOSTS OF SODOM (?) And can not get rid of mental well-being from constant murder. He seeks help from a psychiatrist who instead uses Fulci's work as a method to perform a series of innocent people, a hypnotizing director, to think he may be responsible. This is of course a movie that playfully sneaks fun at Fulci's picture, while exploring topics such as a profession that produces so much death and destruction, rarely untamed, could form and form a reference. The film presents almost the entire story of continuous graphic violence with every possible way to kill a woman expressed in grisly detail. This has a murder murder that Hitchcock could never direct or probably want. The wild film complicates the mental state of Fulci Fulci (.. I know) during the run. Reality and film fiction have melted and Fulci can't find any escape. The end (explaining the old clich√©: "It's just a movie") couldn't work better than here. Fulci's ship says Perversion (... great touch) and swims away .. I can only wish it was his last movie because it's perfect close if there was one. David L Thompson is a scared psychiatrist who plans to kill his adulterous wife. Jeoffrey Kennedy's Fulci's Fear The fear had a family murdered by the devil. Ultra-Violence in the Movie presents a lot of unique ways to take your head away, such as a chest door, a scythe, a chainsaw and an ax. The most brutal violence derives from the ugly activity of a chain saw because the dead body is hacked into pieces (.. how a gardener's chainsaw works beautifully into one nightmare) .. the most enjoyable use of a chain saw is when a little boy gets decapitated! The opening scene with a puppet cat tearing at Fulci's brain is a cook. The scenes associated with the film, with a frightened look at Fulci, are obvious, but I still couldn't help it.
