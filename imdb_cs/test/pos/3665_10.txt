When I grew up, I watched my little bit of Bollywood movies - you know that a typical grandfather meets a girl, a girl refuses a boy, dakus takes a girl, a boy rescues a girl by killing hundreds of dhaks and happily getting married (Of course, I missed an hour of musical styles. Well, I'm looking at Hari Om, I was expecting another typical Bollywood movie; however, to my joy it turned out to be atypical and really quite comical. Bharatbala's Hari Om is what might be labeled as one of those "off beat" Indian movies, such as popular South Asian hits like Monsoon Wedding, East's East or Bend's like Beckham. Being South Asian polite and watching various classic Bollywood movies, there was a lot of humor and sub-dialogues that could be picked up that could be picked up that reminded me of the fun and charming side of Indian culture ( eg, various Indo-Pop numbers that were actually reworked by Nitin). Soni or funny Indian slang that have been used). Hari Om can be enjoyed by all South Asians, and is also fun for those who are not accustomed to Indian humor as characters and conspiracies cater to all viewers. In cocunutshell, the movie is an auto-rickshaw driver (aka 'quad bike' for those of you who traveled to India to know) played by Vija Raaz (from Monsoon Wedding) who gets himself involved with a cheater and it ends up owing him enough money. To avoid selling his quad bike, "Madhuri" escapes serendipitously with "Madhuri" and a very charismatic and beautiful woman from France Isa (Camille Natta), who herself escapes the boredom of her friend Benoit (Jean Marie Lamour, who was in the pool). The film is their way of traveling through the beautiful landscape of Rajasthan? land of love stories; through humor you see two main actors trying to figure out who they are. What became the most memorable at night was to have a director, executive producer, chief editor, and even a lady's mother. Natta present at screening. After talking to Bharatbala (who has actually Zoology background) many interesting film tidbits were uncovered including: having the film finished just 10 days before the Toronto International Film Festival and taking only 45 days to shoot, and having only five actors in the game (the rest they were all real actors for the first time. When I came home, I realized two things from the film - despite our differences, there is always a human connection between one of us and the other, as the director said: "Everyone has a love story." <br /> <br /> It is necessary for everyone!
