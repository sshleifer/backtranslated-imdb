I watched this movie with my family during a long Thanksgiving weekend. I am grateful for someone insisting that we follow him, even though I did not pay much attention to the end of the film when it seems that the headache is promising, but unfortunately it will not happen. On the other hand, I watched this movie a few years later and loved its vibrancy, absurdity, sparkle and simple entertainment. I think the movie has a feminine tone. Women are not exploited in it, although I am sure someone might think that film is pure exploitation. I think the movie plays with the trophies of the period. I still think someone should reshape him. And add some of the consequences in the original.
