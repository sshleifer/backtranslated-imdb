Freely, from scene to scene, from story to story, as well as walking, from the dark path to the open, like the wind in the leaves, from tree to other, how many different sounds? As with traveling, people meet and tell their stories and then divide forever, who knows? And just as when we go through these places full of lost expectations from another time, the human "thickness" of the world takes its breath away. I saw this movie with friends, not everyone They liked it, maybe they were too used to scripts and finished stories, I don't know. So this film is for those silly who love to look at the sun sparkling at sea, walk without hurry in the hills or through small villages, listen to the growing grass that tells the stories of those below them, six feet below, in the warm wind of summer.
