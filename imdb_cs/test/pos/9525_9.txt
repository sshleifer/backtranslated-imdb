The railroad kids, at least this 1970 version written and directed by this longtime British actor Lionel Jeffries, is an incredible ... classic. It tells the story of childhood with great simplicity and charm; sentiment is muted; evocation of children's adventures includes; and Jeffries brings cleverness and style to his production. The Waterbury family runs an idyllic life in Edward's London. The father is prosperous, the mother is beautiful and loving, the children are well behaved and loving, their home is warm and cozy. One night during the Christmas holidays, two men appear at the doorstep, speak quietly to their father and then take him away. In a moment the lives of Mrs. Waterbury (Dinah Sheridan) and Bobbie, 14 (Jenny Agutter), Phyllis, 12 (Sally Thomsett) and young Peter (Gary Warren) were changed. Only their bravery and good spirits will see them. Mrs. Waterbury, who now finds herself in poverty, takes her children to live in a musty old brick house in the countryside near the railway, not too far from a small village with a train station. Children discover the rail and sit regularly on a small hill to rush to the passengers as they chugs. One day the old man looks up from his diary to his business in the city and finds himself back. It's not long before he plays an important role in the story. As time goes by, Mrs. Waterbury brings all her love and intelligence to carry her children. She starts writing stories to make money. He teaches them his lessons and gives them home of heat and safety. But the story is about these three children, especially Bobbie. At age 14, she is old enough to share her mother's worries, but young enough to enjoy the adventure of her sister and brother. They find a poor man at the station who can't speak English. He finds himself a Russian refugee who no longer knows where his wife and child are. They insist that they have to go home with them and their mother takes him inside. Before long, children wrote a great sign on the train to help the old masters. They help a young man who participates in a steeplechase who breaks his leg in a train tunnel. She is home with them soon. They decide to have a birthday party for the station commander, a man with a few friends and a few children who is sticky for his dignity. It is not long before children help him to understand the difference between friendship and love. In other words, these three children encounter all kinds of problems in children's adventures and can help in making all the problems happy. But what about their own problems? Bobbie finally learns from his mother that her father has been taken away because he was accused of treason, giving the Russians state secrets. Will Bobbie be able to find a way to help? Will the old man be more than an old man on a passing train? Will their father's case be reopened? Will there be a happy ending? Jenny Agutter was almost 18 years old when she shot her part; plays on 14-year-old Bobbie with great naturalness and charm. Just as important as other players, especially Dinah Sheridan as a mother, Agutter is the heart of the story. For me, this is Jenny Agutter's talent and the style and limitations of Lionel Jeffries, which makes this film so unforgettable. The problems of the story come without serious doubts, but they will be solved. And Jeffries doesn't just give us a well-groomed and guided movie, but he adds that he barely noticed it, but he enchants us. This can only involve a fraction of a second when two people speak; or slow closing of a small yellow wild flower in the grass outside Bobbie's house, then a slow thrust from the yellow oil lamp that appeared inside; or the realization that a beautiful interior shot or view of a green landscape or a view of a train station downhill ... all of this suddenly recalls those charming Edwardian hand-painted drawings of perfect time. Perhaps this subtle story cannot compete for the time that children today need to perfect their Nintendo monster-splatting skills. I am almost positive that she would never catch the attention of most of their parents, especially those who were weaned at Batman and Leone. Yet it is a perfectly assembled film and should not be forgotten. Only 19 years later the story was rephrased as a television program. This time Jenny Agutter played her mother.
