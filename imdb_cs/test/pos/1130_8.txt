I looked at the pilot episode with this great expectation when I graduated from college and switched to "real life". I wasn't in fraternity, but many of my best friends were, and I had to participate in a lot of the party they did in their house, so I know what's going on. Of course, this exhibition is a dramatization, not in a documentary way, by any means of Greek life, nor by the life of a college for this matter, even though it has a lot of truth, though for the most part exaggerated. If you look at the show for the value it contains as a TV show, and nothing more, it's very fun as well as movies like Old School, Porky, Animal, etc. If you look like it expects a chronicle of all your Experience in your own college life, you'll probably either not want more or crazy to over-dramatize many events.
