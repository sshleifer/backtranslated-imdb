I suppose this is what is called Southern Gothic. It's Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci and Justin Timberlake. Timberlake does a good job, to my surprise, I didn't expect it from him. <br /> <br /> When you get lost and can't find your way home - it's a black snake. Br /> <br /> People in this movie are definitely lost in many ways, psychologically and emotionally damaged, betrayed by those they trusted and loved and filled with a lot of pain. Samuel L. Jackson plays a blues singer / musician - whose wife broke up with her brother and has now left him for her brother, along with the baby's abortion he hoped to have with him. The character of Christina Ricci is a woman who has been sexually abused when she was young - making her a self-destructive nymphomaniac; to allow him to treat her badly. The story lies at the intersection of these two characters. It's a love story, but not a sexual love story, among them - an older black man and a young white woman. <br /> <br /> It's different from most of the movies Hollywood has sharpened. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 10 stars
