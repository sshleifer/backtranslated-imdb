An excellent line of plot makes this movie one of the classic, cult ninja movies of all time. The story that the soul of this woman is obsessed with the evil spirit of the ninja. I want to be honest if I can get a ninja ability through the property I want. In addition to being in the 80's and such a fact that the ninja aspect was much larger in this particular decade is obvious and despite everything, Ninja 3 Domination manages to keep that original of the Ninja cookie cookie cutters that plagued the 80s for so long. This chick is definitely Michael Dudikoff on steroids .... I think the first American ninja was great, but let's get real people it has nothing on Ninja 3
