It's not a bad TV movie. Shtrafbat is short for Shtrafnoy Batallion, which means Penal Batallion. Such battallions were formed due to increasing demand for soldiers, while the Soviet Union took heavy losses throughout the war. These battalions consisted of condemned and dishonored soldiers who were given the opportunity to purify their names by showing themselves in combat. They were looking down on like dirt and were expended easily during the fight without much regret, or much honor, on the army's side. They were often sent on suicide missions and suffered extreme casualties. Those who refused to fight were executed in sight. Needless to say, they suck their lives. There were some very nice performances cast, especially Yuri Stepanov, who played Antip, Aleksandr Bashirov, who played Stirah, and Roman Madyanov, who played Major Kharchenko. However, the series is not so addictive, partly because it is too long, it could be much shorter and more efficient. Although it is a war, Shtrafbat has very mild violence and almost no violence. gore. It just depends on the actors to make it work, and after all, it's a TV series, so producers didn't want to scare the audience and sponsors. Shtrafbat explores the cruelty of the Soviet regime and explains why so many men have chosen to fight the Nazis instead of joining them. Personally, I would rather be a fascist and then a communist because of the circumstances mentioned in the film. One character explains that the Soviets stripped the farm and his family died of hunger. From anger he burned him, who arrested him for destroying Kolhoz's property and ended up in a criminal battalion as a criminal. Antip remembered how his mother had killed her youngest son to feed the rest of the family. Both men explained that they fought for their own country, rather than the Soviets. The Criminal Battalion had one Marine Corps who raped a girl, killed her comrade in prosess, threatened her other. Comrade to keep his mouth closed around both miseries, and then feign injuries when he came to battle. Besides, the girl committed suicide because of shame. I imagine that if they were watching this movie, they should pick up the banners and rebellion on the streets and ask the producers for a boycott or an official apology. The least I would recommend to anyone with the least interest in the former Soviet Union or World War II. I don't think I've wasted 500+ minutes of my life.
