Despite all the comparisons with the Frankenstein House, this film overcomes its predecessor and is one of the funnest monster movies in the Universal Monsters series, and unfortunately, the last. OK. it does not mean that it is like a Frankenstein bride as one of the classics that fans of all movies would appreciate, but with the cast of Dracula, The Wolf Man and Frankenstein's Monster (What? no Mummy?), but enjoy this schlock fest! And unlike Frankenstein's house, the monsters in this movie interact much more. But this film also offers some unique story lines for both Dracula and Wolf, who both go to Dr. Adleman to heal their suffering. While the Wolf Man actually find a cure, Dracula injects his blood into the doctor and that is when real fun begins! I highly recommend this movie to fans of classic horror movies. But remember, I never said it's good, just fun.
