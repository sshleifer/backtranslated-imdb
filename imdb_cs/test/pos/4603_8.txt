A good x evil movie with the taste of "James Bond", "Romeo and Juliet", and perhaps "Star Wars". Poor Count Von Bruno receives an English gentleman as a very dangerous hunting guest. Elga, a beautiful simple and well-meaning lady who has been forced to marry the Count, provides a love triangle. The number of missing eyes points to a terrible past. The Englishman is not what the earl thinks, and is a great pleasure to him. There is also a horrible hunchback, crocodile and even side appearance of some torture tools. Boris Karlloff, here in the supporting role, is a strong but somewhat rigid presence. Other actors (and directing) are a symbol of the era of strong black and white films. There is no doubt from the beginning who is a bad person who is good. Even traitors and stiffness can be identified somewhat easily.
