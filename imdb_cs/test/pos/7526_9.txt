This is Pepe Le Pew's first cartoon, and in some ways it is very similar to the later ones, but in a few other special ways it isn't. While the cat is the subject of Pepe's affection, it seems strangely that she is a cat! This whole difficulty occurs because the cat is tired of being abused by others and dressed like a skunk, trying to feel like a skunk, so it can be left alone. Unfortunately this attracts our hero, Pepe. Most of the action is typical of a very funny and unexpected end - and it actually makes it one of the best of all the cartoons in the series. Excellent animation (although the style is different from later examples), excellent writing and a good sense of humor make it one goalkeeper.
