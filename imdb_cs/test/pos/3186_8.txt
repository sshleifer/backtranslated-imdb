It's a great TV movie with a good story and a lot of comic moments thanks to the excellent cast. The only problem with this movie is that it did not become a test of time, just as it could be. they have. Despite this, it's definitely worth seeing, especially if you're a fan of Alan Alda or Ruth Gordon.
