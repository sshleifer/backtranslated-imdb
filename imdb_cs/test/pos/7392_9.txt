I think this movie is different from most of the movies I've seen. It was an exciting way, and no matter what others say, I say I was surprised by the final solution. Surely he didn't see it! Even though it's sad, it's worth watching .. I can't think of any movie that would be like that! The actors knew what they were doing. If you say this film sucks, you will probably say what most people say. But if someone says this movie is ordinary, I totally disagree. And Norman Reedus should be more noticed. I may be crazy, but I really liked it. It was a kind of mess, but who cares? I'm tired of boring and ordinary movies.
