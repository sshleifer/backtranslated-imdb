Hollywood is one of the best and most beautiful things I've ever seen in my life. I admire and am very fascinated by how Hollywood creates ideas and implements them. I'm thinking about the extent of the human brain. I've seen Flatliners long ago, but the story, direction, cast and all acting are still fresh in my mind. The story begins with our leading actor Sutherland, who says at sunrise, "what a beautiful day to die." For all of us, this is a story that shows emotions that are sometimes held back in our minds during our lives. I can never understand a few things in life. It shows us that we are motivated and improved our quality of life. Anyway, I recommend it to all who watch it once.
