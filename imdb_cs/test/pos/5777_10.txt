This movie broke a lot of land and got a whole lot less credit than its maturity. It touches on a theme that is always present in our daily lives, but which is considered so common that it does not deserve it. This phenomenon is a problem for carers (whether they are doctors or, as in the case of "Broken Promise", a senior social worker) who abuse their position to harm those who have been accused of protection. In a Broken State Promise, Patty Clawson and her family are abandoned by their parents; but soon they are picked up by local law enforcement agencies. Faced with a prospect of foster care, Patty begged the young social worker to keep her along with her brothers and sisters. This social worker approaches a senior member of another department but his application is rejected. <br /> <br /> Children are placed in separate homes, monitoring the day's prevailing views and providing a "clean break". But it is this event, the "broken promise" that gives the film a name that causes dramatic tension to continue throughout the film. Stunned by the apparent betrayal of a young social worker, Patty Clawson runs away from the orphanage she was sent to. Facing the daunting task of finding your family at peace, where the ideal is visible. complete separation from the past; The only thing he can find out is to find out where he is and enter the Senior Social Worker's office to steal the case. Soon after he found out that she had made a dangerous enemy. Furious at the embarrassment of this little girl and his separation, the Senior Social Worker decides to use his power and authority to destroy her; something that he is legally able to do. <br /> <br /> --------------- <br /> <br /> This topic, about the injury of carers by clients, is quite taboo. Certainly very little has been affected in the films, because few directors want to step on the road, which means that carers cause damage. I think this film plays a very important role in raising public awareness of such things. The case is not only plausible, but it has probably happened many times before many other children around the world. This film is critical to changing public opinion to get rid of laws that protect harmful people like Senior Social Worker in "Broken Promise". <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Broken Promise. Particularly useful is monitoring for social workers, psychiatrists, psychologists, doctors, and other nursing professions. It's a avoidance lesson that should be taken to the heart. <br /> <br /> ----------- <br /> <br /> As for acting in "Broken Promise." "Melissa Michaelsen plays an outstanding role as Patty Clawson. Especially in movies like this credibility is critical. If the viewer does not identify with the character of Patty, the whole message of the movie would be compromised. performance in "Broken Promise" shows she has extraordinary talent.
