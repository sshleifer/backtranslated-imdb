**** SPOILERS THROUGHOUT **** This is a very strange movie - especially for its time - in every respect. American films have shown American soldiers for six years, as every son, brother, father is. In films such as The Best Years of Our Lives and the End of Time, our hearts are pulled by difficulties, sweet returning soldiers adjust to peace and their families. In the same year, however, this film shows soldiers as a mixture of people somewhat worse than the spectator - one news of this film is - "lock your daughters". Even good soldiers - with plenty of time for hand - are still gambling, abounding and completely indifferent to whether they already have women. And their reaction to the police investigating the murder is to conspire against them. Mitchum, the most sympathetic soldier, says things like, "I don't know if my wife wants to go out of here now after the war." I haven't seen her in two years, I don't care? Another soldier is depicted as unusually sensitive because after years he would like to see his wife again. Later, when this soldier at the police station said he'd spent the Evening in the Girl's House - without knowing his wife was sitting behind him, there was no doubt that his wife would be OK. Indeed, she is - I think it's "Hey, soldiers will be soldiers". The police detective played by Robert Young, who is trying to burst a murder case, says convincingly and with endless tiredness about someone's account of their night's actions, "I don't care? "I don't care any more. I did it too long, I think." The man appears on the girl's apartment. He says I'm just a man like you, you're interested in a bitch. Then he says, "No, that's a lie, I'm her husband. I'd like to be in the army, I was rejected before." The hen says, "No, that's a lie, why would I want to be a soldier?" He goes through another series of lies when the police ask him who he is. At the end of the movie we have no idea who he is or why he is there, it's one of the strangest characters in the history of movies! A man stands with his girlfriend in a bar talking to four soldiers as a clumsy soldier knocks a drink on his girlfriend. She's going to change her clothes - and she's wearing another one, no problem. But the man does not leave his girlfriend, who just disappears, but instead follows one of the soldiers as he goes to another area of ​​the bar! He then extrapolated the minimal information he learned about the soldier - generously philosophizing about the problems of returning soldiers - and immediately invites the soldier home because he is drunk and feels sick. This is strange stuff. Similarly, the ballroom girl is irritated by the sentimental soldier who wants to take her out "for a real dance - maybe dinner". Yet he dances with him - and immediately gives him the key to her house! Were people in the late 1940s always urging soldiers to come to their homes after they met them? Robert Ryan kills his host, an alien when he gets angry that a Jewish host is trying to get his drunk Ryan out of his home. The reason for the murder? "No Jew tells me how to drink." "How to drink?" Huh? What does it mean? This film is always out of order, deliberately - soldiers act consistently with total defiance of the law, and all characters are as cool and hard as any movie I've ever seen. And yet the film is completely graspable! You just don't know how these people will behave - or what a new bizarre character will emerge - without anyone thinking that his actions are at least strange - for example, the behavior of a woman. Acting is about the best I've ever seen - from Robert Young, Robert Ryan, Glorie Grahame (who won an Oscar nomination), Paul Kelly and other actors I've never heard of. I Never heard of this movie - and it's a great pleasure to have discovered the one I want to see again and again. it is really strange but impossible to break away from it because you do not know what these beings will do next.
