What can I say about this movie besides it's great fun! John Cusack plays Hoops McCann A recent high school graduate who has two options to learn how to deal with the family business sweeping the streets or spending summer on Nantucket with his friend George Calamari (played by Joel Murray cheerfully) and his zany friends. When I say zany, believe me, it can't be much more harsh than Stork, Egg (Bobcat Goldthwait) and Clay (Tom Villard) and Ack Ack Raymond (Curtis Armstrong). Throw a little girl named Squid and her weird mutt and great performance by Demi Moore and you made split pages that laugh, movie. Laughter in this movie and the story flow freely, although the typical good versus bad and good conquest is great with a twist of regatta as a showdown. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a lot of laughter and good time. If you want to enjoy movies thoroughly then you can't miss one crazy summer!
