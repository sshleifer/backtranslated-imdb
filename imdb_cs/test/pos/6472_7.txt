Knute Rockne led an extraordinary life and his story is told quite well in Knute Rockne All American. We follow the incredible Rockne journey from a young Norwegian boy to the legendary American football legend. Produced in 1940 the film may occasionally seem a touch dated and sometimes downright hokey. And the filmmakers sometimes put it a little harder when Rockne is portrayed lovingly and lovingly. You can leave because Rockne should be nominated for a holiday when in fact he was just a football coach. However, it is undeniable that he had a great influence on football and had a huge impact on the lives of many of the young men he trained. This film shows the great influence he has had, and gives you insight into why he is being worshiped to this day. Playing Rockne, Pat O'Brien gives impressive performance. It is undoubtedly O'Brien's film that he carries and he makes the film and his own character. Real Life Rockne was renowned as a great inspirational character and O'Brien's performance allows you to understand why. The only quarrel comes soon in the movie when O'Brien, in his early forties, plays Rockne undergraduate in his early twenties. All makeup in the world didn't do it to be believable, and the effect is rather unpleasant. But as Rockne's character ages and begins his legendary coaching career, O'Brien fits perfectly into the game. As far as the rest of the cast is concerned, one name jumps out and that is of course Ronald Reagan playing youth, charismatic but ultimately convicted football star George Gipp. It's not really a big part in the big movie scheme, with Reagan not appearing for more than 10-15 minutes. But the performance has become legendary thanks to Reagan's famous "Win one for the Gipper" deathbed speech. It's a brilliantly played scene, full of emotions. Reagan may not have been on the screen for a long time in this movie, but he definitely made a tremendously positive impact on winning performance. The rest of the film creates a balance between football and life in general. Rockne has great lessons for her young men in both areas. For football fans (and history enthusiasts) there is a rare treat like a real archival footage from the Notre Dame games of the Rockne era is scattered throughout the film. It's a rare opportunity to see how much the game has evolved over the past six decades and the opportunity to see Rockne's legendary strategic innovation in practice. If you're a Notre Dame fan, you'll probably enjoy Notre Dame Victory March presenting a seemingly continuous soundtrack for the movie. If you are a hater of Notre Dame ... you won't watch it like that. Knute Rockne American is an inspiring, uplifting, emotional film. Maybe it's a little too sentimental, but it's not such a bad thing. It's a very nice movie that is worth seeing time.
