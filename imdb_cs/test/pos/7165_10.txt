One of the unfortunate facts of post-Soviet Russia was that the well-being of people did not differ much from Soviet times. As we see in "Window to Paris", most people are still as depressed as ever, while being encouraged to go for money. Then everything changes for music teacher Nikolai Chizhove (Sergei Dontsov) to find a window that leads to Paris. He and his friends are naturally amazed at what they find. This film has one of the most entertaining discussions Elvis Presley and Edith Piaf have ever heard. So watch this movie. You will definitely love him. It's something like the predecessor of "Being John Malkovich".
