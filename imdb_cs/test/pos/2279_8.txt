This film received less attention than the "League of Their Own", perhaps because it has only one "star" star. But while female professional baseball had only eight years, Midwestern urban existence, Japanese baseball is an overwhelmingly larger entity, both in financial underwriting and popular promotion. That alone would make it a better film. "Mr. Baseball" shows the facts of Japan's life-ball: regimented cheering, respect for judges, corporate owners' pressure on managers, extreme game conservatism - and no hot dog players are welcome. It also touches the isolation that every gai-jin has - but especially the American athlete, not the people who are best known in foreign cultures. Dai Nippon. And the Japanese are not comfortable for foreigners and let it show in different ways ("gai-jin strike", one American player complains "bigger than buick.") <br /> <br /> on "redemption by improved game" but I found it much more fun than pokey "League". Definitely recommended for those who want to see another angle of this great sport.
