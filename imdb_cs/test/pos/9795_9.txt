"Radio Flyer" is one of my favorite American movies. Really great work of two boys, Joe Mazzell and Elije Wood (despite the terrible performance of T.Hanks at the beginning and end ...) with the amazing DMEvans script and powerful and emotional director R.Donner and absolutely incredibly unique H. Zimmer's musical score allowed Radio Flyer to win one of the first places in my family's movie rating. Br /> <br /> It's such a pity that some film critics have underestimated a very good movie. <br /> <br /> I just can't help waiting to see him on DVD.
