'In the Line of Fire' tells the story of a game between an old presidential bodyguard and a former government killer who has changed psycho. The secret service agent (Eastwood) is in defense, and the murderer (Malkovich) is at fault. At stake? The President is alive. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie ... I've seen it many times on TV and I recently bought it on DVD. Yet it is not an excellent movie. The plot is too thin and attempts to amplify it are absolutely ridiculous. The whole story of love is not very credible, and the way it brought another character into the story to kill him is an insult to a more or less intelligent viewer. While I think that these mistakes cannot be forgiven, I can easily look at the excellent performance of Mr. Malkovich. I've always considered him a great actor, but he's really on fire in this movie. There is a reason why he was nominated for an Oscar. Rene Russo and Clint Eastwood were all right, but I don't find their performance unforgettable. They are never at their best. <br /> <br /> If you don't expect too much, you're sure to like this movie. It's not a masterpiece, but John Malkovich is truly extraordinary and I don't think anyone can enjoy his performance. It's really worth watching ...
