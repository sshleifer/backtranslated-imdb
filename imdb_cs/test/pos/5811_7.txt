As a big fan of Hammer Studios and an enthusiastic observer of their Gothic horror movies, I wonder what took me so long to start watching their "Hammer House of Horror" TV series, which was only one season in 1980. I saw the first four episodes of the show, I can say that it easily meets my expectations. While this first episode of "Witching Time" may not be the most astonishing story of Horror ever narrated, and it does not fully bring the gorgeous Gothic atmosphere I love to Hammer's films from the 1950s to the 1970s, it can surprise a spooky story and create some a real scary within fifty minutes. The film composer David Winter (Jon Finch) is troubled by the 17th-century Lucinda witch (Patricia Quinn) ... While the story can be simple but effective for less than an hour, it brings many spooky moments. Northern Irish actress Patricia Quinn, who is probably best known for her role in "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" (1975), as well as the fantastic comedy Monty Python "The Meaning of Life" by Monty Python (1983), is amazingly dangerous in her role that suits her like gloves. Jon Finch is also quite good as David, and while Prunella Gee, who plays her wife with an adulterous actress, may not be the best actress at all, she's definitely nice to look at her. The episode is accompanied by a nice score that plays along with the atmosphere. Overall, "Witching Time" is a very fun episode with a few really scary moments, and a decent opener in the series.
