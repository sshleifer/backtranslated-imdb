THINK DUCKLING is one of Fulci's earlier (and frankly, in the sense of the story, better ...) movies - and although it is not the typical "bloodshed" that Fulci is known about - this is still a very unique and enjoyable film. The story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders takes place. Some of the color features involved in the investigation - either as suspects or those who "help" investigate (or in some cases both) - include the city police force, the small reporter, the beautiful and wealthy former junkie, the young priest and his mother, an old man practicing witchcraft and his female protégé, mentally disabled citizen and deaf / dumb girl. All these people are drawn into a conspiracy to create a few twists until the real killer is revealed ... <br /> <br /> NOT DUCKLING is neither a "classic" giallo nor a typical Fulci. film. Although it contains elements of both - it is a more old-fashioned mysterious murder, with darker affair and a few scenes of graphic violence (though nothing nearly as powerful as some Fulci's later works). This is a well-written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing to the end. Recommended for giallo / murder-mystery fans or anyone who wants to see some of Fulci's non-motorized films - but don't despair, they're NOT more than just a share of violence and sleaze. Some may be postponed by the theme of killing children, and one major female character has a strange habit of hitting very young boys, which is also a little worrying - but if this kind of material doesn't bother you, then definitely give this look. 8.5 / 10
