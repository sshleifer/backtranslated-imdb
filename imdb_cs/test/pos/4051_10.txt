Back in the mid-1980s, the OAV anime by the name "Bubblegum Crisis" (which in my opinion is a military slang term for technical equipment going to hay) debuted on video, inspired by "Blade Runner", "The Blade Runner" Terminator "and maybe" Robocop ", with a little dash of Batman / Bruce Wayne - Iron Man / Tony Stark and Charlie's Angel, who is fine. 8 episodes long, the overall story was that in the 21st century Tokyo, Japan, year 2032 -2033, living machines called Boomers did manual labor and sometimes cause problems.Excellent, SWAT as a branch of law enforces, advanced police (AD police for short) was formed to work boomers, but was mostly ineffective, prompting millionaire scientist Sylia Stingray, daughter of a scientist, who made boomers, create four-powered combat armor (hard suits) to wear women to fight the boom and fight the evil corporation that makes boomers, GENOM. The band became known as Knight Sabers and besides the ring leader Sylia, her rag-tag bands of rebel women included Priss Asagiri, fighting rock and roll gal with passion for motorcycles and contempt for cops, Linna Yamazaki, an aerobics instructor with an eye for money and a tendency to fly through Boys, and Nene Roman, a young ADP officer and expert computer hacker (first in a long line). GENOM, meanwhile, is represented by Quincy, a tall, skinny old guy who happens to own a company, his younger assistant Brian J. Mason (killed in episode 3) and annoying boomer man named Largo. Other characters included Leon McNichol and Daley Wong, two AD police detectives (Leon appeared in a spin-off / prequel anime, "AD Police Files" which I heard was very dark), their bald, overweight chief Todo, Sylia's younger Brother Mackey, and a funny little mechanic known as Dr. Raven, who apparently helps Sylia to keep her suits. In addition to the overall story of Knight Sabers & AD Police VS GENOM, there was also another story involving friend Linny who was apparently a daughter in a big criminal family, annoying Largo trying to usurp GENOM, and various Priss-wants-revenge-for-and-less character story. Oh and did I mention that there are indications that Sylia could be a boomer? Well, it was a great watch, full of chaos and chaos and even very nice pop songs, but it wasn't without its flaws, some of which, unfortunately, was due to the fact that the series was interrupted after the episode 8 when it was originally planned for 13 episodes in all. So some of the stories, like Largo's scheme (or schematics), Linny's unfortunate friend's family, and Sylia's origins, have never been resolved. Another problem with the series was that at the time Priss was the most popular character, so a good part of the series focused on her, and unfortunately, most of the Priss oriented episodes basically focused on Priss self-seeking justice / revenge for some secondary character who she had never appeared before, but she was her girlfriend, but Knight Sabers, who had always brought her out of trouble and rarely cared for her, seldom went to her. being (just to be just though, she went to rescue Linn in episode 7, and her friend was killed by a boomer and ADP acted incorrectly in the investigation). That meant we didn't really focus on the more interesting story of Sylio, nor the daily opposites of Nene and Linna. Linna had two episodes around her that related to her girlfriend with the mafia family, while Nene managed to capture the last episode for herself, which showed that her eternal good mood was a really good mood and not a ditziness. Nene also had to put her computer skills to good use, or sometimes she just acted like a kind of stupid thing, giving her time on screen and developing characters a few seconds above poor Linna, who was often pulled into the background with her. Greed and her tendency to eat up lovers to get her attention. Don't get me wrong, I like it and I love the overall concept of it all, but it bothered me a little. Also this is one of those finalists for the "worst English voice dubbing of all time" features, which means you'd rather stick to the Japanese. Some of the voices were fine (some really corresponded to their character figures), but others were just flat and passionate or, in the case of Priss, really reworked. Well, Tokyo 2040 comes together and throws everything out of the window. The story a few years ahead is that after the Tokyo earthquakes, the GENOM booms rebuilt the city into a great old paradise, with the exception of the boom, which tend to fly away from the handle, resulting in the creation of AD Police followed by the Knight Sabers form. So the overall story is the same but the characters behind the scenes and the looks and attitudes of the characters have changed a lot. 1) Originally, Sylia had short purple-black hair and brown eyes, usually dressed as a strict, right business woman, and far from the others. 2040 Sylia has a more super-model look at her, dressing more provocatively and having white hair and blue eyes that seem to change color depending on the light (running gamut from blue to purple to silver and eyes sometimes looking purple or gray) \ t , and also 2040 Sylia is a more emotionally unstable woman who flies out of the handle when she's not in public, and perhaps holds even more secrets than before. Also, Sylia does not take so much risk on the battlefield, because here she is rather a type of mobile box balance, but she does battle when she has to. 2) Originally Priss was a short African woman, and a really bad mood that always chose to fight people who insulted her always bitten more than she could chew, etc. 2040 Priss, however, set out on the road alone Clint Eastwood loner - very cold, very stoic and emotionally distant (more like the original Sylia you can say) so he's not really connected with anyone. Also her hair is stronger and feline (great improvement) and she is dressed in skin like Trinity of "The Matrix" (though much less annoying than before, unfortunately, writers her at the end of revealing her reasons) hates ADP). 3) Originally Linna had it big black hair for her, but now her hair is shorter, browner, and, well, more than 90 years old. 2040 Linna is also a clerk who is unlucky with sexual harassment. As if to apologize for the way she was treated by OAV writers, 2040 writers actually devoted the first 6 episodes of Linna, writing her as a new country girl to the city, but decided to meet Knight Sabers and win a place with them that eventually does. 4) Originally a short girl with black hair who was often a mocking victim and ate a lot of candy, Nene is now a short blond girl who likes to irritate and take Pot shoots at detective ADP Leon McNichol (revenge for him) to play with her in OAV? and other characters, even her surrogate sister Linna and Mackey, "brother" Sylia, who becomes infatuated. Cockey and arrogant, she still eats a lot of candy and is a master hacker, but she is eventually deflated and grows out of her comic relief status. 5) Nigel Kirkland is a new character, tall, stoic, rough-looking man with long black hair (looks like Adrian Paul from the Highlander TV), replacing Dr. Paul Kirkland. The Raven of the old series and now serves as the man who supplies the service to Sylia's hard suits. Nigel is also a lover of Sylia, but according to his behavior you wouldn't know. It's a kind of father / big brother / character mentor Mackey. 6) Leon and Daley are back, but of course different. The original Leon was a tall handsome boy built as a baseball player with smooth brown hair, blue eyes, black leather jacket, tight blue jeans and always with a revolver that could magically wrap more whallop than howitzers if necessary; while he wasn't really a bad guy deep down, he was kind of a jerk, but he served mostly as a comic relief as he tried to chase Priss romantically (exactly what he saw in her is a secret) but occasionally he and Daley served as an information guide to important points conspiracy. Also, the original Daley was a fairly muscular red head, dressed in pink-purple suits because he was a tremendously homosexual figure who always hit Leon when she didn't provide important information. In 2040, Leon is no longer a handsome boy, but your typical rough guy type, with black hair, pointed black hair, brown eyes, tall and sporty big muscles, brown leather jacket and blue docks (actually looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger). or maybe overdrawn by Colin Farrell, or Hugh Jackman), and he still carries a revolver, one big, but not as strong as before. Although 2040 Leon still has a little probelm attitude (especially in the approaching Priss), he is not nearly as much jerk as he was in the old series, but he is in a bad mood and he is easily angry with Nene and Daley (also drinks too many coffee). And Leon is still after Priss, but this time he has much more luck. Meanwhile, Daley is taller (but not as tall as Leon), a nicer boy-looking guy with red goggles, white suit, green eyes and light brown hair, and carrying a large machine gun (actually looking like James Marsden of X-Men); Daley is much smarter and more assertive than in 2040 than OAV, and although it is not entirely clear, his homosexual tendencies have almost completely disappeared, except when he is jealous of hearing about Leon asking about Priss's e-mail. 7) Brian J. Mason (what does it mean "J"?) is back, so is Quincy, but Mason is much more the main criminal here, with Quincy as a co-rogue because he already Not a towering figure of horror, but vegetables with lots of batteries and wires plugged into it. Mason now sports stroking brown hair instead of black hair, as it did in the OAV (he actually looks like OAV Leon in a suit) and he is much from Alan Rickman's villains school. 8) Although perverted in the first series, Mackey is no longer a pervert in 2040. Of course, in 2040 there are a lot of things that are different from Mackey, but they won't be revealed here. Sylia now has her companion, the Alfred-the-Butler type named Henderson, who is worried about her and the gang. 10) In the original series, boomers such as Replicants in "Blade Runner", armed with their own thoughts and feelings and ambitions, but in 2040, they are more of a kind of stupid monster-on-the-rampage. Mostly they are just big robots who do whatever they plan (hard work, fight, cleaning, etc.) And they tend to "go", which means trying to develop and become a monster. in the process. <br /> <br /> What remains the same is the humanity theme of VS technology (have the machines of the soul?). Sadly, this series, albeit well animated and well written, runs only 26 episodes, so it moves faster than it might be, especially those of us who are used to more than one season of our favorite characters, and unfortunately it still ends up on a cliff hanger with unsolved storylines (which I will not discuss here. What saves this show and what it is, are the characters, the color of the bolts, the stoic loners, the psycho women, the genocidal mad men) , rough cervical cops, sardonic intellectuals, wise old sages and loving innocent people, far more diverse than before and with much bigger games, are enough to make this show go longer. it's a good watch and the English Oak (according to ADV) is pretty good, though not without a few flat spots, but definitely better than the oak on the original.
