Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is rarely popular, said that everyone should see this movie because it's something that can help heal the world .... It's one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen and They add comments to Tutu .... I have read many comments, and when they move from good to average, make comments on the selection of actors ... The fact is that it deals with one of the most extraordinary events in our world. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission .... for the first time, the country has decided to broadcast its terrible history, find its way forward and create a way for people to heal ... WHERE TO FIND THE FILM begins with the fact that White the policeman is offered the opportunity to get rid of the brutal crimes and the Black man tries to make sure he doesn't get into it, plunges into the humanity of the people and the huge healing needs we all need .... <br /> <br /> Definitely thumb up ..... For everyone .... Once again, I am proud to be South Africa ..... <br /> <br /> Here is an interesting comment: http: //www.biz- community.com/Article/196/97/5223.html
