I really love this movie, I saw it the first time I worked a video store. When I went to buy it they told me it was from the press and I couldn't get it that way I thought today I would look. And then I found out that they put it in Spain on DVD under the title "Algo Mas Que Amigos" and you can buy it there in English and Spanish on DVD .... I hope it helps ..... I know how hard is to find movies that we love were not released to the US market. best luck..oh For more information here is one place to look .... HTTP://www.zonadvd.com I think it will be worth $ 10 USD on eBay as well.
