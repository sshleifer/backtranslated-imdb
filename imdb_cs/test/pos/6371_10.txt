I loved the complete Savages! Why did they cancel her anyway? They were supposed to do the second season and so on ... God! They always cancel good shows ... and leave all the boring stuff. Nothing interesting on TV because Complete Savages is gone. This show was a great idea. The only firefighter's father with five crazy sons and a lazy dog ​​... Each of them has his madness in the house. TJ is always the kid ... always smaller ... Kyle the Rocks! It breaks everything it touches! He's always in custody, always doing bad things ... But still, he's so funny with all the things he does. Sam is the smart guy. She's always shy and stupid about girls ... Finally she ends up with Angela's corridor. Chris is an athlete who has nothing to do with school, studio and so on. He's always funny. And finally ... Jack! Rock show. The oldest of all, the macho guy, the "rock star" ... But still as crazy as everyone else. Nick is with these guys ... helpless. Oh! And I almost forgot! Uncle Jimmy ... He's a man! He's like a 30-year-old child. It's like doing the same stupid things the boys do. I've always wondered how he ended up being a fireman ... And the dog is a picture of the entire Savage family. The thing is ... this show had everything to make it really big. He had everything, man! But of course ... they canceled it ...
