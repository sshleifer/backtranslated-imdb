Anyone who knows horror movies knows that most of them are not scary at all. Some people enjoy gorefests with subparaport storylines and character development. I personally enjoy horror movies that focus on the atmosphere and interesting concepts (eg, The Story of Two Sisters, Kairo, etc.). Regardless of the type of horror movie that you personally like, there are only a few selected that scare you. Noroi is one of them. It is a documentary, which means that the whole film is a compilation of video clips that are linked by the legend of the demonic entity Kagutaba. The assumption is that the journalist shot his own footage by interviewing people associated with the demonic rituals associated with Kagutaba, then took shots from other sources related to his research. The result is a relentlessly chilling experience that feels very real and very disturbing, despite the fact that the story itself is false. Some likened Noroi to the Blair Witch project, but the only similarity is the documentary style. One obvious difference between movies is that Noroi scares the viewer by linking events to one another using different sources. For example, a journalist records the exterior of a house he is researching and sees something special on the porch. Later in the film, a clip from another video's home video will present the same strange occurrence. The viewer's memories of these two incidents and chills begin to flow down the spine. Another example is a TV show with a children's psyche that answers every question correctly, with the exception of one. In fact, her response is so bad that the viewer can wonder what the creators think about it. Later, however, it turned out that the wrong answer was associated with an extremely disturbing event. That's really smart movie creation. Another difference between Noroi and Blair Witch is that Noroi doesn't provide one, but two very long finals, the other one a minute after the credits begin to roll. and it's the only biggest scene in horror movie history. I'm not saying such things easily. That totally destroyed me in an amazing way. Other aspects of making a movie are well done. The legend and ritual background of Kagutaba are very interesting and most of the actors did a good job. The only above-average performance comes from a person who is supposed to be just as crazy, so it is expected. Cinematography is deliberately bold, because all the footage is supposed to be videos shot on video cameras. Japanese movies are not known for their special effects, but the effects used here were amazing. In some cases they create a different mundane feeling (eg Static Interference or First Final), but in other cases they are alarming realistic (eg Second Final). When all is said and Noroi goes as the most frightening movie I've ever seen. I would like to go so far as to say there is no film in existence that would provide such utter terror from beginning to end, as Noroi does. Look now.
