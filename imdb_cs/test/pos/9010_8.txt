I like this show.It's so fun and cool. Kuzco is such a hilarious and interesting character, I love him. It's the thing that makes it show what it is, even though Kronk and Yzma are so fun and charming too. The show is great for me because I always manage to laugh, no matter if it's just one episode. It's just so fun and all the characters are so nice and cool, it makes the show in time to watch, unlike some crap on the Disney Channel. You haven't seen the movie, you'll find it will be very nice as well, so go ahead.
