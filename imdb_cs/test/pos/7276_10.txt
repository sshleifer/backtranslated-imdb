If you like fine psychological dramas / thrillers, it's a movie for you. Those who want to see an ordinary sex'n'crime erotic thriller will certainly not understand this movie, as Colin Firth apparently did when he called it "trash". However, Jennifer Rubin is the real star of the film. She's a great and beautiful actress! Along with the twisting and turning of the story, which is becoming more and more psychological, and which reflects on you, the beautiful direction, photography and especially the music make this film a masterpiece. Also small parts are very good, especially Belinda Waymouth is amazing in her little scene. I hope it will be released on DVD soon and the album soundtrack would become a real dream!
