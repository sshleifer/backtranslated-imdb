Formula For Murder is not a well-known Giallo, but that doesn't mean it's not very good! The film was directed by Alberto De Martino, a man behind the iconic classics like Antichrist and Blazing Magnums. The film was released late in the Giallo cycle, but more than many of the movies released around the 'golden' period in the early seventies. Despite the lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly due to a competent manner that mixes Argento's styles of scene death with some really surprising plot twists, and a set of well-defined characters. The film may not be as exciting as many other films of this genre; but this is more than compensated in a way that the central situation is being fed to the audience, and the tensions resulting therefrom. The story begins with a fake priest raping a young girl named Joanna before pulling her down. Then we are a few years ahead and the girl is now a woman who is unfortunately in a wheelchair. She is trained at Craig Sports Event; A man who also has romantic designs for her. However, his suggestion is not met with Joanna's pleasure as a personal assistant who also has romantic designs on her. The film features plot in the middle of the road that forms the backbone of the film, and while it is not exactly logical; It's good to watch and advise that you're interested in an interesting movie. Director Alberto de Martino is apparently not afraid to show some outrageous gore scenes, and the best of this film is a priest who is beaten to death by a spade - and I personally wouldn't hesitate to name this sequence as one of my favorite murderous scenes of Giallo! Sometimes the action may be a bit uneven, but in general the action is very good. The director spends an eternity at the end of the film; But it's totally full of tension and the way it is played is good at using all the plot points that stood before him. The musical score, taken from Fulci's The New York Ripper, works well in this film and breaking the Giallo tradition, de Martin also includes some pretty good performances by cult veteran David Warbeck and Christina Nagy, in his only feature role. Overall, this film is not one of the simplest Giallo to meet; But its worth watching and coming recommended to fans of this kind of movie.
