Based on a true story about Christopher Boyce (Hutton) and Daulton Lee (Penn), and their involvement in the sale of US secret government documents to the Soviets during the 1970s. Boyce is working for the government and his job is to protect these concrete documents that ultimately disillusion with his country's affairs and habits. He then adopts his drug-seller friend, Daulton Lee, who became the wanted man, to be a courier for these sensitive documents. Lee infiltrates the Russian embassy in Mexico and makes contact with Alex (Suchet) and they both start playing a spy game. Lee's interest is purely money, while Boyce stands out against anger Alex believes Lee is the inner man of the US government. Things start to be fields when Lee is addicted to drugs and reckless behavior in handling courier positions compensates for both Alex and Boyce. Lee becomes more paranoid, and the initial game of espionage becomes more mortal and consequent to everyone involved. This is a real spy thriller without a nasty action. Character motifs and analysis of real objects is compassionate but very well written, and the film cleverly connects real-life events with basic political themes about human predatory behavior. Where a larger nation uses its political power to run smaller nations. Well directed and intense parts, especially where the protagonists are incredibly overhead in the spy game. Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn give an incredibly impressive performance in a film that challenges authority and yet there is no simple answer to the political message or complexity of this system. The situation of the protagonists becomes a fundamental message within "Falcon and Snowman" and makes it a clever political thriller with a moving element on society, human relationships and the American system. Great movie! <br /> <br /> **** 1/2 of *****!
