Peter Coyote was the only name I knew from the cast, so I wasn't happy to watch this movie. The only IMDb comment was positive, so I watched it for a late night T.V. I would recommend this movie as a good night observation. It's better than a lot of this genre. The storyline is excellent, acting is not brilliant, but it is not bad. I usually don't like flashbacks, but they work in this movie. As I said, I didn't recognize any of the actors by name, but I met Michele Lee, who gave a decent, hard work, as a woman who wanted to stand by her husband who lied to her. (Was it landing knots?) Anyway, he's wearing really good. Note: You can enjoy it more if you miss the first few seconds of credits. I did it and it helped me. When you see the end of credits, you get what I mean by The Wayne Kennedy character, who is really weird, taking it to 7 rather than 6.
