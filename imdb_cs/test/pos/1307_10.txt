That was a great movie. It had one "sot-so-nice" blast. In addition, there were some very intense (drama) scenes that could be unsuitable for younger audiences, below 6. <br /> <br /> For and under the radar movie, acting was quite enjoyable, and touched in our family room for almost perfect landing. She realized the attention of our whole family and we were sorry that it was over. This film had elements of spy children with young people who saved the day, but got a somewhat credible scenario. Dream scenes were initially scattered, but they did a lot of work to create this plot. The jokes and hi-jinx were also quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> We hope you like it just like us.
