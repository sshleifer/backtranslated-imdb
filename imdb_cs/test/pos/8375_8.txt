It's a good movie in Vienna about a driver's cab, Toni (Donald Buka), who steals a passenger's identity when a passenger is shot while sitting in the back of the cabin. This gives him an identity because he is an illegal immigrant, but has to play the role of a victim until he makes a flight to the US with a ticket in the name of the victim. Mrs. Manelli (Joan Camden) shouts him, but she is accused of the mental problems of her husband Claude (Francis Lederer), a concert pianist. As a result, Toni's released the hook. Claude does not want to say goodbye to his wife, but runs away from him. There are a few twists, and finally, Toni and Mrs. Manelli are running away together - both trying to escape their lives in Vienna. The final is tense, exciting construction. Will they get away ..... ??? Unfortunately, the picture quality is not fantastic and there is a line that runs down the middle of the picture for a while. The cast is very good in their roles, especially the portrait of Claude from Francis Lederer's film. Also important for the story is Heinth (Manfred Inger) as Marie's taxi owner (Inge Konradi) as a friend of Toni's hometown and inspector (Hermann Erhardt). It's a good movie.
