Well, as you can see, I got to this side quite late, but I have the advantage of reading all the previous records before I decided. I found this page by accident when I was looking for other Marine Corps movies. Let's start by telling you I was playing Marine Boot, Pvt. Labarsky, and was based at MCRDep, San Diego at the time. Jack Webb and his crew chose 15 permanent staff, some of whom had speaking parts, and another 15 Marines who just finished Boot Camp. It formed a platoon and Marines who displayed various "DIs". In my best memory, Captain and Pvt. Owens (Don Dubbins) was not in the Marines. We spent about three weeks in Hollywood (Studio City Film Lot), CA filmed the movie section we were dealing with, and then we finished another footage after we left. Like me, let me clarify some of what has been questioned in the previous records as best I can. "Cuff Daddy" commented on our platoon's ability to shout "Yes, sir" without moving and so on. "Yes, we were screaming for the sound boys and that was the scene." As you recall Marines Marines when you are DI or who started asking and before you finished, you already took the breath of air that allowed you to shout the right answer to the top of your lungs. So it happened. "74Sooner" commented on a walk through the same building on a Parisian island, however, as I mentioned earlier, all the scenes were shot in the City, CA studio. They were built from photos taken on the island of Paris and on-site excursions and maritime advisors from the Parisian island. Sorry, you were in real buildings, not in series. "schappe1" brought a lot of good points, but about a platoon incident on a Parisian island when this Jack Webb said we were, "The movie came about because of an accident, and the Marine Corps didn't want to give something it would affect one of the family members of the Marines who died that night, although the Marine Corps would provide Marines and help for a film that matches the public, why Marine DI does what it does. ‚Äù<br /> <br /> As mentioned a few of you, me even at the time we shot the scenes, I captured my own thinking this dialogue was cleared up a lot and of course it's not how it goes in real life.In the 1950s it was how it had to be done. br /> <br /> One story that I would like to pass on is about the interaction that has taken place between the Marines and the film crew, and between the film crew and the film crew, Jack Webb. Yes, sir "to everyone who moved. To go to the second week it was more common to hear" Yes sir "coming from all directions. On stage, someone would bark for something that should be done with the lighting and from above on the podium above the answer "Yes, sir." All this at one of our informal meetings, said Jack Webb. "If I knew I'd get such respect from this crew, I'd bring you here years ago." There was Lt. handed down from San Diego to play DI from another platoon and one Jack Webb struggles, but during one Art Nouveau shooting He was up to take number 32, and still Webb still tried to work with him by him. The next day they used the Paris Island advisor, who was DI Sgt. from the island of Paris and he did it well. At that time, I was a bit of a camera enthusiast, and I met a man who made him a pointer to him and how it turned out he would still give me shots and some of the 35mm film everyday shooting that was not used. The film strips I carved out of them and made them slides. After the movie came out in a VHS tape (DI, 11706 B & W / 106 min.), My Kids and Big Kids have an explosion when they try to find out who finds the most on my screen.
