Do not look into the basement is actually a very clever and thoughtful exploitation film that gets a bad rap because of its cheap quality and misbehavior. Sure, it's not a masterpiece of someone's standards, but it's a very fun little B-movie with a lot to offer and even a lot of scary scenes that stay in your head. As I said, acting could have been a lot better, but that's the case with most exploitation, so I can't complain. The story is smart and has some great plot twists that will keep you guessing. I thought it was a lot of fun, too. There's just something great about older gore movies because they didn't have CGI at the time, so they had to set it up for themselves. Check out this time!
