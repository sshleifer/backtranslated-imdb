CGI's feature film was just released this year, but while it will provide kids with a lot of fun, for die-hard Alvin fanatics and followers who grew up with the 60s and 80s cartoons shows, Chipmunk Adventure is probably the best animated movie by Alvin and Chipmunks , sometimes. <br /> <br /> For starters, animation is always amazing, character patterns are just like in cartoons - unlike the movie itself, it's just fun to watch. There are no celeb voices, no CGI-generated effects, just pure 2-D quality, hand-drawn animations and colors are fantastic-bright, bold and beautiful. Jokes and humor are a typical squirrel standard and the story is in place. In truth, The Chipmunk Adventure is all that should be a live action movie, but not. Alvin, Simon and Theodore compete with Chipettes, Elenor, Jeanette and Britney in a hot air balloon, and on the way, children meet with all kinds of problems and dilemmas they have to deal with in their own way. And no chipmunk movie is complete without an odd rendition of classic rock and pop hymns. Chipmunk Adventure is for both children and adults - another advantage over CGI - as the 2007 version will win several new admirers, the 1987 film will appeal to young and older Chipmunk fans. Bagdarasian and Karman provide helium-like voices to the threesome. Overall, this film is a must for cartoon fans - you won't be disappointed yourself. If you've seen a live action version, then you'll feel that this movie is much better. If you didn't then you should go and see it even more, or even forget about Jason Lee's movie and as an alternative to stick to this
