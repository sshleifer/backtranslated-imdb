A really good Australian movie. Beautifully restores the look and feel of Sydney as it was in the 1950s. I was very impressed with this film when I first saw it during the opening cinema and it still stands very well. Fine Noir Overhead, amazing camera work, sophisticated lighting, and some fine cross-board performances. Absolute "Must See" for all students of the 70s Australian cinema.
