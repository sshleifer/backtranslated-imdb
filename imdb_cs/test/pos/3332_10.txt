These cartoon writers are reluctant with their corny (and fun) puns. The first shot we see is an island prison with the following sentences: "Alka-Fizz Prison - No Noose is Good Noose". Inside the prison, the first sign we see is "Welcome: Have a Place." They then show an electric chair. Corny gives way to smart, however, as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With a pen in his hand he literally pulls the door beside him and then escapes it! In no time, he cruised-the United States, zipped across Canada and is in the northern part of this country. We see Canadian Royal Mounted Police and of course our hero Droopy, known here as "Sgt. McPoodle." He has the task of catching a great criminal from Alka-Fizz. So, with his trusted little blue horse, he goes out in the heavy snow to track down the wolf being sought. From now on we get a normal story: Droopy is always one step ahead of the wolf, no matter what's happening .... and both characters are involved in some wild and very funny gagy look. Droops even emerge from an eagle's egg on top of a mountain. Nowhere can a wolf go - or do (plastic surgery!) To escape the fearless "Sgt. McPoodle." By the way, by the way, in the history of cartoons there may not be an overreaction than this wolf every time he sees his nemesis! His screams, face and body, always in horror, are a big part of the gags' views. Do you think this cartoon of one joke would be monotonous, but not. It's more good stuff from Tex Avery and the gang, just one of 24 cartoons in the DVD "Complete Theatrical Collection" with beautifully looking restored visual effects.
