There is a large cast of scientists, mathematicians and others on both sides of string theory. He is continually being questioned as untested, untested, and perhaps dead. The closest proselytizing that someone is doing is to explain that quantum physics, a set of mathematical ideas that provide an extremely good approximation of what is happening to sub-atomic particles, has never demonstrated an incorrect prediction. It is not so with the String theory; No one is willing to say, on camera, that String Theory is true, so a piece maintains a respectful distance from the subject.
