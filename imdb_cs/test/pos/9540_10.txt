The railway kids are perhaps my favorite movie of all time, just for the brilliant performance of the cast, the warm, humane work of three children and people they meet near the railway in a beautiful English landscape. Jenny Augutter is particularly believable in her role as "Bobbie" of her sister Phyllis's older sibling and brother Peter. The adventures they discover and the relationships created in their new home and surroundings are very real and fascinating. part of the huge British history and soundtrack is very mobile. This gratifying film never fails to bring tears to my eyes every time just as it makes me homesick. \ TI often wondered if I should be born at that time, as I think I would be fine with how people were treated with each other chivalry and decency. In short, I consider this film to be somewhat of a masterpiece and must see anyone who is considered "sensitive or caring". Edith Nesbit wrote this story around the beginning of 1900 and what a wonderful story it is. More children today have to read or see a movie instead of playing a violent video game. If we had more movies of this nature, the world would become a better place.
