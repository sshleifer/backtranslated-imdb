Darr, though a copy of a Hollywood movie, is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It is not only beautifully portrayed, but also great songs and beautiful scenery. Shahrukh is his usual self. His expressions and voice correspond to his character. I was pleasantly surprised to see Sunny Deol in the movie. She is a bit romantic and kind in the film, unlike his other characters in her other films. Sunny was supposed to be portrayed as a good kid in the movie, but eventually looks like a bad guy at the end. Juhi Chawla is beautiful and lively. It's her usual self. In short, a great love story with passion.
