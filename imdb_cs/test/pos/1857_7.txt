Last year, the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin and the 150th anniversary of the publication of "Origin of Species," it is appropriate that "Creation" Jon Amiel be published. The film focuses on Darwin's life (Paul Bettany) while he wrote his famous work, and the slight pressure he put on his family life. I think the film has overwhelmed Darwin's tensions with his religious wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly) and his guilt over his late daughter Annie, but I still like the idea of ​​Darwin's theory of working as a karate on religious dogma. As it was, the United States was one of the last countries in which "Creation" found a distributor, thanks to a debate on the development of creationism (yes, it still continues). <br /> <br /> Everyone in all is not a masterpiece, but I recommend it just as I recommend "Inherit the Wind". I hope one day the debate on creationism and evolution will not be a problem. If this movie helps give a debate to rest, then more power for everyone in the movie! Also starring Martha West, Jeremy Northam, Toby Jones and Benedict Cumberbatch.
