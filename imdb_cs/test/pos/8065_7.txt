Although the concept of a 32-year-old woman portraying a 12-year-old girl could be a stretch for today's sophisticated audience, in 1920 Mary Pickford fans demanded and expected her favorite star. The opening scene portrays Annie's tomboyish character as an overt leader of a multi-ethnic street gang in a comic "battle" with a competing group. The view of a young girl immersed in a jaw and kicked may be a bit rude, but the scene is played in such a "gang" fashion that it would be hard to take it seriously. By the way, Annie can do it just as much as she can. When Annie returns to her apartment building and replaces her street bag with more girls' clothes, it becomes more difficult (especially in close-ups) to imagine this beautiful young woman as street urchin. However, for those who can collect the required suspension of infidelity, the rest of the film has its rewards. Vaccination among the comedy (Annie's gang at the show) for sentiment (Annie plans a birthday surprise for her Irish policeman's father) to tragedy (her father is killed on her birthday), the film gives Marie enough opportunity to display a variety of emotions, delighting her fans of any time. Of course, the desired "happy end" is finally achieved; the criminals are arrested with the help of Annie's friends and rivals, and most recently she is seen in the company of her friends who set out on a busy thoroughfare on a sunny day. Which is a good way to quit Mary Pickford. <br /> <br />
