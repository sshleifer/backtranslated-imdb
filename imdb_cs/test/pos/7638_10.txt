I watched this movie that thought it would be absolutely awful and that I was ready for all the grains, bad special effects, etc. But I was pleasantly surprised. Not to say it's the best vampire movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely not the worst. I liked the whole alternative state of reality / dream that got into the movie. The graphics were pretty good for a direct DVD movie and I like the overall look of the movie. I enjoyed the main character Sai. I usually ended up hating women leads, but there was something about her that interested me. Yes, he makes some bad decisions, but that was to be expected. Yes, the other characters were stereotypical, but I was expecting it. I don't know if I recommend this movie, but give it a chance and you can be pleasantly surprised. I'm putting this on my list of wine pleasures.
