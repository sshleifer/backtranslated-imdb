Created by Dennis Spooner, 'Department S' was a shiny thriller show about an offshoot of Interpol, based in Geneva, created to deal with the confusion of police secrets she couldn't handle. If the plane landed at Heathrow, where no one was on board when a man in space suit appeared in London, if a Rolls Royce passenger suddenly overcame the skeleton when the train that got into the station showed dead commuters he called 'department S' to get things done. Peter Wyngarde played 'Jason King', a beautifully dressed criminal writer whose fertile imagination has helped burst many bizarre cases. The king caught the public's imagination and later won a spin-off show. Stuart Sullivan (Joel Fabiani) and the delicate "Annabelle Hurst" (Rosemary Nicols) helped him slowly. Unusually for the 60th show, the department was led by a black man - 'Sir Curtis Seretse' (Dennis Alaba Peters) If the show looked and felt like 'The Avengers', it was hardly surprising. Many same writers and directors shared! Color titles have been designed by Chambers & Partners, and it's worth tuning yourself. Like many I.T.C. series, music was composed by Edwin Astley. His theme for 'Department S' has been one of the best television themes ever. Predictably, the show looks a little sexist and dates now, but don't be discouraged from you Imagine a hybrid of "Jonathan Creek" and "Austin Powers" movies and you have a 'Department S'! Trivia Note: episode 'Little nerve war' features young Sir Anthony Hopkins starring!
