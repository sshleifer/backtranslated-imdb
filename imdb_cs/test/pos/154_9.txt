No pun. I will not spoil anything about the story, but it is safe to assume that you already know the character of the main actor. And of course he is a priest, while he is "naughty", they exaggerate everything. Plus, it's the most erotic movie ever from Chan Wook Park. <br /> <br /> If you've seen previous works / Wooka movies, you know it's very visual (in a good sense) and it turns out again. While moving away from the revenge of his previous films on the surface, there is still some heat beneath him. And when it cooks, things start to get bad. But through all the darkness, there are also moments of light (fun) to be also. A very stylish yet provocative movie that lives off the mainstream and does a very good job ...
