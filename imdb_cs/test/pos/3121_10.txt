This little John Ford western with 'stars', but the cast of actors' characters is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary-like feel on how it traces the way west of the Mormons and it can be the most authentic look of all Ford movies, (it's on the same level as "The Sun Shines Bright," which he made a couple of pairs. years later). There are plenty of species, (a band of bandits join the wagon of the train in one place), but the dramatic points of the movie are almost random. Wonderful performance of Ford's joint stock company (Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr., Ward Bond, Jane Darwell, etc.) Significantly contributes to the authenticity of the film, while the closest movie gets to Denver Dennis star Joanne Dru. Dru was a much finer actress than she was ever awarded recognition as was Bond and Johnson, who at least was eventually awarded with Oscar recognition for his work in "The Last Picture Show". As he himself said, "It couldn't have happened with a nice boy". Add Bert Glennon's excellent photo location and you have an original piece of Americana that she couldn't have from anyone other than Ford. It is a film that truly honors America's pioneers and is full of emotions and feelings.
