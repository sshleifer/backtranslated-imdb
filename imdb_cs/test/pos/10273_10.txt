This is my favorite movie. A tragic romance intertwined with a complex mystery whose threads are all but invisible until it ends in a fantastic hurry. Brighter brilliance. I'd like to see another work of Gilles Mimouni, but at least he didn't do any more of what he did. Does the high quality of this work result in another overly daunting task? Has he moved back to another sphere of creative effort? I certainly hope it's not his last feature play, but I can't blame him if he decides to stop this gem as his only contribution to the world of feature films.
