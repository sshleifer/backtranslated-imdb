The aftermath of World War II resulted in the death of Soviet film. In the early 1950s, film production approached a total cessation (mere nine feature films were released in 1951), and the work of all filmmakers was attentively watched, and often censored, by the government. Following the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, filmmakers were given greater artistic freedom with their paintings, though many remained reluctant to challenge the heroic, optimistic and propaganda attitude towards warfare that was prevalent in previous years. Only in 1957, director Mikhail Kalatozov and writer Viktor Rozov became so courageous that they produced what is widely regarded as the first post-Stalinist Soviet masterpiece, Letyat zhuravli / Flying Cranes, one of the best images of war I have seen from any country time period. Not only was the film awarded for his artistic brilliance in the Soviet Union, but international recognition was soon followed, and Kalatozov's film was awarded the Palm d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1958. <br /> <br /> 'Cranes Are Flying is both a stimulating visual feast and a bold, humanistic depiction of war. Unlike many Soviet war films of that time, it was less constrained by the archetypal character of the traditional war hero and more concerned with the vanity, brutality, and inevitability of the conflict. Love, as a film concept, is too often idealized as the idea of ​​conquering everything and enduring endless suffering, yet the reality is much less romantic. In the film, two lovers, Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov), separated by the advent of WWII {widely known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War, 1941-1945}, promise to marry after the war, but the tragedy denies their wishes . Veronika is led to betrayal by the constant suffering and uncertainty of waiting, and agrees to marry Boris's cousin Mark (Aleksander Shvorin), a nice but unworthy young. The film can end with the proud victory of the Soviets and the patriotic flag waving process, but the optimism of this succession is immensely obscured by the bittersweet tragedy of our young female protagonist, who wanders helplessly into the famous crowds. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of "The Cranes are Flying" is the inspired and dynamic handmade cinematography of Sergei Urusevsky, which captures realistically and dizzyingly the chaos and confusion of war, not necessarily in the hail of firing and screams. dying comrades (in fact, only one of the movie sequences joins Boris on the Eastern Front), but from the perspective of the family and friends who stayed. In one particularly impressive, often quoted picture, the camera follows Veronica as she furiously searches Boris in a crowd of recruits and their families. The hand-held camera keeps track of the girl from the bus, passes the crowd beside her - captures the momentary passages of loved ones who said goodbye to their sons and husbands - before unexpectedly emerging from the crowd when Veronika disappears into the dust around the army tank squad, a breathtaking movement that offers a range and the urgency of a dramatic episode. Urusevsky first acquired his film experience as a military cameraman during the war and apparently fell in love with the possibilities of telling a hand-photographed photo: "The camera," he once said, "can express what an actor can't portray: his inner feelings, the cameraman has to deal with actors.
