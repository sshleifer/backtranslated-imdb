This is not your story of the police police, where the characters were only secondary to battle weapons and the pursuit of cars. So far, episodes are more realistic and intelligent. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something with a lot of Rambo-style cop stories, you won't find it here. I gave him 9. I wish this series lasted a long time. Morse is excellent!
