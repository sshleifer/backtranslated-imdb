A touching story told with tenderness: An unpleasant young Jewish girl in World War II America befriends a fugitive German prisoner hiding in a clubhouse. They discuss their lives and beliefs (it's anti-Hitler), sneaking food, becoming her only friend and ally. All this reminded me of a much better theatrical film "Whistle Down the Wind", where Hayley Mills befriends Alan Bates' conviction, but you definitely can't doubt the direction that is smooth or the performance that is sterling. Mature in Preschool, Kristy McNichol carries most of the picture and never comes across a fake note. Suddenly, when a prisoner is discovered (and Kristy is also discovered), the film is very hard. Her father, shocked and embarrassed to see his child behave with a "Nazi", puts a silent rage in it that I seldom saw (telling me, "You're dead for me," which must be devastating for the little girl. The final scenes do not dig; There are no great reunions, no peaks. The girl has to face the world, so she learns a bitter lesson about neighbors, friends and family. Surprising film.
