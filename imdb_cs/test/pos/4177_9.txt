The head was to be a proud moment not only for his stars (The Monkees and Victor Mature), or for his director / co-founder (Bob Rafelson), but also for his other co-founder, Jack Nicholson. As it stands, most of them seem to avoid it, and to outsiders the film is considered, at best, as a curiosity. While the TV series was superbly based on the Beatles '' Help! ", This film is also judged by the same agreement. Yet far from the trite and painfully overrated Beatles films, and even from the Monkees T.V. series, the head has a depth layer. There is a darker nature's sub-undercurrent, and although it may sound like a bizarre thing to say about a pop band produced, about the use of certain themes and images (hitting women, laughing at cripples and real Vietcong shots). POW shot in place-empty range) give the film the advantage that many 'serious' movies would not dare to aspire to. There are also fun moments that range from James Bond parody to 'Big Victor' and my personal favorite, Mickey Dolenz under beseige Arabian soldiers riding. (One of them turns to Mickey and hisses' pssst! ', Just for' pssst! ', To appear in the headlines!) The band is aware of its made film in the movie (' I'm a manikin, Mickey '' always a dummy ', says Tork, neatly summarizing his one-dimensional foil role series, which means their characters? They play acting and don't do it here? they are more open and therefore less general and irritating than they were in the series. This level of parody and self-awareness even takes their false four origins, with the finer Maharishi and out-and-out confirmation with a waitress who asks, "Well, if it's not God's gift of eight years, you still pay tribute to Ringo Starr? also for Tork whistling 'Strawberry Fields Forever' while in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> Then of course there are songs, six of which are a little more psychedelic than usual, which could alienate their fanbase and even portraits Frank Zappa would not appear on an adult audience at this moment, probably the most charming 'As We Go Along', although the first, Carol King-Penned 'Porpoise Song', is an interesting talk about the desire to live while time is hopelessly gone and death is On a lighter note, his chorus of 'porpoise laughs' seems to be a direct mickey-taking 'I'm Walrus'. <br /> <br /> Constantly resourceful with direct links to silent film and Perhaps the finest element is his narrative structure, not the only one, but the most important one? The reason why it improves with more looks, the story goes left, right, forward, backward, circular and across several levels of reality. Essentially, the series of sketches hung loosely, its cohesiveness tightened by the cosmic time-resisting plot that hangs its inner logic together with the flashback, the dream sequence, the prison of the mind, and the channel changer of the remote. With a perfect start and end, this intelligently written science film was not what the preschool audience expected of The Monkees and subsequently suffered a negative critical income. Now these expectations have passed, this is in dire need of serious re-evaluation.
