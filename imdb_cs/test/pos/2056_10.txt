I saw this film about a dozen times because it was originally released theatrically. Anyone who calls this movie garbage or terrible just doesn't understand action movies or recognize good. Perhaps some incidents and results may seem far more appealing, but in my opinion, screenwriter Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) has created one of the most sophisticated action adventures you'll ever encounter. Over the top or not, this film flows like a movement and action just comes. The final action sequence is one of the best I've ever seen in every movie. The cast in this movie will burst. Genna Davis has done tremendous performance and her bloody shame has never been a "LKG" sequel. Samuel L. Jackson is cheerful when her sidekick Mitch tries to help her discover her lost past and make a few dollars at her own fortune. If I Baffles How Anyone Could Not Get This Movie. It packs so much excitement and is so fun. Wisecracks in this movie still make me laugh just as hard 10 years later. In my mind, the first Matrix movie and Long Kiss Goodnight were easily 2 of the best and most original action movies of the 1990s. By the way, Shane Black was lucky to sell this script. At that time it was the highest selling scenario and its value every penny. It's so sad that viewers never gave this movie a chance because they would have witnessed Renny Harlin's best film and Genny Davis as you never saw it before. We Long Live "The Long Kiss Goodnight" !!
