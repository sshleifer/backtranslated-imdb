Looking at this night's cable and on-demand and thinking, "this is the type of movie that Alec Guiness and Glynis Johns could play if it was done in the late 1950s". Farewell in English tradition. Alfred Molina and Brenda Blethyn are very kind and honest in their ideas. Naomi Watts just dissolves in the ditzy Jayne Mansfield-ish (if she could act) the way. The rest of the cast has some big bends and bits. The Welsh landscape is pleasant. An absurd assumption, indeed and not believable, but it does not get in the way of enjoyment. It's not a great movie, but it is a really fun watch. And Walken is at his best. Joy to look!
