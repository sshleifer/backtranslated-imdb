I watched Attack Of The Show religiously about 6 months (maybe longer but not much). I was very infatuated with Olivia and I found Kevin to be very funny and repertoire among them very good. Recently, although it starts to wear thin due to many factors for me. The first of my favorite segments is the first 15 minutes, called Around The Net, which show 5 video clips that you would find on sites like Youtube that are generally funny or people who accidentally hurt themselves (some intentionally). Umm, when I saw the same things 4 and 5 times a week over and over again, I really didn't see anything so good and I can only laugh at those people who probably break their necks and paralyze. The show is like a late show wants to be / Colbert The message wants to be with his politics too, if you don't live in a blue state and aren't automatic liberal, this humor gets old as well, McCain is old, yeah, whatever. Libs have no courage to make fun of themselves because they are not smart enough to realize that they would rejoice in having a sense of humor that they can laugh at, so it's almost every show bash McCain or Palin, sheesh. So we get the same old visions of people who have been hurt to laugh and then some left-wing political humor that never laughs out of its own weakness. I'll watch because I'm looking at work and it's all I hope to have fun but it'll be a little old. Although I liked the fill of Chris and Alison hosts, it was actually a good pace change; maybe this show could make a rotating host. Olivia, whom I thought was really funny at the beginning, resorted to this constant response and is old, lol. 7 out of 10; It will keep you in a young mind that is good if you are a younger baby boomer like me (mid 40s). Maybe the cartoon of the day would be another segment they should do, there's a ton of things they could use.
