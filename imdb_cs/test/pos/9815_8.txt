This bitter slice of magical realism had a varied production history (replaced by the director / writer) and refueled at the box office, but it's a great movie. Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are brothers who are in front of the teenage mom (Lorraine Bracco) with an alcoholic alcoholic (Adam Baldwin). During his drinking seizures, Baldwin physically abuses Mazzello and manipulates him to keep silent about his situation. But when Wood Cotton on what's going on, boys put their heads together and hatch a fantastic solution to Mazzello's devastating dilemma. <br /> <br /> I like movies that combine fantasy and dark reality. They are rarely successful financially ("Lawn dogs" is a similar example), but they are usually original and fascinating. Drunken Baldwin is shot from a low, childish perspective and his head deliberately cut off under the top of the frame. This device allows us to judge him purely by his actions and as a totally physicized animal. Wood and Mazzello are both excellent and effortlessly dragging us into their dark, frightening world. <br /> <br /> "Radio Leaflet" is a small red stroller that carries its stuff. dream. <br /> <br /> Really interesting stuff.
