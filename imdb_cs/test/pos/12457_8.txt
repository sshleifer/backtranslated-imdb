I thought it was a very bold representation of the old hokey concept 'Tarzan', which popular Hollywood, Weismuller et al. <br /> <br /> Yes; There's a lot of stupid stuff. But the idea is stupid. It is almost unbelievable that a human child could be chimpanzeed into adulthood. I'm tempted to say absolutely incredible, but the concept has never been tried. And there is certainly too much anthropomorphism for comfort. Although in these circumstances I can see how this could be avoided. We now also have a much greater insight into the issue of acculturation, and we know that a child raised from childhood without human behavior would never learn in adulthood. However, if you can get your head around a lot, there is a lot to admire that it is both imaginative and bold. Lambert makes a beast thing with great confidence. I am tempted to say that this is the most compelling and compassionate role I have seen playing. There's a lot of other great performances. Last but not least, they are Sir Ralph Richardson and Ian Holm. What is especially worrying - and rightly - is the monkey's perception of people. We see almost from the perspective of the poor, stupid, helpless brothers, whom we are so routinely master. And it shows well how the false "civilization" and "morality" with which we cover and justify our actions is nothing but an expression of selfishness and arrogance. Sometimes it may seem a bit exaggerated, especially in the hideous spaces of the museum, but what we see is not just the truth about the Victorians; its right about how we are today. It is the one that must be given and cannot be given often enough. The obsession of Holm's "ray-ray" as a symptom of civilization - as if she had hair on her face - was a primitive condition for contempt - an excellent example. Primitive bearded readers take note. The story is depressing. In the end, it's a tragedy. Because even when he returns to the jungle and freedom from moral tyranny, which is truly a human "civilization"; we know he's condemned. Before the third millennium is 50 years old, wild simans will be hunted down as shrubs and their environment developed for agriculture and mining to satisfy the insatiable human excess. Finally, it's a story about yourself. The way to the extinction that other Simians tread must eventually be followed by people. <br /> <br /> It is strongly recommended for your ethical behavior, despite hockey moments.
