It seems that I have noticed that many people have never seen this film, and those who usually refused it as garbage are really bad. <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw this film almost one of those people ... thank God I'm patient, otherwise I would never find such a classic. <br /> <br /> As this movie is goofy, it's also a must for anyone who is either a fan of the 80's or just has a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I know there are a lot of people who will tell you that this movie is somehow a derivative of Better Off Dead ... so what if it is? They were great movies! Frankly, Savage Steve Holland is a genius! 10/10
