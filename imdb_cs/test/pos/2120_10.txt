My children, DD 7 and DS 10, enjoyed the film so much that they wiggled in place. It was good, old-fashioned, Rated G, family fun. This movie was made for kids .... someone really understands. It was fun to see Julia Roberts, Brice Willis, Garth Brooks and other stars make their appearance performances. As someone who lives in the city, he invented the fictional "Big Texas", I can say that they have made a fair and accurate representation. Children looked like children, not superstars. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone supports this film to send a message to Hollywood that we need more movies like this. Look at it, then you spread the word!
