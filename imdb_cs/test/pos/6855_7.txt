I saw Anatomy years ago - dubbed in the house of friends I don't remember much, and then I saw in the video store is the second - not really related to the first Frank Ponte doing a little portrait. And he was fine, not as good as the first one. I see again tonight - it's not a dubbed edition of collectors. I really like German movies like this, it's very interesting and people and cults like the one in the movie could exist i think i dunno. But it's very coarse and frightening. Anatomy 2 is a bit different and the characters aren't as good first. But if you really think Anatomy is interesting and good, you should see the other.
