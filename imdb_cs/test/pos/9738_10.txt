Originally I saw a flash Gordon series on PBS, and thought it was fun and awesome, I overlooked the special effects of rocket ships with sparklers, and a big dragon monster with lobsters claws who cares it is 1936 and it was a show, so everyone a week would show a new chapter, buster Crabbe played flash Gordon three times, in all 3 series. In 1939 he played buck rogers, in 1933 played Tarzan the fearless.he was very busy actor.beautiful jean rogers played sexy dale arden.frank shannon as zark professor, and Charles Middleton played evil ming merciless.he makes darth vader look like boycout The series were very close to Alex Raymond's comic book. time.not to mention ray guns and television.this one stands out as the best series ever. the sequel to flash Gordon's trip to Mars is about 2 chapters longer, the next flash Gordon conquers the universe is just 12 chapters. and then there are natives of mongo. ., hawks, lions, sharks-m en. the feature version omits shark-men scenes. for full effect you need to see the complete serial.i heard George Lucas was inspired by flash Gordon when he did star wars.flash Gordon was from universal studios.and the music on the soundtrack is from many universal movies like Frankenstein Bride, Werewolf from London, Daughters Dracula, etc., even today Gordon continues to delight people young and old of 10 out of ten.
