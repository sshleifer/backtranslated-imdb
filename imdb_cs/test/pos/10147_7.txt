A beautiful little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans around the murdered spy, kidnapped child, ugly church, stranger land, and some random taxidermists. Jimmy Stewart is still a great hero for Hitchcock, the story stretches to his great peak at the embassy, ​​but lacks the tense threat of Hitchcock's black-and-white, low-budget originals. However, another great movie from the Grand Master is stable.
