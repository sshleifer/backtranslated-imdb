When viewed for the first time, this film appears to be a fairy tale of a beautiful and distinctly white horse that has never been forgotten. However, in the context of the story, the result is that the survival in the immediate post-Civil War of America must have had a horse and not an old horse, but a really big horse. And Eagle's Wing is such a horse. But there is another thing for a man worthy of such a horse. Who should own it? Native American or AWOL Soldier? The story mimics primitivism against civilization. As other commentators have said, it is ironic that the English director has noticed this, and then created this simple theme in the Western world as if no one else has ever seen it. The film is essentially about this beast and the wild harshness of the environment and the people who lose it. Photos and soundtrack are excellent. Martin Sheen's performance is a revelation. This film, released in the same year as another great performance by Sheen as Willard in 'Apocalypse Now', points to his abilities that have never been so free of the opposite. It's a shame. Comparing the two stories brings surprising similarities between them - not least that the two films map the path of man into the soul to find redemption. While Willard is redeemed, I'll leave it to the viewer to decide if Pike is finally. The end is wonderful in the true sense of the word and very mobile; be warned. This is an extraordinary film.
