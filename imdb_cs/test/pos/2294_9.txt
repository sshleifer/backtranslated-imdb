I agree with BigAlC - this film actually prepared me for a lot of cultural differences and practices before I went to live in Japan for a year in 1993. Tom Selleck has a great job here, as always, and the movie is very funny and educational. I am a big fan of Tom Selleck and bless this part with his usual charm and charisma of this part, bringing the film to life in such a way that I cannot imagine another actor pulling out. This movie featured several first-class Japanese actors, and it was very fun to watch them associate with Selleck - I can imagine the fun he had during the actual film shooting - the amazing Japan the place to go, whether you want to at party, look-seeing, or just try to take everything.
