I've always loved "Down with the Wind" and I've seen it many times. However, his end left me not only "hanging" but depressed, with a hopeless feeling. Finally, in "Scarlett," Ripley took us to a very plausible and satisfying ending ("beginning") of the original story. It follows that someone from Scarlett's obvious intelligence (as originally written) would eventually grow up. Although I, like most people, fell in love with Scarlett in GWTW, I got tired of the constant insane infantilism to the point of irritation, and I was disappointed that Mitchell had not shown Scarlett with that overt intelligence to even attempt emotional growth. . Fortunately someone finally did. (After all, it's not an annoying immaturity that was at odds with her beauty and intelligence, that's why Rhett finally gave up on her?) I think Ripley did a great job of describing this long delayed process, and Whalley- Kilmer did a great job of portraying it. Joanne WK has all the fire, exuberance and intelligent spark, just like Vivian Leigh, and is certainly at least as beautiful, if not more. There was only one Clark Shield. However, if I had to choose the actors from the thousands I was exposed to in his biography, it would certainly be Timothy Dalton. Dalton has the same charm that Gable had, which is necessary for Rhett's character. I can't imagine anyone getting close. In my opinion, Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were great cast and the only actors who could play Scarlett and Rhett. I think that both their performances were not only managed by late actors, but also by the spirit of their characters. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the whole cast. Julie Harris was her usual beautiful presence, and Jean Smart was an adorable kick! Even Ashley's character was nicely played by Stephen Collins, and the progress of his relationship with Scarlett was absolutely believable. The story has become a bit complex in Ireland, but life is the same, after all. they found it amusing. All in all, I enjoyed the fruit of Ripley's imagination. I wish I wrote it! <br /> <br />
