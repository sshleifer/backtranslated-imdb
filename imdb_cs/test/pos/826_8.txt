Like Steven Seagal, I'm also a big fan of Van Damme and I've been watching most of his movies since the beginning of his acting career. In this film Van Damme takes over the role of Jack Robideaux, who is a cop who just moved to New Mexico from New Orleans to work as part of a border patrol. He is haunted by memories of his past, it is up to Jack to end the group of Ex-Navy Seals from smuggling illegal drugs to the US that killed his daughter. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found this movie to be very good, Van Damme is in very good shape for 48 years and can really move. Action scenes are very intense and the film even throws a few twists to guess you. Unfortunately, Van Damme is not as intense as he said 10 years ago, despite the fact that The Shepherd: Border Control is the 3rd direct hard movie that Van Damme made possible the door opening for a larger project. Definitely recommend this movie to Van Damme fan or action movie fans in general; The Shepherd: Border Control is a great movie, not as good as Do Death, but better than Hard Corps. Make sure you try this, you won't be disappointed.
