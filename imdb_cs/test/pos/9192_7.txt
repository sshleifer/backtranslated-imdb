I have read the last comment on this film and I have to disagree with it completely and completely. You see, I am a Portuguese nationality, and although this film may call someone a little from Boston, it certainly says something to both Portuguese and Brazilian people, as well as immigrants everywhere. And why are you wondering? First, this film deals with two sibling nations: Portugal and Brazil. Brazil gained its independence in the early 19th century (by the heir of the Portuguese throne) and since then relations have improved greatly. However, a lot of prejudice is still meaningful as it may be. Due to the economic climate in Brazil during the 1990s, immigration to Portugal grew massively. Portugal is not only a country that has the same language, culture and faith as Brazil, but is also a gateway to the rest of Europe. Some people were forced to decide to cross the Atlantic and look for a better life, and Portugal was the first logical place to try to emigrate. As is always the case with many immigrants, averages below the minimum wage have been paid and treated as "dirt" - only in this case, because the language is similar, have their status been constantly informed as immigrants. Another curious thing in this movie is the idea he expresses about how a person so knowledgeable about the history of his own country was still trying to make a quick profit through export-seeking national resources. . It is people like this who keep Brazil in a constant state of imprisonment because the country is well endowed with natural resources and could easily climb the economic ladder if it were given a fair opportunity. In sense, this goes to show how colonialism still exists - Pablo representing exploited people, Igor man whose status as "nobleman" (or at least rich or "well off") is secured by a foreign colonial power that is in turn. represented by Kraft. <br /> <br /> If you've seen more Salles movies, you'll recognize it as a recurring theme - the fight against oppressive power. I don't want to give lectures or be promoted to teach history, but I thought this film was symbolically very powerful. I'm not saying there was no room for improvement (as always), but I think the last comment on him wasn't just narrow-minded, but his hands were unconscious. The last thing to say about this is to assume you've been watching this movie with the eyes of an "American film watcher". No damage to this note, but I think "foreign" movies can't be about "beautiful landscapes" - Art deals with the problems of its time. For example, wouldn't you expect Otto Dix to paint all the beautiful places in Bavaria and the Black Forest ... Why should you expect a filmmaker to focus solely on scenery when they think they should be covered by other relevant questions? Br /> <br /> In short, do not disassemble films with just two or three criteria. This film is very interesting, its photography is quite good and even the idea that the black and white coloring lot fits with what it deals with. I believe the picture is intentionally grainy ... like reality, right? :) <br /> <br /> Watch and follow your own conclusions ...
