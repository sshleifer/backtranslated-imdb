There are a number of reviews that comment on the cast of this film. Suffice it to say that Alex Cord has a strong lead over Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy. What worries me is that many of you may not know (at least) two existing versions of this movie. In the American version, Clay McCord gets an amnesty from Governor Lem Carter and then drives out of the redeemed city. I agree that the end is less than satisfying. However, in the original Italian cut, Clay McCord leaves the city (without weapons when he turned to a governor's gun) and is a bushwhacked hunter hunter who slowly depopulated Escondido's bandit. Bounty Killers are excited about the prospect of a $ 10,000 reward, but they are disappointed to find McCord's amnesty deal in the corpse's pocket. When they go away, they can hear them comment: "If this amnesty keeps up, I'll start buffalo!" . The same thing takes a minute to pray ... the other to die and place it on a flat course with movies like Keoma and The Big Gundown. As the end credits say in Italian cut "FINE".
