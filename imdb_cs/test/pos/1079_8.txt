I saw it at the London Film Festival at night, probably a shorter version. The summary of James McNally's film is very good. Nossiter very skillfully combines his winery exploration with wider concerns about globalization, homogenization, the influence of the mass media, the power of capital and the need for diversity. held by DV which some might find offputting, but which allows the Nossiter to grab people off the guards on a number of occasions that would probably not be possible to use more conventional equipment. Despite the vast feeling of film, the cut is very sharp, not just giving a show of world dogs, but also undercut a number of inquiries with somewhat contradictory visual images, and giving another sufficient rope to hang. To the extent this evoked Michael Moore's recent work (though Nossiter operates in a more subtle way), but probably the roots of the film revert to Marcel Ophuls' "Sadness and Pity", both in the way the film is constructed and in the emergence of "land salt" by French peasants as stars. De Montille pere et fils were present at the LFF screening and then answered questions. We really all need a little mess - brave Hubert! Overall, an excellent film with implications that go beyond the world of wine into how we build ourselves as people and organize our world.
