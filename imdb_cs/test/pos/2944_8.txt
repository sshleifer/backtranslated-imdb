This film was both fun and provocative. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to be moved and invited. Great acting, directing - and it's Canadian to start! It's a movie that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. Places in Ontario evoked such a feeling of nostalgia for the era. With so many garbage and shallow hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back independent film. For every family that has come to overcome the challenge or obstacle - whether financial or ill - this film hits a stunning chord! He approaches the idea of ​​the afterlife in a modern way - without the inexpensive appreciation of all the "gohst" and supernatural themes that have become the foundation in Hollywood and television networks.
