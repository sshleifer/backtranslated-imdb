It was this film he saw the next day at the Santa Fe Film Festival. I was pleased with his honesty and humor. It was the most inspiring movie I saw in a very long time - for some reason I can't get it out of my mind. It doesn't have to be for everyone because you think. I don't know if people in movies like to think so much, which is a shame. Actors who play Franklins are quite a finding. I can't imagine playing with such honesty. Although I thought a few supporting characters were not as good as Franklin's, I can totally forgive him - because that's an important movie in my opinion. I didn't expect to like it, but as I thought about it for days, it's very important fun.
