I'm surprised that manufacturing companies will sue for reproductions they won't deliver. I'm looking for this movie on DVD for a while and VHS for years. One can get all kinds of movies online ... old movies, new movies ... but all this targeted to a specific group. This film is for many very nostalgic. I'm not sure why I can't get a copy. Perhaps if there are enough people to write, the copyright holder will have a clue. It's time for it to happen. Yes, it's a date, but the OZ Guide is the same. It doesn't seem to be that hard. So for now, I'll see those illegal copies on search engines like many others.
