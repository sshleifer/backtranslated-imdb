In 1982, a small film called MAKING LOVE shocked the audience with its open and open view of a romantic love story that just became two men. I waited a few years for good, old-young romance between two men; LATTER DAYS is everything and more. Yes, it's soap, melodramatic, clich√© and quite sloping. That's what makes it so beautiful. There is nothing like a good romantic movie, and this movie is romantic in the best sense. As for the question of religion, I apologize to people, but these things are happening and people are going on now. It is not just the Mormon Church that rejects its homosexual members. Gay people in every religion faced harsh judgment and rejection. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. He has a perfect blend of fantasy-romance anchored in fact the everyday life of the characters. If I could give more than ten stars, I'd do it. Good love stories never go away; great love stories like LATTER DAYS are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> It's time!
