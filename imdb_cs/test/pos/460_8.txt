This is the story of a group of foreigners who tried to leave the country in Hungary in November 1956 at the time of the uprising. <br /> <br /> Once the airport is closed, the titular journey begins with a bus to Austria. As it would be obvious, they are stopped on their way, where they come against almost flawless Yl Brynner, whose military power as the Red Army Major has been marked by loneliness, his inner struggle between right and wrong, his quest for truth and his need to feel emotions for other human beings . He was saddened by the fact that his work alienated him from his friends and enemies, and longed for social contact. Robert Morley plays the stiff upper lip of an Englishman who, no matter how seriously a role, manages to keep an almost light-logical outlook on life, while Jason Robards has a stunning film debut that promotes the reason why he had so many roles throughout his career. Deborah Kerr, as a leading lady, exhibits the grace and femininity that we have associated with her, yet she manages to pass on the strength and determination needed for her character. The film deals with a very turbulent time in European history, but never ceases to remind us that in all of us it is good and you can never judge the book completely. Fabulous screenwriting ensures that for all the seriousness of the topic can still be a great one-liner and comic cases that add, rather than downplay the film. Chemistry in the game cat and mouse between Kerr and Brynner will allow you to understand why they appeared in more than one movie together. All in all, a thoroughly funny movie that I would definitely watch again. 8/10
