Sorry to repeat again and again, but here's another great episode of Columbo. That's why I'm such a fan - most episodes are really great! The best episodes always have a standout feature of some sort, and in this case the killer and his accomplice are perhaps the youngest ever Columbo villains. After watching a lot of episodes where Columbo and his adversary behave like close friends, it's good to see the episode where the mood and bad feelings on the surface float. It just gives the episode a bit more drama and bite. Columbo is fast on the fact that two students who claim to help him are not secretly laughing at him and feeding him false traces. He happily plays and deliberately moves in front of them to underestimate him! Of course he knows when he talks about a balloon. The murder itself is another complicated, in line with the Bye Bye Sky High IQ episode, with a sophisticated chain reaction of events that will kill the intended target while giving the murderers a seemingly waterproof alibi. In recent years between 1978 and 1990, this technology has moved from record players and flip flops to remote control locking systems and hidden cameras. Stephen Caffrey has performed great performance as Justin Rowe. , corrupt student. Gary Hershberger is weak but good as his friend "yes-man" Cooper Redman. And it's nice to see Robert Culp as Mr. Rowe, Justin's father. Very satisfactory episode in all directions.
