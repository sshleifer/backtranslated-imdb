Finally, I managed to see this movie ... after so many years of expectation ... <br /> <br /> I was so curious whether this movie is as bad as some people say .. <br /> <br / And my opinion is that this movie wasn't bad at all, it was amazing ... <br /> <br /> I enjoyed every second of it ... from start to finish ... <br / The actors were great to send me the feeling that I lived the story at the same time the movie was playing ... <br /> <br /> The landscapes were so beautiful was the movie that was shot ... I was fascinated by it. Also, the music was extraordinary and I have nothing to blame. <br /> <br /> I think the plot was very original, I don't think I saw a movie like this ... <br /> <br /> It's a pity it's not recognized around the world .. bad for those who didn't do it t get a chance to see it. I give this movie 10/10
