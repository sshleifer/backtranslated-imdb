This is easily the best of summer movie camps. In fact, few of them are even righteous, let alone anywhere near as entertaining as this. The movie is just about having some good, clean, and fun fun. Many people who went to summer camp as children will see that they are faithfully presented here, as it usually was, but with a comedy comedy. Bill Murray, as Chief Camp Advisor, Tripper, leads a great set of cast, and is usually in the center of the riots. Tripper has great players around the world who usually broadcast their jokes as pseudo-announcements through the public camp system. Several great support actors have played campers and advisors to build a myriad of fun and exciting subplots. , all the time he sprinkled many of the hi-jinx incidents. Spaz (Jack Blum) and Fink (Keith Knight) were very well done. The adventure (and misfortune) of these two is cheerful. Each of them has classic lines and are characters that you like and root. Check out Spaz in the disco dance pandemonium scene. The girls in the story are also realistic characters. They are not stupid, naive, frightening, excessive, nervous, nor any of the other overused stereotypes of nasty teenagers. Kristine DeBell, Kate Lynch, Cindy Girling and others make these characters believable. The required chips are plentiful, usually at the expense of Camp Morty's director (Harvey Atkin). The nature of these jokes begins with resistance and progress. However, with all that is happening, Tripper and others have their serious side. For example, Tripper befriends a shy, lonely guy, Rudy (Chris Makepeace), and takes him under his wing. The story culminates in a sporting competition against an opposing camp. It's a great "root for the finals". When the chips are down, Tripper's motivational "It's just fine" is inspired and it's one of the best moments in the movie. And get ready to root: "Spaz. Spaz! Spaz !!!" "
