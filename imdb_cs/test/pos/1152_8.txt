Now, lissen guys, I loved this movie, though not as much as FAREWELL to the King, another beloved epic by John Milius. It was fun, much more than if it was based on the Tennessee Williams drama. It's a great yarn, with a breath of political correctness. I love this film for its beautiful photo, humor and its softened criticism of Bad Guys and REAL Bad Guys, the spear-bearers of the "civilized" world with their repeated rifles, artillery, and large gunboats. there in the harbor. The extraordinary scene is a Berber camp with blue-gray smoke from cooking fires that rise to the cool desert air. It's visually eloquent, highly evocative. In 1904, in Morocco, WIND is equipped with a helpless American woman (Candace Bergen), who is captured by a disturbing, though not fashionable, Berber bandit (Sean Connery-the very Great Muslim Nomad). The exciting story is based on several historical facts. The photo is beautiful Milius, punctuated by Jerry Goldsmith's excellent score. Mrs. Pedicaris and Raisuli's behavior stretched the foreplay and bounced into the desert among the oases. Although Raisuli proudly traces his lineage back to apes, he is a perfect gentleman - he even leaves her head when he beats him to chess! Naval troops attack Bashaw's palace and fire fires of competitive hegemony with gasoline. Don't be shy with the choir, Abdul. There are many fun stereotypes: <br /> <br /> Contemptive Sultan - reminds of a scattered ferret. It's definitely not a liberal. Cruel German Officer - Big, crazy dachshund sporting a monocle. He gallantly decides to fight Raisuli with swords instead of shooting him under the way of Indiana Jones. Noblesse commit, using Von Clausewitz? Dashing Marine Officer - Kicks crap out of Bashaw Tangier Army and storms his palace while chewing tobacco. His speech is slightly aphasic. Bashaw begged him not to breathe on him. Berber - a horde of burrowing sibilants led by a charming megalomaniac. None of them buys, except perhaps camel urine. President Teddy Roosevelt is uninitiated as helpless and impressed with weapons, toys and grizzly bears. Beautiful American Widow - Gives people a lesson of courage as well as her two kids. Apparently she has a huge supply of clean, stiff clothes and rarely has her hair in place. Raisuli sends Teddy Roosevelt a message and thanked him for the gift of a repetitive Remington rifle claiming: <br /> <br /> "MEESTER ROOSEVELT. WIN." <br /> <br /> How true. Please don't take my acerbic notes to say I don't like the movie. I had almost as much fun writing as da Pitcher's observation.
