Hookers was for me a great story of everyday people, like someone you knew. Just trying, my big shot is just around the corner. Then a small temptation of life, a spoiler, slipped again. How much, your love can take and give a guy who's really not so bad a man. I liked it, I was also paid extra in the movie. He played drums at the bar shots, with the band, made several walking shots, my green 66 'corvette was at the motel party shots. Wonderful cast and crew, first-class people, except for the Earth film. I had lunch with James Coburn, for Mother's Day, what a wonderful man I would never forget him, just as I had known him for years. My father spent a day with Slim Pickens and exchanged horse stories, Slim was really down on the ground, I love those guys, we really miss him. Real people make real people movies, thanks to Levy, Gardner and Laven.
