Two sisters, Su-mi-jung and Su-yeon, return home with their father (Kim Gap-soo). Eun-joo (YEOM Jeong-ah) welcomes them, but Su-mi is bitter for her. Su-mi hates Eun-joo because her father let her act as the wife of the house after her sister's mother died. Eun-joo looks at her stance and treats the sisters coolly, and a tense atmosphere grows between them. As in the atmosphere, a number of mysterious things appear in the house. When Su-mi hangs up her dress in the closet, a lot of dresses of the same design have been hung up. When she put the diary in a drawer, she finds another diary of the same kind. As she sleeps in her bed with the frightened Su-yeon, her nightmare awakens and she finds a woman standing on her - and a woman's hand is hanging from her skirt! Mysterious things happen to other people. The next weekend's Eun-Joo's brother and his wife are visiting family and having dinner together. Eun-joo talks cheerfully about the crazy man she met when she was a child, but no one is interested in her. He says a fool has poisoned his brother, but says he doesn't know anything about a man. Listening to their speech, brother's wife is panic. After dinner, the conflict between Eun-yo and the sisters becomes the worst. Eun-joo pulls Su-yeon into the closet and locks it. Su-mi saves the crying sister and complains to her father about what Eun-joo has done to his daughter. But his answer is unexpected. "Give me a break." He says he's angry: "Su-mi, please. Don't make me tired anymore." The following words from my father's mouth are shocking than what they saw in the house. To tell you the truth, I hate horror movies. Although I was alone in the theater because intuition told me that the film was something else, I regretted what this curiosity made me when it began to show. But this regret turned into a joy of expectation ten minutes later. This film is a tragic mystery more than horror - more painful than terrible; beautiful more than sensational. It can have a disappointed hard-core horror fan, but for a fan of secrets like me, this movie needs to be seen. (9 of 10)
