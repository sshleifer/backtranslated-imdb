A very humorous look at some contemporary Australian events and political events. The Chaser boys really enjoy this show and what I enjoy is that they all have their strengths; some of them are brilliant (Chas) when they do all the idiots themselves, while Julian can tear off "I'm talking to a well-known politician and I'm going to suggest he's disguised as a pot of humor". Br /> <br /> They have great segments on the show, where they take mick from all sorts of aspects of Australian culture, such as our current shows, our commercials and TV shows for morning morning wounds. Some material is a bit tired and predictable, but overall it's a lot of fun to watch and leave you with a smile on your face.
