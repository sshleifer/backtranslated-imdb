It is a spoof, its intelligent comedy, has some pathetic action and choreography (and thinks it is intentional), good humble songs, good performances of the entire cast, brilliant from Amir, Salman and Pares, and across the script that is so rare in an Indian cinema that too much in comedy (watch David Dhawan, Harmesh Malhotra etc.). The story is two garbage, whose sole purpose is to get rich and make it famous in any way. He comes across one such path when he finds that India is coming up with a rich NRI to get married. The rest of the story is about one piece, and how these wastes try to joke with each other. The entire cast is perfectly filled from Deven Verma to Viju Khote. The songs are correctly placed and are funny. The surprise package is Salman, who deals with perfect timing and this particular act gave him his comedy style. <br /> <br /> All the fumo movies you shouldn't ignore if you like and watch an Indian movie.
