People have to learn to watch what's on the screen. It is a great movie that is based on the slow, careful collection of details used to create the personalities of these two men. Yusufa's passivity (Emin Toprak), cousin, is well described by his fear of talking to women. He has at least three chances to start a conversation with a young woman and loses everyone. He has many decades of bachelor work ahead and perhaps unemployment. Mahmut is another case. He stepped out of a small town by working very hard (imagining), and his hatred of delicacies like Yusuf is palpable (leaving crumbs on the expensive rug!). We see a group of friends talking about Tarkovsky, among others, and note that Mahmut feels regret - but only a slight regret - that his work has become commercial over the years. The gap between cousins ​​becomes wider and wider. The theme of the mousetrap is wonderfully vibrant, bringing Yusuf's compassion and confusion and the cold-blooded solution to Mahmut's problems. I have been alerted to two classic movies of men who ride each other: The Forest Cousins ​​Chabrol (a rich boy with Hitler's assumptions played by Brialy is always in my mind) and Kiss of Spider Woman figure out why this is so everyone). Nuri Bilge Ceylan occupies a place among dozens of prominent directors who are now active. I just hope that in the future she will rely on co-workers, instead of directing, writing and filming her films alone.
