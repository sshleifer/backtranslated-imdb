If you know anything about the Manhattan Project, you'll find "Fat Man and Little Boy" at least an interesting view of the events surrounding this story. The film is a very realistic representation of these events in all respects, and in many ways it is almost too real (for example, some scenes involving radiation poisoning). Paul Newman, as usual, is brilliant in his role and always manages to leave as a real person on the screen. Supporting casts like John Cusack, Laura Dern, Bonnie Bedelia and Natasha Richardson are also pretty good. But this film is not one of the best examples of transforming a true story into a film. Big movies are able to take a true story and use just enough artistic licenses to keep their audience throughout the film. This, however, tends to stretch a little throughout, and some scenes (such as John Cusack and Natasha Richardson's love story) could have been removed entirely without causing the film to lose much. However, there are a lot of interesting facts and little witty pieces that make the audience at least interested in seeing the whole movie. It is not always fun, but in terms of large images, it is very accurate, fascinating and leaves the audience to think. <br /> <br /> *** off ****
