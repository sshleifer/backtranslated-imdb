I recently saw it on TCM, and thanks to IMDb I found out that there are seven "Crime Doctor" movies with Warner Baxter as a psychiatrist detective. Baxter is a little longer in the tooth compared to his solid performance on 42nd Street ten years ago. It's not a noir and today it's a bit fragile, the film also has a touch of possible supernatural. The storyline, black and white cinematography and characters are much more complex than the series. Moto and Charlie Chan. There are subplots, unexpected twists, and appearances by the number of B movie stalwartly we all should recognize immediately (neither ever made it to state A). It's a pretty unpredictable 70 minutes. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see a boxed DVD of these movies.
