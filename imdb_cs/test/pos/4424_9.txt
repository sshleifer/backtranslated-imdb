I've been a fan of Rachael's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network, so I've seen her grow over the years. The moment I saw her communicating with Oprah, I predicted that this exhibition would happen because I saw how Oprah was with her, and with good reason: she found herself very natural and willing to laugh at herself yourself, which is very engaging. The file is appealing and there are new ideas (I love lazy Susan, to whom the audience will settle). There is just enough celebrity segment, and she remains far from discussing and debating (there's enough on daytime television). The show is a hilarious escape and she hasn't moved from her strength (cooking), which is a very good planning. I know there are people who hate her and hate her show; It's okay, you can't please everyone. And somehow I think Rachael knows and accepts it. So just turn the channel; I don't think she has that in mind.
