These movies made me suffer and I LOVED IT! MILOVAL TO! He was chasing me for days. I think Erika is a kind of character you hate and lament at the same time. The most horrible sex scene he ever captured on film. That's the best of Haneke's work. He is the only live director to redefine the pace from Kubrick. The violence in this film is wonderful. One word is a suicide movie. In the sentence, there is a film about trying to find love, to stop hating it and discover that it is hopeless hope.
