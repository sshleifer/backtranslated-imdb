The movie is really about elections. In the oppressed state, as seen in Fire, where good women had to be obedient and did what was right in the eyes of tradition, Radha and Sita seemed to have few options. However, it was not their only option. What Is Life Without Desire, Radha Questions Ashok. Yes, it is true that life gives us a number of options, but how many we can accept depends on a number of external factors. When your world is confined to a small Indian household, it is an obedient innocent father-in-law to a quiet but attentive, still powerful matriarch, a 13-year-old wife who is an obedient wife to a man who promised celibacy because of his inability to have a child, a man who wants you He lay beside him to prove his strength in removing his desires. I felt that the ladies had no choice but to seek comfort in their company. I think the fact that so many women applauded Mrs. Mehta's work was because she gave them the opportunity to think of herself. Possibility to do what may have been unacceptable. The lesbian scenes I thought were mere putting this point across. Every scene in the film from the first to the Taj Mahal to the last in the mosque is engraved in my mind. How frustrating it is to be a prisoner of your feelings and desires. Feel that you had to leave the human touch to be a conscientious wife just because it is expected of you. They must suppress any desire you can have and desire human contact. So what is the purpose of our existence is wonder. In the scene where Sita cries herself in the room and Radha comes to comfort her, her lips rubbed at herself and awakened in them. Something they both got rid of. Bravo Mrs. Mehta translates her vision so clearly. I especially like the memories of a young Radha trying to "see" the ocean. It is a metaphor of freedom. Freedom of choice, freedom of transport to places where we would not normally be able to reach. In these scenes, we are gently told that her sense of duty was also passed on to her mother, who I suppose she lives in rich Indian traditions of duty in marriage. The film is beautifully filmed and enriched by the musical score of A.R. Rahmane. I became an enthusiastic fan of the two main actresses and the director. I look forward to the next production of Mrs. Deep.
