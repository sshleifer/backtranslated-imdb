Contains "SPOILER" information. Watch this director's next film, "Earth," at some point. It's a better movie, but this is not just wrong. A rare feminist view from an Indian filmmaker. Tradition, rituals, duty, secrets, and the depiction of strict sexual roles make this engaging and culturally dynamic film viewing experience. All marital characters lack the "fire" of a double bed with their members. One husband is celibate and commits a form of spiritual "adultery" by giving all his love, honor, time and respect to his religious worship (guru). His wife is lonely and longing for intimacy and tenderness, which she finally finds with her step-sister sister who comes to live in her home with her unfaithful husband. This unfaithful husband is openly in love with his Chinese mistress, but has been forced into marriage with a (unknowable) lesbian. They only have sex once when his lesbian wardrobe loses her virginity. The servant lives in the house and he finally reveals the secret that both women are lovers. Another important figure is an older matriarch who is unable to speak or take care of himself because of a stroke. However, she uses the ringing bell to communicate her needs as well as her dissatisfaction with her family members. She allows them to know through her bell or pound fist that she knows what's going on in the house and how much she disagrees. Finally, the truth about everyone comes out and two women lovers end up running together. But not before there is an emotional scene between a sanctuary husband and his formerly straight woman. Her sari catches in the fire and initially we think she will die. However, we see that two women have joined in the last scene of the film. The writer / director of this film challenges the traditions of his culture, but shows us the individual human beings who are trapped in their culture. and sex. We really care about characters and we don't see them as stereotypes. Each of us surprises us with its humanity, vulgarity, tenderness, anger and spirit.
