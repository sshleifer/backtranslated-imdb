"Americans Next Top Model" is the best reality show! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time when I watched it. I kept my eyes open all the time. (well, I'm winking) This may be a sad, funny or addictive (mostly addictive) "America's next Top Model" didn't want me any more and that's pretty much a point. It is also more than one channel. Sometimes it's MTV sometimes. I hope to get more fans and become a hit series! It's great for all ages, so everyone can enjoy it! :) <br /> <br /> If you looked at the show earlier, didn't you notice that Tyra always had a different hair style? The week will be short and curly, and then long and straight next.
