I saw the movie for the first time at night. I've been thinking about it all night and this morning. I can't say it was my favorite movie, at least not yet. I have to see it again. <br /> <br /> The camera is stunning. Every shot has a lyric that could be expected in a movie that has Wim Wenders' name attached to it. It is always tempting to see de Chirico in any image of order orders that disappear in the gloom, but in this case the analogy fits. The figure of Malkovich, who passed through the fog and wind of Ferarra, in many respects reflects the shadow of the statue outside the canvas that haunts Milan in the main works of Italo-Greek painter. It is a mildly horrifying presence to watch and act as a film director for the whole story. Wenders fans who are devotees cannot help but think about a little Damiel and Cassiel, who are wandering through the streets of Berlin and watching everyone but not directly interacting with the people. And according to the metaphor Himmel Uber Berlin, the angel (or in this case director Malkovich) gets in touch with one of the stories. At this point, I have to give up this criticism too far. I have to see the film again. I'm pretty sure this is a theme that connects Malkovich's monologue together. Perhaps his thoughts and pontifications are a pretentious, empty dialogue that sounds good, but cannot be analyzed into real communication. Maybe that's the whole point. No one can make this judgment with any degree of certainty or authority until they do their homework. We have to be careful when throwing the word "pretentious". It is easy to write off anything that inhales the intellect as a preload, but it leads to a frightening mental state in which a single conversation, considered true, earthly or authentic, is the most banal. By avoiding all discussions about philosophy, God, existence, meaning, and everything we have in our brains, we set our culture to die with a slow, stupid and ugly death. Maybe it's a warning Wenders and Antonioni give us. Certainly this is not the only theme of the movie, but I think it cannot be ignored. Another (and most obvious) leitmotif is satisfaction. There is a lot to do and a thorough check of all the subtleties and consequences of developing this leitmotif would exceed the limit of 1000 words for this review. <br /> <br /> My advice is to see the movie. However, I offer a warning: it is not an autonomous film (at least I do not think so far). Some films interact with the intellectual and artistic thinking of their time, so that the viewer must have a background in the Zeitgeist before approaching the film. Par-dela les nuages ​​is one of those films.
