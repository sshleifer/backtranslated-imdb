At the age of 20, Francis Ouimet (Shia Lebouf) as his entire life before him - in a way. The son of an immigrant family living in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the class was a very limiting reality. If a man is born poor, he remains poor; if one is born into a bourgeoisie, he has little opportunity; if one is born into a rich class, he basically produces it in the shade. The British gold champion Harry Vardon and Francis' golf idol (played by criminally underestimated Stephen Dillane) is an exception to this. Born and raised in a poor British family, his perfect golfing skills enabled him to get off the dirty mess of the poorest slums into lush green English country clubs. He has not forgotten this life lesson. Francis wants to follow in Vardon's footsteps and similarly uses his great golfing skills to get to the 1913 US Open at the age of 20. But the hard course and impressive rivals (including Francis Vardon's idol) are not all that Francis has to deal with, a father who is a less understandable and cruel social framework, stands in his way of living his own dream. <br /> <br /> I know what you're thinking about - I thought it too - Walt Disney's 1913 movie The open-tempered Shia LaBeouf has a chance to be fun, but it can't be a great movie. I'm here to encourage you to think again. Despite what the paper may look like, the Biggest Game ever played is one of the best sports movies in creation. <br /> <br /> As with any big sports movie, The Greatest Game Ever Playing contains many exciting sports scenes. but it is not a movie about golf - it is a character-centered film about the use of talent, following your dreams and breaking the class barriers. Where the biggest game has been played, it works great as a themed sports film that works just as well as a contemporary film - a movie show of costumes and sets is the best time to travel. The film also * looks * a great and virtually unknown music composer Brian Tyler has introduced the film into wonderful music. The cast is also great with the gentle but powerful Stephen Dillan, British golf champion Harry Vardon, cheerful Stephen Marcus as male golfer Ted Ray, hammy Josh Flitter as Francis before the caddy teenager Eddie and the surprisingly good Shia LaBeouf. starring Francis. Actor Bill Paxton (Apollo 13, Titanic), who is here for the second time (feature film director) in The Greatest Game Ever Playing. Produces a delicate product - it contains a lot of heart, ingenuity and attention to detail in film making.
