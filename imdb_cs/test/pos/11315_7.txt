Seeing this movie brought me memories of 9/11. The first thing I remembered this morning was to see the television images of a plane flying into a large building, and my immediate thoughts "Must be a preview of Tom Clancy's new film". It wasn't Tom Clancy's movie. That was certainly not the British version of "The Sum Of All Fears". A typical Tom Clancy film or novel has a relatively small cast, linear plot, and usually some sort of solution. He didn't have this film. Sure, what I saw right on the screen was a small cast, conspiracy, and vague solution, but as in September 11, the reality was much bigger and more complex. Work on system planning and the reality of disaster preparation and the disaster itself are painfully obvious. It is impossible to prepare for a disaster like this, nor can it be dealt with when it happens. From the argument between the police (not enough to prepare) and the politicians (to give everyone a gas mask to the trumpet would cause panic), to permanent speaker reports (you are not at risk for your health but not going home before we decontaminate you), and (do not eat, drink, or smoke before we decontaminate you), I was on the edge of the film. Not just the slightest urge to surf the canal. This film was 90 minutes long. It could have been doubled and not all the details were displayed. Instead, it left enough reluctance for each of us to imagine the details, each of us in our own way. That was far more real to me than any Tom Clancy movie. Once I lived in London and just off Edgeware Road. And several times I took a train from Waterloo. When I watched Dirty War, I thought it was just fiction. Now. Allah and Jehovah willing, this film will remain a fiction, and sometimes in 20 or 30 years, my nephews can watch this movie and remember the early 21st century and the panic we felt too much. Hopefully, as much as I feel at the moment, while watching the Cold War memorabilia with the evil communist regime in the mid-20th century, and remember "Drop and cover" exercises at school.
