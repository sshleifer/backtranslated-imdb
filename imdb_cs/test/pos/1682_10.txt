The plot line is exposed under the belly of American politics. While the subject seems normal, what "makes" the film is the unconventional way the story is told. <br /> <br /> Characters are played with conviction. You feel the innocence of leadership and the loss of its innocence. A politician is a dual-speaking prince, a real snake. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera is impressive. This confirms the nuances of acting and dialogue. Ditto for music. The story uses a parable-style with vingettes where the message is full of double participants. Very silly writer / director strategy. Voltage in the event is transferred to the last scenes. The film was like a good mystery book. Something was "walking"; you knew it was bad; you didn't know exactly what it could be - you suspected; and when evil was revealed, you let out a breath that you did not notice that you were holding. Sadly, he shook his head. The story well written and well spoken. 3 on the health of a young writer / director.
