This movie is about Geisha's aging in post-war Tokyo. Okin, played by the incredible Haruko Sugimara, lends money to two more ex Geisha, Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Otomi (Yuko Mochizuki) and hates how somewhat smug. Tamae has a son, Otomi's daughter, who during the film announces that she is leaving, while Okin, never a mother, gets visits to two men in her past, who, as it turns out, just want money from her. It is a compelling story about what you are doing, what you are doing to get to life and who you are responsible for and responsible for. Haruko Sugimara has always been one of the greatest actresses in every country in my eyes, playing mostly fearless, less than sympathetic Okin with the air of superiority that makes her dislike but at the same time envies her. By the time, among other things, Ozu, Mizoguchi, Kinoshita and Kurosawa had created great films, Mr. Naruse is there with him. If you have a free DVD player, you should try to find two Naruse Box sets released in England. I think this film was a great study of women who are at risk of being irrelevant. That does not really mean that this film is a true masterpiece.
