I liked the movie, but it should have been longer. The actors did a great job. Portia De Rossi is a wonderful actress and Kristoffer Polaha is a hottie. He didn't look 100% like John, but he preferred it from a distance. I look forward to seeing more on the big screen. He didn't have John's charisma, but he definitely had a charm. She has beautiful eyes and a big smile. He reminds me a lot of my friend. Mrs. Bissett was too breathtaking for me. She should have cleared asthma. I'm not going to comment on the character of Darryl Hannah. My mom always said, "If you can't say anything nice, then shut up hell!" so that's what I'm going to do. Molly
