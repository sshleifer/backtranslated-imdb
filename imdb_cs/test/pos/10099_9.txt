Every word of high praise fell short of the height of this film. This film is a real example of how a psychological horror movie should be. At first glance, the conspiracy seems a bit confusing, but it will definitely explain a little about what is happening and you really want to see it a second time. But after the second review, you start joining the pieces together and then you will know how amazing the movie can be. <br /> <br /> Recommendations for slasher flick fans will stay away from this movie. This is not your stupid ass teen movie slasher in which you just turn off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b ** bs and lots of blood. <br /> <br /> If you want to increase the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a large home theater system that supports Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1ch without any of your poorly bred friends who crack jokes on a really tense situation. And don't forget to turn off the light. <br /> <br /> My points to various aspects: - <br /> <br /> Direction = 9/10 playing = 8/10 Atmosphere = 10/10 Sound Effect = 9/10 <br /> <br /> Total = 9/10
