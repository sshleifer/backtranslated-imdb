"Desperadoes" (1943) is a true classic, not for its story (which is quite a routine), but for its technical elements. This was a western landmark, the largest ever at the time of its release, and all more unique because it was the production of a Columbia-light studio with a lower feed reputation. Just Fox's "Jesse James" (also starring Randolph Scott) from a few years earlier gave anywhere near this opulent treatment to the genre. Although it would be overshadowed in a few years by "Seekers" and "High Noon", "Desperadoes" was a ground-breaking breakthrough effort and historical treasure. In 1863, the economy in Red Valley, Utah is based on rounding and selling wild horses to the Union Army. The script was somewhat muddled here with references to railroads (which were in Utah's future for several years) and Custer's last stand (Custer was employed in the fight against Stuart in Pennsylvania at the time), but these are not important elements of the plot. Red Valley has an honorary sheriff, Steve Upton (Scott), but a banker and several citizens are corrupt; to rob your own bank every time the government pays for a herd of horses. The city is visited by Cheyenne Rogers (Glenn Ford), a famous outlaw who is old friend Steve's. He wants to go straight, especially after the stable owner, Alison McLeod (Evelyn Keyes), has fallen on a pretty livery. Cheyenne's partner "Nitro" Rankin (Guinn "Big Boy" Williams) is mainly there for comical relief as being Uncle Willie McLeod (Edgar Buchanan) and City Judge (Raymond Walburn who models his character on Frank Morgan's "Oz Magician" Crystal Ball) cheater). If you take no chance with your huge budget, Columbia packed this thing with a bunch of events and every Western movie element, but Indians and covered cars. There is the best wild horse stampeded ever filmed, magnificent barroom battle, explosive peak, romance, and three-strip Technicolor. All these things do not necessarily come together, but who would care for it in 1943. Unity is a problem because it is trying to be a serious action western and comedy. <br /> <br /> The camera was probably the best at the time of shooting. The inner scenes are solid, but it is a truly impressive naturalistic photo; both lyrical static shots and moving cameras shooting action sequences. Scott and Claire Trevor were best billed, but the studio wanted to promote Ford, which will soon be their biggest star. Director Charles Vidor used the film to showcase his new wife, Keyes (whose portrait of Scarlett's sister in "Gone With the Wind" has teamed up with the audience more than any small part in the film's history). Ford-Keyes Dynamics is a "unique and important feature" of Desperadoes. Rather than going to the "Love Triangle" cliche with Scott and / or Trevor (who first appears), the whole romantic focus is on two younger actors. This was probably the best role Keyes ever got and would get the most out of it. They play a tomboyish but very sexy young woman who looks great in both leather pants and dresses, and who rides and fights like Kier Knightley's character in "Pirates of the Caribbean". This was revolutionary at the time and coincided with the 1942 WAAC formation for WWII military service. "Desperadoes" is one movie that has been taken care of and the print looks brand new. Unfortunately, there are no special features on the DVD. Then again, what do I know? I'm just a child.
