Imagine spending your summer without your family or school friends and meeting new people. Or it's your first time you are nobody and the only person you can rely on is someone from camp. "Meatballs" packs a lot of comedy in this movie. There is an eccentric counselor (Bill Murray) in the camp who knows how boys and girls can enjoy themselves. Enter a boy named Rudy (Chris Makepeace) who has no one to look at him. He doesn't sit with anyone, only Tripper can entertain him. The rest can be as crazy as a Tripper. Camp Northstar is an average camp with an above-average team. On the other hand, the Mohawk camp is an elite camp that leads them for money. In a basketball game, Mohawks got a breath! And in the Olympics, Northstar prayed for the revenge they needed when one of the members closed the saboteur. And Morty (Harvey Atkin), this poor soul can never get into gear if he tried. A very, very fun comedy, and he's a great breeder, I'll say. This movie shows that camp can be fun if you want to be! 5 Stars!
