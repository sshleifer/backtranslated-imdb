If you watched this movie for nudity (like me), you won't be disappointed. I could have done it without having to deal with cheaters. Some bottomless nudity could be shown, but what I thought was H.O.T.S. it must be the best of its genre. It's not the kind of movie that could be made today, which is a shame because it's the kind of movie that's worth watching in these times. br /> <br /> I would like to take mindless nudity through the key points of the plot every day. It is a pity that the DVD has no add-ons but because they don't have a DVD when it was filmed, which is understandable. I would like to learn more about making a movie, especially where they shot a football match at the end.
