I saw this film at Galway Fleadh in the year he won the best short film. I have to say that I thought the direction was fantastic and the performances of the key members were very memorable. The two main actors are certainly the names to watch out for. The last shot over the cliff was fascinating, and I'd like to find it if I waited for the end of the world. become. The kiss was definitely a great profit, done with great enthusiasm! I can only assume that the film was shot on film, and I heard that DOP won a prize at the Tribeca Film Festival for his work on this film and I must say ... well deserved. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who was a teenager in the 1980s. It brought some great memories and some terrifying memories.
