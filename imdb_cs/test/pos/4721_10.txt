This film should be seen by as many people as possible because it focuses on human rights issues in Burma. When I watched this film for the first time in the mid-1990s, it changed my life. I knew very little about Aung San Suu Kyi or her democratic movement. That affected me, so I wanted to understand the situation better. Every movie that has the power to learn more has done its job correctly. Patricia Arquette is great as an American lady who, because of her personal tragedy, has become reckless with her own life choices and is in a subsequent conflict. It's a powerful movie about an item that deserves more publicity. As the film itself says that the 1988 activists' massacre was not broadcast on television, it has so far been largely unnoticed. I urge anyone who reads these comments to learn more about the current situation of Burmese people. It's time for this movie to be on DVD. Can anything be done?
