That was a really amazing adaptation. I missed the first episode, so unfortunately I missed the connection between the characters and the smooth progress of the story. But as soon as I watched the second and then the third installment, I was just blown away. I ordered a DVD less than a week later and I couldn't wait to come, I went straight out and brought the book. I was addicted since I opened it, I just couldn't put it off. I decided to finish the whole book before I dare watch the DVD at all. I preferred the book because it got into the mind of the characters, you could understand where it came from and what the role in the story is. They missed much of the adaptation, which was disappointing because the book is a masterpiece and I think they could do it great if they could stretch it for a long time. But since it is possible that it can be placed in 3-hour traffic, I think it was excellent. Brilliantly followed the main twisted story. And actors who have been recorded as the main characters where they are amazing! The loving scene was purely beautiful. It was so tender and loving, and just showed how natural homosexual love could be. I was totally blown away with both the book and the TV adaptation! I loved both Sarah Waters previous novels and also found Tipping the Velvet adaptation quite enjoyable. But when I read and watched Fingersmith, I knew none of her previous novels / adaptations could beat it. This time Sarah Waters really got over it! I recommend that you follow this adaptation! If Tipping the Velvet wasn't your thing, then don't let it take you away. Fingersmith is a whole new ball game. It is a beautiful but dark twisted story about love, greed and betrayal ... <br /> <br /> CAN SEE!
