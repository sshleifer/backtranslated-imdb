"River's Edge" was one of the most disturbing movies of 1986 and the year, which also saw "Blue Velvet", you know it says something. Looking at today, she has lost little strength and remains much better than the overrated "Children". Previews for "kids" played as a demonstration of the nation's youth deterioration. In fact, it was a little more than an exploitation film based largely on shock value. "River's Edge" was promoted as a teen of exploitation, but was actually much better. The only time since they were disturbing and disgusting is the constant image of a dead naked body. Besides, the film is provocative and quite realistic for all its minor flaws. Keanu Reeves, known for being a particularly wooden performer, gives his best performance as a burnt-out teenager. Ione Skye is as sympathetic and likable. Dennis Hopper (on this trail called "Blue Velvet" and "Hoosiers") gives great performance as a fearsome but pathetic generation of hippie that remains. Crispin Glover, although always looking fun, seems a little uncomfortable as a manic stoner and group leader. The best performance, however, is definitely Daniel Roebuck. As the killer John, Roebuck is scaryly emotional. It is a pity that actor than Reeves did not become a bigger star like hes. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is fantastic and bold. Don't be mistaken for another lame John Hughes clich√©d high school movie like "The Club". This is a shocking nihilism that resonates with the viewer. Fans of this film are advised to try out the 1981 Canadian film "Out of the Blue," directed by Dennis Hopper. His next shocking gloomy exploration of the gap in the generation and despite his confusion could have affected River's Edge. (7/10)
