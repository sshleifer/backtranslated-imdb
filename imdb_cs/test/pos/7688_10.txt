"Porgy & Bess" was the very first movie my parents ever saw me. Even at the tender age of 5, I was so dramatically hit by the drama that I screamed loudly on the screen "Crown, please don't take Bess!" I was fortunate enough to have seen a single "Porgy & Bess" TV show so many years ago, and now I only have the great memories (and the album) to remember this wonderful, amazing movie. I wait and wish and hope that one day I will own a copy of "Porgy & Bess" - but it does not seem to happen. What does it mean? Obviously, there is enough public interest in the release. After all these years I remember it and it certainly looks like I'm not alone. This film is full of human emotions - jealousy, lust, anger, bravery, determination. "Porgy & Bess" is a buried gem that deserves to be brought out into the light for a new audience to admire and enjoy the old audience.
