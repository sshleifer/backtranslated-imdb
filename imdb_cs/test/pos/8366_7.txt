Shuai is a young and unhappy young Beijinger with a punkish haircut, who ekes out living to sell cheap books from a stall in the internal market. He does not seem to have anything to do with wire, middle-aged, intellectual, shrewd intellectual, Zhang - and yet the two end up in a restaurant together to discuss what's for murder (a Chinese title might be better translated as' Talk It Over '). If it makes it a sound kind of pedestrian, not being misled: this film is richly resourceful in its plot, and mostly races along at the thief's speed (though the tempo makes the flag quite wrong to end). If you only know the historical dramas of Zhang Yimou, such as the Raise Red Lantern and the Shanghai Triad, or his more recent martial arts epic, Hero and House Of Flying Daggers, you'll be amazed; In fact, no matter which of his other films you have seen, you will be surprised, pleasantly surprised - this is by far his most original, most unpredictable, most experimental work. It was shot within a few weeks on a minimal budget, almost entirely on location in Beijing (and using many common Beijingers in smaller supporting roles - there is even an ephemeral portrait of the director himself), and mostly with a hand-held camera, in jerky, hyper- a kinetic style that is a million miles from the elegant formalism of its most famous films. OK, I live in Beijing, so I found another joy in all the bizarre details of everyday life that I recognize and enjoy (although it was shot in 97 and things change so fast) but I really think this movie can be appreciated. I saw how I had so many other Chinese "comedies" in a film club that screened the cover versions of recent Chinese films for an almost exclusively expatriate audience; and it's the only one I can remember where the audience laughed out loud. Some non-Chinese viewers might consider it somewhat strange, sometimes a bit uncomfortable because it involves some violence, and after opening it as a fresh, romantic comedy, it mutates into something darker in its second half. But it is very, very funny. It's also brilliantly acted by two leaders, especially longtime Zhang Yimou associate Jiang Wen, who is probably mainland China's main movie star, and has a tense presence on the screen reminiscent of young Depardieu or De Nira. Watch this movie - for proof that the Chinese have a sense of humor that can translate into other cultures, for proof that Zhang Yimou is far, far more than a one-pony pike. .. and for a very good time.
