I blame myself for the "birth of a nation" - for starting a long tradition of Hollywood history, of which there may be a few examples. In addition to getting the name of Custer and his 7th Cavalry, Crazy Horse and Sioux and President Grant say geography correctly, and the fact that Custer and his men were really exterminated by men, the rest simply takes the hyperbola and invention to ridiculous limits. Throw in some downright hackneyed scenes from the purest exposition, (try Custer and his wife learning about the fake "Gold Rush" to excuse the invasion of Sioux territory, Custer testimony before Congress begging the Red Indians' rights and to start all this, Custer burst into the President's office to begging him to return to his post), honestly, there are a lot of the same, some of these scenes are almost comical in their grumpy ... ... and yet he's still a great action player with Flynn, as always, DeHavilland As charming as ever, young Anthony Quinn started as Crazy Horse and director Walsh as a barnstorming as always in his portrayal of crowd scenes and of course stormy action sequences. Ford taught us in "Liberty Valance" to believe the legend before the truth. Here I think we're closer to legend legend, but hey, it's just a movie and a flashing, beautifully entertaining classic Hollywood movie!
