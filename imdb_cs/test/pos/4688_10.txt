Hi, I have to say you have some bad information about the show. The main author was Richard Carpenter, created the series. Later there were some other authors but they only made a few episodes. The first director who did most of the series (I think the complete series 1) was Ian Sharp, who created the distinctive look of Robin of Sherwood. Clannad actually saw some material and read the pieces. I know that for sure, because Richard Carpenter said it to Con in England last year. I think it's a TV-Entertainment masterpiece because it has great characters and casts, good costumes and great story lines. For me, still one of the best TV series ever!
