I have to say that this film is absolutely amazing. I don't understand why he has such a low rating. He has romance, music, darkness and vampires. Also, Stuart Townsend did a great job of being Lestat, acting was great. Also, usually I'm not in the music, sometimes well. But I have to say that the music fits perfectly in this film. If you like dark movies about vampires this is definitely for you or even if you don't have there is a love story to this. My rating is defiant: 10 out of 10. Anyway, I strongly recommend that you watch it. I remember not seeing it for years, watching it again about a year ago, and being dependent on it again. lol. Great movie!!!
