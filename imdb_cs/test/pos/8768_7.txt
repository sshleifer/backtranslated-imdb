Excellent thriller Hitchcock with Robert Cummings, who again proves he could really attack the storm. This time it's a defensive worker who was caught in a terrifying plot when his best friend is killed in a race. Priscilla Lane is a girl who is suddenly interested in Cummings, how the story is condensed and he's being chased from California to New York. to destroy from within. Hitchcock was known to play in his long career as a director in the upper class of chaos. Ironically, the film at the very end implodes. While we see what happens to the guy who killed Cummings' friend, we don't see what happens to the rest of the gang, again, many of whom represent the top crust of society.
