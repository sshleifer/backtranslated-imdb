No doubt it's a big mom of all music videos !!! Unlike most music videos that are either "dance videos" of badly stored and / or badly interrupted lyrics, it was right. Jackson was a co-writer and proof of VH1 strongly choreographed and directed this masterpiece. In fact, you could say that Thriller is more horrifying than most horror movies with the last second sparkling eye. For me, this music video is what you judge all other music videos. You can easily see the sinister influence that M. J. had on the morning dance with the zombie march number. Because of dancing, comedy, story and yes horror. I give him 5 out of 5.
