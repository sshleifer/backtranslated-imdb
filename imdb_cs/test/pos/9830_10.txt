Random Hearts is a very well directed, well written and perfectly cast actor for the primary role. I found it so intense that you have to stop and wonder in almost every scene Harrison and Kristin are together as their characters deal with this terrible situation they find themselves in. A lot of people that I think didn't appreciate the film for what it was, didn't make sense of the film or could understand the situation like theirs. <br /> <br /> You haven't seen the movie yet <br /> <br /> I loved the end, which was a big surprise that tied the whole movie. They were relieved to see how these two good people could eventually come out happier. <br /> <br />
