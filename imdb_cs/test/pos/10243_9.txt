The Milkwoman story is a simple, unrequited love that remains strong for decades. Now 50 years, Minako Obha (Yuko Tanaka) lives alone and works two jobs? One as a cashier clerk in the supermarket, the other as a militia, doing her daily round on the hills of Nagasaki. One of her stops is at the house of Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), a government official who tends to his terminally ill wife Yoko (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita saw themselves as school children, but after Minak's mother and Kait's father, who seem to have a common relationship, their own relationship was destroyed. Lying in her sick bed, Yoko knows that her husband's feelings for the militia are not completely gone, and because of Kaita, after she has died, she is trying to engineering how to unite them. While the story can be simple, the emotions it deals with and the means by which it expresses them are truly the place where the heart and beauty of the film lies. The film takes its time to show the simple daily routines of each character, their actions being recorded by an old lady who writes her story for a book while caring for her own husband who shows signs of dementia. In this process, she captures the social conditions of people from different ways of life, interacting with each other on a daily basis, how relationships are formed and how past and present can collide. The director handles this with a strong structure and visual style. It is only later in the film, which the story begins to follow a more conventional and inevitably melodramatic path, as if it is really being constructed to match the narrative structure of the book it is written. All this is confirmed by the emotional depths of the film's feelings, which are most prominent in the exceptional performance of Yuko Tanaka.
