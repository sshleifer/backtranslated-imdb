First, let's know that I came to this film not for music; in fact, I find it disgusting. I was really interested in the psychology of punk subculture. At this point, the document has proved very well. One unpleasant aspect was the numerous scenes in which the songs are played and the hyped-up band and the aggressive crowd are shown to run amok. If you saw the first such scene, you saw them all. This redundancy is a party created to print lyrics for some songs. With these, viewers are able to somewhat connect mentally with the band. The lyrics are much more interested than mixing the sounds coming out of the speakers. I don't know why all the texts were not printed. Scenes without texts slow (ironic eh dan√Ω, given many references to the speed of music) film flow. Also bright was an interview with fans and bands, although there is a delay when the second band's interviews prove to be not as fascinating or humorous as the first two. Overall, a good movie that I'm glad I saw. I'll take a look at the follow-up if I have a chance. Favorite Quote: He tried to hide the fact that he couldn't play by rubbing peanut butter and breaking glass. Wide Punk Generalization: Although their shamefulness, lack of vocabulary and hygiene, and drug-induced ignorance are often cheerful, punk is believed to be just pathetic juveniles who only revolted because of interest. rebellion as seen through sophomoric words and naive attempts to philosophize and politicize (regardless of black flag, who are slightly less misleading than their peers).
