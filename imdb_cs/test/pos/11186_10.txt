"Curse of the Monkey Island" is a treasure; In my opinion, the series as a whole was a holy grail of adventure games, not to mention LucasArts. But to return to "Curse", which is beautiful on CMI, it is that they are not afraid to be themselves. This differs from the first two, but Ron Gilbert remains faithful to the staging (if only the same could be said for the fourth installment of the series!). The voice work is perfect, with Dominic Arma, who plays our favorite hero Guybrush Threepwood. The animation, although quite different from classic pixeled characters, is done beautifully. It's really absolutely amazing. And the music is fantastic! Its never annoying and you never have the urge to turn it off. Although I am not a big fan of romance, romantic scenes and motifs are not very strong at all. They also have the rare ability to leave as a sweet cheesy place. It says a lot from a girl who normally falls asleep during the offspring. Then, of course, humor is a classic element of humor. CMI is fully versed in providing templar lines, totally absurd humors and simply good fun. Gary Coleman makes a portrait as a young entrepreneur, and events in the world are discreetly jerked out of the game. It is not entirely fair to compare CMI with MI and MI2 because it really is in its own sphere. Personally, I can never find a favorite between 3 because they are all quite different from each other. However, if you want a good time with the taste of the classic series, I insist on granting this game. You won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars, hands down. Emily N
