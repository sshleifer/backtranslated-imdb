The All-Monster gathering in the final film in Universal is a renowned cycle of classic horror stories. Earl Dracula (intense, dapper John Carradine), calling himself Baron Latos, comes to Dr. Edelmann (Onslow Stevens) asks to be cured of his tribulation. This is naturally just a ruse. Coincidentally, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney), aka "The Wolf Man," appears to be cured. <br /> <br /> As others have noticed, monsters do not get the same screen time. Frankenstein Monster (Glenn Strange) gets to the end just to include all Universal Monsters. Similarly, footage and music of the library are used here. The film spends perhaps a little too much time with Dracula part of the story, though Carradine gives an impressive, non-hammy performance in the role of Count. Above all, the film is a show for Stevens, who goes through the tragic character of his own arc and has a great job. Women are wonderful and I have to say that I loved Jane Adams as a light nurse - which happens to be great. Of course it wouldn't be complete without the angry villagers. <br /> <br /> A competent, professionally manufactured cooler is, just for my taste, really scary at all, but fun no matter what. Overall, it's a serious show. <br/> 7/10
