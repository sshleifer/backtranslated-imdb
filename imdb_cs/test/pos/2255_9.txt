This film reminds me of "Eternal Sunshine of the Immaculate Mind" and "Garden State" not because of the content, but because it's one of those movies you don't just hear from the mouth, or are you reading the back of the DVD in the video store and thinking "why No". Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised (as well as the movies above) on how well it was and how much I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Best vision with little film knowledge and only intrigues that lead you to watch it. Also best seen with someone else or if you know someone else who saw it - you'll want to talk about it !! It's a beautiful movie that will stay with you after watching. It is also a smart watch that requires little effort to be able to find parts for yourself. <br /> <br /> Enjoy :)
