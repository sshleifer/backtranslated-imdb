Chuck Jones 'Beep Beep' (the so-called "Road Runner clearly says" Meep Meep ") is the second of the extremely popular Road Runner series and is a tremendous improvement to his predecessor, a historically important but indispensable 'Fast and Furry-ous'. While it has several predictable fast gags, 'Beep Beep' also extends this initial cartoon with more ambitious, longer sequences. The main one is a fantastic, widespread chase over an old mine, in which we see Coyote and Road Runner represented by two small lights. There is also a very funny longer gag involving some rocket-powered roller skates. 'Beep Beep' also sees a great improvement in the representation of Wile E. Coyote. Not only does it look "nicer" than its "prototype" in "Fast and Furry-ous," but it also draws the audience into a cartoon with more views of the camera that indicates the brilliance of its idea or fear of impending. pain. Although it is a bit slow to get around (too many persistent shots hamper the pace in some of the early gags), once the Beep Beep arrives on the mine sequence, it is clear that Jones was getting a real job on this site. characters and greater possibilities of what he could do with them. There are better Road Runner cartoons than 'Beep Beep', but there's a real sense of triumph on this cartoon as if it were a confirmation that there is a series to be milked from this scenario.
