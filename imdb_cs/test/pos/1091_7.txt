Nana Patekar proves once again that she is undoubtedly the best actor in Mumbai. His recent films have included the shouting of his lines, which do not bode well for the thespian theater. One wonders why the award is not always awarded during the season. "Shakti-The Power" was one of his films, which was a total disappointment with Kohram (missed opportunity to create a screen charm with Amitabh Bachchan). But Patekar radiates cool calm in this film playing a cop on the way to social justice. Standing the streets of Bombay in the underworld dons in mock meetings, the Patekars character takes control of the screen (and the audience's attention) and never releases. Editing is a tight pace and there are no annoying songs that would distract from the story. <br /> <br /> In the same lines as the modern cult classic "Company", the film has acted well, directed and should have a long life on DVD. The last ten minutes Nana and the main villain are talking to in their offshore refuge are bound to be part of the classic Hindi movies. They won't be disappointed with this cop and robbers.
