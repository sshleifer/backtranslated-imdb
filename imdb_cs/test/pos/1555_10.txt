Excellent storyline, wonderful acting performance, amazing production values ​​and cool, action-packed short with perfect turn at the end. What a great short movie! I saw this film in Vail or Aspen at the film festival and I was impressed. Then I saw it again at another festival (where it won again) and I was even more astonished because they had a gentle touch for the second time - a short film that packs up a lot of smart layers in a short time. AWOL is not for heart weakness, but it is very well done and absolutely impressive for short film - for any movie. It is an interesting story that is very well narrated, and each scene moves a story that reveals that good film instincts have entered the film. The movie looks beautiful and David Morse is also stunning, with dynamic performance in every scene. Watching his character trying to beat the life of curveballs is throwing him making a great viewing experience. It should also be noted that when torture wars are everyday headlines, the line between reality, good and evil can be very gray, while rhetoric is loud and tries to make things black and white. AWOL intelligently enables viewers to decide for themselves what they think the message is, what is real and what is not, which adds a mystery. <br /> <br /> I saw it both times, the audience was WAY more into this movie than the others who play with it, which says a lot. There is a lot of shorts out there right now, but few of them will add that versatile perfection and complex theme that AWOL does. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a previous reviewer is out of his rocker or has some personal agenda because it is a really great example of short independent filmmaking. I see a lot of short films and I have to say that if it were ALL shorts made by the festival rounds then the shorts would have some serious legs.
