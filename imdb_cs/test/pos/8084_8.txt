This is a chart driven movie and very fun. Nothing is waiting or opening on the property, but it is moving at a very fast pace, keeping your attention. In fact, I didn't notice what I think is a good thing. John Mills was fine, but everything in his stride seemed to be somewhat considering how his life was falling apart. He would have collapsed on his head, stood 20 seconds later, dusted and continued as if nothing had happened. A minor quarrel in a movie with a strong story, authentic places, and conspiracy that keeps arguing to its conclusion.
