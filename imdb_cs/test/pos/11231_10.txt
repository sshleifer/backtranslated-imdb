The dreamy, stunning atmospheric film takes place in the small town of Northfork in Montana in 1955. Government officials arrive to evacuate the city to be flooded with a new dam. There are other visitors in the city, angels from another time, but only the dying boy Irvin has seen. The boy is taken care of by a local priest (Nick Nolte in a quiet heartbreaking show). Irvin begged with the angels to leave the place with them ... <br /> <br /> There is some supernal quality in the film, some dignified sadness and noble sadness when you suddenly realize the inevitable finality of everything - people and their relationships, cities, earth, civilization, the whole world as we know it. Death and birth have something in common - we go through them in the ultimate loneliness. I can't remember a movie that hit me in the same way and as deep as "Northfork", a film so beautiful and so tender, so quiet and so strong, so heartbreaking and so moving. Even now, after a few weeks since I saw it, I get tears in my eyes when I think about it. <br /> <br /> When I saw it, I had to talk to someone about it. I sent one of my friends and I asked, "Please tell me what I just saw?" And my friend said, "You've just seen one of the greatest films of modern times. One of these days the others will see the light."
