Who should watch this movie? Anyone who has ever taken acid has read Philip K. Dick, thought the Matrix assumption is better than special effects, is interested in philosophy, or likes having a sense of reality with them. In this movie I laughed loudly just because he was so outrageous and so in place. This movie is great. This movie is cool. It's better than the Matrix, for a long shot (I didn't fall asleep in the Country, kick: action and special effects carried me stupidly and, despite the credible philosophical shine, that's what the Matrix is). Existenz is rude, it's disturbing and it's funny. David Cronenberg has done some rush things (Rabid) and some works of genius too too (Videodrome is another worth checking out, as is Stephen King's adaptation of the Dead Zone). But this is one of my favorite favorites. I can't remember the end - which is a good thing because it means I can watch it again. Or maybe he didn't see the movie at all. Maybe it's implanted memory. Or it really happened to me. I don't know. In any case, she is now fluent in my overall illusion of reality and I am glad.
