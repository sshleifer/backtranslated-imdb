After reading the book before watching this adaptation, you would think it would lose some of its excitement. But the story is so clever that I could never get tired of it. Sally and Elaine really put their hearts in their roles and brought so many characters. I fell in love with the story and the women again. <br /> <br /> Beautiful watches with direction, set and costumes. Despite the speed of television, I do not feel that anything important is lost in transport. It was on the edge of my seat where I had a lot of wonderful moments trembling in my stomach. He enjoyed it thoroughly. This is the TV I've been waiting for.
