My teacher did it. It's a new beginning. Watch it and you won't notice it is a Romanian film. The old boring style is gone. Now it's something else. Postrevolutionary film. It uses the latest imaging technology and most unknown artists. They are unique. You will not even know that you are watching, you will simply be transferred off the screen and feel every shot. Don't miss it, pay attention to the plot, but don't ignore the details. Differences between this film and other Romanian films. Sometimes you hear some music. It is a representative part for us, but it does not represent us. Please hold your head straight and leave your body free.
