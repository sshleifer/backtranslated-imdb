Assignment is an excellent thriller with a few twists driven by character, rather than a star turns, you need to make special effects stages, mandatory romance, and endless car chases. But there is a chase car and it's a dandy. Aidan Quinn is amazing because both the terrorist and the naval officer "recruited" to remove him. It is rare that a second or third degree actor, such as Quinn, is given an important lead role as this that carries the film. Usually, such a role is given to the A-list actor with the box, which is probably why I never heard of the movie before I saw it. Donald Sutherland is great as a morally ambiguous, somewhat haunted time, an agent who recruits Quinn. Ben Kingsley is fine as an Israeli agent. The storyline is very complicated and there are several story lines that are gradually coming to an end and not all at once, as we are used to seeing. Paranoia and claustrophobia of these types of thrillers are captured and portrayed by both moral ambiguity and terrible intensity. Places are convincing and effective. The soundtrack is nothing special, but we rarely get all the aforementioned qualities these days, without the stupid and / or insignificant development of the plot; unconvincing star bends; loud, annoying, music video type soundtracks; a villain who digs it; and repeatedly cast, costumes, and conspiracies that cater to an audience of up to 25 years old. This is an excellent thriller that probably hasn't been released. *** 1/2 of 4 stars.
