I thought the movie started a bit slow and disjointed for the first hour. However, in the last two hours she has become more absorbing, fascinating and surprising. While it starts as a cheap horror movie, it evolves into a beautiful and amazing fantasy movie. Bridget Fonda performs as Snow Queen. That was her best performance, and it was sad that it was her last appearance because she hadn't acted in the past 7 years. Absolutely embodies the beauty and cold of winter. My 14-year-old daughter found this movie a little scary, so if you show it as family fun, stay with the baby and reassure her or it's just a fairytale fantasy and we don't take it too seriously. It's really one of the best fantasy movies I've seen for a long time, a little better than "Eragon" or any of the "Lord of the Rings". It's as good as the "Golden Compass".
