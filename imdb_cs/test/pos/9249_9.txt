I am slim interested because I have appeared in this movie, but I loved it and I'm only in seven scattered minutes and I'm not nearly the most interesting part. The film is a sincere and interesting account of a noble independent group of filmmakers trying to make a nice film. It's also a record of bloated expectations and fallen heroses. Different people are all interesting and never one person. Also interviews are filmed in quite interesting fashion that keeps the film visually satisfying. Definitely worthwhile movie. I hope this happens.
