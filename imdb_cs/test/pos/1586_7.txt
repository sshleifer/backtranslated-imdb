Wide but fun piece of distraction. You have to see it from the beginning to see what's going on, but every message on Earth has its own little joke. Very good special effects for very low sci-fi budget. show. It's fun to watch. A little in the veins of the Red Dwarf, but even lower in budget. For someone who is just coming in the middle of one of the episodes, you have to realize that these people are incompetent because they have been relocated to the leaderboard because the other officers have died. Also, the main guys are out of the laundry, which is why they have laundry in everything. If you like Red Dwarf, you'll probably be like this. Slightly different t.v. the concept, in that everything you see is the message of the commander every day. It would be better if it was explained more, not just at the very beginning of the first episode, but then it was hard enough. find out what happened also in the Red Dwarf, if you weren't told.
