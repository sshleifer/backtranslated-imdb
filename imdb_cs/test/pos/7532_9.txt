Writing about something so beautiful is absolutely hard. In fact, it is almost impossible to describe the peculiarities of this film. It's an amazing story about sex and sex and it's almost incredible that we can't deal with the obscene scenes of sex. The feeling that this movie was made for people who like to feel and just feel life in all its complexity in a wonderful simple way. We look at it and growth begins in our minds, and our hearts: pure poem. I've been watching some "gay" movies and I've almost always been really dissatisfied with the unnecessary scenes of sex, not because I don't like sex scenes, but in general they're so pornographic that I'm forced to think that the director or producers or script writer is thinks homosexuality means reversal. Nagisa no Shindobaddo is completely different from those. Three main characters. We have Ito, Yoshida and Aihar, two boys and a girl in a special love triangle. Ito likes his best friend Yoshida, Yoshida likes Aihara and Aihara likes Ito. Imagine what could be in unprepared hands? On the contrary, Hashiguchi will make an amazing story that deeply translates into the philosophy of life and adds a question in our mind that has been wondering at the end of the film: Why? And that's why he spread to many questions in my brain and heart. Scenes, sometimes boring, are the moments of the most beautiful poem we can feel, but completely unable to write words. And maybe because we are unable to understand the question at the end of the film. I'm sure this movie wasn't created for us to discuss every single piece of his work? Some people want to understand a film that almost discusses it. Others are so accustomed to ordinary "American gay" movies that cannot appreciate the true value of this masterpiece. Watch it, close your eyes on credits and feel, everything, feel, feel beautiful song. For all this and much more, I give nine. And I won't give ten because ten out of ten is perfection. But I admit I almost did.
