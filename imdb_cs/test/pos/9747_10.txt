The standard bearer of all movie series, the ultimate good guy - Flash Gordon - versus Bad Guy - Ming Merciless. Although today's standards seem strange, they are the most prominent for 1936. But the essence of the story is the battle between Earth Lightning Gordon (Buster Crabbe) and Emporer Ming of Mongo (Charles Middleton). Crabbe and Middleton are amazing in their parts. And accompanying characters play Dale Arden, Dr. Zarkov, Princess Aura, Prince Barin, Vulcan and others are very good. This series is much better than the 1980 movie, essentially because Crabbe is much better than Sam J. Jones as Flash Gordon. This series is a standard carrier for all movies. No question about it.
