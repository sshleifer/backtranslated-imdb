This mini-series is an icon of the Australian spirit. Though it may seem unclear, the film depicts a spirit that is unique to Australia and one that should be valued. If anything, this mini-series shows Aussie a sense of humor. The ability to laugh at the extremely ridiculous. Our willingness to laugh even in the worst situations. While much of this series focuses on partner relationships and how humor can be used as a means of survival, it also has drama elements that evoke true emotions. The main actors who appear are absolutely sensational and convincing in their different roles. Perfect capture of the nature of their characters. This mini-series should be a mandatory tour for all Australians.
