I'm really enjoying this movie. It is a look back at a time when this nation was really threatened by nations that either attacked us or spoiled the war, ie the Japanese and the Germans. Robert Cummings and Pricilla Lane were excellent in the lead roles. Supporting cast ... Otto Kruger, Alan Baxter, Clem Bevins and Norman Lloyd were also excellent. The direction, pace and finals are taking place and I'm still interested. So much that I bought my own copy. Thank goodness for Turner Classic movies that show so many classic movies, including this one. Robert Cummings was definitely not a lightweight actor, and although I am a big fan of Gary Cooper and Joel McCrea, two of my favorite actors who were first offered a lead role do not see what they would bring to a role that would overcome performance Bob Cummings. <br /> <br /> a movie that I like repetitive repetition and invite others to look.
