I've always enjoyed Frank Sinatra's music and recently wrote a semester paper on his life story. I was fascinated by the life and legend of Ol 'Blue Eyes. But I've never seen his movies. So I wanted to see if his performances were as great as his singing. Well ... it was! I was blown away by his performance in this movie! She really does a tremendous job as a heroin addict, Frankie Machine, who tries to put her life together and auditions as a drummer for a local band. Otto Preminger is also great. I haven't seen any of his other movies. I read his resume on IMDB. It seems to be one of those directors who have been very misunderstood, and people have been thinking about it. It looks like the man who appeals to cult enthusiasts. I haven't seen enough of his movies to know if he's really brilliant, but I'm curious now. I want to see more of his films because, according to his attempt at "The Man with the Golden Arm", this guy has a talent. I also loved music for this movie. The score definitely contains the kind of music I will remember when I ever heard it again. That's when you know you have a great score. Supporting performances are also fine, including Darren McGavin as a local pusher drug, Eleanor Parker as Frankie's disability wife-wife and Kim Novak as his lover. It is interesting to see how filmmakers tackled the issue of drug abuse, as opposed to modern attempts to make films like "Trainspotting" and "Requiem for a Dream". Back in 1955, just mentioning the word "drugs" caused controversy, and if you watch the movie, they kept the subject at a very discrete level. There is only one scene where Frankie actually gets heroin in his arm, and showed that he was approaching the reaction of his face rather than showing him a needle that graphically poked into his veins. But he brought his message without feeling weak. In a powerful drama like this with strong performance and direction like this, you don't need a graphical representation of drug abuse to attract the audience. "The Golden Arm Man" is a dramatic gem that all movie lovers should try. It's really amazing work! <br /> <br /> My score: 8 (out of 10)
