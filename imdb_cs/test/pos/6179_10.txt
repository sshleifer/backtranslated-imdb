I absolutely loved this movie. Great, realistic looking combat shots for one thing and a moving, real story. The quiet, unobtrusive way of leading character, Franty, makes him very sympathetic. Relationships between people in the story seemed so typical and possible what you might expect at a time of war. The bond between Franta and Carel shows that loyal war comrades may have to each other and this is often described in books and interviews with veterans. Subtitles do not disturb the story at all and in fact serve to underline the problems of Czech pilots in the RAF. The post-war story is a great reminder that for many World War II sufferings it did not end in 1945, especially in the Russian occupied countries. The film was also very good. I wish I could see it on the big screen.
