Putting aside "I'm so sure" and "Totally harsh" is one of the sweetest and liveliest novels on film. deborah foreman (where is he now?) like julie and nicolas cage like randy are just as classic as romeo and juliet, tony and maria, yak and samantha ... you can't help but fall in love with them. plus the soundtrack - plimsouls, sparks, furs, flirt and, of course, modern English - is also excellent. for fans of movies about young love I would like to recommend a recent movie of all real girls by david gordon green.
