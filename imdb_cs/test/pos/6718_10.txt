Danny Boyle wasn't the first to realize that zombies can run like flaps. This honor includes Lifeforce, which is, of course, the biggest nude space vampire zombie from Halley's Comet running amok in London's end-of-the-world movie ever made. Tobe Hooper may have done a lot of bullshit, but for this delinquently demented epic sci-fi horror he deserves a place among the immortals. In addition, he offers the space vampire Mathild May, the best thing to come out of France by Simone Simon, to spend the whole movie naked. Which makes very, very good. Just keep in mind that while she is the most overwhelmingly feminine presence, anyone on Earth has ever met is also "totally alien to this planet and our life form and totally dangerous." It's a meeting on the playground I would like to sit on: The astronauts from the British space program will find three naked forms of humanoid extraterrestrial life inside a giant 150-mile-long artichoke / umbrella that is hidden in the tail of a Halley comet full of giants. dried bats and bringing them back to Earth with almost apocalyptic results as they progress towards the outflow of London by their life force amidst a lot of nudity, thunderstorms and spitting coffee across the direlog room ("I've been in the universe for six months" And I assume we don't know anything "Don't worry, a naked woman won't get out of this complex.") Oh, and we'll get Alien and Blue Thunder writers to write it with incredible transcripts by Mark Devil, Sex Thief, and Eskimo Nell and Jonestown Director It sounds like a winner, there's $ 22m to have fun, and they do it, they do. <br /> <br /> It's true that there are enough promises in the raw material that something really scared and provoked (at the time when AIDS hysteria approaches its height, sexually transmitted) plague offers ample opportunities for allegory) but in the hands of Go-Go Boys in Cannon, what could be another Quatermass and Pit quickly turns instead of being more Plan 10 from space.It's a full-to-burst with crazy inanity, be it Frank Finlay is a hilarious scene of death ("Here I am!"), Peter Firth's big entrance ("I'm Colonel Caine." "" From SAS? "Discreetly screaming Michael Gothard through a room full of reporters:" Gentlemen, the last note was not for publication. This is a D-Notice situation, responding to surprisingly pressing pressmans, security guards who offer Mathilde Maya vampires in a pretty vampire biscuit to prevent her from escaping, reanimated bodies exploding into the dust of whole people, sweaty premier sucking life from his secretary and London filling up with zombie nuns, brokers and runners as the city gets its most comprehensive on the trashing screen from Mrs. Gorgo lost to junior at Battersea Funfair and went to the rampage.And it doesn't mention "This woman is a masochist! An extreme masochist! "Scene or great stereo echo effect on a male vampire" It will be much less frightening when you get to me "line, while lead at stake controlling Peter Firth receives his best male action voice to answer" I'll just do that! " In a single scene, you have obsessed Patrick Stewart, who embodies a woman in our deeply confused mind of astronaut heroes, Steve "I-never-over-playing-Charlie-Manson" Railsback and his amazing dance eyebrows in full "Helt-Skelt! the regime is trying to resist the temptation to kiss him, the inimitable Aubrey Morris (the only man who makes Freddie Jones a restrained look) plays home secretary Sir Percy Heseltine as a kind of demented Brian Rix, Peter Firth (one of those actors who always looks like it must be a doctor who, at a time when no one had observed him, had failed to do a crazy macho public school in the hope that no one would ever see her and John Hallam's unrepeatable nurse still opened the door to a middle psychic tornado to bring more drugs. It is a pity that Frank Finlay, a crazy scientist who is not capable of certifying death on alien life forms (a role originally intended for Klaus Kinsky), has lost this action. <br /> <br /> No Doesn't matter on how crazy you think the movie is, he still manages to get even crazier, no matter if he is a zombie pathologist. she needs feeding "), which explodes all over the suit of the Interior Minister, Patrick Stewart's blood and the guts forming naked Mathilda May or the space vampires turning the Cathedral of Sts. Paul at the world's largest laser show, which transports human souls from the London Underground to their geostationary mother ship. I loved every amazingly crazy moment. In its own, truly unique way, it could be the biggest movie ever made. The DVD offers an original 116-minute version that opened in the UK and not a heavily revised 101-minute version of the US that not only offers much more joy for your dollar, but also fully restores Henry Mancini's score to its original glory (The American version covers a lot of gaps with other hints of Michael Kamen and James Guthrie). Though somewhat surprising at first glance, Mancini has cut his teeth on many of the classic versatile sci-fi horrors of the fifties, and his score is absolutely superb, with a marvelous headline that offers a rare reminder of how interesting it could be. Be Away From Blake Edwards. Sadly, there is nothing more than a comparator trailer, though it would be nice to hope one day to become a special edition with some of the deleted scenes from the originally intended Hooper cut, which is 128 minutes. even more comedy gold!
