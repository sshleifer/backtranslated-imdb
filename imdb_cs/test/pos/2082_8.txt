It's a big little movie full of interesting characters and situations. Although not in the same class as some of the most famous films of their time, they are still very attentive and unforgettable. The scene where Zachary Scott was sitting on the bus steals an airplane from the lapel of his coat thrown over the seat beside him, staggering. It defines its character beautifully - a guy who is so low that purloin will be something of an invaluable value to a war veteran, used as a prop in his various charades. It is easy as the situation demands, and captivates Fenchurch's housewives with their irresistible charm and the killer smile. I couldn't tell if this movie had created Mildred Pierce's success. Scott and Bruce Bennett were reunited, and Faye Emerson bears some resemblance to Joan Crawford, with her facial structure and big eyes. Also, the character of Mona Freeman is not unlike the Science of Mildred Pierce. I agree with the previous commentary that the end of the film was too pat, with a convenient fall over the cliff for "Ronnie Mason, the character of Zachary Scott. Also in one of the closing scenes we see Mono Freeman brothers who met a friend whom he had previously despised for the benefit of an older, smoother Zachary Scott, I think the script should call for her behavior and cruelty to her sister instead of considering her a typical episode of adolescents. otherwise pleasant and well made film.
