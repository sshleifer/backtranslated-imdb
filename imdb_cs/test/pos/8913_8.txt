There is more to this film than it meets the eye. If you're looking for breakthrough originality or easy comedy, you'll be disappointed. But for a fun 90 minutes it's okay. <br /> <br /> The camera is meticulous and precise. Sex scenes that one comment rejects as unreasonable are something else - each gesture contributes to the development of the characters. Yes, some of the main characters are not exactly loving human beings. But the film makes a sincere effort to show their interactions in fair light without being sensational (at least not for urban standards at the beginning of the 21st century). And there are many very fun moments.
