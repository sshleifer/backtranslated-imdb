I just went through this movie again and can I wonder if we'll see such movies anymore? Timeless music, gentle voices of William Holden and Jennifer Jones leave this adult man crying with joyful, romantic scenes, and I am not the one who cries in life often. Where is our William Holden away and do these moving, wonderful movies? It is sad to realize that they will probably not, but don't think about it, just try to block it. They won't even have Holden, and they won't show up on that hill again. You can enjoy this movie and watch it again.
