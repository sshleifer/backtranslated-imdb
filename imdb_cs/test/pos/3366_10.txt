There is nothing to lose about this work of Perry and Croft - as well as any of the best episodes, fortunately it was still being shot in time before the late James Beck unfortunately died to join him to show his talent. It turned out from the beginning how the platoon is made up of a state of emergency, which shows that the boys are incapable of being led by Captain Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe) and Sergeant Wilson (John Le Mesurier). On the way, Mainwaring makes his usual desire to show authority, but chaps can't help but leave him at every turn, during wargames and suspicion of invasion. They have a chance in the movie though to redeem when they actually capture Nazi flyers who take the church corps hostage. That was a nice final, especially since Mainwaring was able to prove himself to the general, he got one last chance to form. Great movie, lots of good lines and laughs, it's another for the DVD locker - I'm glad the BBC repeats it - and on this day 2.8.08 they deservedly deserved 'Dad's Army Night'. Do not miss!
