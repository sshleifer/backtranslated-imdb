I actually saw the last part of this movie when I was a kid. Thanks to the search engine of the charts I was able to find out its name. I didn't know the name for years, but the movie got stuck in my head. The left end hopes that the main character will eventually return to Earth. It was a pity she didn't get into the series. This film reminds me of the way to the other side of the sun. Also known as Doppleganger. If you liked this feature, the second is worth watching. This was done before The Stranger, but shares a similar plot. But different. I just picked up The Stranger from eBay on VHS. I hope to DVD, but it is doubtful if it comes out on a DVD DVD. Several pilots are doing it on a DVD budget and maybe it will be.
