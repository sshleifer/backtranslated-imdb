This film is the godfather of Latino. An unlikely gangster bridges the gap to some improbable alliances and creates an empire. I liked the action and firefighting along with brash actors and colorful characters. This movie is not an Oscar winner, but definitely entertaining. Hey, who needs an Oscar anyway? Chap has some balls to drive and act (I think he also produced it?) this movie. He reminds me of another filmmaker who likes to do it, Robert Rodrigez. Keep it up, is the sequel continuing? There are plenty of chains to tie. The Son Returns and Avenges the Father of Death?
