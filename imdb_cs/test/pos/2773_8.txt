My kids loved this movie. we watched that every chance we got was a fun movie. we watched it as a family and we all enjoyed it. it was a movie you could watch without any unpleasant places you would have to explain to the younger. my boys loved this movie and would like to see it again. even after all these years, they remember it. that Amy Jo Johnson was a very cute girl. all my boys crushed her. They loved her as a pink guard, which is why we watched this movie begin. (as you can say, I was a little closer to filling LOL lines). But seriously it is a fun movie and worth watching. Disney please give us a DVD or replay!
