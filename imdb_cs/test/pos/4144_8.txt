I always liked to listen to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in a plane crash. He wasn't in an old rock class, say Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he wasn't far away. Who knows how great his legacy would be if he sang in a decade. Almost everyone he released was a hit. So I was very pleasantly surprised at how good Gary Busey was in playing and mimicking his singing. He was proud of Buddy as well as actors (Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith) who played the Hollywood backup band "The Crickets". Musically, some of Holly's most famous songs are the beginning of the film and his really good performance with a strong ending at the end, as well as Holly and the boys, are exhibited in Iowa at their last concert. Busey not only sings like Holly, it's a dead bell for him in the department of appearance. Some thing was the best performance of an actor and you didn't get any argument from me. I am also glad that the film ended up on a positive note with the Iowa concert, instead of dwelling on its tragic accident. The end could have been a real fall, but they didn't let it go.
