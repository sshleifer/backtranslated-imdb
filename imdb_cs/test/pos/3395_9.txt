After watching it with my mother (Who got it for Christmas), I was thrilled to find something other than the usual things I usually watch. All stories have been described in detail and you are able to feel the strong emotions of each character from the beginning. Each story is followed brilliantly, so you feel completely different things for each individual character. The cast is amazing, my personal favorites are James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, like George Hazard and Madeline Fabray / LaMotte / Main. The whole thing is in depth and amazing, so very compulsive viewing, I recommend it to almost everyone.
