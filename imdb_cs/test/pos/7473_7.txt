I don't know what critics were looking at when this movie was released, but slipped it off. It is well written, witty, satirical and thoroughly pleasing. It's like a video game brought to life. You never know who's behind the door or what's next. Violence is neither unjustified nor exaggerated due to the splashing effect. The Last Word: For You Mickey Rourke Fans ... Mickster is back and on his coolest in the show at the end.
