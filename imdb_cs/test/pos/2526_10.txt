Pixote is barely controlled by sentiment. And even more than I imagine, Hector Babenco owes some of his film chops with this film to the neo-realistic style of Vittorio De Sica, especially Shoeshine (the film, like Pixote, mostly takes place inside a children's prison). And yet, although I could still prefer De Sica's film, if it were decided between the two, it was so close, because it wasn't, no pun like the choice between two children. They are amazing works of raw drama, and Pixote Babenco also has an extraordinary advantage and tormenting qualities to deal with it in that it is not filmed under the conditions that occurred after World War II. This is how it was in Brazil - one would have seen it with a somewhat larger atmosphere and astonishment in God's city, perhaps in some of the same locations - and these children were on the streets before and after filming. Some aren't alive about 20 years later, they don't know for everyone. "Star", a preschool street boy, Fernando Ramos da Silva, plays the title character, a youth without a father, or indeed every family who takes care of him and places himself among dozens of other street children and offenders in the reformist program for boys. Conditions could not be much worse, and are even more unbearable because two children are killed one by one by some of the watchkeeping causes. There is a rebellion, and an escape, and in the middle of the film we find a Pixote with several other groomsmen, including a Lilica practical transvestite of 18, and they become pickpockets, drug dealers what they get. None of this, I repeat, manifests with the seriousness you have ever shown, you would never see in a million years how Ron Howard or Paul Haggis directed this kind of image - and yet there is all emotional honesty because nothing almost every scene is important to to show how fragile life is for Pixote, and how he could be killed or die in any way at every step, and so without even reaching puberty. at the level of people around him who are slightly older (though not much) and become things that will frighten him forever. Despite the fact that Babenco uses gentle and mournful musical scores and one or two scenes with people who cry a lot, nothing feels forced. As with De Sica, perhaps more - due to the consistent conditions of the children on San Paolo and Rio, it is a natural children's director and coaxial from Ramos da Silva and Jorge Juli√£o and others have a really great job. The "movie" drama (it's not so real that it becomes documentary, which is not a bad thing to say) and even subtlety in some scenes. Pixote may not be as well known as it is later 21st century Brazilian films that look beyond the horror of Rio, or even neo-realistic movies, but that should be. Anyone who wants to get a good, hard look at what it was, should look for him in the library or elsewhere and soak in the best foreign film of 1981.
