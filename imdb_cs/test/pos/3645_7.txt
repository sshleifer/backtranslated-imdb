As I said, I'm not a Tweety fan. It's just so aggravating that I wish Sylvester just ate him and get him. <br /> <br /> In this cartoon, Sly is homeless again and is back to feeding the trash. He observes a cruise ship leaving the port nearby and decides to jump aboard when Tweety plays one of the passengers. <br /> <br /> The ship provides an adequate phase for subsequent hijinks, and Sly desperately tries to catch an annoying bird and avoid disease. Just once he manages to chew and swallow, so end up with the irritating Canary forever. But, as cartoons play Tweety go, this is pretty good, but it's all thanks to this brilliant cat.
