At the beginning of the 19th century, a young woman with a harp is at odds with her family's ambitions and the local community's superstitions, but she meets a man who can see her differently and can only forever change the life of Pru. Precious Bane is a British radio corporation adaptation of the highly acclaimed novel by Mary Webb. It's a beautifully shot piece that behaves at an incredibly high level, the story {Maggie Wadey} is excellent and period detail and the use of the dialect is top-notch. It's such a shame that this movie doesn't have a DVD release yet, one would think that with Clive Owen (great here like Gideon) he has raised to fame, the BBC would have gotten there, but unfortunately not, so the only way to catch it is in a very rare occasions that TCM will show it. Janet McTeer's leading performance as Pru Sarn is simply brilliant, courage and true emotion go hand in hand with McTeer giving her. Pru must not only struggle with her disfigurement on her face, but also with the constant weights and injured unconscious villagers. It's a time when people believed that if Hare ran in front of a pregnant woman, he spelled doom, the time of the Bull Bait, the time of superstition and the talk of the witches. Despite the constant retreats, Pru is strong and resourceful, even her family will knock her dreams back without realizing it, but this path may be terribly bumpy, but hope is eternal and Pru has hope in abundance. > <br /> 8.5 / 10
