Ignore Bad Reviews Here, This Movie Is Amazing! Just Before Dawn is a great example of what can be done in a movie with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew, a decent script, and a great movie idea. It's a hell of a lot of fun. I liked it much more than most of the other slashes of the 80s, because the killer is so unique. "Wrong Turn" tore this movie out of something wild! There's a lot of blood and scares. My girlfriend was scared and she was watching almost everything with me and she didn't move. It's scary. I'd say "Just Before Dawn" is the best morning 80's. I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 children.
