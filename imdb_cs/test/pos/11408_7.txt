Jill Johnson (Belle), one hundred miles away from the grizzly murder site in the Americans, settles for a baby sitting night. With children sleeping and a beautiful home to rest, she locks the door and sets the alarm. But when a series of mysterious alien calls say he "controls children," Jill panicked. Fear of horror when it has traced calls. And what the police find, it does a perfect job of babysitting in the worst nightmare of 16 years. There are no other actors in this movie. Camilla Belle is the main star with a cute face. On the day she comes to babysitting, she has no idea what she really is waiting for in hell. If I was in a house like Jill. The refrigerator would be the first person to look at, but I'm a man and I'm not talking. But what I found funny was the size of the house. I'd think the movie would be the same if the house wasn't that big? Anyone could get lost in that huge house, but this movie needed a house of massive size. Camilla Belle has a cute face, a perfect smile, but it's like a movie like this, the main actress needs someone with experience. I found Camilla wasn't that good. I don't know, maybe she thought it might be her breakthrough role. I love her, she is a cute girl, but someone who has a role in this movie must be someone who is different than to take it. This movie wasn't scary. I also found this film more as a "film movie". I think the only reason it was released during the SuperBowl weekend was that the guys stayed at home watching the game and the girls were going to see. It also looks like a type of movie when girls will enjoy more than boys. But I liked this movie, but how it is. The girls, just as scared or screaming. That was just a pretty decent movie. Maybe someone might like this movie. There are many PG-13 horror movies that never succeed. It was on its own level. That's how I liked this movie. I give it 7/10.
