This is probably one of the best Portuguese films I've ever seen ... I really enjoyed the show because, as the story evolved, you'd be more involved in how their world was really upside down ... just one the part that doesn't really seem to fit into a movie, which is a girl's stripe ... It doesn't add anything important to the story, it looks like it's just a man of fun purpose. But the end is a bit unexpected, but somewhat anticipated. If you do not understand, then follow me: after so many strange events, the viewer is so accustomed to the weirdness that the end of the film with unexpected relationships (like Mimoso and Susana) sounds completely natural after seeing the rest of the movie. But above all, Sorte Zero is a movie that makes you think you are trying to solve mysterious Olympics, laughing at their unfortunate lives and messing with their perceptions of what can happen in minutes when you turn back from something. for all this I rate 8/10
