I wonder if Meryl Streep has become the most interesting and versatile actress ever since, well, maybe just about the beginning of the sound era, which perhaps her talent now takes for granted. It is probably three tics, which he relies on all his performances (the most tightly closed lips), but her performances are incredibly variable and original and fresh expressions of inner activities. Although "Sophie's Choice" and "A Cry in the Dark" and "Silkwood" may be rather huge, her work here and at "Bridges in Madison County" is also remarkable - just softer. In "One True Thing", she is mostly sweet and in love with her domesticated life, and Streep does what might be routine, even boring, seem attractive and charming. I think they have to develop these mini-theses for each character and find out what makes this person real and interesting. She works from the inside out with every character, and maybe it's this basic quality that has triggered a major critique of defiance or self-awareness. I don't think it's cold at all, but instead thought about the unique qualities of her character. I think her critics are confusing self-confidence with intelligence. Not too many other actors would be so comprehensively thought-out and creative that Kate Muldrun would become light and carefree in her beloved, homely environment, only to later reveal unprecedented depth through her true relationship to this home environment. Her performances are insurmountable consistency, seldom doing anything wrong. I wonder if it is possible for any of Streep's paintings to be scaled down because of her presence ... Anyway, Kate loves her home and her affection for her "family life" is as delightful as her new home conflict. When it all comes together and Kate starts to recognize that she can no longer function in the same function, and she breaks the cake bowl and shouts that she is not affected, she is painfully sad to watch because it wasn't someone. susceptible to emotion. Streep is smart enough and generous enough to recognize how better everything works because she felt the dramatic validity of Kate and it's really the only scene she lets her go. But how refreshing it is to see a character who can really surprise you by showing something you don't think. Again, Streep's character has at least three dimensions ... God, that sounds like a job alone, but as an actress, Streep has just a special kind of intelligence, incredible empathy and great expressive skills. The film itself is somewhat mediocre. I think William Hurt is supposed to be an unlikely blockbuster and very good at pomposity. But I think Hurt is really scary. The script is quite standard - another Streep tribute that was as touching and credible as she was.
