I'm a big fan of Naruto, even though I haven't seen every episode or read every manga. I really liked Naruto's first movie and, to tell you the truth, I was a little nervous that this one wouldn't be as good (or wrapped) first (mainly because this one had only PG instead of M in Australia) , which is PG-13 US or 12 UK). But I was wrong (fortunately)! The animation has been improved (although some character drawings in the points seemed hurrying) and were particularly good in the battle scenes. <br /> <br /> Speaking of it, let's talk about battle scenes! The animation and action in the battle scenes were spectacular and very fun! Especially I enjoyed genjutsu battle with kankuro and fight with Gaara fighting against the shape of a female warrior! All the characters you want are here! Naruto, Sakura, Gaara, Kankuro and Shikamaru! If only Temari were in the movie, Shikamaru could save her dramatically from the female warriors! And maybe they could have PASSIONATE KISS! In my summary above, I say it qualifies as a piece of cinema rather than just an extended episode. And it does! The action is very cinematic and the quality of the animation looks very effective, especially during the fighting! Overall, this is an excellent anime movie to be seen for all Naruto fans! 5/5! 10/10! 50/50! 100/100! All right, I'll stop!
