SPOILER WARNING <br /> <br /> We've all heard the legend "Boy Who Cried Wolf". But what if the wolf was a man in the modern world. It could be something like Big Fat Liar. Fourteen-year-old Jason Sheperd (Frankie Muniz of "Malcolm in the Middle") always lies to avoid problems. One day he is pressured to write an English essay, but it is in the hands of the slim filmmaker Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti) who plans to turn Jason's story into a Hollywood blockbuster. Nobody trusts Jason once he declares the truth and ends up in the summer school. However, Jason is determined to prove to his parents the truth and travels to L.A with his friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes). When Wolf refuses to admit that he has torn his story, Jason plans to make Wolf's life a living hell. B.F.L. There is no masterpiece, but it's a nice way to spend 90 minutes of time. I wished they could do it a little longer, and it's not that much of a joke, though they're pretty smart (I like the pool-dye the best). Maybe I didn't like it as much as I did if it wasn't for Paul Giamatti. He's just cheerful about it. If you have 90 minutes to kill, try it. Maybe you'll enjoy it.
