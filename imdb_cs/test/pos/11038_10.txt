This World War II Popeye cartoon had some very good gags in it, and its definitely above average for its genre. Also, it was nicely drawn, with some great angles, good details and ... well, lots of interesting sights. into a small Japanese boat, with two boys on it. (By the way, why were "Japanese" always displayed with large, round glasses and jagged teeth?). But these harmless Japanese sailors want Popeye to sign a peace treaty. Oh, boy, he thinks he's trusting Popeye, "wait until the Admiral sees it!" In one of the great art scenes I mentioned above, we slowly see how the little Japanese ship is a really big destroyer ... and Popeye is deep .... um, water! "Why, those double crosses Ja-pansies!", Screams our man Sailor. <br /> <br /> As it gets out of the way, it's fun to watch.
