Dracula (John Carradine) visits Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens), who believes that everything can be cured by science. He wants Edelamn to cure his vampire - Edelman agrees. Then Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) appears and seeks a cure for his ripple. The Thr Frankenstein monster is also discovered, but he really does nothing. Very ambitious conspiracy for a 1940s horror movie. In fact, trying to heal monsters with science is an interesting idea. Also, this film has beautiful sets (LOVE the castle lives on), tons of atmosphere, is very well directed (great use of shadows) and has quite good special effects. Acting is all good except Carradine - he is trying, but I could never accept him as Dracula. Also, Lionel Atwill appears in the game (as always) of the Chief of Police. This is largely forgotten and taunted as a silly movie, but I think it's very good. It is also the last time that Universal Monsters were taken seriously - another film in 1948 at "Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein". It's a great movie, but the accent is more on comedy. The only real mistake is that there is plenty of conspiracy for 67 minutes and some gaps in logic: Why is Dracula trying to bite a beautiful Milizu (Martha O'Driscoll) when he's cured? And why (and how) does Dr. Frankenstina have his castle? There are still small complaints. Recommended.
