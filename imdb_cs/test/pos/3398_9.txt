This commentary deals with "North and South Book I", which deals with the period 1842-1861 <br /> <br /> The history of the US in the 19th century is mostly identified by people with a civil war (1861–1865). This is a sensible opinion because it was a civil war that put the Union in a difficult test; it was a civil war that made Americans realize how rare it is to live in peace; eventually it was this period that finally ended the shameful system of slavery. <br /> <br /> Since the birth of movies, there have been people who have adapted that time on screen. D.W. Griffith, in the early 20th century, made his memorable BIRTH OF NATION. Yet the most famous North-South clash is still GONE WITH WIND (1938). Unfortunately, fewer people know beautiful TV series based on John Jakes' novel, "North and South". It's the best TV series ever made, and the time spent watching is really rare. Many years ago, I recorded it on my Polish television video and since then I have come back with great pleasure. Why? First, the whole story is deeply rooted in historical reality. The two families, Maines of South Carolina and the Hazards of Pennsylvania, represent two completely different ways of life. Despite this, friendship links them up. But what they are experiencing is the struggle that all people do: a friendship attacked by the "truth" of "political correctness", the love attacked by the hatred of "legal spouses," the subtlety of the power of "social heroes." Orry Maine (Patrick Swayze) is my beloved character - someone who finds love and who quickly gets rid of it; someone who cares for friends, but political fanatics in the way and destroys many. Finally, he is someone who can see the tragic future of his country, but there is nothing he can do about the inevitable fate of the south. His friend, George Hazard, is similar in most aspects but sometimes he seems to have a stronger character. It is he who shows Orry that even if they are tragedy, they must get up out of despair and live because life is the most precious thing we have. Although they represent two different lifestyles, their friendship is stronger than any prejudice, politics or conflicts. <br /> <br /> Other characters are also very well developed. There are villains like Justin LaMotte or Salem Jones who are really bad, but most people are ambiguous because the nature of humanity has always been. Charles Maine is initially full of rebellion, prone to combat, but later learns to be a true southern gentleman, for whom southern pride is not a brave word but, above all, courageous deeds. Virgilia Hazard is the most fanatical side of the abolitionist movement seeking to condemn slavery and punish "black breeders". Her marriage to Grady seems to be a symbol of equality, but also a symbol of "no" politics in the south. Two interesting characters are the sisters of Orry, Brett and Ashton - the sisters whose veins run completely opposite blood. Brett in her kindness, but also naivety, believes in absolute fidelity. He marries Billy, even if he's a northerner because he really loves him. Brett is a representation of everything that is rare in every young woman. But Ashton is a vampire, a tigress, a woman who does not hesitate to do her own best. A clear picture of their clashes of world views is their talk about people and family ... an unforgettable moment and how versatile! Most characters are heading to their values ​​... but the war breaks out and will have to put aside a lot ... Second, the performance ... someone said not all people act naturally. I wouldn't say that. I would say that all casts do very good work in their parts from the main characters, which are shown by younger employees for guests consisting of famous stars, including Liz Taylor, Robert Mitchum and others. Patrick Swayze as Orry is doing a great job. I consider this role to be one of the best. Lesley Anne Down as Madeleine is also very memorable. Part of it may carry too much suffering, but it can express itself very well. Kirstie Alley is very attractive and truly unforgettable as Virgilia Hazard abolitionist. Phillip Casnoff is worth considering as the extremely ambitious Elkanah Bent as well as David Carradine as the monster's husband, the disgusting Justin LaMotte. And unlike him, we have to mention Jean Simmons, who is truly outstanding as Orry's mother, whose heart beats for the glory of family life and the union's harmony. Third, the unforgettable moments of "North and South" leave the mind in mind. Who can forget the first meeting of Orry and Madeleine - what kind of magic, what softness is in this scene! Or is it possible to skip the moment when Madeleine's father dies? I found it really powerful, there is a real drama, a drama of a woman left by someone who really loved her. I also liked Churubusco and George Hazard was so worried about his dearest friend's life, Orry. Then his appointments with Constance are amazing. Virgilia's speech in Philadelphia is a masterpiece of performance. And the last moment of the first part: even though the north and south may separate, their friendship will never die. Orry and George symbolically join hands as the train goes on. Simply put, there are so many beautiful and powerful scenes that it is impossible to mention half of them. And these wonderful tones of Bill Conti filmed in a brilliant landscape. Music in the "North and South" is very moving and unforgettable. <br /> <br /> What to say in the end? "North and South" is real on DVD, just an amazing TV series about winning everything that is rare in us: love, friendship, loyalty, honor, truthfulness, absolute loyalty. 9/10
