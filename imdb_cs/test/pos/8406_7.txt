When I grew up with GWTW, I avoided both the "Scarlett" sequel and the mini-series until now. When I first saw the video for the first time, I was amazed at how much I enjoyed watching Timothy Dalton's Rhett Butler and Joanne Walley-Kilmer's portrayal as Scarlet. I feel that "Scarlet" should be judged on its own merits, rather than attempting to compare it with the respectable Selznick masterpiece of GWTW. While the "Scarlet" story and some of the dialogue suffered from a lack of inspired writing, overall I thought it was a useful dramatization of what might be between Scarlett and Rhett.
