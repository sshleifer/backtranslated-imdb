She could not come from another country or another time. This film simply radiates psychedelia influenced by the late 60s Italian cinema. So, pseudo serious and sexually free. The noble setting and dreamy music make it a visual and aural pleasure. In addition, we get the beautiful Dagmar Lassander, certainly at her best. Kinky on going on a wild ride and if the romps in the middle of Mimosa seem elongated at the end, it's another, but charming feature of the time. You probably expected to divide the few minutes between the screen and your girlfriend, and of course this is a turning point in driving. Perhaps it would be better if Philippe Leroy didn't look so strange with his shaking red hair and a twisted face expression. He does well and has many silent moments when Dagmar Cavort is and must show a mixture of love and hatred. It's not an ordinary narrative film in any way, but for those who like something else, it's certainly.
