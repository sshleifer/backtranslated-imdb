Two hard luck but deceitful ladies decide to act as HAVANA WIDOWS by cruising to Cuba to meet and blackmail the rich gentlemen ... That was a kind of fleeting comic book that the studios produced effortlessly. The 30s. Well done and very enjoyable, viewers of depression do not seem to have enough of these popular, funny photographic dramatic enough. Joan Blondell & Glenda Farrell are perfectly cast as frantic, fast-talking women who go to great lengths to get a little dishonest dough. Although Joan gets both top billing and romantic scenes, both gals are talented and traceable because they are beautiful. Nice Lyle Talbot plays Joanna's persistent suitor, but has little to do. Chubby, cherubic Guy Kibbee appears to be the intended target of the girls. Whether she wakes up, finds herself on the wrong bed or is persecuted on the roof of a Cuban hacienda in her long john, she is just as cheerful. Behind him comes the rank of character actors - Allen Jenkins, Frank McHugh, Ruth Donnelly, Hobart Cavanaugh, Maude Eburne, Dewey Robinson - all equally adept at enjoying the toughest crowd. James Murray as a suspected counterfeit ATM. This very talented actor was pulled out of utter uncertainty to appear in the Cross of King Vidor (1928), one of the most prestigious films of the silent era. Hopes were high for a great career, but his celebrities quickly faded with sound images. After a long chain of tiny roles and bits, smashed & abandoned, his life ended up in the waters of the New York River in 1936. He was only 35 years old. While never stars stars Joan Blondell (1906-1979) and Glenda Farrell (1904-1971) revived dozens of Warner Bros films during the 1930s, especially eight in which they appeared together. Whether gold diggers or girls, reporters or secretaries, these ladies and brassy ladies were almost always in agreement with what the lead man was, who was fortunate enough to share the same bill. Their character has shown that they are ready to embrace the world - and every man in it. Never as ominously shameful as Paramel Mae West, you always felt that Blondell & Farrell, hard as they were, used their tenacity to defend the vulnerable hearts that were ready to break the right guy. While many performances seven decades ago may look erratic or today, these two beautiful ladies are still spirited and harsh.
