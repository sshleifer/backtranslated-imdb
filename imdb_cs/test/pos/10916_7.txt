*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** I loved set-up and consistently laughed throughout the movie. Acting was great because my favorite part is Howard (Kevin Kline) trying to be a "manly man". The fianc√© and the parents did a great job as a supportive cast. Spoiler warning: The behavior of his conservative family's acceptance and attempts to be polite was pleasing and believable. My only problem with the end was the fact that Howard was actually gay. The movie is set to "be who you want to be", but the movie actually does the opposite. Howard's logic behind his "discovery" is that he loves Barbra Streisand's movies and likes to dance to music. His mannerisms and tastes seem to be homosexuals until he is told that he is aware of it. Instead of getting him free, Howard pigeon holes. Oh, he likes to dance to music before he has to be gay. His confession in marriage felt like bending at the company's desire. Eventually, the film becomes a film about gay rights, which was not the original course. It almost becomes insignificant with the rest. I believe the film would be better if Howard was straight. That would be truer to the report.
