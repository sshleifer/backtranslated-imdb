Selling the dead revolves around the condemned grave thief Arthur Blake. Blake's friend and fellow fighter Willie Grimes has just been executed and Blake will follow in the morning. While sitting in his cell waiting for his execution, the priest named Duffy comes and asks him if he sees everything he sees as a grave thief. He then continues to give Father Duffy a quasi biography of his more interesting exhibits. The storyline consists of several incidents that are only associated with chronology. This prevents the viewer from ever getting bored, but also makes events less important because you could easily add or remove a lot of scenes without noticing it. Although I was wrong, overall I thought this method contributed to the fun loving nature of the film and keeps it very entertaining. Most of the different stories are good, specifically the stranger, Murphy and the vampire, but others were not that big. Acting is not amazing, but in no way did I consider it bad. point. Dominic Monaghan had a good performance when he was serious when it mattered and also played very well in the comedy parts of the film. The characters were not too deep, but they were interesting. I also enjoyed how many villains were made in an over-the-top almost comic book way. Murphy's back story and their gang are priceless. Overall, I Sell the Dead successfully combines horror, comedy, and sci-fi into mish mash fun and excitement. It is one of the more interesting and original films I have seen in a while, and it is unfortunate that independent films such as this one have no greater recognition.
