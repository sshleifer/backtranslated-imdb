Probably one of his lesser known films, it suffers from the same lack of exposure as Salvador in that of his actually one of his best. Written and starring Eric Bogosian, Talk Radio tells the story of the illustrious Radio Telephone Station that cancels out the wrong kind of listener. The film is important and has something to say about free speech issues and how free it should be, and you can easily say that life began as a scenic game. Knowing what you're getting into before you sit down and you're fine. Actually, there is not much to act on, because Bogosian is largely stealing the film, writing it, and when I granted him a license, I couldn't take my eyes off him and that was part of the fascination of many listeners; people who hated him wouldn't shut down if they didn't miss something. Not for everyone, but a very good drama and a very good movie in general.
