I waited 9 years to watch this movie, simply because I never saw it advertised on television. I finally caught it and it was worth waiting. It's much better than your excessive scream or last year's trash last year, because it's all at a fairly fast pace, without being pulled out, creeping into the house for enchanting music scenes. Just bad dubbing makes it a little bit light, but don't let it deter you in any way. What lies beneath - above the hyped and stupid. Mute witness - low budget, not enthusiastic at all and very good.
