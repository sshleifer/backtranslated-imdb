In 1950, they saw two very different and interesting Westerns: Henry King's Gunfighter and John Ford's Wagon Master. The 'Gunfighter' was historically notable as it clearly influenced Zimmerman's 'High Noon' (1951) and later revisionist westerns. However, I personally find a 'master car' superior to it's current counterpart. The smaller Ford masterpiece is not about telling; it should be conceived rather as a poem describing the concept of the old west. Although we are optimistic and heartbeat, we deserve naive naivety because it is totally free from the supposed underline. Border scenery is well used because it perfectly supports poetic narration. Add naturalistic work to the camera and we are transported among Mormon passengers to witness Western folklore that is told in cinematographic means.
