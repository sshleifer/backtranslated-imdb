The band is known for its strange performances and strange musical styles, so their music videos may not be quite normal. In fact, these little videos are abnormal and bizarre, but they have immense artistic value for them. The atmosphere is built with lighting and thoughtful visuals. It's a great viewing experience. Icky Flix basically consists of many Residents video clips created for their songs. The music itself ranges from rock to synthesized music that sounds like it's right from the 80s horror movie. What doesn't change is the quality of these videos. They're great! <br /> <br /> Every fan of art films will love them. They are so original with their visuals and angles on which they are shot, and lighting that makes them so interesting. Music is scary and catchy and highly original and these short films are mini-classics that deserve more attention. This is an almost perfect collection of short videos. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** outside ****. 56 minutes.
