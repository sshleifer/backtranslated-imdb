I can't build people who comment on this program or other HBO programs as "too graphic" or "unnecessarily graphic" or that they include "unjustified nudity / violence / sodomy, etc." <br /> <br /> Guess what? Prison life is not PG-13. "Gratuitous" graphic content is TRUE FOR LIFE in this situation. The prison contains rape inmates / murders / drug deals and showers. If you don't like it, then don't look at the program. I'm definitely no fan of prison rape, but if it was from the show, I'd be surprised and lend the show less credibility. If the prisoners didn't go through, it would be stupid. Of course it's a gratuitous language, but it's REALISTIC. The show is good, some of the audience .... not so much, I think.
