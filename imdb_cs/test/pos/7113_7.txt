This is a pretty fun B-movie in the Universal Horror series featuring Dracula, Wolfman, and Frankenstein Monster. The plot revolves around Dracula (John Carradine) and Larry Talbot, a wolf (Lon Chaney Jr.), a visiting revolutionary physician. They both ask him if they can be cured, and the doctor tries to figure out a way for everyone. Under the medical castle they find Frankenstein's monster buried in the mud (this is apparently a reference to the previous film in the Frankenstein series). Of course, if it was planned, the film would prove incredibly boring. Instead, Dracula cannot suppress his appetite, and the doctor is eventually infected, with a blood transfusion, with vampire. As a semi-vampire, the doctor goes crazy and awakens Frankenstein Monster. As with all Universal Horror series, the end is completely unsatisfactory. A beautiful woman with a humpback, one of two doctor's assistants, has a particularly terrible ending. What's more, you have to apologize to Frankenstein's monster in this movie - he's been up for about two minutes, killing one policeman, and then another building (what is it, fifth?). flames. It is also unfortunate that the great character created in The Wolf Man (1941), Larry Talbot, is really limited here. People underestimate the film and Chaney's performance in it. Here he would be rightfully criticized as wooden. All in all, it's a pretty funny movie in just 68 minutes. Nice waste of time. 7/10.
