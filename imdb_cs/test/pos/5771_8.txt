This trip to Knotts includes one of his best sidekicks ever, Frank Welker. Welker makes a movie. Knotts and Welker compete for laughter and both get a lot. Knotts works for a small "no where" city where the city is controlled by some of the most ignorant officials. When things go wrong with the city's fathers, let Knott fall. Frank Welker's character becomes friends with Knott and stumbles together to get rid of Knott's good name. This film shows the usual Knott is terrified of the character of death, which made him famous for years in television and film. This may be the last good trip knots. When you have another 90 minutes, get a good old-fashioned laughter great icon, Don Knotts.
