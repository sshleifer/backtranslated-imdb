The problem I have as Finn is that most of the actors in this film are in every Finnish film. I feel that Finland has only five actors. I think that if you are not from Finland, you like this movie as a refreshing novelty. This film is about a terrible chain of events that affect several people. Alcoholism, cold climate and darkness can be clich√©s, but in today's Finnish society they are still very real. Many people in Finland are depressed, especially in winter. The film's tone is very melancholic. I liked it and Louhimes's direction was again very strong. I liked this movie a lot, the only negative thing is that you see the same faces you have seen again and again.
