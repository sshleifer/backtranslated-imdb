GLORIFICATION UNLIMITED World War II. <br /> <br /> In regular TV programs we had several documentary series about World War II. Without information in any encyclopedia or film book, this old memory seems to remember most of the names on its own. In Europe, CRUSADE, which was the name of war memoirs, was one General of the Army and later the 33rd President of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower. This told the story of the conflict in Europe as seen by the Allied Commander in Chief. Then there was the word CRUSADE IN PACIFIC, which I don't remember much about. Jim Bishop was moderator / navigator of BATTLELINE. And there was a great WINSTON CHURCHILL, VALIANT YEARS. * The series was co-produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation American Radio Company. It first aired in the 1960-61 season here in the States and boasts of having Richard Burton speaking the words of Sir Winston. It's 1952 NBC Television's making our affair today, this VICTORY AT SEA that wins a cigar, hands down. First, it had to be carefully and literally sorted through thousands of hours of film for several years. The film footage discussed here was an officially recorded footage of members of the United States Armed Forces, an independent intelligence film, a film by our other allied partner nations, as well as Axis images taken from Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan. <br /> <br /> Once this was achieved, the corresponding movie had to be cut out and edited into a series of 1/2 hour installments. This was done with great skill, being that there were so many scenes changes, whether suddenly or as a dissolution. The appearance of an ever episode looks as smooth as if it were one film project. Writing a spoken word to accompany this best realistic movie was equally amazing and unique. Highly polished and meaningful eloquence wastes no word and sometimes even underestimates the description of the action, rather than exaggeration. The story goes to Mr. Ralph Graves, who was a talented actor of stage, film, radio and television. Certainly he has earned the degree of immortality with his golden toned expression of written episode descriptions. Finally, VICTORY AT SEA enjoys the luxury of having an original score, both the opening theme and the random music. Broadway Fame Richard Rodgers (Rodgers & Hart, Rodgers & Hammerstein) His compositions are complex, full, variable and even "classic" in the true sense of the word. The classic arrangement was played by Robert Russell Bennett's NBC Sympphony Orchestra and has been available and in demand since its first release, 55 years ago, as a sound recording / cassette tape / compact disc! And a really small miracle because it's a musical score that fascinates the viewer / listener. It really gives the icing to this cake. <br /> <br /> * SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL, VALIANT Flight also had a beautiful and very memorable original score. This was also composed by Mr. Rodgers. <br /> <br /> ** We had in our house at Ace in Hole in the person of our Father, late Klement J. Ryan (1914-74). The father was during the war in the US where he was put into operation in 1943 or on '44. Our Pop has always been on hand to explain and further clarify any situation that has been portrayed in the series. He and our mother now 90 years old Bertha (nee Fuerst) Ryan already had my older sister, Joanne (1942-90) addicted.
