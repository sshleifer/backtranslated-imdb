WHAT AWESOME FILM !!!!!!!! I stepped out of the theater and stunned. The movie I just saw was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I had eyes stuck to the screen. It is very symbolic, visually fresh, beautifully shot and beautifully narrated. It's basically about two people who move to the apartment and live side by side, where there are partners who are supposed to share with other partners. Suppose our two heroes act according to what their partners think. There is an obvious suppression of feelings for yourself, using vouryistic camera work, body language, and staircase symbollic. It's a visual feast and I hardly like it. Some of the story is a little confusing, but it's nothing. The end is one of the most beautiful (and anti-Hollywood) endings I've ever seen in my life, and visually amazing. Movies haunted scores add mood. I highly recommend this film to anyone who has an open mind and respect. What a great movie.
