Babette's feast, for me, is about healing: repairing the split between spirit and body in orthodox Christianity. This Puritan community in remote Denmark lacks adequate recognition of all God's gifts in creation. They took Saint Paul's dualism to extremes and emphasized the life of "spirit", not the life of "body". Both older sisters, in their youth, were frightened by the love of love and the temptation of life outside their simple village. They, and their parishioners, cling to the narrow biblical interpretation of their former sister and sister father. The aging corps has become irritable and quarrelsome, and sisters don't know what to do. Enter Babette, a French foreigner and someone they can show you a favor. They have no way to know that they will eventually return their kindness and give fertile soil their dry, dusty theology. Babette gives everything she has and in this process teaches her sisters and their flock about grace, sacrifice, how the sensory experience (as in bread and the Eucharist wine) can change lives and why the true artistic movement moves us so deeply. When they can forgive each other and themselves, they can focus on the love of God that will unfold before them in the present. As a minister and artist I cannot recommend the film. True art and true grace!
