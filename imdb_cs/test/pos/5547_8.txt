Time does extraordinary things. He's the ultimate judge. Time gave "Married To The Mob" more freshness. There are no dead moments or cheap shots. Now it's more than a pleasure. Michelle Pfeiffer creates a mafia widow that is as far away from the cartoon as anything she has ever done. The real original creature touching the stereotype that leads us, but her Angela is completely unique. Stockwell's legendary dean demonstrates to me a mafia boss that he's as menacingly real as he's cheerful. And Matthew Modine? Why then did I think he had no chemistry with Pfeiffer? I was wrong. They are beautiful together. This time, they reminded me that Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray of "Remember the Night" is writing this comment to lure you to visit or visit this Jonathan Demme gem.
