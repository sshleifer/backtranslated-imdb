This is a really jolly movie and one I've seen many times. Drew Barrymore is great as Josie Geller as well as her brother David Arquette. When you think of going back to high school, you will be embarrassed because the film is a reminder of what high school really liked! Her clothes are crazy and weird, bringing back the memories of those who dressed a little differently! Wonderful Michael Vartan was adorable as a teacher (wishing teachers were there when I was in high school!) And Josie's boss is fantastic. This is a movie you can watch over and over again, with an amazing soundtrack! One for all those in school in the 90s to watch!
