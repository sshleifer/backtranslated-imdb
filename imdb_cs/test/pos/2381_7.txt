One of the few cartoons of Scooby Doo, "Scooby Doo and Loch Ness Monster," turns out to be a fun, exciting, interesting, fun, and surprisingly good interpretation of the Highlands. One of the unpleasant aspects of the film are the voices of many characters - unfortunately, the Americans who are trying to make a Scottish sound in this movie will not do so well (although some people do better Scottish accents than others). Daphne came to the Highlands to see her cousin Shannon and Highland play at Blake Castle. Gravely Shannon tells the gang she believes she saw Loch Ness Monster. When more chaos arises, Mystery Inc Gang has more secrets on its hands ... <br /> <br /> Good for Scooby Doo fans and for people who want to learn more about Scotland! Enjoy "Scooby Doo and Loch Ness Monster"! :-)
