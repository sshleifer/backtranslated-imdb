This film tells of the real life story of Ramon Sampedr who lived for 27 years while lying in bed after breaking his neck and struggling to get a legal license for someone who can help him with his death. Javier Bardem is one of the best actors of his generation. Let's think that this film has to bear only with the face! Unbelievable he didn't even get an Oscar. Now we can all see that the academy is a joke! The support cast was amazing! Optimistic Rosa, his lawyer Julia, the rest of the family ... Everyone has their own opinion that Ramon wants to die. Whether you are for or against euthanasia, put your views aside because this film deserves to be seen by people around the world! In the middle of the movie, I started crying and didn't stop until the credits came back. This movie is so heartbreaking, but it's also amazing to watch and I can't wait to see it again. I give it 9/10, and in my opinion it is by far the best film of the year.
