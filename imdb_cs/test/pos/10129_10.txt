Radio is a true story about a man who did what he felt in his heart, it was right. The viewer will be forced to think about what he would do. The hostility that coach Jones and Radio faced was both tragic and predictable. People did not understand it; nor did they want to understand. Eventually, however, the force of circumstances forced people to understand and appreciate much more than before. Radio is a youth with intellectual disabilities that understands very little, except the three most important things that are too often forgotten as we are adults: Intuition, compassion and love. Coach Jones is a high school teacher who can't ignore the tricky situation of a cheater trying to play bad card cards in the best way he knows. It was sad how coach Jones and Radio met. The practical joke that frightened Radio's life was enough for you to strictly punish not only the boys, but every boy who knew what was going on and did nothing about it. However, on the positive side of the scale, the incident has led to a friendship that would affect so many lives in the way most of us believe that it is only in films. This movie is a real fairy tale and don't miss it. Ed Harris was his usual brilliance. Gooding was flawless. Radio is an inspiration.
