"Batman Returns" in 1992 was Tim Burton's second round as a director. Again, Gotham City is a place of darkness and grimness with crime and corruption that evolves from every corner of the street. It was also clever to see how Burton used politics as a subplot of it tied in order and slick with the business corruption of entrepreneur Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and a plan to do "Penguin" (Danny DeVito) Mayor of Gotham! Keaton returns as "Batman" / Bruce Wayne and he gives another stellar performance as a strange and torn man who just can't find love in the normal world, yet is attacked when he meets another lonely soul in Selina Kyle. Kyle has a dark secret to her own that is very slinky and she is just downright vamp as a sexy and mysterious but dangerous "Catwoman" (Michelle Pfeiffer). A plan to destroy Gotham is being created between the two villains, and most of them want to get rid of the bat. Really this movie, though violent and somewhat rude with many penguin scenes is clearly an exciting thrill ride from start to finish because you will never find a boring moment and thumbs up on Tim again for his exploration of the characters as dark and contrary to it just made the movie even more interesting . The performance of Michelle Pfeiffer was the best ever because no one could play "The Catwoman", nothing better and Devito was perfect because "Penguin" his body frame fit into the character just to improve his performance, though ghoulish was fun to watch. "Batman Returns" is an entertaining exciting ride that you can't take out of view as a spectator that you will enjoy many times, it's exciting and explosive.
