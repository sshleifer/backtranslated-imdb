This is glaringly funny (well when Bruce is in the hospital scene, which is a bit sad). Ted Raimi and Stacy Keach are excellent and worth watching. Sure, it's not a big budget-driven blockbuster, but it's all that promises to be and will be more - and BTW- women are beautiful in their parts, even though I don't know them from other movies, I'd see them again. The two-brainstroke scene is inspired and sure to showcase for the great physical comedy Bruce - he's one wonderful guy! Thanks to Bruce, for your brain, this is your baby!
