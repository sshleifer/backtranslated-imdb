It could be a section that says it's a tough Carlin fan, but the material, both written and performed, is the best late-time material in It Bad for Ya. At the age of 70, Carlin bounces off the level of despair (and some stumbling in the act itself) from life that is worth losing to a special structure that is tightly structured but free and playful - just like "old f ***" . can - and is constantly, continuously, funny. And funny as they recall what some of us did for the first time watching Back in Town or 'Disease'. The material, even though it sounded occasionally earlier than it used to be (ie, the whole piece on children in school and camp, such as the child segment in the Sick), is always fresh and with such a stab of truth to everything that haunts the mind. while (here goes) tickling funny bones. We go from the theme of death (how long to wait to scratch the name from a book? six weeks if on a computer planner), aspects of communication, looking down from the sky, spots of God (naturally), children, and just Annoying gestures involving hats in religion and, if people really have "rights," make up most of the special, centered around the assumption that what is bad for you, plain and simple, is BS. A total, complete BS, which, as we have also learned (or if you really learned that you are like a boy waiting in a street corner for a week after a fall that is not quite a parent), holds the earth together. Carlin is not necessarily angry, though the contempt seems to have emerged on most turns, even to see how frightening child teeth look. It is skepticism tinged with the feeling that everything will not be "right". What it is, it is: Carlin is a dirty, witty, warning stand-up comedy, what Yoda is Jedis everywhere, a small spark of hope through crystal clear wisdom in a world where it's pretty damn hard to get. At the very least, we get the classic GC - outrageous lines and bits of the 13th (or 14th) special comedy, including eyebrows on people playing Mozart's music during birth!
