The best kid boy movie I've ever watched saved "Free Enterprise". In some ways, it reminded me of Kevin Smith's movie. Role playing, this movie will probably make you laugh often at its insatiable fun. Don't expect a big budget here, acting is sometimes controversial, but it really contributes to the fun of the atmosphere they create. The script is really funny with many witty moments worth experiencing. Bard, who always killed himself, rolled me. The sexually confused player also amused me a little. But in the end ... It was just a great movie that showed some better moments in the lives of several geeks who enjoyed playing roles. Playing, it will do nicely for distraction. Really unexpected treatment.
