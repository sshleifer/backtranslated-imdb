In a movie comedy, there is a running thread that all great comics just aren't enough for the law or the way to jail. Think about conman's conman W.C.Fields in OTHER FASHION METHOD, or Marx's brothers at NIGHT ON OPERA, or Chaplin at ADVENTURER, Mae West at SHE DONE HIM WRONG. The circuit of the law is inevitable, and when it ends on the side of the law, the results are in fact still hostile between the forces of law and order and comics. Think about Lloyd in his first talkie, WELCOME DANGER, trying to "help" the San Francisco Police Department amid a criminal wave, and Police Sergeant Edgar Kennedy wants to kill him. Think about Laurel and Hardy as unfortunate cops at MIDNIGHT PATROL. I have found that this type of hostility is so patented in all the giants' comedies (and their peers) that it is also dealt with in a fake movie title. Think about Jerry Seinfeld in one episode of his series, which creates three Stoogs short, SAPPY PAPPIES, where the boys ended up being killed for murder. Buster Keaton often pulls the forces of law and order to be his opponents in his comedies. Check out STEAMBOAT BILL, JR., Where he tries his spring calaboose in spring. In fact, he had more conflicts with his police forces in his shorts. In CONVICT 13 he is pulled back into jail when mistaken for a fugitive convict. In COPS (the perfect name - if you see that you understand it), the big city police forces are repeatedly looking for Keaton, mistaken for a terrorist. And in KOCH, most of the film can't be avoided by the police. Keaton is a hiker looking for food. But he's totally unhappy. Seeing a stranger, he throws a happy horseshoe over his shoulder (which Keaton had previously ignored) and then finds a wallet full of money, Keaton tries the same thing and hits the cop in the head. The cop gives chase, and Keaton (how lucky he should) runs into another cop, tries to act normally, but ends up throwing a second cop in the first. Soon three cops chase him. He briefly shakes them and walks by the window in a local prison where he is photographed by a local killer "Dead Shot Dan" (Malcolm St. Clair *). When Keaton was driving through the back windows, he was stupid enough to stop and look right inside. When Dead Shot escapes to the police, it is Keaton's face on all the wanted posters. (* St Clair would eventually be a successful director of silent and early audio comedies, though in his later biography Stint would be in the 20th century Fox, where his work with Laurel & Hardy was under par.) Keaton flees to another city by train (disconnects passenger cars containing his pursuers from the locomotive and tender). This is a movie (by the way) that has two famous Keaton jokes. His arrival on the locomotive is carried out in a distant shot, approaching and approaching, and suddenly the viewers will see Keaton sitting on a cowboy. The second famous succession goes later (and perhaps influenced Chaplin somewhat at the beginning of the CITY LIGHTS). Keaton accidentally set off a man who was too violently arguing with a pretty woman with a dog (Virginia Fox). Seeing the mailbox calling him a killer, he thinks he killed the man. This city is being haunted by a suspicious Chief of Police (Joe Roberts) and is currently losing Roberts in the park. A statue of "Man-of-War" is built and the sculptor reveals the clay model of the horse. Keaton is seen sitting on a clay model, attempting to maintain his dignity as the horse's clay legs begin to collapse under his weight. Keaton manages to meet Mrs. Fox, who invites him home for dinner. She just doesn't realize that her father is Roberts. The last five minutes of the film deal, Keaton, is fleeing and avoiding Roberts while he and Fox are running away. It's a funny comedy and a great example of Keaton's work at his best.
