This is my favorite love story that has every element that should have a good love story. Poetry, jazz, friendship of ups and downs in relationships. Finally, a film that shows the positive aspects of the black community. Larenz Tate was great I can't imagine anyone else playing Darius. He gave the poem he wrote himself and meant every word. I own this movie and if I had the time I would watch it every day to make myself feel better and what a good movie should do. Also, the character of Savon could not better deal with the topic of marriage. We would all like to find Darius outside, but most of us just contented with looking at this movie. My vote is 10/10
