I just want to comment on the woman mentioned above that Beethoven is pushing for begging. At the beginning it shows credits. Thank you. I think it's an amazing movie. They chose the right music for the mood of the movie, the animation is amazing and they chose the characters for the characters very well. They teach children never to give up and always have hope. Princess Annika does not give up and shows children that they can do the same. The film also has humor in for all ages, parents and kids, laughing. The colors in this movie are great, and kids can really feel good while they watch it. I watched this movie for the first time, now I'm a huge fan and I'm sure your baby will be too. Walmart sells a lot of Barbie and Magic of Pegasus stuff, so your child can continue to watch the movie even if they don't. Thank you!
