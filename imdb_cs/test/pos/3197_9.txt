Awww, I love it! The Cat and Moon story doesn't really need synopsis as it is ... a cat chasing the moon, a Spanish poem. It's an art that is interesting. In fact, it was this short animated film called Fan and the Flower, which was the winner of the Academy last year (2005) ... yeah, almost the same, which leads me to believe that it can only be a rip. But it's really good short, with sharp black and white shapes that move and move into beautiful movement and poetic seduction ... If you think cats are poetry in motion, you'll see it and you will believe it more. It also has such a moving end. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
