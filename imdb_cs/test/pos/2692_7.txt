I need help in identifying King Queens's episode. It starts with a scene where Doug talks to Carrie on the phone, and suggests that they agree to stop all conversations with "I Love You". But it is difficult to do it and he will call her back just to get closer to "I love you." It's a very clever moment, and I think he says a lot about relationships that last a long time. I THINK (but I'm sure) it's the same episode where Doug gets some local building boys to whistle and throw lurid comments on Carrie to go on ghosts. I recently saw this episode, but it was probably a repetition. I don't know what network I've seen. Can anyone tell me the title and season of this episode?
