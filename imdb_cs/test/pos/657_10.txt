I first saw this film in 1980 and touched a line that reminded me of more innocent time. Norman Rockwell's opening story, music and paintings gave me the tone. Either you love the movie or you hate it. Jan Michael Vincent was the best ever and portrayed Cpl Marion Hedgepeth in the most innocent and moving way. This movie is on top of my favorite times, a pity that isn't available on DVD or VHS anymore. The end was also amazing. John Hancock did an amazing job of capturing the essence of time.
