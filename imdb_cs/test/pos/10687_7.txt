This is the question astronauts Roy Thinnes and Ian Hendry ask when they discover the parallel world of Earth, which is always hidden on the opposite side of the sun in this cult sci-fi drama from 1969, published here in America as THE WAY TO FAR SIDE SUNSET. The storyline was designed by British writers Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, creators of such TV shows as "UFO", "Thunderbirds" and "Space 1999". It is extremely strange at times to betray the influence of the "twilight zone" and even Stanley Kubrick's 2001 classic: ODYSSEY Space. Surprisingly, the visual effects of Derek Meddings, who would later also work on SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE, stand well in the last three decades of special effects development; And while they are not really on the same lofty level of Kubrick film, they are very excellent. If you do not expect a STAR WARS movie and you can overcome the occasional dialogue, DOPPELGANGER is a good movie; it was good enough when I put it at 7 and considered it an undiscovered sci-fi gem.
