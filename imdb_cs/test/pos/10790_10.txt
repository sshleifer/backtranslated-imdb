I never knew what to expect from this film before I saw Oliver Stone's movie or Erik Bogosian's movies. After a while I was playing with the idea of ​​buying it, I finally got it as a supplement to the Sunday newspaper for free and I was overwhelmed. It tells the story of Barry Champlain's spokesman for a host who can be incredibly rude to his callers, often putting them in place before realizing what's going on. Although this is what made him a popular radio host show, it also gained him numerous enemies. Acting in this film was extremely impressive with not one bagpipe actor in it. Eric Bogosian is brilliant as Barry Champlain, a disturbed spokesman for a radio host with Alec Baldwin who has turned in strong performance as Barry's boss, Dan. It also features a voice, and a portrait appearance, Michael Wincott (my reason for wanting to see this). The story was really well written as, despite its arrogance, you feel for Barry how more about his troubled life is revealed and you see how vulnerable he really is. I would recommend this movie to anyone because it is charming, and more importantly, on many levels, two of which have been inspired by the life of a real host of conversation and the fact that you are actually receiving a host of radio and callers such as those that actually appear in the film. <br /> <br /> High Recommendations and 10/10.
