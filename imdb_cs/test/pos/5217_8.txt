In this role, he is very good as a disgruntled and bored husband, a decorated aviation officer who is bored with his predictable suburban life and decides to radically change. One evening he meets Karen Sillas, an attractive younger woman than his current wife. Relationships are developing and Cole decides to take it to the next level. Not only does he have an affair but also his death to escape his family duties. Lies are becoming more and more a model when it starts robbing banks to keep their new wife (Sillas) happy and project the image of being successful. Fictional illusion, apparently. It was also based on a true story that makes it all more interesting. Cole is believable and excellent in these roles. Recommended. 8/10.
