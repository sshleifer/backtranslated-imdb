Very few reviews I could find online Barnens ö really do not do justice. I read them all before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I ordered it anyway. I almost regretted it almost immediately, but the order had already passed, so I couldn't cancel it. I'm very glad I couldn't. It's an extraordinary movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give an overview of the plot because other reviewers have already done so. But I will say that I do not understand the remarks that it is bleak, shocking, strange, clinical, depressive or pornographic. It is certainly very unusual, which I think may be special for some people, but other critics must reflect the reviewers' own questions because I haven't seen them in the movie I was watching. I'm not attracted to boys, so nudity doesn't seem pornographic at all - it's just a child trying to figure out who's free from the irresponsible adults in his life. And it's Sweden, not Utah, so topless women are no big deal. But what surprised me most is how positive the film is in his portrayal of this gutsy lost boy who goes to some sort of Odyssey through all sorts of strange experiences they seek - and finally find - himself. It's fascinating, thoroughly original and deeply satisfying. I'm not surprised at all that Barnens ö won three major Guldbagge awards, for best film, directing and actor, but I am absolutely amazed that the winner who won was not Tomáš Fryk, a boy whose fearless performance Reine must be one of the most remarkable films, but Ingvar Hirdwall in the relatively insignificant role of Stig, the slim friend of Reinina's mother. I don't get it at all, but nothing changes that it's a great movie.
