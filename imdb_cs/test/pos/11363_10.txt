My introduction to Shakespeare's lifelong love. My brother was 5 and I wasn't a total of 7 when WTTW Chicago aired the Age of Kings. It became a family ritual he watched, including repetition. As an autumn series, my father bought us a rare treat for the Midwest - pomegranates; and mummy drank corn on the stove. Wonderful playing of actors whose names meant nothing to me then (though I will never forget the pain of a young Sean Connery as Hotspur), but now! And they published scripts in a paperback book so we could follow and find out the language. I managed to remember most of Richard III. So glad it comes out on DVD! Highly recommended for all ages and any level of familiarity with Shakespeare's history or English.
