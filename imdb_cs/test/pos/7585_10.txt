Horses on Mars are a wonderful way to be taken by very small creatures. They don't have to work hard to focus your attention and the characters are really unforgettable. Most credits have to go to Eric Anderson for his choice of visual style and for writing an interesting story, but the merit of Anuj Majumdar also deserves a narrative and wonderful musical score. Of course, these elections were no coincidence. If you can, check out the 35mm range for the greatest impact. It's a pretty beautiful movie!
