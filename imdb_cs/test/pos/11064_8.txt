I have to admit that I am prejudiced about my vote on this movie, but I have strong reasons because I know some of the true history that has been provided by Hollywood treatment. Edna Ferber is a novel on which this is based is from an era where real names cannot be used. In a way, this film is all smoke and mirrors. Although it was released in 1946, it was filmed shortly after Casablanca. Ingrid Bergman is the most brilliant in this film as a brunette. She plays a beautiful woman trying to trade her beauty to win a rich husband. Today it is a gold digger, but in this social era it is desirable, and the kind of woman who wants it, and all the old snoots of society talk about it and avoid it while they want it to be her. Ingrid is at his best and plays this role well. Some sympathy for the Ingrids character is raised in the New Orleans section of this film when she manages to get a decent late tomb for her scandalized mother to settle her relatives to leave her. Orleans. The Snooty family of relatives there are so scandalized by her that they will do almost anything she asks to leave her city. Gary Cooper is good at this movie, although he seems to be aging a bit to play the spirited Texan Bachelor / Gambler. He will take it well in view of the fact that a handicap that looked older than him was caused by the smoking of his real life. Flora Robison as Ingridina Maid was nominated for an Oscar as an actress in this film. Jerry Austin as Cupidor has been overlooked for his role in many ways, but is the only comic in the movie and doing it well. <br /> <br /> When a movie moves to Saratoga, it shows exactly how important Saratoga was. at the time. I like the succession when Bergman goes to Saratoge Spring to get some "sulfur" water that everyone thought was healthy. When she drinks something, she forces herself not to create and say how good it is and what she must have more. The real history is the rail battle that really happened on the railroad track in the New York Tunnel, which is the real Saratoga Trunk movie title derived from. This battle actually happened in 1869 between the agents of Andrew Carnagie & J. P. Morgan. The line was the economic key to the country in 1869, linking the coal and eastern coasts. Links to him are very realistic throughout the film. There is even some dialogue describing Carnagie as "Scotsman" although the reference is vague and unknown to anyone knows the history of the battle. Tunnel Railroad and Tunnel Railroad, New York (postal code 13848) still exists, although the film was shot in California. The real tunnel is about 1 mile long. It is still part of the key freight line today, years after this occurred. I grew up there. Gary Cooper's line in the movie while he's taking the train to the tunnel is right, he's still a "powerful pretty country".
