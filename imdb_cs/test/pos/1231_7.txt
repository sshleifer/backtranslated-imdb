Travis (James Franco) is a young man who rides a train for business reasons (we expect), leaving behind his beloved phone. She is picked up by a prostitute, Terri (Rachel Miner), and when she goes to her city to pick it up, there will be a series of events that will stay with him forever. <br /> <br /> Both characters have barriers they have to defend themselves against communication. But despite their facades, it is clear that they are both willing to destroy them. In total there are about 30 or so spoken lines, but from the way James Franco and Rachel Miner use their faces, you can also turn off the volume, words are unnecessary. The scene to watch for is Terri wearing herself in the mirror. You can just feel her despair penetrate into the room. But the film is not perfect. Mostly it is shooting with handheld cameras, which disturb the attention. Especially due to the acting of Mr. Franco and Miner and photography, the shortcomings of the script do not stand out so much. Sometimes it seems that the story doesn't really know where it wants to go. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a type of movie that will really stay with you long after you've watched it. One hour after you've seen it, you're still "what-if" to stand up to certain characters. It's not flawless, but you still want more, wishing they were at least four times long.
