Well, maybe the movie isn't a revolution. But it's a very good piece of fun, and that's Liv Tyler's variation of Alicia Silverstone's "Clueless" or Cameron Diaz "" There's Something About Mary ". <br /> <br /> Liv is playing a femme fatale he just wants to have He owns a house and all kinds of material comfort in it, and he does everything he can to do it ... even crimes, many crimes, and dropping any friend who doesn't work to get these things. lover next to her current friend. This movie is even more fun to watch if one knows Liv is actually a zodiacal cancer sign - and cancer is reported to be very domestic. in fact, when I watched this movie, I was alone in the cinema, which was quite comfortable because I could laugh so loudly as I wished all the time - but It was strange as if no one about this the movie wasn't really interested? <br /> <br /> I liked it very much, acting was among the very good to excellent, especially the main actors who were brilliant. Where there are enough jokes, many black types and good dialogues. This is a garbage movie and is full of black humor. If you like this kind of movies, try this one!
