This must be one of Australia's best productions. I totally disagree with the comments that RamiNour101 wrote. This series shows the depth of an Australian friend and the length they helped each other. Episode Five 'Eddies Birthday' is a great example of this and really captures the Australian spirit. The music used throughout the series just emphasized the men's struggle, longing for home and their loved ones. Numerous fun portrayals of The Road to Gundagai captures the spirit of men and the fact that they have never forgotten about home and that they were small elements like singing a song that took them home for a short while. As for the comment that it's racist against the Japanese people, the only thing to say is that you can't change what happened. The Japanese considered the Australians very bad at Changi and represented it because otherwise it would be very misleading. The exact commentary on the script is also false. These six stories told in the series consist of real P.O.W. The actors were excellent; the best is, in my opinion, Matthew Newton. His performance as David in the first episode was clear. From being a city boy, to being another nameless face to his prisoners. We see him change dramatically in the first episode due to his violent attack in the jungle, and in other episodes we can see how one event has changed him, he is more aware of what is happening and is always one of the first. to help other members of The Secret Nine. Stephen Curry also deserves mention. His performance at Eddie's birthday is amazing, going from family to sick, weak and unable to take care of himself. Performing mateship in this episode will touch you on an emotional level and make you proud of being an Australian. I study WWII at university level, and this series, if not physically true, spiritually true, captures the true spirit of what it was to be an Australian soldier. Good work for John Doyle to capture Changi's spirit.
