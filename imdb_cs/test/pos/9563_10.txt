I recently saw this movie for the first time. I liked it so much that I went straight out and bought a DVD. This film is a pure genius and becomes more enjoyable with every viewing. Everyone can write jokes or funny dialogue and have actors remember them, but the basis of this movie is to improve them! How do they do it? Thank you, Christopher Guest!
