I was pleased to find that at least now this film is getting the recognition it deserves (just look at these voices). It's not a first-class event like "Die Hard" or "Lethal Weapon", but still something like a solid 7 out of 10: subtle script, good actors with working chemistry, and a director who knows what he wants "Deep Blue Sea" managed to achieve "OK rollercoaster-ride" status, but "Cutthroat Island, and especially" Driven "are deserved flops!) Personally, I think the turn-off at the box office could be" Woman Like an Action Star " - Well, give her a chance because Davis has a performance higher than par. "- Outside, but instead of a good event", Buddyism (Jackson as a sidekick is given a lot of space here, plus his share of the event - and about a thousand wisecracks killers! ) and on the property (by Shane Black, writer "Lethal Weapon" and "The Last Boy Scout", which as a film is on many levels like this ... theme, clever storyline, so well and underestimated!) Overall: if you haven't noticed yet, don't forget to rent it for another quiet Saturday night!
