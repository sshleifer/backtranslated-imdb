Every show is excellent. Finally, a show about something other than why it sucks to be married or good looking people talk about why they are like normal people. Too bad it was canceled. Mike Scully and Julie Thacker, formerly The Simpsons, have written or created some of the funniest episodes of this series and a lot of humor. Take Officer Steve Cox and think about Troy McClure. However, it comes with its own unique brand of humor and let's admit it, a teenage girl will love just by putting on her cheeks alone. What is it about a TV that cancels most of the good shows and we are a spoon-feeding with such abominations as Who's Mother Almost Slept With or What the Show Is Called? Learn the lesson. Not everything must be about loveliness or a romantic journey, or, above all, about reality that shows how to demystify every aspect of life. Some people actually like to laugh and not think about it later. Well, my grip is going on all day. Now back to the Simpsons. When is it? Oh yes! Throughout.
