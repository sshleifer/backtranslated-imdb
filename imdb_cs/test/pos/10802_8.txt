Many American peacocks worshiping and supporting political truth truths hucksters like Michael Moore would be able to sit in this film more than once to find out how hypnotic manipulators can scare, intimidate, and lie underinformed to get people, fear or hatred killed, beaten and crippled. In this beautiful epic, Robespierre kills the opposition by remote control, all in accordance with just devotion to his principles. We get the impression that Robes felt it was quite justified to cut off his opponent's heads, even if he sent his ministers to win over false and misleading charges against the state. Today, the captains of our rotting media institutions are much more sensitive than Robes ... just murdering your character with allusion and false accusations without bases or resources. Witness Dan Rather's attempts to assassinate W's character on the eve of the 2004 election, or constant drumbeat that the 2000 elections were stolen, though constitutional scholars continue to deride at such an irresponsible drivel.
