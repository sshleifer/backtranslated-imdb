This is an exceptional picture with so much to recommend. Playing and writing are amazing and there are plenty of big twists on the plot. Like the French film "Noir", his language is certainly much more earthly than his American counterparts, but for me it just added to realism. Moreover, I liked how not all were charming - especially husband and lieutenant. The only negative, and the reason why the film gets 9 and not 10, is that there was a glaring plot hole. Just like the other famous French film, Dr√¥le de Drame, the confusion between the cops and the accused could have been easily resolved at first, but the characters decided stupidly. To do this, just suspend distrust and watch - the reward is well worth the wait. That's just one of the best French movies I've ever seen. Time.
