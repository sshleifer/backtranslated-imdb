It's all about what you want when you want it. Bluebeard's Eighth WIfe's message is to keep an eye on what you want, except for what you wish for. Most men have heard stories of what happens when your sexual frustration escapes and some of your anatomy goes blue. We refused misogynist pirates, Cooper plays a very wealthy man who is very used to what he wants whenever he wants to, because he learns too late that it's not what he was expecting and never learned his lesson until he escapes into the wild Claudette Colbert. Through a twisted (in soul and in practice) business deal, he ends up marring / buying her with the intention of litter her, but she will have none of it (literally) and frustrates him at every turn, and corner, and room, and tourist attraction. The film has some French feelings, which means it has strong double-submitters and boudoir humor for the day and sharp edges you are not used to (and may not enjoy seeing) in either Cooper or Colbert. The whole reason I watched the movie was that they were "likeable" actors, and this whole movie is that they're clumsy, or at least sympathetic, who have developed incomprehensible features to protect themselves, they think, world. <br /> <br /> If you can accept it on your own terms, you will be satisfied with this witty and sophisticated film ... and satisfaction, as we said, is what it is all about. Such a film with such a cast comes around, after all, once a month ... blue moon.
