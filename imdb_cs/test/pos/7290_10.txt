"Here On Earth" is a surprisingly beautiful romantic story about Samantha that has both boy and health problems. As her love for her current friend, Jasper, disappears, her love for Kelley's flowers is like a new spring flower. <br /> <br /> I found this movie very moving, very warm, very romantic and touching. I enjoyed every bit of this movie ... and it's pretty rare! I highly recommend this movie to all movie lovers! This is one movie you don't want to miss !!! : D <br /> <br /> By the way ... if you're a very sentimental person who cries easily while watching movies, INTRODUCE WOVEN !!! On the other hand, it was a really good movie !!! Very romantic ... and surprisingly good !!! : D <br /> <br />
