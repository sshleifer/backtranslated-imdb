It is not difficult to comment separately on the three parts of the Kieslowski trilogy, it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do the opposite: they were looking at them in a good way, in blue, white and red, and considered them together as one complete work. . It is true that these are different stories with different themes: freedom, equality, brotherhood, and each of them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and art. Each of them is worth seeing independently, but I believe they are best viewed as one job. Together, I would evaluate the trilogy as 9; separately I placed everyone in my top ten for the years 1993 and 1994. <br /> <br /> The color red is the most memorable in the third movie as a background in billboard advertising, whose profile is the central of the three main characters of the film. The next two figures make double-take different degrees of recognition when they first come to commercial, posted larger than life along a busy city junction. This ad is not an essential part of this film's conspiracy, but its image becomes remarkable and is one of the reasons I called Red a film that bends the mind. This is the third of the trilogy of Kieslowski's trio of colors, based on the blue-white-red French flag and three parts of his motto "Freedom, Equality, Fraternity". Films remain primarily focused on these themes, adhere to the basic levels of one, two or three main characters, but with each film the complexity of the plot escalates because three principles move from fundamentally personal (Liberty, Blue) to relational (Equality). , White) to social (brotherhood, red). Red is my favorite of these movies, and I'm giving her 9. It's like a great movie in itself, but one should see Blue and White first to make it full.
