Working as a center between "Waiting for Guffman" and "The Mighty Wind", "Best in Show" shows an exhibition of dogs and various people who bring their dog friends to attend. Some of them are weird, crazy and different, but they all make the film good. Director Christopher Guest is especially entertaining as gay Harlan Pepper, who is very keen to promote his dog. Eugene Levy, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Catherine O'Hara and Bob Balaban are also doing great jobs (I can't imagine they wouldn't do a great job, at least not in Christopher Guest). As someone who has never participated in an exhibition, it is my main speech. They certainly look elegant.
