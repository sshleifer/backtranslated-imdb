Considered by many people as strangely overlooked by Chabrol, it seems to me that the reason he was cold is his sleaze factor. Not so obviously sexy, violent or bloody, like many movies from that period, it starts rather surprisingly, and while it is increasingly measured, it still emits a rather unpleasant smell. Mrs. Audran, not an ice girl, but a drunken mother, Donald Pleasence makes a portrait as a child harassment, David Hemmings has her eyes on the underage sex and the central theme includes the relationship between brother, sister and niece. Not very nice at all, and Chabrol treats it as if it were very normal (like it could be in a small French village!) Ed McBain's New York City. If it was done sensationally, then it would be a more acceptable but smaller film. Here we really have to choose between the probability of various unpleasant possibilities before the final denouement. Very observable
