Once upon a time, Troma, the company that brought us cinema classics such as: Toxic Avenger, Rabid Grannies, Poultrygeist, Redneck Zombies and Surf Nazis Must Die, has long since decided to adapt Shakespeare's famous play "Romeo and Juliet". This adaptation decided to spice up the story by adding eccentric sex, extreme violence, genital monsters, body piercings and incest and it managed to create a bizarre yet jolly movie. Anyone who goes to Troma's production should know what to expect, and this is an incredible and perverted comedy with plenty of political misstatement. Expect a lot of nods for the next Troma movies and lots of reused gags (crappy cars and heads). Many may think that it sounds like a total crap that just witty to find funny ... they may be right, but at the same time they may need to shine and enjoy the madness and insensitivity of the mind, which is Tromeo and Juliet. > <br /> With great cast, witty screenplay (James Gunn and Lloyd Kaufman), great soundtrack and lots of great visual gags, Kaufman has once again managed to turn what's right upside down and grossing to hell. each. Get popcorn, grab a beer, invite your friends and enjoy Tromeo and Juliet for what it is, Shakespeare's adaptation with plenty of balls. End. <br /> <br/> 4/5
