I'd like to know if anyone knows how I can get a copy of the movie "It's the Way of the World". It's been 30 years since I saw this movie, and I'd like to see it again. Earth wind and fire transcend the nation globally with its inspiring music and themes. It was unfortunate that this group did not take off as their counterparts in the early 1970s, but racial tensions existed in the United States, which banned a balanced exposure of African American music bands. It's good to see Earth Wind & Fire continue to succeed. I want to add this movie to my collection. Somebody please if possible. Thanks for your attention. Milton Shaw
