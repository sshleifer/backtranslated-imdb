In Victorian times, a father is separated from his family when he is falsely accused of treason and sent to live in the country. Children adapt to their new situation, make friends and get help from someone on the train to help unite their family. <br /> <br /> Actors who direct movies directly are often not very good. it. Jeffries, a great veteran actor of dozens of British classic comedies, is one of the few exceptions. His brilliant conception (also written by E. Nesbit's novel) of the classic story of British children is what this film provokes in art. While the story can be a very idealized, gorgeous performance, and the wonderfully evocative setting of the Yorkshire Dales combine together a truly memorable movie. The photo by Arthur Ibbetson is a definition of good filmmaking - it is nothing that is wasted in telling a story, but at the same time it combines images to create a beautifully romantic atmosphere. Agutter is just perfect as a kind Bobbie (all right, I fell in love with her at an early age, but I resist anyone who disagrees) and Cribbins, whose comic family tree is on the same level as Jeffries, is as memorable as Perks the humble but proud railway porter. It's a movie that's out of time; A romantic, charming, immensely pleasant and beautifully naive sense of kindness towards all.
