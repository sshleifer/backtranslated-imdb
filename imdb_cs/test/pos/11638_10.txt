From start to finish, it seems that this classic twentieth reel from 1926 from Hal Roach Studios sums up what was fun about the 1920s. It is now a forgotten comic genius, Charley Chase and was directed by legendary Leo McCarey, who was unknown then but would capitalize on his retention with Roach and graduate from greener pastures in the 30s and 40s. Recently released on video and disc, this is one of the ten best examples of silent screen comedy and should be seen by viewers of all ages. Although today his star has practically shrunk, Charley Chase was considered the leader in the short subject comedy field in the waning years of silence. He helped the career of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy before they were joined as a team, by Leo McCarey and a number of other talents. It's a pity he remembers them today. Check out this little movie gem. Once you do this, you'll find more movies from this classic comic. He had a hand in more than 300 movies and many of them survived. Rediscover this lost giant movie from a past era and its giant star.
