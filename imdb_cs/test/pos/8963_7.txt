Recap: Based on the real story of US Congressman Charlie Wilson, who (according to this film) was in the US secret war in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union. Comments: Not so much fun, especially since they were real. Hanks, however, focuses on film and performs very well as a malevolent congressman with a good heart, who becomes a master of the secret war in Afghanistan. Hanks and the whole movie, especially Philip Seymor Hoffman, has a somewhat humorous tone. So much that adding a comedy to the genre would be appropriate. But the story he tells, and perhaps the most serious ending, is really serious. The story of what happened to some questions about what might have been. So the movie works like a comedy if you want one, and a lot more serious if you want. Something for everyone? 7/10
