Boogie Nights is perhaps one of the greatest examples every filmmaker should look at for a long time. Sure, you could spend a lot of good time reviewing the Hitchcock classics on Scorsese; but let them watch the suit for the modern generation and study half heartily. Where to start, I suppose one could look at the film as a mere story, maybe even a docudrama that focuses on the late 1970s. - And what an industry it was! The other half could focus on the incredible detail one filmmaker can only achieve with the help of polyester and rubber. But honestly, Boogie Nights brings clean, non-bul! Shi $, in the face of your cinematography, which I didn't experience from the movie giants of the 1970s ... irony ... or genius. The story is full of richly detailed characters, all of which may involve love, hate; but the impact is clear - you feel something for them. Among the characters who perform, include: Burt Reynolds as director Jack Horner and Mark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams / Dirk Diggler. Julianne Moore is as brilliant as Heather Graham ... but if I focus on one actor, it would be John C. Reilly. John's performance is the perfect balance of comedy timing and character-driven emotions ... I'm crazy about the "I've seen Star Wars movie? ... People say I look like Han Solo." In any case, the film's appearance is incredible, the director of photography and the director / writer / producer have come up with a pulsating color and opulent style that compared to Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick (in terms of his perfection in his craft)); but with creating your own unique look and moving the edge with the longest one shot I've ever seen ... it's a New Year's party sequence. Music, as in any big movie, is its own character. Sometimes it is consumed with grief or sorrow ... but most of all with fun, dance and good time; the spirit of the seventies. OK, back to the show. Burt Reynolds plays the character of Jack Horner, a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of "film" means for his genre. Terrible transition from filming to film to magnetic tape recording. Losing his art as it was ... and changing the mentality to the people he works with. Walhberg adds a perfect blend of innocence and sexual wart for character. For all those who have seen the Burton Planet of the Apes, ignore the Wahlberg show in the movie ... rent the boogie nights and see what difference a good scenario can make! Julianne Moore plays mother for all, and with that comes the sorrow and anxiety she feels when life imitates art; and loses all who are close to her. Heather Graham is an eye candy, but later holds her own, and steals some of the great Mr. Reynolds himself. Each character is multidimensional, rich in life and play that seems to be the perfect picture for the part. The film itself is often witty, tragic, exciting and provides an uncompromising insight into the turban. lifestyle of the quick seventies. He gives no excuses and says no lies; and offers the audience a way back. But more importantly, the film gives us a great example of how films should be made; and a new director whose brave visions bring art to film.
