In the KPAX Softley Brushes on the Subtlety of Eastern Religious Mores from Small Archetypes Embedded Throughout the Film to the Real Purpose of Prot. Spacey (Prot) occupies a predominantly didactic role throughout the film - it is as if the statements it makes embody the general truths about the culture of peace that is strongly proclaimed in Buddhism and Hinduism. It can be said that Prot is the eye of the storm - the world is in disarray and is "clear" and the false veil of reality is what everyone else sees, but Prot sees the truth - sees a minute - and appreciates it and worries about some points when it transcends its social construction of reality and becomes more human. The film is particularly detailed, so I would recommend that you look at it at least twice to see how Softley projects the nuances. Listen carefully to the stories at the beginning and the end because they really touch on concepts that are not commonly presented in Western philosophies. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 reviews - Superb - with nominal space for improvement.
