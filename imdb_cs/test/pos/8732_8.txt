CACTUS FLOWER was a beautiful 1969 comedy based on the play by Neil Simon on the dentist (Walter Matthau), who has an affair with a young single woman (Goldie Hawn), completely unaware that his dedicated sister (Ingrid Bergman) is in love with him. Matthau can play this kind of role in sleep and will not disappoint himself as a treacherous dentist. Julian Winston, who is dating one woman but has no idea that he is in love with another. Goldie Hawn won an Oscar for her brilliant performance as Toni Simmons, an aging child who learns slowly that she is trapped in a dead end issue and is not as weak as she appears on the surface. The real pleasure for me in this film was the performance of legendary Ingrid Bergman as Stephanie Dickinson, a totally devoted assistant to Dr. Winston, who is willing to bury and sacrifice his own happiness while Dr. Winston and Tony satisfied. Bergman is luminous in this movie, looks pretty beautiful (though the camera has always loved her) and shows a quirky talent for a light comedy. Yes, the dialogue and settings are somewhat dated, but the story is timeless and the star performances follow it.
