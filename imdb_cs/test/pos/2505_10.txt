This is one of the better films with a good feeling in 1999 with Kate Capshaw, who leads the star cast of a small town and a love letter. First, the scenery is beautiful, and anyone who sees this movie and does not want to move to this place is crazy! For cast, Capshaw is overwhelming as the main actress who engages the emotional role of roles. Tom Everett Scott is charming as the "author" of notes throughout the film, and always the wonderful Ellen Degeneres is hilarious! Blythe Danner and the actress who plays bookstores are also amazing. Although it was unsuccessful, the film is great because it is short and sweet as well as very romantic. 10/10
