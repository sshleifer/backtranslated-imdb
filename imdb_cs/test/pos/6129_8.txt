Like those who have listened to the radio news of the Pearl Harbor attack, anyone who has ever seen PINK FLAMINGOS can tell you exactly where they were when they first saw him - and thirty years later, the film is still one of the most unpleasant, ugly, unpleasant , a repulsive and cheerful movie that has ever been put into celluloid, is sure to test the strongest stomachs and the toughest funny bones. Recorded with nearly zero budget and some of the most embarrassing cinemas around, PINK FLAMINGOS tells the story of two families competing for the tabloid title "The Weakest People Alive." How dirty can they be? Lots: The film contains everything from sex to chickens to what I can only describe as a remarkable manifestation of rectal control to help doggy doo, and I guarantee that you won't want to eat eggs for at least a few weeks after seeing it. The cast is either gorgeous, appalling or terribly awesome, depending on how you look at it. The star, of course, is divine ... and describe the divine, because the greatest queen on the planet would underestimate the year. She is a mammoth creature that is given BIG eye make-up, BIG orange hair and BIG expressions - it's Charleton Heston's turn, and whether it's almost running down after a running jog to stop in the bathroom on some front lawn or startling real By taking a stroll along the Baltimore sidewalk, the shoppers are unreal and unspeakably entertaining. Others in the cast include Mary Vivian Pearce, Danny Mills, and the ever-scary Edith Massey as members of the God family; and Mink Stole and David Lochary as a white-slave, child-selling couple who question the state of divine. It should be clear that PINK FLAMINGOS is not exactly a movie that will appeal to everyone, and viewers who know director John Waters only through such later films as HAIRSPRAY and CRYBABY will have a great deal wound. But if you want to see something so different that even Monty Python can't imagine it, it's a movie for you. Just make sure you eat before you see it because you probably won't want to eat it later - and you might want to put a barf bag at hand just in case. Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
