For me it's a good series. I'm a little disappointed that Ana Lucia and Libby died, but more angry that Micheal lied to everyone who killed them. And if someone can answer what was that guys name that was supposedly "Henry Gale" he was like the leader of others (or it was Mrs. Clue ??) anyway if you know his name cool. I'm trying to figure out what might happen next time they didn't press the button. It's supposed to mess up the whole thing of DARMA's project, and I personally thought it was okay, how had this key thing in the underground that Desmond used to turn off the magnet thing, yeah and what was the point? I'm just glad they didn't finally press the button, but what happens to the people in the hatch? Like Mr. Echo, John, Charlie and well Desmond probably died, but what about the others? I think they survived, I forgot? Well it's just my little thing to think about this season finale !!!
