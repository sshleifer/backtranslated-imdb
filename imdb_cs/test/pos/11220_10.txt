I loved the movie "Northfork". I didn't know anything about the film before I watched it. Therefore, I had no external influence or information that would lead me to see what I saw on the screen. In retrospect, I would advise anyone interested in the film to look at it if, for reasons other than the quality actors that appear in it. You don't read anything about a plot, story, or movie rating. In fact, stop reading something further in my comments, even though I believe they are general and will not spoil the movie for you, I do not want to reduce the value of the movie to you. Find your own way of meaningfulness in this movie or reduce its potential. In general, I found that 3 kindly strangers in the mysterious Northfolk. As the film develops, they could qualify as three amusing refugees from a psychiatric hospital, or dreams and hallucinations of a sick and feverish young boy, or three angels "sent" to find a "lost angel". A sick and possibly dying boy is working to convince the three "strangers" to abandon the search for a lost angel, become his guardians (mother and father) and drive him safely away from Northfork (not less than 1000 miles). He even claims he is a lost angel to try to manipulate them to be his guardian. Only one in three responds positively to the boy. The other two have no real passion or passion for this engagement. A priest who nurses a sick boy shows the depth of care for people and a deep belief in his faith. It overcomes the waste and emptiness of Northfork and his people; it is the light of good and hope for both Northfork and the viewer of the film. Near the top of the movie, the boy and the new guards are traveling the land to the plane waiting for the plane. They board to find the other two strangers also on the plane; in fact one is a pilot. The engines start and the aircraft starts. Who are the 3 strangers? If only one stranger was interested in helping the boy, why were all three on the plane? Where does the plane go? Did the other two find the "Lost Angel"? Is there a lost angel and if so who is it? Who are the six men dressed as businessmen? If it's all just the fearsome dreams of a sick boy, how one of the three strangers finally reached out to help one of the men dressed as an entrepreneur when he jumped and hit his head (neither the boy nor the aliens met) men)? One or two phrases written under a title that tells people what this movie is about is a tragic mistake (it's not a spoiler, it's just an advertisement statement). So if you haven't seen the movie, Northfork, the above questions show just a few interesting and fun forks on the way of thinking when you see Northfork. If you read the movie summary before you watched it, maybe you should look at some of the questions above and watch it again ... I know I'll do it. Terry
