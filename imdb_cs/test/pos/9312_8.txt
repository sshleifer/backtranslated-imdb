The first time I saw this movie was on a flight between Guangzhou, China and Los Angeles. It was a real scream and made a trip with much less discomfort than a normal 10-hour flight. I tried to find his copy without success until I discovered a copy for sale on eBay. When I watched it twice, I recommend it as a good fun. My only real criticism is that choosing English to translate words for subtitles is a subpar, even a normal norm. The subtitles are also small to small, too often blended into the movie and often travel too fast to read well.
