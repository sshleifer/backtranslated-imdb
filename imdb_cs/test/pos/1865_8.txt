I saw this movie at 19SEP2009 at the Cambridge Film Festival. The Beagle is only in a few short flashes, the whole thing about Darwin's life from 1841 to 1859, when it was set up in Kent with his growing family, more than 200 pages of the original have already been written. and wondering whether to finish the book. The script is based on the book by Randal Keynes Annie's Box (Annie, daughter of Charles, died when she was 10). It is mostly a family drama, but it also includes sex scenes - but the participants are married, both on-screen and off-screen. Not too exciting, not much science, but a well-made film that is nice to watch and push the right emotional buttons. Actually, a little romantic screams. I believe that the conclusion is that you can be an agnostic free-thinking scientist from a family atheistic environment and still be an emotional romantic and excellent father. Some characters and Darwin himself say or wonder if he "killed God" but the viewer is able to doubt. What is undoubtedly, given the deadly struggle for survival and the meadow predation network (well known before Darwin and totally uncontrollable) and the failure of Darwin's prayer is that the thought of a kind, providential god who loves "his creatures are unsustainable. I really can't see many Americans defending themselves against it. Some may have problems with the title, which is probably the most controversial thing about the movie, or with the fact that Bettany doesn't have horns, tails and pitchforks.
