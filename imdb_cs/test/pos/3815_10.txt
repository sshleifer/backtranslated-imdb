It's amazing what you can do with small money. DEAD SILENT is a low-budget film that it promises. Too bad we don't see Rob Lowe more often on the silver screen. Lowe is in the best thriller. No wonder he went from DEAD SILENT directly to the TV mega hit West Wing. <br /> <br /> DEAD SILENT 8 of 10 Sputtosi Toronto.
