I saw the second part of this beautiful period work on the ship sometime in the 19th century. Golding's book must be responsible for some of the excellent dialogues, but everything else was also good! I especially liked the way they created the season and the feeling that they were so good on the ship. For me, it was a sense of completeness that I knew I wouldn't be able to express myself in words ... Maybe it was the way they mixed in the technical and historical details of sailing at eighteen hundred into the story without reading it up. Benedict Cumberbatch was excellent as well as the rest of the cast. It's not often a mini-series will send me to the "zone", but he did this.
