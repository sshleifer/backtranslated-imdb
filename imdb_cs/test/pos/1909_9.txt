Dolemite is amazing. Rudy Ray Moore's rhymin kung fu chimpanzee with horrible choreographic action sequences is about as close as you can get to become a spoof of the genre without actually being a spoof. Citizen Kane does not have to be a Les Infant Au Revoir, but it is undoubtedly a genius in his own right. The production values ​​in this film are so bad that they could qualify as existential special effects. The story goes somewhat longer, but the power of such cheap prerequisites as kung fu hookers is enough to bring all but the most powerful movie lovers. The infamous current mike boom evokes the shades of beautifully incompetent Ed Wood and never becomes unusual. Sometimes I wonder if the mike boom was meant to be a commentary on the ridiculous aspects of movies in general, but I was usually distracted by erotic scenes that lack eroticism to the point of high artistic mundanacity. Everything that this film is alive and breathing drips desperately desiring to be both loved and ugly. It works. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
