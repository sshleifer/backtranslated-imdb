Chan is in New York and is involved in attempting to sabotage the new aircraft design. The war was more than a year away from America, but World War II was raging everywhere else in the world, and so it all turned colored, because most people probably realized that the war was coming. There is no mention of war here, but the fact that the film deals with the production of aircraft at least refers to it. The secret itself is good enough, a somewhat tense moment is well suited to the concept of flight sabotage. To be sure that we are talking about Charlie Chan, we can be sure that he will live in a fight against another day, but no guarantee of what condition he will have will be guaranteed even if someone has survived around him. I really like this movie. It's not one of the nests and far from the worst. It's one of the really rare things, really nice. Certainly worth a look or six.
