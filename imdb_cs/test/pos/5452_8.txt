Television films generally do not accept as much recognition or recognition as big movies - and this is usually for good reason, but the 1996 HBO movie The Late Shift is easily one of the best TV movies ever. Based on Bill Carter's revealing book, The Late Shift is about NBC's late night talk show hosted by David Letterman and Jay Leno when it came to filling up the blank tonight Show once held by Johnny Carson. We see what's going on in front of the camera - author Bill Carter, director Betty Thomas and HBO show us what happened when the cameras were turned off. Unfortunately, we can never know for sure what really happened when it came time to replace Johnny Carson with either Letterman or Leno - but Late Shift gives us an interesting reality. While just making a very good movie, Late Shift also makes a really good job of showing all the parties quite equally - even if you're wondering if the movie makes Letterman and Leno out, they're too nice guys; especially Leno, who seems too holy. Performance is also very good. Kathy Bates plays Lena's extremely aspiring manager, Helena Kushnick, in a highly deserved Golden Globe performance, which Carter and the book / movie were very problematic for studio and Leno (actually Kushnick actually suited Bill Carter for insulting the picture). !). John Michael Higgins breaks out of his usual gigs when he gets into tiny comedic comedy games and gives outstanding performance like David Letterman - which gives Letterman an excellent impression, but also creates a bulky and portable character. Daniel Roebuck gives a good performance as Leno, but not quite measured except for some of the other talents in the movie - Roebuck probably did the best that anyone could do, it just looks hammy whenever someone tries to impress or display Leno. Bob Balaban (Warren Littlefield squirrel), Treat Williams (as magician-like Michael Ovitz), and Ed Begley Jr. (Pompous Rod Perth) also give unforgettable supportive performances. The late shift is certainly one of the best movies I've ever seen. I suppose if someone has not seen David Letterman or Jay Leno, The Late Shift may not be for them, but it's an interesting movie for those who get into politics late at night - something that recently brought up its ugly head again in 2009. -10 Debacle Conan / Leno / NBC.
