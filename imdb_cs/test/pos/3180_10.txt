I remember coming home from school to watch and come. This was the story of a black family moving from a ghetto to a community class in which the family was named Wilson Frank Wilson a man with his own construction company whose wife Joyce was the bank manager had 3 teenage children Kevin Valerie and Marcus. That was a very good show. it was educational with out being a preacher. the show was well written. This show showed us a successful African American before the Cosby Show. A lot of black actors appeared on this show from Esther Role to David Hubberd to 227 Stonnie Jackson to name a few. If you can find this show on DVD, you should get it for the whole family
