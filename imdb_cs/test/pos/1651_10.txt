Directed by Jules Dassin, Rififi is in harmony with the photographs of criminals in Melville (especially Bob le Flameur and Le Cercle Rouge) that he is totally focused on story and character and makes sure he is not a spoken word he does not need and has been your time. Ionic still has her professionalism among her characters, a kind of respect (if not for herself, than for others, some duties) that ring well in France after World War II. Her actors carry faces for those characters who say "we know what these guys are about," and from there the story starts. Maybe it's because I have a weak spot for robbery pictures, especially where we see only nuts and bolts (err, the real physical side) of how the puppet is withdrawn. One of the problems with how Real Robbery is filmed in today's movies is that it's all very fast (ie Snatch) or doing the ways we've seen too many times before. Dassin, like Melville years later, decided to create a virtually silent film of robbery, including sound effects. The tension in this scene may not be what Melville had in Rouge, but at its own level it reaches its own size and momentum, as well as the fundamental originality of what has been done before. There are some well-kept close-ups, for example, as the safe is cracked that mark some of the best I've seen from France at the time. Added plus for the film, in addition to the larvae of the new wave touch to the film, which ultimately makes it a bit more modern, is that the story works so well and differently. It happens completely about the character in points, and then keeps the excitement. The last ten to fifteen minutes are miraculous; As with any classic robbery, the image of the Asphalt Jungle, it's not the last stop that matters, but all about how much one goes around calling duty, bringing humanism over greed. All the excitement of a camera flying at trees at high speed with a car they could just do. Here, Dassin has a very entertaining and intuitive movie of his genre, but also a handy musical number.
