I actually learned about Favela Rising through the IMDb website. I am particularly interested in Afro-Brazilian culture and movies. Favela Rising is one of those gems that gives a new meaning to human transformation. Beautifully documented and filmed by Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary his story Anderson Sa, a former drug dealer in Rio De Janeiro who, after the death of family members and friends, becomes Christ's, Malcolm X and Ghandi. AfroReggae, a cultural movement that uses Afro-Brazilian hiphop, capoeira drumming (Afro-Brazilian martial arts) and other artforms, has been created to transform hopeless and mostly angry youth into lively, viable, loving community loving communities. A few years ago, I remember going to the City of God (Cidade De Deus) and leaving the theater utterly numb. The images were grim but stunning and you couldn't take your eyes off the screen. I remember how hopeless the situation was in Favelas and how decadent society was caused by the neglect of governments. How drug trafficking was a way of life, as the citizens of slums were indifferent because death was a daily event. Anderson Sa, like City Of God, talks about how favelas people were also desensitized. They talk about police corruption and how communities were so immobilized by drugs and gangs that you couldn't visit family members in other Favelas that you had to meet in a neutral place. Unlike the City of God Anderson, the AfroReggae Movement provides a solution to anger, hopelessness. There was one episode in the document where Anderson, in the spirit of a preacher approached some youth and asked them to join AfroReggae. These tired youths were so scarred by everyday survival and violence. Their patterns were drug traffickers and that's what they wanted to be. Anderson then said drug dealers don't live long. Of course, he was reluctant, but five months later he managed to get some of his youth to join AfroReggae. The visuals at Favela Rising are amazing. It is clear to me that Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary are not only great storytellers but also a visual artist. This is a document to see! There are some magical and transforming moments in this document. I don't want to spoil them. I want you to see it yourself. Tell your friends, academics, youth counselors, family members about this amazing movie. You will care about the world and our children. I'd give him eleven stars!
