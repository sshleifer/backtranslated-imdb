I was a projector while in the US. and remember this movie very well. we were just set up with stereo sound !! o-o-o-o-o !! Well, it was a big problem in 1959. The instruction came with the cylinders. The overture played when the projected picture of the curtain was closed and I followed the suit with the closed theater curtain. for a break, the theater curtain was closed, and after five minutes, I started the movie again with the screen closed, while the music served as a curtain to the second part. to be the first stereo movie I've ever seen, and to be such a huge musical production, I certainly enjoyed watching it show off.
