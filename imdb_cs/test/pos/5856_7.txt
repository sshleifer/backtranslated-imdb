Now I know that Sandra Bullock has made this movie, but she needs to learn that sometimes you have to make certain sacrifices to take care of the story ... as if you were not trying to do the whole movie about her character! <br /> <The story is about two high school students (one rich and popular, another smart and anti-social) who formulate a plan to commit a murder followed by a numberâ€¦ just to see if they can get away with it. Enter Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin as detectives trying to solve the case. The boys dropped the evidence, created an alibi, and cleared themselves so well that the cops fell for the whole act. But Sandra feels like it's not all that it seems. This film could have been a great Hitchcock-style thriller, but the film spends too much time learning more about Sandra's character. than focusing on the crime itself. You see, something happened in her past that still haunts her throughout the film. And we all know about it ... all about it. After a while, it is rather tedious, especially when you're in the middle of a sincere investigation into the murder, and then you have to stop this investigation to hear what happened to her in the past. Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the true winners of this film. They play their characters convincingly and with the right amount of anger. If the script had spent more time focusing on these characters and keeping the detectives there to do their job, it could have been an extremely entertaining thriller. In this way most of the excitement is lost. They should cut out all things with Sandra's character and made that standalone TV movie for channel life. But I turn. It's still a fun movie. I recommend this movie ... but wait for the video / DVD.
