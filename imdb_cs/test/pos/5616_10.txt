Although many audio recordings of great musicians like Jascha Heifetz survive, film or television recording is really limited. That's why music offers like "They have music" such precious gems. While with modern eyes and ears one can argue about conspiracy, a perceptive viewer should give this film unique enjoyment from their right perspective. The storyline was designed to appeal to both young and old era audiences, but to this day it is pleasant. An important aspect of the experience of watching classical films is seen through the eyes of the viewer of that time. I have to deal with a reviewer who complains about a film that is black and white, or who feel obliged to report that their students express such reservations. These are juvenile complaints that reflect a limited historical perspective. For teachers it should offer an educational opportunity to explain the unique qualities of black and white photography and its place in film history. Color can actually go the way of a good story or music. John Ford's "Stagecoach", for example, is a work of art, as is Ansel Adams's photograph. As for Heifetz's wooden, I couldn't agree with that. If you want a glaring emotional posture, go to a rock concert. The role of a classical musician like Heifetz is to relocate the audience, not himself. Heifetz's emotions are transmitted through his play, not through body language. He had the rare ability to extract all the emotional nuances from the music and transfer it to his listeners. He is a listener who should be moved, not an artist. By the way, one reviewer asked how Heifetz was on YouTube playing the first movement of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concert, with Frank McHugh in the audience. This is from the 1947 film "Carnegie Hall," not "They Have to Have Music" "Carnegie Hall" is an even greater treasure of many great classical artists in their premiere. We are blessed that there were film producers who, at least in these limited cases, decided to perform these artists. There was still an era that was not completely overwhelmed by the lowest common denominator we receive today.
