It's not your everyday Tom and Jerry for many reasons. One of them is Jerry's voice narrative, which is strange because Tom and Jerry rarely speak. Two, two are friends, which was also rare and rarely works, as well as more controversial shorts. Third, and most importantly, the caricature is rarely funny (by design) and jokes are dry laughing with a little cough and a blood bubble at the end. Think Tom and Jerry cartoon directed by Tim Burton. It is not quite successful, but it works to a great extent. The most amazing end for MGM short I remember. Not for everyone and proof that these shorts were never meant only for children as a target group. It's worth watching. Recommended with the above warnings.
