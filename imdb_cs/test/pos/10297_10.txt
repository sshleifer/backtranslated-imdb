This is a wonderful movie. The storyline is a good yarn, and is imaginatively said in a series of flashbacks and alternative considerations. What was intentional and what was coincidence? Who is in love with whom? <br /> <br /> You get the chance to stand in the shoes of every character (sometimes literally), which helps define each character to a satisfactory depth. /> <br /> With a little effort after turning and turning you can understand each of the characters; and the key events in the film are reshot from the perspective of different people. <br /> <br /> Take this opportunity to return to your cinema; it looks good on the big screen. More than guessing, the plot is filmed to the point where you sit and watch what unfolds - I resist anyone who predicts! But you're more likely to need more than one browsing - I've seen it three times in the pictures in his original release, and it's always better. Acting was very good, with the performance of Roman Bohringer as Alice torn in three directions by three other characters in the ensemble. <br /> <br /> Classic. The second best film of the 1990s.
