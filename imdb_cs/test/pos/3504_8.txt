As someone who usually despises Ali G, Ali G Indahouse was absolutely great. When I watched, I was in hysterical condition. Yes, it is sexist, gross and extremely gross, and I loved it. Because some comedies have only one or two comic scenes, this movie was a laugh-a-thon. I've never seen a comedy as original as Ali G Indahouse. For the comedy in which Ali G plays, it would be worth 8 out of 10. Absolutely Brilliant.
