Another nice entry into the Crime Doctor series [# 4/10], with atmospheric almost noirish black and white photography and some gorgeous Spanish American backdrops and orchards. And another alien story too! A man who looks like a mad killer of his first two wives is found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner. The crime doctor is on the scene (supposedly as a guest) to immediately and resign him as a murder, and we are presented with a fairly strange set of people who could wake up because one of them did the deed. He was the fraternal brother of dead first wife, 3rd wife and rich widow Hilary Brooke, dancing brother and sister vampires, intense young man, eccentric maker of Lloyd Corrigan's loan from Boston Blackie, irreplaceable butler or course - Jerome Cowan? Police Inspector Emory Parnell had his work shut down, but Warner Baxter as Ordway was as staunch as ever. One of the IMDb scammers is wrong: To break the murderous room, Ordway says, "Through the center of the forehead" and Cowan replies "Don't miss this time". Favorite Pieces: Baxter and Cowan travel through club sandwiches and beer in a nightclub to help them with their interrupted dinner; The scene where Braga is instead of resting seemed to bang. The plot seems to be occasionally meandering, and the way everything was explained was perhaps a worthy Monogram, but he wouldn't even let him in the air as a supernatural! <br /> <br /> Worth Watching If you like this genre, you won't be disappointed if you really don't like this genre.
