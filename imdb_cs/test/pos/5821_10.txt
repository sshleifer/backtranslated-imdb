Oz is by far the best show he ever loved television. Better than The Sopranos, yes, ER, yes, CSI, absolutely. Uncompromising, bold and totally distracting, but deeply moving. Oz took us around any prison image that anyone on TV had once conjured. Tom Fontana really did a great job of writing. No topic is taboo. Rape, drugs, murder. Oz is proof of how good television can be. He follows the characters of different backgrounds and all the different races, but always returns to your mundane Tobias Beecher, in prison for murder. We see what we do not want to see, pain, death, chaos. Oz will disturb you, cause you to bend over to distract you, but above all it will come to your mind. To see Oz is to see truly wonderful TV production
