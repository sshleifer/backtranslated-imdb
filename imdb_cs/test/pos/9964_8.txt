The Merchant of Venice 8/10 <br /> <br /> (This review assumes a basic knowledge of the story, so it may be thought that it contains spoilers for anyone unfamiliar with the chart.) <br /> <br /> As a movie version of the famous Shakespeare, Merchant of Venice does what has made a few adjustments since Polanski is somewhat bold Macbeth: takes the spirit of the game and brings it not only well, but better than the game itself could easily achieve. Lord of the Rings director, Peter Jackson, argued that there are three possibilities when editing a book or playing: attempting to replicate the original as completely as possible, using the original idea as inspiration, but accepting a full license for film change, or ( the one who seems to prefer to stick to the original as well as the film ally is viable, but make the changes that are necessary for the film while remaining true to the intent or spirit of the original. In Macbeth, Polanski used rain beaches and realistic rape and murder to tell what bloody and frightening period the game was, and he remembered the horrible context in which the characters do such diseases. decision. It differs from (say) Branagh's Hamlet, which has reached new heights of faithful rendering, but otherwise offered a small new. Macbeth, on the other hand, may have allowed viewers fresh to appreciate Shakespeare's some drama without extensive study; similarly, a more familiar audience might find greater depth than could be done without stage performance. Such an interpretation plays an important role if viewers are to be fully engaged, not only intellectually but also emotionally, with the points Shakespeare wanted to make. Radford's adaptation of the Merchant of Venice is doing just that. It uses a fundamental moral dilemma involving religious fanatics or keeping promises, and faithfully expresses them in the spirit of the original story with the minimal story of Bard's holy story. The first of them, religious fanaticism, makes Shylock's otherwise ugly behavior. We see that the Jews of that time descended into the walled ghetto, allowed only when they wore a red identification cap. It is not allowed to own property, one of the few ways to make a living is to borrow money. This makes them useful for their Christian oppressors and at the same time for their defamation. The idea of ​​biblical prohibitions of usury (both old and new laws) seems to stem from not helping profits by helping friends. This is widespread by bigot Christians to curse the ones they spit on (we see that Shylock not only spit on, but also Jews who are thrown into the waterways for sport - in an atmosphere that can only be described as menacing). The timeliness of the film is curious because the fanaticism of right-wing Christianity (embodied by Bush's Americans) has changed its circle because they are now the main supporters of Zionism, and Jewish political leaders are biting into the Palestinian territory. neighbors, like Shylock, are trying to bite Antonio (once he thinks the law gives him the power to do so). Psychology is self-evident - repeatedly kick the dog and it will be bad. The circle continues easily because the victims of oppression themselves easily lose their sense of moral values ​​and become oppressors. The tough handshake that the hidden Portia uses to save Antonio has some merit, both the clever interpretation of the sophisticated law that the Venetians play so rue and also as a moral indicator. Shylock may "have his pound of meat" under his contract, but he may not have any blood. An easy analogy could be made in terms of warfare and terrorism - it is much easier to justify fighting between warriors or attacking bad people if soldiers or criminals are the only victims - when there is massive side damage like innocent citizens. , including women and children, are killed in their hundreds, warming arguments (whether they are Israeli, Palestinian or American Americans) carry much less popular support. There have been many arguments for a long time whether Shakespeare is anti-Semitic in this story. One asks whether he had to adapt the ending to a predominantly Christian audience that had nothing to do with Jewish people. The end promotes Christianity and humiliation on Shylock - far from teaching him greater good - a course that would simply resist. Both camps look just as bad - they just hold more power than others. Slight moderation of judgment simply gives Christian judges a better public image, or, like Bassanio, so acutely (watching the coffin and solving puzzles that win Portia's hand): <br /> <br /> In religion, what a damn mistake, but some sober eyebrows Bless it and approve it with the text, Will the roughness hid with majesty? There is no such a simple habit, but it assumes that there is a mark of virtue on its outer parts. Of course, fanaticism relates more to organized religion (rather than to spirituality), especially when it is organized for political purposes, but one that is easily annoyed by ordinary God-fearing people who have no habit of splitting hair . Kindness, mercy ("Chesed" in Judaism), which is so fundamental to true Christianity, is also practiced in Judaism as in many faiths. Jewish faith distinguishes between kindness and philanthropy, ways to practice effectively, and ways to make it part of being something rather than just an external manifestation. Both Shylock and Antonio are fanatics and use their respective beliefs to abuse people of other faiths. While Shakespeare may have pointed to the gap between the good prescribed by different beliefs and his absence in practice, the film version greatly reduces the window for interpretation of anti-Semitism and brings psychological causes to a greater degree of realism. Keeping promises (men to wives) is less well treated, as are comic elements contained in sub-plots. Bassanio, however strong his love for Antonio (are there homosexual elements?), Can't make healthy moral judgments when he expresses his gratitude to "judges" and thus violates his promise (for which Portia forgives him, which is a triumphant character for women, not only so overly intelligent and witty, but also more merciful and considerate to others than her bigoted male counterparts, including her husband. Some of the actors are a little bit embedded and too many. regional (English) accents, but bringing a fresh and rewarding rework to Shakespeare across the entire Merchant of Venice. I liked acting and also the very beautiful soundtrack from Hayley Westenry and others, singing ballads written by Shakespeare and Edgar Allen Poe. All in all, the Merchant of Venice is an insignificant success of the British (in any film that can be said to have a nationality today) a film tradition.
