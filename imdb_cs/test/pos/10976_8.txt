Manna From Heaven is a light comedy that uses exaggeration of human weaknesses for the entertainment of the audience. Throughout the film, there is an expectation that good will manifest in every situation. As a result, the film's visitor finds himself with this silly smile on his face, peace of mind and high expectations for the human species. Watching this movie was the most enjoyable experience. (I would dare to say an uplifting experience, but some would say it sounds frantic!)
