I can't believe how many great actors can be at one show. It is realism and gentle action that makes it real. This must be the best comedy he has ever created, and I love Seinfeld and everyone who loves Ramond. It's just wonderful and everyone in my family seems to agree. This is not my isolated opinion. The whole world seems to be talking about different incidents and trying to recover them. My hat outside the crew. Some shows have an actor who does the whole show. This conspiracy comedy has killed (8) of them. That's amazing. Some people pray for health, wealth or fame. I pray the show never ends. Sicerely John. LKHUBBLE2@talkamerica.net
