I recently watched this movie and decided to comment on it. <br /> <br /> The best way to watch this movie is not to wait for what you've seen in the past. Miyazaki is well known for his work on Spirited Away and Howl is a moving castle. as well as for Western viewers. both of them were similar but completely different. But Ponyo is a completely different type of story and animation. The story follows the "Ponyo" fish that has the face of a girl. After Ponyo flees from his home at the bottom of the sea, he finds a whole new world she never knew about, and a new five-year-old man saved the new problems when she was almost caught by a fishing boat. a boy known as Sousuke. The story then follows two of them and a pure friendship between boy and fish. can Ponyo stay with Sousuk forever? I feel that the film was inspired by the "Little Mermaid" and similar to "Tonari no Totoro" <br /> <br /> the movie is very short and you have very little time to learn about the characters in this movie. But the characters are a fish and a little boy, how much do you expect to know about them? The movie is set to what seems to be 3 days, I think that's why the movie is so short. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie and I hope you like this movie
