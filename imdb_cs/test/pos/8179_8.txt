This movie is not meant for those who expect martial art. As far as historical accuracy is concerned, I will leave this matter to those who are better informed about the matter. I thought the show was amazing. Gong Li never fails as a resourceful and (originally) loyal wife of King Qin. Fengyi Zhang showed a lot of flexibility showing the ruler descending into madness. He chose "Hannibal Lector" instead of resorting to bragging. For me, the best performance was Zhiwen Wang as supersmooth Marquis. The figure came across as very greasy, but in the subtle "Sir Humphrey Appleby" - Yes, the Minister somehow. Cinematography is a standout feature of this film. The scene when the Marquis and his men attacked the palace was breathtaking. There are also a number of wonderful battle scenes. Therefore, this movie is highly recommended on the big screen.
