A good but not big movie, "The Great Dictator" is Chaplin's first talkie. It is a good effort and sometimes a remarkable satire for Hitler, but the moments of Chaplin's brilliance in the offer are unfortunately tended to use too much unnecessary dialogue. Yes, Chaplin, the silent master of the screen, uses too many words in this film, and his tendency to write long speeches and strange passages of dialogue would translate into his other films, such as (better) "Limelight." Yet Chaplin was extremely brave in that he even made this film and his performance in dual roles is certainly unforgettable. Paulette Goddard doesn't have the glow she did in "Modern Times" (her off-screen affair with Chaplin at that time), but it's always worth seeing, and Jack Oakie just steals the show as a rival dictator. Chaplin's famous creation, Hynkel.
