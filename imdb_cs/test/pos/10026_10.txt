Warner Brothers has largely manipulated American history with director "Big Trail" director Raoul Walsh, who is a first-class western "Died with their shoes", a somewhat inaccurate but exciting biography of cavalry officer George Armstrong Custer. The film captures Custer since arriving at the West Point Academy until the Indians massacre him on Little Big Horn. This is one of the roles of Errol Flynn and one of the biggest epic bands of Raoul Walsh. Walsh and Flynn then came together very often and "They died with their shoes on" again joined Olivia de Havilland when Flynn was last interested in romantic interest. They appeared as a couple in seven previous films. This 140-minute black-and-white oater is nothing but brilliant with dynamic action sequences, humorous romantic scenes and strict dramatic confrontations between our hero and his opponents. One of the notorious mistakes includes Colonel Philip Sheridan, who is depicted as commander at West Point before the Civil War. Sheridan was a lieutenant at this point. In fact, the commander was Robert E. Lee as an earlier Flynn movie "Santa Fe Tour" showed. Another historical extinction concerns Lieutenant General Whitfield Scott; Scott was not commander of union troops throughout the civil war. Warner Brothers introduced Custer as a drinker (probably because Flynn had a reputation for drinking), but in real life Custer neither drank nor smoked. However, these, like other historical goofs, will not hurt a truly wonderful movie. "They died with their shoes on" will open with Custer riding to West Point Military Academy grouped in fancy uniform uniform with an African-American carrying their luggage and caring for their dogs. After the guard's sergeant finds himself a guardian of the future plebe instead of a high-ranking foreign general, the sergeant turns Custer into cadet Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy of "City for Conquest") to take over. Sharp is working on Custer's practical work by installing him in Major Romulus Taipe (Stanley Ridges of the Task Force), who immediately starts Custer. Naturally, the unstable Custer attacks Sharp in a public battle. General Phil Sheridan (John Litel "Sons of Katie Elder") is ready to reject Custer from the West for behavior that is unsuitable. As it turns out, Sheridan can't drive Custer out because Custer didn't register. Once registered, Custer establishes an average academic reputation with kindness to fight and hoard humiliating galore. When American Civil War erupts, West Point cadet graduates who did not finish their education and rush them into battle. One of the last cadets to get into the war is Custer. Avid getting to fight, Custer meets his future wife, Elizabeth 'Libby' Bacon (Olivia de Havilland "Santa Fe Trail"), and they commit to each other, despite Mr. Bacon (Gene Lockhart ") Carousel" ), who hates the view of Custer. It seems that Bacon ran over the Custer at the salon and offended one of Custer's friends and our hero chastised Bacon. Meanwhile, in Washington, Custer desperately seeks to convert to a regiment, but Major Taipe has a cool pat. Custer befriends Lieutenant General Winfield Scott's rotunda (Sidney Greenstreet "Maltese Falcon") and shares the appetite for creamy onion Bermuda, which will become one of Custer's qualities. Not only does Scott oversee Taipe assigning Custer to the second cavalry, but Custer also calls Taipe's horse to his command. During the Battle of Bull Run, July 21, 1861, Custer cannot hear orders from anyone other than Sharp, hitting his superior officer and holding the bridge so that the infantry can cross him. Custer, injured in the shoulder and sent to the hospital, gets a medal, not a court fight. When Confederate General Jeb Stuart threatens the Union Army at the Battle of Gettysburg, in Pennsylvania, Scott is shocked at the chance that the South may triumph. When Brigadier General cannot be found, Scott goads Taipe into support the first available officer. There is a mistake and Custer is promoted. First, Custer embraces the moment in disbelief and Stuart's procedure bursts. After the war, Custer shrouds down and starts drinking it with the boys at the local salons. Sharp appears as a crooked rail promoter, and with his father trying to get Custer to serve as president of their railroad, in order to receive funding. Finally, Libby joins his name with General Sheridan, who commanded the army, and gets him back to active service as commander of the 7th Cavalry. When he takes command, Custer discovers that the 7th ride is drunk and is not surprised that Sharp controls the fort in the fort. Meanwhile, Custer has his first run with Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn "Guns Navarone") and takes him into custody. Of course, Crazy Horse will escape, become Custer's adversary and fight. Once Custer suppressed Crazy Horse and Indians, Sharp and Taipe as a government agent conspired to destroy the peace treaty with Sioux and other Indian nations. They also oversee that Custer is brought up on the charges for striking Taipe in a parlor brawl. On the way to Washington, Custer discovers the perfection of Sharp and Taipe, who cast a golden strike in the sacred Black Hills. Settlers rampage in a Indians hit warpath. Custer sacrifices himself and his 600 men in the Little Big Horn in a slam-bang showdown against 6,000 red skins. Bert Glennon's "Stagecoach" lens captures both grain and fame. The long shot of the 7th cavalry leaving the fortress at dawn is spectacular. As an added premonition of Custer's impending demise, Libby faints after leaving their quarters for the Little Big Horn. "They died with their shoes on" benefiting from the top-notch Max Steiner score that includes the regimental tune "Gary Owen."
