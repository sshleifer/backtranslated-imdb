For the first time I saw this film when I released it in 1980. From other sources, I learned that the only release of the 219-minute cut was in New York, after which it was seriously reduced to 149 minutes. So, I think I saw the first shorter version, which was very interesting anti-western at that time, if the little thing was confusing ... So it was with even greater interest that I finally got a full DVD version. I'm glad I did it because this second tracking confirmed that the film was a real classic, and the critical vitriol poured on Michael Cimino was unfounded, at least to say the least. Yes, it's a long movie, but so many more. For example: Once upon a time in America (1984) in 227 minutes; Cleopatra (1963) at 320 minutes; The Ten Commandments (1956) in 220 Minutes; Spartacus {Renewed Version} (1960) at 198 minutes; Away with the Wind (1939) in 222 minutes and more. So it cannot be the fact that the running of time that made so much foam at the mouth the way back when the celestial gate came onstage. But note that all of these films have everything in terms of strengthening myths about history and heroes. It is not a heavenly gate: in this narrative, the American West manifests itself in all its grim and inexorable cruelty, injustice and poverty. And this is probably the first reason why this disliked this film: it set the circumstances of the Johnson County War of 1892 in Wyoming, showing how Wyoming Stock Association growers hired 50 killers to pursue and murder a large group of European immigrants accused of rustling cattle; and all with the help and convoy of the authorities, to the President of the United States. For an essay on that war, with background and what happened, there is a reference to Wikipedia under Johnson County War. Very little wanted to be alerted to the really dirty period in their country's history, and they fly in the face of what the country is supposed to be. If it were a document, it would be barely tasty for most; as entertainment, it was almost committed to failure commercially and being torn to pieces modest and infamous. Leave aside the socio-political diatribe, for a moment that Cimino has launched here what the story? the story of the three main characters? Perhaps it was not unusual for the man of that time to fall to a local prostitute. It is a fairly standard love triangle, according to which Ella has to choose between two men and ultimately decides on a younger man, Nathan, who, though not to resort to a cold-blooded murder when he likes it, shows more spirit and commitment than older James. (or Jim, as most people say in the movie). For some, the part of the story may be too slow; However, in the context of the wider story of war, I think it is quite appropriate. And the war is graphically, cruelly and cruelly portrayed with scenes of massacre that are beautifully staged and flawlessly edited? although in the last massacre between the association and the immigrants, I am sure that some scenes of cars blowing apart are repeated. Smaller point and possibly caused when 219 minute cut was restored? Any way you look at it, however, will hit your face with noise, dust, chaos and confusion of war ... <br /> <br /> Which leads me to further criticize others: noise and dust is that it is often difficult to hear the dialogue and even clearly see what is happening. I admit that I found out that this is a trifle annoying initially, even backtracking to the parts to be played to try to capture the image or words? Until I realized that it wasn't really necessary if you accepted the director's intention: life is messy, it's hard to hear and see in crowded situations and in war it is a sine qua non of this mission-en-scene. In short, it is as if you were actually present behind and behind the scenes ... <br /> <br /> What about the title? From Shakespeare, it refers to the figurative proximity to God and so, if you balance God with the natural world, the stunning scenery that permeates the film? and it is overwhelming, scaryly the same as David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965) ?? is a useful metaphor. However, I have a tendency to think that Cimino had something to say, the idea that brave immigrants? the godly salt of the earth? they were denied entry to heaven on earth and the freedom to build life for themselves in a country that professes freedom. Was it Cimin's intention? read the myth of the American West? To show how rich the rich get rich in America, while poor people are in one way or another massacred throughout history? Is this something new? Not quite as we all know. But where it really hurts, it is to show how America is not, and consequently, not a free country and brave homes. Instead, after absorbing this story, we have the impression that the foundations of America have more to do with a country free of slaves and home to a knight ...
