The cheerful team that brought you 'CNNNN' and 'The Chaser Decides' returned to ABC with its new series 'The Chaser War On Everything'. Filmed in front of a live audience, Chaser will once again do what it does best - blind key political figures, international celebrities and media personalities. Satire is simply priceless and nothing is sacred. In recent weeks, the Chaser Team has been chasing alongside the Queen (during her visit to Australia) to try and leave John Howard Dismissed and Kim Beazley (Aust. Opposition Leader) at risk of kneeling. A particularly funny segment is "Mr. Ten Questions", which shows an enthusiastic reporter who is approaching celebrities (recently Charlize Theron and The Backstreet Boys) and asks them ten such questions as "what Just for record, Theron ignored him and left, and one of the Backstreet Boys was angry and "refused to give him a dignified answer." <br /> <br /> when one team decided to become a "busker statue" to get some extra money. When he realized how hopeless he was, he put in a real statue. PERFECT SCAM! He got thirty dollars in twenty minutes! The brilliant satire of everything in Australian society. Two inches up! (By the way, the show will not show three weeks after Easter because "though the team is all atheists, they are also hypocrites.")
