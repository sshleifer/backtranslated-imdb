The first half-hour of "Homegrown" was somewhat boring and not absorbing, but as the film went on, my interest in characters and storyline. Several scenes are really scary and you are worried about the main characters you are actually joining. The story is about three hired hands on a hidden illegal marijuana farm in Southern California. They are witnesses to the farm owner's murder, Malcolm (John Lithgow), and they take over the weeds for their own. Three rather simple minded farmer hands will soon reach the frightening mafia world and local interest, while everyone is constantly trying to convince everyone that Malcolm is still alive. While the movie had several mistakes and a slow start, it turned out to be worth it. 7/10 stars.
