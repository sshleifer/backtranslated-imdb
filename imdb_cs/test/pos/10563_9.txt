The story itself was well drawn and interesting. However, it is difficult for me to write a review of this movie without spoiling you. To avoid this, I will not speak the story here. I consider this film a good adaptation of Sarah Water's book compared to the previous book "Flipping the Velvet". First I read the book and then I watched the DVD later. The film retains most of the main character's ghosts in the book. Of course, given the time constraint, the movie in the last 30 minutes seemed to be in a hurry to cover Part III of the book. So she couldn't well illustrate the scene when everyone met in Mr. Ibbs' kitchen and after that (even the book felt like a rush on the kitchen). Still, the film actually did a good job in representing the story. It's really worth watching. It's still unclear when BBC-America can broadcast this movie. It is a pity. PS: He noticed that the ages of Maud and Sue were set to 20-21 instead of 17-18 in the book; the other one is more reasonable, while the first one is closer to the actresses.
