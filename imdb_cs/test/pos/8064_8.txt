The Anne Frank Diary is the world's second best-selling non-fiction book for good reason. Still, I am in this document about my life, which fills some details where the diary stopped, I thought, "Just another documentary about Anne Frank." I found it competent but not extraordinary. That was my contented attitude because I was well aware of Anne Frank's story; most of what the documentary had to say was not new to me. But everything changed when I got to the end of the document --- when I saw Anna Frank's movie footage. The emotional impact of seeing this record, just the second or so long, did everything that cost it a thousand times more real - but not everything in the document; all I knew about Anne Frank before had become more real, more personal. I always moved her story, but when I saw the record, what I felt was stronger and deeper and deeper than any other film experience of my life. (Previously, I knew that this documentary contained Anne Frank's live footage, and I even saw footage from a film review on television, but seeing it in a documentary context was a completely different experience. > Now I realize that many people still do not know the story of Anne Frank; sometimes it is discouraging to witness this kind of ignorance. I wonder, "How could anyone know the story of Anne Frank?" Although it is, ANNE FRANK: MEMORY, along with reading her diary, is the best place to start. It's a story everyone should know.
