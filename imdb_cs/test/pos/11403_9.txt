I saw both movies and I no doubt saw that re-make is the best, I know that many people would disagree with those who became fans of the original, most likely it won't, but I thought it was well thought out and definitely scary , it was so good to see it again tonight, the original creeping me because they're killing kids, I mean, who's doing it in the movies anyway ... but at this one kids have at least half the chance ... The only bad part about this movie is when a nurse (Jill) walks to the sounds she hears and runs out into the bushes to check on someone. That, while babysitting, so this is the only thing I found wrong with the film, and even so that they probably had to give that there to build tension, I don't want to give too much to all who have not seen it, I recommend you instead of listening to all Those people who say its crap and worse than the original, it would be a better film for teenagers because it shows things that most of us are afraid of, but when I was in the movies there were at least 10 adults over the age of 70 watching there , and they enjoyed it if they liked it I think you will! I give him 9 out of 10!
