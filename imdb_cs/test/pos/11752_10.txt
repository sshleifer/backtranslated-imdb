I first saw this film in the mid-sixties when I was a teenager, and that moved me so much, in fact the final scene where Han Suyin hears Mark's death, and then rushes to the hill in disbelief, where you hear Mark's voice. his hand ", and then his image disappears, the butterfly with its superstitious meaning, the music, the broken emotions of the love of Han Suyin, let me sob. Outwardly I cried bitterly, my mother and sister looking up and shocking my reaction. I just left the room to be alone. Luckily, I'm not responding, but I'm always crying at the end. I love everything about film, mostly music, Han Suyin costumes, and location. The beauty of Jennifer Jones and the handsome William Holden, both were the best. I have VHS and DVD of this wonderful movie. I also have two versions of Music & Lyrics by Arthur Newman and Sammy Fain. I also have a book Many Splendored Thing Han Suyin. I recommend this movie 100%
