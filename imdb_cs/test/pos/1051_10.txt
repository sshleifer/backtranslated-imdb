"Christmas in Connecticut" is the jewel of Christmas classic film. While less known than some others - it is however a wonderful way to spend the evening at holiday time. I look at it every year. Barbara Stanwyck is perfectly cast, Elizabeth Lane, the only, career girl. The road before it was popular, Stanwyck embodies the only girl on the rise. Her NYC apartment, and her friendly "uncle" restaurateur around the corner typify one girl in the city's existence. She can't cook, but she writes a homemaking column for the magazine! Dennis Morgan is also perfectly cast as our war hero, Jefferson Jones, who wants to meet the amazing Elizabeth Lane. After being lost at sea, he just wants to spend Christmas in a "real" house. Who is preparing a wonderful, crazy story that is developing. It's fun from start to finish. We should have Uncle Felix too!
