I just praise this film. From start to finish he captured the brilliance of Stephen Sondheim's musical. I'm not a big fan of musicals, most of them exaggerated. But this one changed his mind. I myself am an actor and I played Sweeney and I know how heavy this role is. George Hearn showed a stunning, masterful and rounded performance worthy of the highest prizes we can give him (he won Emmy and that's something.) Everything he does turns into gold. It's so good that it blows you away why it's not in the winning Oscars. Lansbury is also very good and very fun. Sara Woods is scary and gorgeous as a Beggar Woman. All in all a great video. Pick it up if you can.
