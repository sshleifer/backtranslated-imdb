This jazz soundtrack looks like Clint Eastwood. In fact, the whole thing interferes with me doing Burt Clint. The story is good and the film is full of one liner I wear today. (Reynolds on the wrong guy: I'll pull the chain for you because you're in my city. And you want to know the worst part? ! Charles Durning will brighten listening to the wiretap of prostitutes that have sex on their phones. (You have to see it, believe me, it's cheerful.) Brian Keith plays like a tough guy. (And does it well!) <br /> <br /> Worry about Bernie Casie and Zen. Rachel Ward. WOW! (Where did it go?) <br /> <br /> Doc Severinsen and the Tonight Show are playing as usual. (Guest Joe William on vocals. Manhattan Transfer re-recorded "Route 66".) The soundtrack lends the class the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Do I need to say more? It may be the best Reynold's film ever. <br /> <br /> (Yeah, it's played as usual, but it works!) <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
