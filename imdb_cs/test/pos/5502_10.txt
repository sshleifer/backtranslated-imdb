For some inexplicable reason, Jerry's films seemed to often come to diatribes from certain neighborhoods, though they were rarely disappointed with cash registers. It is one of the greatest mysteries of life for me, because his films always have a "good feeling" for me. But this film is not only bad: it is an extremely good and clever comedy. For those who can be tickled by "modern" coarse or cruel humor, they do not see this film: There is no such thing and you will waste your time. I've only seen this movie once on television. Since then, I have expected to see it again, and that has been for years. Do you think the idea of ​​an arrogant millionaire entrepreneur who would go to win a war against the Nazis with his own small private army of subordinate employees was boring, wasn't he? Only Jerry Lewis would dare try out such a plot for comedy out and it works, I must say brilliantly. I think that, as with "Nutty Professor" and most of his other films, this film is a testament to his comical genius, both in concept and performance. I think Buddy Love may have said, "You know, a real comedy can't do just six years of hysteria, it will do for his father." Perhaps several Nazi monocles and limping hazel generals would not like this movie, honestly. If you see only one comedy in your life, look at this one. Be careful, but you can die laughing. And I'm kidding!
