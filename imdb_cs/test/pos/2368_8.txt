This film makes several nods to various sci-fi movies. The prologue reminds me of the one for the original THX-1138 (trailer for BUCK ROGERS, here it was clips from some morning Japanese TV show). Then the opening picture of the city in 2345 has a dragon flying overhead with a billboard reminiscent of BLADERUNNER immediately. BLADERUNNER's aspect comes even more <br /> <br /> when we encounter a hero called Replicant (he is blonde hair and is called Ryo, a tribute to Roy Batty, the character of Rutger Hauer in BLADERUNNER). Soon there is a battle scene that immediately reminds MATRIX. The government that forces the population to take drugs is like the THX-1138, and the chief enforcer, while looking like a cross between Elvis and Dan Ackroyd, turns out to be a robot, much like a TERMINATOR. The end of the battle is reminiscent of TERMINATOR 2 and the end result is cheerful. Probably not one of the best SF movies out there, but it's nice, certainly much more fun than tripe like BATTLEFIELD EARTH.
