I'm glad I read the Sarah Waters novel for the first time because I had pictures of characters in my head at the time. However, those we occupied for this production were not at all disappointing - actually, after getting used to Rachael Stirling as Nan, I think Nina Gold did a great job in the casting department. (Can Keeley Hawes Be More Delicious?!) <br /> <br /> The BBC did it again: it's a great production of a very good book, in style. If you succeed (VHS, DVD), do not forget to purchase a 181 minute version (uncensored). It's an amazing journey, though sometimes a little rocky, which you won't regret.
