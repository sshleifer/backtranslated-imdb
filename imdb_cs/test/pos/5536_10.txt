The Mob marriage was one of the first VHS tapes I had with Coming To America and Grease. After all these years, I still have memories of this film. Damn, I still have VHS of this movie in good condition. Story: The secret cop Mike Downey (Matthew Modine) is sent to spy on Angela De Marco (Michelle Pfeiffer), wife of the killed mafia member Frank "Cucumber" De Marco (Alec Baldwin). Later she falls in love with her after she realizes he's innocent in all this. Angela has to deal not only with the unwanted advances of Tony's boss Tony "The Tiger" Russo (Dean Stockwell), but also with his jealous wife Connie Russo (Mercedes Ruehl). Marriage Mob is funny and still keeps your interest when not trying to be funny. I like the small cracks that insist on mafia life (the jealous mafia woman, the boss of the crowd who doesn't realize he's not a magnet for chicks, etc.) And you like the characters of Angela De Marco and Mike Downey. It was the last of Johnathan Demme's funny phase before he got into serious situations and gave you gems like Philadelphia and Silence Of The Lambs. If you're in the mood of comedy, Married To The Mob is a goalkeeper. It's better than the waste that goes through the comic (Epic Movie, Date Movie, Meet The Spartans, Disaster Movie, etc.) today.
