I saw this film twice at the Transilvania International Film Festival (TIFF), the film is in competition and I really hope Esteban Sapir will get one of the awards (at least the best prize). <br /> <br /> As a silent fan of cinema, I am interested in contemporary films that quote or renew the language of a wine movie. Previous reviewer emphasized Fritz Lang and Fr. W. Murnau. As I see, the film refers directly to Lang's metropolis and to the allegorical parabolic character of his plot. But I didn't see Murnau in it. There's an even clearer tribute to Melies: a moon with a human face (smoking here here) and paper, painted mountains and urban landscapes. I enjoyed the film mainly for its visual imagination and in the meantime I found a very interesting story about piety and creative means of communication used by the inhabitants of a dull city. From this point of view, this film is a unique reflection of the silence of a silent cinema, because it is hard to find stories with silent characters in silent movies. In this case, it can be questioned whether the story of alienated voices was a motivation for the form of silent film, or that there is an intention to play the wisdom of silent films. Another example of this type of reflection I found in Guy Maddin's Careful, where mountain village residents have restrictions on using their voices. I intend to write a paper on it, if you know movies related to this topic, please let me know !!! I highly recommend Esteban Sapir to every viewer (one of the critics called it: the jewel of the festival). PS: The winners were announced and the film won the Best Cinematography Award!
