I missed the cinema and rented it on DVD. If you have a chance, I would recommend it because it's better than just about everything I've seen this year in a movie theater or DVD. But that doesn't mean it's one of the best movies ever or not at all, it's just I've seen a lot of garbage :) <br /> <br /> I can't really add to what's been said except 8/10
