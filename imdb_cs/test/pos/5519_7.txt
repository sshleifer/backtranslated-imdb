I saw this film on my local cable system under the title "Beyond Overcoming". I was looking for new material to watch because most of the Saturday morning repetitions didn't interest me. I've always been a fan of Andrew McCarthy and Michael Ironside, so I chose this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I personally enjoyed the movie. Rich Roesing, who has posted a commentary on the film that is spoiled for him by seeing the scenes from the movie on the back of the video rental box, is well justified. I wasn't disappointed that I knew about the film in advance. This led me to rate the movie higher than the average score on the page. <br /> <br /> I like thrilling movies and this was no exception. The film guessed me to the very end. I was surprised at the end! The moments of reflection and memories of the main character's past experience have only added to the tension. His reactions to these memories gave the film a sense of humanitarian but conflicting police work. Fighting his faith is also a welcome addition. <br /> <br /> If you like thrilling movies, but also movies based on the character's feelings, personal inflection, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie in the local cable or satellite guide, check it out! <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a rental video, follow Rich Roesing's instructions and ask someone to get the video. for you before watching.
