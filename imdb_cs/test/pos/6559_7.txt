Horror Time, Japanese Style. Uzumaki / Spiral was the very best from the beginning to the end. A fun freakfest on it, but at times it was tad too relying on kitsch rather than horror. The story is difficult to sum up: a carefree, normal teenage girl starts coming face to face with extremely disturbing events, because the little town she lives in seems to be in control of the spirals. Spirals are everywhere, in the air, clouds, dirt and everyday objects. Spirals have control over people, and bad things happen to them. Another thing is that people accidentally turn to snails. Why? Who knows or cares, people turn to snails, that's enough for me. It wasn't as scary as just scary, because it doesn't have a lot of tension or violent attacks, as often do horror movies. Uzumaki prefers to sneak and crawl (like a snail could!), Rather than shake. Favorite scene: a woman lying asleep in a hospital room when this long, thousand-created centipede makes its way into the room and slowly rises to the bed, over the leaves, over the pillow and into the sleeping ear. I crouched and twisted my toes. Uzumaki has several scenes that are really violent but are also a little funny. For example, a man is obsessed with w / spirals, he gets into his washing machine because he sees a spiral in it when it spins, he commits spiral suicide inside the washing machine. The last shot we see is that his body is twisted and rubber, the human body of the spiral w / entangled single eye flashes in the middle of the washing machine. Bizarre picture. Uzumaki has a stunning psychodelic angle to him, which adds to his charm and fun. I like such horror movies. It's not about killing, slasher movies, it's about the power of evil (spiral!) That takes you and tries to kill you, forcing you to kill others. Films like Uzumaki prove that there are many ways to make a horror movie and thanks for that
