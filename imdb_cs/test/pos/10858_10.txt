I think Andrew Davies did a remarkable job with a wonderful book that emulated the pace and style of the Victorian novel and turned it into a moving and fun movie. I'm glad I read the book twice, which is usually the case for me. I know you need to see a novel and a movie as different media and judge it accordingly. But it is still often difficult to read the original material after the film gives away the best parts. <br /> <br /> I realize Davies is a very good adapter, but I wish manufacturers would choose a woman to write the script. Davies, he admits in the commentary accompanying the DVD movie, wanted to emphasize more of the scatological bits in the book. I certainly enjoyed the movie as in the book. But Davies missed half a dozen moments that were so unbearably, painfully tender that he could be incorporated if his sensitivity was more feminine. <br /> <br /> I'd also take a problem with his use of the primary symbol book, Rose. As the screenplay was rendered by Davies, denouement was inevitable and appropriate. But I think the author's last nod to the rose symbol was more interesting. And I preferred the way the novel let Nan "come to age" than the way Davies chose. <br /> <br /> One quick comment on four actors involved in primary roles. They are all great gifted - with the exception of singing and dancing - and moreover, their physical presence is so much that they see the mind reading the novel before they see the film. I thought they were all great. I recommend that all lesbians and someone who loves good fiction add BOTH book and DVD TIPPING VELVET to their shelves.
