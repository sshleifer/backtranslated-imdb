The best I've ever seen. Some commentators have suggested that it could be extended, due to the density of insight it offers. It is irony in the commentary and little merit. All acting is at Noonan, and his flawless character is perfect. I may have preferred the narrator to be less "recognizable", but the gravity loans are perfect. This is an acronym for people who read, for those whose "bar" is set high and for those who realize that life in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can create the opposite and bitter defender of beauty. Beautiful short film. FWIW: I was delighted with Picasso's legacy because I once believed Picasso was just another little bitch with a little talent; I suppose most people - until the day I saw some drawings he did when he was twelve. At this age Picasso was a finer draftsman and brilliant artist than many artists throughout his life. I immediately understood why he had to do the art he knew about.
