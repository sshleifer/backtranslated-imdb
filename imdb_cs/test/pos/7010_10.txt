I watched this movie at least thirty times, maybe even more, and every time I watched, I was drawn into the movie and back to 1963! The film takes me on a nostalgic holiday every time I look at it. I think the important thing I say here is that I had 15 in 1963 and remember, "before President Kennedy was shot and arrived before Beetles." I feel like saying, "I was carrying a watermelon." and then realized how stupid it was! Jennifer Gray plays Frances "Baby" Houseman in Dirty Dancing. The child starts studying in autumn. She goes to Kellerman's on vacation with her family (mom, dad and sister Lisa). One of the dancers, Penny (played by Cynthia Rhodes), gets another employee (one in college), the boys who played Max Cantor) and have a chance to get an abortion, but it's at night that her and Johnny (Patrick Swayze) are scheduled to dance at a nearby hotel. That's why a penny dancer is needed. Johnny believes Penny and his cousin Billy (Neal Jones) can teach the child to dance over time on the show. Baby teaches dance steps with Penny and Johnny are wonderful scenes! Children's father (Jake Houseman played by Jerry Orbach) comes to Penny's rescue when the miscarriage is done wrong. Dirty Dancing brought me this time in history, when the girls got pregnant and aborted the chicks in the back rooms. Around this time (1963) many girls died of this type of abortion - but there were not many options for the girl then. Lonnie Price plays a great cocky grandson (Neil Kellerman) to Max Max Max. Kellerman. Jane Brucker is doing a great job as annoying baby sister Lisa Houseman. Music is great and dancing is amazing! "Dirty dancers" are absolutely amazing and very sexy - I feel the child's amazement when they first see them dance and say, "Where did they learn it?" Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze are perfect together in their roles. Patrick's song "She's like the wind" brings tears to her eyes every time I hear / watch in this movie. The film ends up, but lets you know what happens next. in the life of a child and Johnny. Dirty Dancing gives something new every time he is watched - it fascinates the watchdog with nostalgia, the feeling he wants it to be 1963 again.
