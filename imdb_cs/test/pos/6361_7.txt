Dan Ackroyd in his main stars, such as Johgn Burns, a psychiatric asylum refugee who presents as his own whirlwind to travel to La La Land and host a popular radio talk show, while a regular guest (Charle Grodin in his snarling prime) takes a vacation. Along the way, Ackroyd joins Walter Matthau, a colleague, and the rest is a merry. Ackroyd and Matthau play very well. Ackroyd's overwhelming real wife, Donna Dixon, is driving for further downsizing. The end feels a little rushed and invented, which is the only thing that keeps me from making this movie my best rating, the 8th lost '80s gem.
