Duke is a very stupid movie - a dog becomes a duke! But it's a very funny movie. It has some of those corny jokes that many kids have movies, but (thankfully!) No bodily features jokes, like so many animal movies feel compelled to have! Mostly they are dogs and people. . . Okay, guys. "Good guys" are nice and attractive. "Bad boys" are ridiculous and, of course, the pun of many jokes. But there is something dignified about this movie because even if it's stupid, it's not for every cheap laugh, like "Home alone" and others. Crocket, Simon and Copper are doing a great job with Black and Tan Coonhound "Hubert", who becomes the Duke after his beloved owner, the real Duke, dies. Mostly behave like dogs, no "talking" or human emotions and attitudes. However, they make stereotyped poodles and Hubert makes a fall for her, just because she is a poodle. Come on! These are dogs - they have a different view of beauty !!! <br /> <br /> Overall, charming, fun and enjoyable.
