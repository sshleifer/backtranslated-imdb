I had the pleasure of seeing Saltimbanco live before I saw the video version of the series. Although nothing can be compared to what it really is, people behind the video have done an amazing job of capturing taste, feeling, feeling and much more. The wonderful performance of the amazingly amazing Saltimbanco ensemble is beautifully captured all over the world. The video goes as smoothly and artificially as the production itself. A wonderful experience.
