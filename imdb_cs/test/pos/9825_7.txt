I read more comments on this movie before I watched it. If you have read them, you will know that they are almost all negative. I really don't understand. I admit it's too long (it takes about half an hour to make it a little faster). Music is often inappropriate. But the strong performances of Ford and Thomas are really enough to prove it. With all the fame of the movie star, I forgot that Harrison Ford can really act! What is remarkable is this role of man, who has defined himself on the basis of lies. I find it absolutely credible that he wants all the details he can get to see what's real and what was fraud. Thomas is always amazing and this is no exception. Her initial denial, which leads to confusion and then to inner peace, is great. This movie will never be on anyone's list of big movies, but it's not that bad. I'm glad I was waiting for a video, but it's worth $ 3 or $ 4.
