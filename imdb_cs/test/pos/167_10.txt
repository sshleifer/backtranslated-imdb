Bloody birthdays play the supposed innocence of children and show them as bloodthirsty monsters. Steven (Andy Freeman), Curtis (Billy Jayne, credited as Billy Jacoby) and Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy), all were born the same day during an eclipse. In addition to sharing birthdays, they also shared the love of murder (and are not picky to kill). Young Billy, Elizabeth and Andy play quite well in these parts of these heartless monsters, but they know when to spell it. But they can no longer fool everyone. This is a good horror swing overall, it's not too unrealistic, there are a few good moments of tension and the children portray roles well (but adults are quite shocked). I'd say it's worth seeing (I have my own copy).
