It must be the best movie of all time (in my opinion). This really taught me when I watched when I was 10 (in 2000) that the freedom of a child slips out before we expect. Also, Joseph Mazzello must be my favorite actor at all, and I think he and the elijah wood did a great job in the role of brothers. This movie is pretty sad and some people don't understand it. But the story itself is incredible, the thought of a poor boy at the age of 7 (bobby), abused by the father of a drunken step, is horrible and what both boys do is sad and important. My favorite part of the movie is when Tom Hanks (older Mike) presents 7 things that are children that are lost in the adult world. However, there are some parts that could be done better in this movie, such as mother casting (lorraine braco), which I think is a terrible actor. "King" played his part well because it's a tough part to play. Joseph and Elijah were certainly the stars of the film. I couldn't believe how well the victims of the abusive stepfather had played, which was the age they were (7 and 9). But overall, I recommend this film to anyone who loves big children's actors and a great movie. :)
