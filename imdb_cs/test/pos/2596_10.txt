Chuck Jones's 'Rabbit Spice', the second in a much beloved hunting trilogy, is often considered to be the best of the three. Although I find it almost impossible to choose between these three fantastic cartoon films, I must admit that "Rabbit Seasoning" is the most beautiful scenario. Here, the emphasis is on language because Bugs and Daffy go through a series of complicated dialogues in the abbot Abbot and Costello's tradition of routine "Who's Next". As a longtime fan of Daffy, I have always been pleased with the hunting trilogy because it is consistently Daffy who gets all the best lines (the famous "Pronoun Trouble" is one of the classics of all time) and does most of the work. The bugs play the role of a cold manipulator, while Elmer, as always, is confused by a stomach. Part of what makes a hunting trilogy so much fun is that Daffy and Elmer pose such a small threat to Bugs that it's basically just kicking back and having some laughter. Elmer falls into every trap that is put for him, but he is a poor old Daffy who comes the worst, shoots his face again and again, his beak ends in more ridiculous positions. All this follows the inevitable declaration "You are despicable". As a complicated example of the perfect timing of Chuck Jones as you encounter, "Rabbit Spice" is a real classic.
