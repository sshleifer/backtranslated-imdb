I really liked this movie about love between two adults in post-war Britain. The high standard of BBC TV is evident in production, and excellent actors (Claire Bloom and Joss Ackland) make this uplifting experience. Bloom and Ackland have worked together in the theater before and their chemistry and interaction are wonderful. I recommend this version of Shadowlands over the 1993 movie version.
