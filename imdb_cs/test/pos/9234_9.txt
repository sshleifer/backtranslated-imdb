This is a very funny movie. There is a suicidal, iconoclastic tone to a film that is very attractive. The characters are interesting. The film spins very well and keeps your interest within 1 hour, 50 minutes of film duration. Film quality does not have the highest Hollywood standards; however the original film was to be made in the genre of bold punk-rock style. The documentary film and subsequent betrayal of filmmakers is very detailed and easy to follow. The original filmmakers are becoming the main characters in the documentary version of the film. The filmmakers 'and actors' interviews were gathered in a very entertaining story that illustrates the struggles in the creation of the original film, the possible failure of the original project, and the phoenix demeanor that evolved into this documentary. . In my opinion, the documentary (Texas Tale of Treason) is a more interesting and entertaining movie than the original film (Waldos Hawiian Vacation). Two inches up for a job well done.
