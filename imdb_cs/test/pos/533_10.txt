Adam Sandler's movies are my favorite comedies. The Silence of the Lambs is My Favorite Horror. Matrix is ​​my favorite sci-fi movie. Anywhere But here's my favorite drama. Perhaps the most precious asset this film has is playing. Susan Sarandon is absolutely amazing. At the end of this film, I felt like I knew her character better than I knew myself. She just did a great job. Natalie Portman did a great job. I recently rented my first movie, Leon (1994), in which she played a 12-year-old girl. I believe it is contradictory; she was a good actress. Well, five years later, the actress is still as good. In fact, it is much better. Not only did Sarandon and Portman paint their characters well, they also worked perfectly together. I don't think I can believe now that they are not really a mother and daughter in real life or in this movie. This film is about a 14-year-old girl (Portman) and her restless mother (Sarandon), who leaves their home town in Wisconsin for Beverly Hills. Initially, Portman hates his mother for taking her away from her cousin and friends, and both start a very turbulent relationship that goes up. and down over a few years (usually down, I can add). Although this explanation is a bit vague, the conspiracy can only be summarized vaguely. But when you see this movie, you'll see that the plot isn't really vague or weak, because it's really very deep. What I am saying is that the plot is outlined weakly, but then focus on being strong. And it's very strong, but the plot conspiracy is great too. And there are some brilliant scenes that I hope will one day be considered "classic". <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. I laughed. I cried. And although it is true that there are a few gaps, it is still a stellar film and is really missing at the end.
