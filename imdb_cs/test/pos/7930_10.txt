Eisenstein was not only one of the greatest Soviet, Russian, film directors, but one of the great film masters, between Griffith, Murnau, Ford, Hitchcock, Welles and others. One of the greatest things in all his films was the edition, very personal, and exceptional in this film. It was his first sound film and the use of the musical score of the great Russian composer Serge Prokofiev in the battle order is a perfect contrast between music and image. Watching this movie is like an hour or a cinema lesson, which many film directors can't afford. I never like REAL CLASSICS watches like this movie. I hope that more people will recognize a great work of art in the near future.
