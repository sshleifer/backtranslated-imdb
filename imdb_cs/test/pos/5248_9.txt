With the relatively recent release of "Fados" Carlos Saura in the United States of America (albiet and limited art publishing house), it is high time to re-release this documentary on Amalia Rodrigues. This film is the treasury of Amalia's historical film clips on Portuguese and American television, as well as various other movie clips, including one of her and her mother, which could easily reduce most of the macho man's tears. For the first time I saw this subtle documentary a few years ago when it received an unauthorized release of "art house" (it deserved much better). Fortunately, there are various recordings of the best Amalia recordings on various "budget line" recordings (which are generally available in places like K-Mart or Best Buy), or you can improve some of the original versions if you search a bit, and either on E-Bay or on one of the distribution services that specialize in expensive European imported CDs. At least two versions of this document are in circulation (the original Portuguese version, no English subtitles and the American version in Portuguese with English subtitles, except for the European version, cannot be played on most USDVD players, due to the PAL system color). It is not rated by the MPAA, but it does not contain any insult.
