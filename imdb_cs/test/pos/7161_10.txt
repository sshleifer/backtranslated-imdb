I just returned from the GLBT Film Festival at AMC Loews 34 in New York. A friend told me about this movie. Audience response was very positive! Lots of good solid laughs, as well as quiet moments of realization. Top notch in every area. A film that makes you think, and then you realize how lucky we all should be if we can go back and live without shame or guilt. I imagine it will approach, if not win, the popular audience award! What was most surprising is the fact that the film looks like it starts as a satire and then slowly sneaks into the true commentary on the negative and sometimes violent reactions of the group that began satirizing. At the expense of one group there is no sensible humor, only a slow knowledge that we would all be better if we returned to the subtle innocence that we all started with.
