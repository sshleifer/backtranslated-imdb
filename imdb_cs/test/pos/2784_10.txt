The young Frenchman emerged as a student of the Erasmus exchange program in Barcelona and returned to a better man. Sounds boring? In any case! The film is filled with colorful people, all of which are stereotypes (British jerk and her racist brother, sexually liberated Dan, ultralight German, ...). In this case, however, the stereotypes are perfectly executed. You feel like you know people like this one (I know one arrogant doctor and his trophy wife, and they are just like the characters in the movie!), They feel like they are real people! <br /> <br /> Go see this movie and enjoy the headlines!
