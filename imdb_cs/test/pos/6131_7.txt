This is a really amazing story and the most amazing part of it all is that it is really happening! If you haven't noticed: it's based on a true story. <br /> <br /> (Possible Spoiler) <br /> <br /> Imagine shock and horror when you find your father was an SS officer in WW II. It's a very interesting story and I'm really surprised that the movie is rated poor on imdb.com 5.3. <br /> <br /> my course: 7
