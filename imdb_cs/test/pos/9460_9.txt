I captured this film right in my eye as I walked around the poster hall in a nearby cinema. The tag line was a bit confusing, and right after reading it, I thought of the possibility that it would be similar to the Lampoon's Dorm Daze. I liked the movie, except that I had a huge collection of such genres, I decided to hit him in the cinema right after the tension release tests. I came out beautifully with a smile from face to face and had the same amount of laughter on the pieces and points of the movie. Certainly Amanda Bynes fired him better than Keira Knightley in Bend It Like Beckham. Being both male and female actor is definitely not the kind that has to face the similarities of life, along with the reactions the actress has to react to. This film requires a lot of confusion to confuse ourselves and the audience. The only way to download it is through this movie. The principle is obviously sick, seriously, girls are just as sexy and beautiful as are actors. I would recommend this movie to everyone who needs a weekend break and don't worry, you'll laugh all over the movie. It's a guarantee.
