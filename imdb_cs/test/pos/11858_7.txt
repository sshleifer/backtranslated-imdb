I went through the channel many times, mainly because the synopsis sounded so cheesy, so "Love American Style". But it turned out to be quite good, very well done. These two stand-out features are dialogue and action. Great cast. The assumption is actually well made and there are not too many weak moments. I think what impressed me most was how often you thought the wheels would go out of the cart, and instead the wheel just turns around, so to speak, and the movie is still flying. There are some nice little sub-lands, especially a relationship that develops between the character played by former Conan Sidekick Andy Richter. I would also like to mention that the music she accompanied was good.
