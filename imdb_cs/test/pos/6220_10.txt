Jäniksen vuosi is one of Jarv's most political films. It persists strongly against the current status of modern society in the lives of ordinary people and how it alienates men by nature completely. It challenges the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our welfare society. Vatanen (Antti Litja) - overwhelmed the purchase of a particular jungle with all its rules and regulations - trying to expel the company chains by escaping everything in the wilderness of northern Finland - just to realize that the concept of "free country" is not so unequivocal, in other words, society has balls of ordinary man. Jäniksen vuosi is so special - in addition to visual and humorous brilliance - it seems to illustrate the entire political atmosphere in Finland in the 1970s, as well as the entire identity of Finland as a nation. Vatanen is like an archetype of classical finna in its solitude and social distance. Since nature has always played such an important role in the national identity of the Finns, the whole idea that modern society is slowly getting rid of modern society makes Jäniksen vuosi emotionally exceptionally mobile.
