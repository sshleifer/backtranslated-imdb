What is nice to watch random movies randomly is that one never knows what to expect or where another great piece of cinema appears. Recently, my tracking has taken the form of stitched classics like "Raging Bull" or "Lost Ark Raiders", but this time my video recorder took me away from modern conveniences and pushed me right in front of Lionel Jeffries "The Railway Kids". three juvenile children, mysterious events with their father, relocation to the open fields of England, and finally rewards inherited by mere trains, At first glance, this seemingly simple children's film does not seem so promising that it has been lost to VHS for a while during the first fifteen minutes of this film, one realizes that it is more than just your common children's film. "" Railroad Kids "was created when cleanliness was more than just saying" no "when family meant everything, and where the adventure was prepared for you in every yard.This is more than an adorable movie, it has amazingly used film technique , keeps a regular viewer stuck to the screen with unanswered questions and gives three perfect companions to follow this 110-minute journey. "Rail Kids" is a lost treasure that must be seen by both families and movie enthusiasts. There are a few moments that proudly appear in "Railway Children" that turn it from mediocrity to perfection? one becomes our three children; Bobby, Phyllis and Peter. The modern cinema assures us that these three children cannot provide enough darkness, laughter and insight into the world that surrounds them, but Jeffries' children prove the opposite. From intelligently spoken lines (from both acting and script) to the sincere kindness and dedication of this little village to the final meeting at this train stop; These children are more than just children's stars advancing the story, leading us through emotions, persuasion and realism, which today's children don't see. In this little VHS there is more imagination than I have witnessed in film for years. The favorite scene that could be worked out with the generality I saw in other films was Bobby's birthday scene. The way Jeffries floats it between guests and gifts has been exciting and refreshing, keeping our eyes on every scene, just like our minds. Another scene that took my attention was when the kids worked on the gifts for Perky when he asked one man for a gift, Jeffries just said, "No, I don't." Children 's reaction is cheerful? They provide moments for both children and adults to enjoy. Filmed in the 1970s, this little feature provides real laughter than most modern comedies. It is a creative film combined with great choreography and direction. This means that just as I loved this movie, it wasn't perfect. Jeffries has a great job of guessing what happened to my father, but this event seemed to happen, the children were kept in the dark and suddenly resolved. More details about the father, not much more, would reinforce his character and give us the opportunity to see more children's reactions. There is also one scene in this film, one of those magnificent shots from the English countryside, which is only breathtaking, but if you look a little closer, you will see the background of the car. That made me laugh, but I didn't turn too much of the picture. A cinema like this is very missing today, and strangely, it seems that only the British want to make it. Films such as "Love, Actually" or "Vicar of Dibley" demonstrate the power and excitement of community cities, places where everyone knows everyone and we are not afraid to be a neighbor. Is this more a topic that the American audience can have more? More understanding of what is going on outside, instead of being left alone to make your own events. Overall, I loved "Rail Kids". I didn't know what to expect when I first put it on a VHS player, but from the opening scene, to the exploding set of trains, to the Perks birthday, Jeffries proved he could handle the most enjoyable story with the kids. His ability to make child actors feel like they were real characters, less involved in adults, and engaging children like adults was excellent. This is a movie to be seen as a powerful alternative to any Disney release. Permanent themes of friendship, kindness to strangers, and pardon by television explosion with grace and power. "Rail Kids" is more than just a children's film; it is a feature that should be the basis of modern audience tracking. Not only does this give a great visual appearance to English countryside, it also teaches (and shows) how life would be bigger with an emphasis on imagination and courage, instead of fighting against all fallen CGIs. <br /> <br /> Class: **** Â½ of *****
