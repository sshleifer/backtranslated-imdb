I loved this movie from start to finish. I am a musician and I have the medication get in the way of my some things I loved (skateboarding, drawing), but my friends have always been there for me.Music was like my rehabilitation, life support, and my cure.I changed my life. totally related to this movie and i would get there was more i could say. This movie left me without being honest. I just saw it on Ifc.I usually hate to have a satellite but it was perk to have the satel.The ifc channel shows some really great movies and without it i would never find this movie.Im is not a big fan of international movies because i find that a lot of don 't make a very good job of translating lines.I mean obvious language barriers let you just believe it is what they say, but its not so big business i think i almost never see this amazing movie.Good thing i stayed for it instead of going to bed .. sooner than usual.lol.I hope that they all look forward to hell this movi ea love this movie just like i did.I wish i could write it all in caps but its again the rules i think it is shouting but it would really show my excitement for the movie. it three thumbs up! br /> <br /> This BLEW ME AWAY movie!
