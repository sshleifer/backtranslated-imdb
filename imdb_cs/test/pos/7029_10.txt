<br /> <br /> When this movie was released I refused as a light pop nonsense. That was a mistake. After repeated viewing and seeing the documentary about DIRTY DANCING, exploring the depth of this film certainly increases its attractiveness. <br /> <br /> DIRTY DANCING is a film about change. The evolving nature of family relationships, changes in the worldview during their age, etc. The story takes place in August 1963, the last weeks of the last summer of innocence for Americans. Many of the personal changes that character characterize reflect the many changes in American society that would be affected by the assassinations of Kennedy and Vietnam. Female film go'ers adored this film and repeated trips to film houses. it is the most successful dance film in the world. As a male, I find a romantic pairing of Patrick Swayze's last stud with a very simple Jennifer Gray that's hard to accept. This would be fatal for most romantic dramas, and it also can create intense resistance expressed by most male reviewers. The movie soundtrack found # 1 status before the movie was released. To this day, it is almost impossible to attend a wedding reception without hearing the song DIRTY DANCING. Near the center of the film, the baby's mother wakes up and asks her child's father: "Is something wrong?" A child's father, a family member against change, tries to keep everything that happens in secret. He tells his wife to go back to sleep. Resistance as one can, change is unstoppable. DIRTY DANCING is the story of one person who awakens at the very last moment of our country's last sleep in innocence.
