One day I caught it on TV when I was young and I loved it. In the 1970s it was a lot of lame comedies that were trying to be too funny, so it was a nice surprise. It's one of the finest comedies of the 1970s and the definitive summer camp comedy, thanks to Murrary's excellent comedy performance, which is still one of his greatest. This is a movie that Ivan Reitman noticed as a director. Reitman proves that he is one of the most talented directors of comedy ever. Although this movie is merry and MEATBALLS 2 is so bad that it's fun, MEATBALLS 3 and MEATBALLS 4 are absolutely terrible. Recommended for those who enjoy STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS.
