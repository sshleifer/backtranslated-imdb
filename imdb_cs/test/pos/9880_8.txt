LOVED this movie when I was younger and I was actually looking again! I'd love to watch it again !! All the information is correct, but the cover doesn't seem to fit - but I can't say it. From what I recall, there was a film about these children (Alyssa Milano, Tina Yothers, etc.) In the management class and also shows the badness with which they get out of class. Edie McClurg was the mother of Alyssy Milano in the film. I remember I liked it, so if anyone knows where I can get a copy (preferably a DVD) of the movie above (with the stars in it) I'd like to know. Thank you :)
