I loved this show. I think when I first tried rocky road ice cream, it was because of this show. Wasn't the store located right on the beach or something? I've been writing back and forth with Marci for several years. I lost touch and I wish I could reconnect as an adult. Anyone knows where he is now? I wish they'd put it on DVD. I seriously doubt that because I think about five or six people who remember the show broadcast first. They don't do it like that anymore, do they? I wonder if it would be worth it today. Do you know anyone who could burn a DVD from a show they recorded on VHS? I would be willing to pay (within reason).
