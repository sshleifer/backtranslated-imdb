Well, I'll admit that if I didn't have children, I'd never see this movie and never see it. But with all the rotten movies I've seen (such as SPY KIDS 2 or BABE: PIG IN THE CITY), it's a significant improvement. And it was enough for me not to get bored with my skull or suicide (something I did repeatedly in the other two movies). Sure, the performances are pretty wide and the story is a little stupid - but it's a children's movie. And compared to other films in the genre, it's definitely better than average. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bines actually seem to have some talent and will probably have a career after puberty - at least on infomercials or making voice-overs. So if you're looking for a movie, see with your kids, you could definitely do a lot worse!
