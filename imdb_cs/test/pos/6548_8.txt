After discovering the Rings Trilogy, I hated all those Japanese and Korean films that are either on or off the train. Certainly pushed some of my buttons, though I can't claim that the movie makes a lot of sense. I'm upset, so there were a few points in the movie when I didn't want to watch what was happening on the screen. The film made me angry, so I was afraid to see things I thought I'd see. It's an imaginative film that visually offers a lot of things. It also provides food for thought. And a lot of material to argue when the movie is over. The characters are at least well defined. Could they do films in the West like that? Finally, it doesn't make sense, but when one has a taste for occultism, supernatural, bizarre, second world, then no. the film will provide a final explanation.
