Although video technology can be dated, this classic music game, now on DVD, is the best version of Sondheim's most important and polished work on Broadway. If you've never seen SWEENEY TODD, you need to buy this DVD. I saw this production in November 1980 at the Kennedy Center in Washington - and I fell in love with the pre-"Murder of She Wrote" by Angela Lansbury. Subsequently, I tried to find any of her work, among them: FILMS: "Harvey Girls", "The Picture of Dorian Gray", "Manchurian Candidate"; CD: "Mame", "Dear World" and "Gypsy"; and many others. The rest of the cast is also flawless. All in all, this wonderful DVD gives us the definitive version of Sondheim!
