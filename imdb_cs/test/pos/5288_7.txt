Hayao Miyazaki captured the imagination of young and old audiences around the world, and his latest film work is "Ponyo", a fairy tale for children who borrowed from the Little Mermaid's story elements. Of course, like other Miyazaki classics such as "Spirited Away" and his latest film "Howl's Moving Castle", "Ponyo" is full of creativity that adults can really appreciate. effort. It is a magical story that is best described as beautiful and sweet, focused on magic instead of conflict. "Ponyo" is a story about fish of the same name that resemble children. an underwater wizard who desires to escape the sea and become a little girl. When he does, he quickly connects with a young boy named Sosuke. In the process, she gains strong magic and unknowingly throws the world out of balance between land and sea, and a huge storm drowns most of the reef where Sosuke lives with her mother, threatening to end the world. Like "Howl's Moving Castle," Walt Disney picked up "Ponyo" for the US release, calling him an impressive selection of Western voices, even picking home products in the youngest Disney Jonas Brothers (Frankie Jonas) and Miley Cyrus (younger sister of Noah) to voice Sosuke and Ponyo, respectively. The characters are also Liam Neeson (Fujimoto, Pony's father), Tina Fey (Lisa, Sosuke's mother), Matt Damon (Sosuke's father), Cate Blanchett (mother of Ponyo, goddess of the sea), and three cheerful elderly women play Betty White. Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin. The effort is definitely there to make this film appeal to the American audience and Disney is coming. But voices are of little significance in Miyazaki, which is about visual creativity. A fan of transformations and animations of fluid and fluid motion, creating a fairy tale that takes place partially under water, must have been a joy to work with, and perhaps all of its motivation for choosing this story. The most important are the drops of water that Fujimoto sends to Ponyo, which move like live waves, as well as a number of other beautiful sea creatures and breathtaking scenes that make "Ponyo" as much as any other Miyazaki movie. But as a children's story, "Ponyo" focuses its efforts on pleasure. The discovery of true friendship and love between Sosuke and Pony is heartbeat, though Noah Cyrus screamed childishly when Ponyo enthusiastically embraces human life, and may be a little uncomfortable. But as beautiful as many imaginative elements and loving relationships, there is very little antagonism or danger. Past Miyazaki movies have clear villains, but the conflict in "Ponyo" actually shrinks as the story goes on. Sosuke believes he has lost his mother in one place, and in the background is the idea of ​​the world that it will disappear and that people should be ashamed of the pollution of the sea, but "Ponyo" is mostly tense. The most prominent is his climax, no matter how sympathetic all characters are. "Ponyo" will surely satisfy Miyazaki fans with their imaginations and newcomers will still be suppressed by its simple yet visually ambitious storytelling, but it is clearly more film for children, best for families and others who love fantasy without regardless of its form or target audience. It is not exactly what you would expect from Miyazaki for his recent work, but you certainly remember it as another of his beloved stories. ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
