Certainly one of the most distinctive films of all time. Great original music, clever, intoxicating ... it's hard to talk about such a good thing. There is no character you should not immediately love - Myronex "Putney, there are trouble in the black room!" "My name is Rufus." Lines left and right are themselves classics, reminiscent of Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialogue is not formal. "Putney, Myronex called you tasteless!" "My organization is pro-integration ..." "Where is Lopez?" "It doesn't sound brilliant until you hear them in the scene. This movie will eat your brain, it's too good. I read reviews calling this film racist who couldn't be further from the truth. Each scene is golden, from commercial ethereal grain to the brothers meeting in a black room with that horrible pipe in the final scene. One word - a genius.
