The Central Airport is a pilot story named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flying. She meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two are starting to talk about flying and stunts. They both start a relationship, but when Jim is hurt, his brother (Tom Brown) takes the act for a while and falls on his brother's girlfriend. From there things are exciting and terribly sad. This movie is a pre-code for several reasons. First, Jim and Jill filled their relationship without getting married, and without the intention of having a wedding. Second, Eilers is pictured in her underwear, and an absolutely limited scene when the Production Code came into effect. This film does not happen on a dramatic love triangle and as a result it ends bitterly.
