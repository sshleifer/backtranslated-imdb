I managed to see MTV's premiere of this movie last night and I had to tell everyone that this movie brought thunder. Obviously, this movie will be the most entertaining fans of D because it has a lot of in-jokes for those who have seen the HBO series and has more than enough D for newer fans and a number of early-to-be converts. The music really shines with new songs "Kickapoo" (which is much better than it sounds), "Master Exploder" (maybe the third best song in the world) and "Dude (I miss it)". There are lots of great scenes (chase for car, rock-offs, meetings) and portraits (including Dave Grohl as Satan!). I really could go for hours, but I don't want to give up the movie. Go see it. You won't be disappointed.
