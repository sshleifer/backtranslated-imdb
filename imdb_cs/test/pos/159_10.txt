If you love Chan-wook Park, you know what to expect. His films are brutal, poetic, tragic and artistic, with a splash of very grim humor. THIRD is clearly Park's style, and I loved every second of cinematography (every shot is beautiful and creative) into a story that combines Shakespeare's tragedy, murderous love, Gothic horror, and layered character. Characters are complex and there is a lot of moral ambiguity. Even the sociopathic character evokes sympathy. The direction is limited and performances are nuances - like SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE, there are too many little things at first glance. Chan-wook Park is an intelligent, courageous, constantly surprising filmmaker. It's unpredictable - the scenes are laughing from the brutal and heartbreaking moment. That's closer to LADY VENGEANCE and then to SYMPATHY PRO MR. VENGEANCE in terms of premium and comic. But like LADY VENGEANCE, it's incredibly rich, provocative and rewarding. <br /> <br /> If you like the beautifully told vampire stories (LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) or you are a fan of Chan-wook Park, you see the third should be obvious. Easily one of the best films of 2009.
