I loved this movie because Bobbie Phillips can really fight! I always hate when actors aren't believable in action parts. It was great to see, no offense, but a woman who could do martial arts and fight. If you compare it with most action movies with women, you will DEFINITELY see what I mean. He doesn't have to cut shots with someone who can fight, and it does flow better. I was very impressed. I hope there's more!
