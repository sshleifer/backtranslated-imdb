(WARNING: SPOILERS!) <br /> <br /> Five young people ignore the warning of George Kennedy, a forest guardian, embarking on the hazy mountains of Oregon where they are being chased and defeated by a pair of huge, deformed, in-bred twins. With only two left, Warren and his girl Connie resort to their animal instincts to stay alive. The film ends when Connie shoves half his arm with one of the throats of the killers and hits him to death. Very powerful, if overestimated, the effective use of lighting, sound and photography makes it a cut above the usual amount of money. This handy piece by Jeff Lieberman SQUIRM (1976) and BLUE SUNSHINE (1977) should not miss an attractive, likeable cast, especially Deborah Benson (where is he now) and Gregg Henry.
