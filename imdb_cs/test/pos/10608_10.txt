I just finished watching Marigold today and start by finding this DVD on the stunt shelves. While I am looking for something new and good to watch, Ali Larter's image captivated me. After drowning out Ali Larter, I picked up the cover and continued to look around the cover. From that point of view, I thought the costumes were a bit up. And then I saw the other Indians on the cover and found it was a spoof movie or something. When I switched part of the synopsis and saw Salman Khan, I did a double action. Salman Khan in American Movie with Ali Larter on DVD on Blockbuster? Since Salman Khan is a Bollywood movie like Mel Gibson on Hollywood movies, I had very high expectations for this movie: it was good! I'm very glad Marigold is a phenomenal movie! It's far exceeded all my personal expectations! I suppose a movie like what happens when you have a decent script, a talented, experienced, knowledgeable and targeted director, two incredible actors playing lead roles and just a very hard work cast and crew support! Khan and Larter seem to have really great chemistry and they both shine on the big screen: they look really good together. The music numbers were not bad at all, which was surprising when we considered how long Indian movies are nowadays musical. And you will be glad that Indian costumes are very far from being kitschy as you get. The beginning of the movie was a bit slow, in the middle it was really good, the scenes leading to the top were dramatic, but the end was just amazing! But I have a couple of grips and complaints about the DVD. Although I loved the widescreen DVD aspect ratio, I didn't like the fact that several other things were left out on the DVD. There are no headlines for beginners. Now English is my first language, it's not a problem. But when some Indian actors and actresses spoke, it was (sometimes) difficult to understand what they were saying; captioning would help. Another thing I'd appreciate on a DVD would be a reel or some outtakes collection. Finally, how about the menu function that would allow us to jump directly to the music numbers? Men, some of those songs were really good! On the other hand, I enjoyed watching Marigold's work. <br /> <br /> I have a lot more to say about the amazingness of this movie and how I enjoyed it, but I don't have the time or the time to keep writing why I enjoyed it so much. I hope Salman Khan does more English movies in addition to her Hindi films and I hope that this Hindi film will not be Ali Larter's latest Bollywood movie. And I encourage the director to continue producing Bollywood movie hybrids featuring Salman Khan, Ali Larter and other great actors - just make sure the scripts are original and good. 10/10 - This is just a great love story movie that the whole family can enjoy!
