Well, maybe he doesn't deserve an Oscar. Or Golden Globe. Or any price for that thing. Acting is not excellent, there is no reason to give credits directing, and its really just another semi-gory 21st century slasher film that most people will consider decent. Or maybe horrible. But in my opinion it doesn't matter. And that's because I had a great time watching this movie. Of course, the first 40 minutes are pretty slow, but as the movie progresses, something in it will make you enjoy it if you're like me, and someone else should be watching this movie. And that is: looking for 2 hours of fun, mindless violence. (And the ending that I will not spoil.) Yes, there are a lot of drawbacks in this movie, but don't be thrown up on the front cover. Hilton brings decent performance that no one has seen. Even her greatest haters like me and my friends had to agree that she was very surprised by her barely believable acting skills and a stripper who wasn't as ugly as her online pop-ups promised, but still not so unbearable when fast forwarding or turning off the DVD. Violence was a surprise to me; no one in school or horror playground talked about it as if they were about "these new movies called" Saw "and" Hostel ", but I could safely say that" Wax "was more graphic than Saw, and some scenes of death were actually Quite worrying. In conclusion, I'm not surprised House of Wax didn't create a place on the IMDb Top 250, but it's definitely worth a look.
