This is the first of the Ma and Pa electric kettle. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show in whatever she's doing. It's fun to see Ida Moore as Emily, the old old lady on the train .. God who has always been old; she was in the "Desktop" and "Alfred Hitchcock Don". Their new house is also co-star here - his house of the future with some really cool inventions that Pa doesn't care about. LOVE picture gag. Watch out for Tom ... he played in "Nanny & the Professor". Unfortunately, a real young man died ... Surprisingly, his last role was on "Death Cruise". strange. Directed by: Charles Lamont, who has not only directed several Kettle films, but has also made a lot of Abbott and Costello films, so he had to know something about comedy. Fun story, simple, simple humor. Even the release date was in April, 1949. The story begins with showing us what backward and land-folk are (neighbors are even natives), but as the story progresses, we have sympathy and respect for it.
