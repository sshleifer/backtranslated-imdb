Alexander Lou, star of the classics, such as the subtitles "The Super Ninja" and "Mafia vs Ninja" here in this fun martial arts festival. The conspiracy involved Abbott White (who boasts some humongous and, frankly, somewhat frightening-looking white eyebrows) gaining the help of a ninja clan to overthrow the Shaolin Temple. This goal, which he achieves and exterminates most of his members, even though there is no need to say, one or two manages to survive and rather predictably resume the exact possible revenge on the wrong Abbott. a movie called 'Wu Tang vs Ninja' aka 'Ninja Hunter' really depends on such insignificant factor as conspiracy? Of course not! - These are the battles that matter about these movies and the gum. There are some great choreographies of martial arts on display from all involved in this and rarely a minute seems to go without a fight to break out for some reason. <br /> <br /> If your ever into martial arts movies then it has to be seen!
