He brought Philip Larkin to life in a way that is worthy of the greatest performances of all time, not just those that are measured by popularity. It shows the sharp image of Larkins' life as the greatest unrecognized poet of his era - which is exactly how he would want it, such was his disdain for cankers and medallions. It dramatically reveals the raw beauty of the intense sadness of Philips observation from our relationship with our own mortality and stores it in a way that even the great philosophers seemed to lack. for anyone who is interested in deeply observing our relationship to life, love and death, this is a necessity.
