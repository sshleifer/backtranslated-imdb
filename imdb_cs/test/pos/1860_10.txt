I believe that the reason this film did not get the credit it deserves is a lot of misconceptions about Darwin, pro and con. I'd say a real man is shown here without sterility. He is what he is. Though the film is a snapshot of man, the narrative technique has extended its life far beyond the years covered by the film. This is a profound film, thinking about modern life and the way we think, and can provoke a study of a person whose thoughts (and others who used it) have certainly influenced our lives. There are some movies that the historical context is so great that it is the primary task of the actors to stay out of the way. History carried the day and the actors did their job. Good work to them, I say.
