The primary plus for this film is a combination of Chris Farley and David Spade. It was the first film in which the comedy duo exhibited its humorous brand, Laurel-Hardy. Farley's apparent physical comedy skill is perfectly extended to the sarcastic Spade situation in every situation they find themselves. This film is among other comedy films. Tommy Boy ranks with the Blues Brothers as a comedy whose individual scenes and pieces stem from the action, rather than serve to break the story and give the film a discontinuous feel, like many other comedy films. Thanks to the excellent direction of Sagal, each scene is tight and instantly foreshadows or tells the story. He is so much to acknowledge the film's hilarious as Farley and Spade are. Playing Dennehy, Lowe, Ackroyd and many more (see service station staff 22 miles from Davenport) strengthens this film. The film guarantees more views because there are many subtle nuances on the film, it can be overshadowed by Farley / Spade. <br /> <br /> I believe this movie is very good and it's the funniest movie I've ever seen.
