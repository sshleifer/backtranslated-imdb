Whatever Park Chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant and very twisted to a minimum. Nothing I'm Cyborg. Park is the latest movie called Thirst is a vampire romance-erotic-thriller-dark comedy-drama? yes, that is a lot of adjectives? Inspired by French novel 19th century Emile Zoly called Therese Raquin. The park creates a uniquely Korean and uniquely park vision of vampire mythos and asks viewers to explore the dilemma of a Catholic priest who has discovered that he is thirsty for blood and a moral and spiritual crisis that would develop. The park adds to the elements you would have hoped for, but certainly does not achieve the quality of a masterpiece like Oldboy or even Lady Vengeance. Thirst, heavily inflated by a narrative that often loses much less than the audience, desperately needed another way through the editing room. It crawls when it should be run, but fortunately it will bring back home before losing the audience completely. How negative it may sound positively certainly outweigh the negative and another unquestionably has been added to the dark and twisted Zeitgeist Park Chan-wook movie. <br /> <br /> Check out the rest of our review at www.thefilmstage.com
