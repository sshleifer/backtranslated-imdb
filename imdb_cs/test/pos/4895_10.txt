I must admit that when I first learned about the Apocalypse movie, it was fear. I mean, they have a lot of life, don't they? When they first made a theater show, they won the Perrier Award and won the Sony award when they made the radio. When they went to our telly, they won the Bafta Prize, the Royal Television Company Award and the Golden Rose of Montreux. When the first series aired in January 1999, it was overwhelming! The real breath of fresh air in the British comedy, and when the second series aired a year later, built on that foundation and concealed iconic status all over the world, our web statistics show that we have received visitors from every country on this planet. ! The 'Local Show for Local People' introduced men's talent for live performance and opened the door for gents to make more live performances such as 'Art' at the West End. Favorite fans have always been a Christmas special, less sketch and more homage to classic horror movies, which are still packed in a delicious League style. And of course there was a "difficult" third series, still a hit with loyal hardcore fans, of course, but maybe a little before his time for a mainstream television audience. As I say, live a lot. So now we have the movie and ... Well the movie is different, right? This will see much larger numbers than radio or TV shows and I was afraid of the third series in mind. Well, as you know, I was fortunate enough to have seen a movie yesterday at a London screening and all my doubts were blown away (literally) in the first few minutes! I will not give storylines, as some reviewers have done, nor will I tell you about catches (even if it is just one), but I will try to tell you what this film has achieved! When I left the cinema on Monday night, I could only imagine that I wrote "Oh my God, it's brilliant, its amazing, the best they've ever done, better than the first, the second and the specials that are in one cylinder Of course, I owe my visitors a much better explanation than that! So why is it brilliant? This is a movie for everybody, an occasional fan, an obsessive fan of the occasional fan and even someone who is in the wrong movie theater! You didn't have to watch the show to enjoy this movie; It works on many levels. This film reminded me why I'm a Gentlemen's League! You can say that shooting was also a true work of love; attention to detail is incredible. TV show kits have always been detailed, but I just have to look at the movie again in the background! The story is moving at a fast pace, the action carries us from Royston Vasey to the real world where we meet "Creators" who are of course the League itself! Along the way we come across popular characters from the show, but always in the central story, unlike the TV show sketch. <br /> <br /> I was glad the movie was dark in places, a little scary and a little weird ... just good for the Lords League. Ghents also managed to get revenge on BBC censors, not slip through the word "mongoloid" as he yelled them out of the roof! Some may think that the Gents appear to be a little indulgent, but that's a joke, and with that comes my only concern, some viewers can argue in the jokes I mentioned below, and they might come up with a little too clever ... fear , there is always a poo joke waiting just around the corner and talking about jokes, they come strong and fast, and mixed with clever links, wit jokes, bum jokes, visual jokes and cock gags! I must not laugh at the cinema loudly because ... well, I can't remember! Fans who have been 's' League from the beginning are rewarded with lots of 'in' jokes, some who work on two levels, the main audience can laugh at the link to the compact disc for one reason while the fans of the local show will laugh for another reason entirely ! Portraits are a genius! Peter Kay and Simon Pegg form the strangest double act you've ever seen. I was a little worried about the aspect of the 1690 movie when I first heard about it, but as a story in a story I just got into when ... but that would be a story! All I have to say is that it fits perfectly and contributes to the overall film feeling! I am not a professional film reviewer, so it is difficult for me to say how much I enjoyed this movie, but for now I'm just saying that if the alleged benchmark of British comedy films in recent years was an excellent Shaun Dead, then I'm sorry, but the new benchmark was just an inventive, hilarious and sometimes a little scary ... League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse. Jason Kenny 2005
