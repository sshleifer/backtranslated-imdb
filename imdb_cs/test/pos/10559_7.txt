I watched this series after Tipping the Velvet, for which I gave 10/10. I read user comments on this topic and expected the same good series, or even better. At this point, I must emphasize that this series is good, and I am sure it has attracted me around the world and so it's worth watching. However, I get it just like Tipping Velvet, for the following reasons: 1. Less passion, love, and related sexual content. In these elements, there was a surprisingly little emphasis I had as an integral part of the love story. Fingersmith felt like an irrigated version of Tipping the Velvet. 2. Like in Tipping the Velvet, the story had three parts: the beginning, the shocking second part and the end. The second part was supposed to be the culmination of the story (as well as in Tipping the Velvet), but instead was almost completely omitted, perhaps because of the inability to make a shocking but believable content of asylum. The series was to be in three parts, with two cliffhangers, with much more focus on the second part. 3. Almost no weight was given to what the Fingersmiths were and how it influenced their personalities. It seemed somewhat unpleasant to me that the series did not properly address the central theme. 4. The end was much faster than in Tipping the Velvet. Fingersmith left some interesting plot lines open. Despite these shortcomings, Fingersmith is a good series and worth 7/10. But it is not a classic like Tipping the Velvet.
