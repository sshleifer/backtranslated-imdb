All comments so far on this movie are negative, but I have to say that I found "The Net" engaging. Few movies can keep me on the edge of my seat, but I did that. Another plus for this is that most action / tension movies are full of language, but this one had little profanity. I found this funny movie I watch. However, I am a little biased because I'm a big fan of Sandra Bullock. *blink*
