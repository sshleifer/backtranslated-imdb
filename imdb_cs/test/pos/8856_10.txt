Following the line of the classic formula to the point where another material emerges from the material, the remake of Thing becomes one of the most beautiful remake of its time. John Carpenter of fashion from what must have been quite a vague scenario about certain things (or perhaps very descriptive, who knows), bringing incredibly miserable, brilliant puppetry and Rob Bartin's animatronics (with Stan Winston also on the team). These effects help set the tone against a rough, separate environment. The film is based on the group's story, which is located in a research bunker in the middle of the Arctic climate and is opposed to the malevolent power of others. It is due to the full life of choosing tones and surprises. For someone who follows in the footsteps of Howard Hawks, the filmmaker has much more confidence and talent in doing the material than most of them have given a chance for another film with an old film. With the effects of people working at full strength - in the middle of what would probably be Backdraft how to contain the most fires on the scene (it could become overkill, but it all fits in after a while) . Unlike the Predator team, these are mostly ordinary working people, with the leader coming from MacCreedy Kurt Russell (a very good role for his style, in fact, excellent). Juicy support roles are for graby for the likes of Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how it is the absurdity of what is happening in the film (an alien who starts with dogs and then shifts to others in the gorii, a demented transformation form), against such a timing tone with everyone. I loved the occasional silence, with a lot of Ennio Morricone, curious background music (and the fact that the bass line itself is due). It's up with being if nothing else brings aspirations to its genre / cult audience. It remains one of the best carpenters; a rare horror movie where the story is told clearly and precisely according to camera position, dialogue and timing with scenes. This does not mean that the film is not overcrowded with violence, it is, and in fact it is several times almost funny. But since it is returning to what is ridiculously looking like an era, creatures / make-up, along with a stable, well-calculated scenario, have been done entirely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real and atmospheric.
