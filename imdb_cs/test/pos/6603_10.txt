My son, a passionate skateboarder, put me down and forced me to watch him. As I love documentary films, it didn't put much pressure on his side. The whole amazing story of it all - a bunch of kids who are poor in dirt, engulf and eventually create something revolutionary out of nothing - well, more of some wood, bikes and lack of surfing waves. He still does it. I didn't think I'd like the way I did, nor did I think I'd tear Stacey Peralta's sight over Jay Adams's fate. And just watching Adam Adams himself ..... a complete skating genius and an adult shrug. Last night I watched him have to be tenth and I still get goose goats watching him fly downhill with Jimi Hendrix "Freedom" playing in the background. And I ripped again. Not too many movies have the same effect with me after several views. Brilliant.
