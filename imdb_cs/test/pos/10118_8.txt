After reading the unemployed critic, review, I went to the screening of "Radio", not knowing what to expect. Fortunately, the unemployed critic now seems to me a frustrated film director / film critic. His review is insensitive and utterly junk! <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will laugh at you, cry you and finally give you a break!

After thinking about this movie and growing up in Deep South my own, it's hard to really appreciate Mr. Harris and his contribution to this movie. As coach Jones, Ed brings quiet, solid rock performance, a human performance on a mission. Coach Harris won't let the city or circumstances turn him away from what he knows in his heart, it's the right thing to do. You will be in good shape because the real James Robert 'Radio' Kennedy, now in the mid-1950s, is still in the lead of T.L. Hanna's football team on the field every Friday night. <br /> <br /> Last note. If you were teenagers in the mid-1970s, this movie is worth the entrance fee, just for the soundtrack!
