Although there were several rough spots and some plot lines that weren't exactly true to character, it was Classic H: LOTS. Characters outside Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito) were true in form, and the reunification scenes of Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) were as deep and well behaved as anything that graced the small screen. "Murder: The Movie" aka "Life Eternal" is a fan of swing, but stands on its own as well as any 2-hour episode of the series. Fontana, Overmeyer, and Yoshimura did a great job of getting rid of the 7 seasons and every major member of the "best damn show on TV" together for the series finale that NBC never bothered to give. The truth of "murder", there were no happy endings, that is life. This is what always makes this show unlike the mindless cookie-cutter that shows on TV. Kudos to writers and cast for creating something over the span of the series and in the film that challenged television viewers and producers alike. I call myself a "murderous maniac" if for nothing else The reason is to keep my co-workers in a cooperative mood. **
