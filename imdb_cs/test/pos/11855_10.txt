Intense, funny, funny and more than anything else, social comedy about the way adults walk and it's a result - whether it's good or bad. Mohr and Nicholson are employed two two months away from the wedding date when a bizarre event at their party engagement engages Nicholson to re-think the relationship and begin dating other people so she won't feel so untouched when it comes to sexual experience. This leads to a disaster of events after Mohr, Nicholson and their cohort. Very intelligent and needed at this time of clumsy, condescending comedy, while containing your usual variety of comedic, sexual and frustrated characters (especially Karl as a sexually frustrated sexual devil ... very annoying) who even seems to have the right feeling for this heart felt a comment. The film goes the way it should go these days, which shows that the boys are heart-sensitive and have a morale. Most male characters are moralistic, straightforward eyes, while the female is fresh prowlers who don't stop at anything to be happy. Boys will appreciate the message for their own respect, but it is easy to assume that most of the men who see this film will use a male sensitivity message to hide any mistake or feature that a woman might offend. However, this formula for writing uses this tool as a tool for paving the way for its male leadership, especially for Mohr, Richter and finding a director in a portrait as a businessman! Women are the most promising when they talk about nothing but pleasure and what it would be ... to someone else. However, they have friendly features, even though they are covered with the image of sex-driven kittens. Very funny things. <br /> <br /> On another level, the movie tracks some of its files into different relationships. Richter meets a stressed divorce (a very notable and notable performance ever reliable by Helen Slater) named Penelope who is divorced from a son who hates her for breaking up with his father. As the two deepen in relationship, human interest is revealed and both the comedy and the tragedy of divorce and re-initiation are studied. By the end of the film, Mohr and Nicholson had made their way deep above their heads to see what would come next, and it depends on what they learned about each other and decide for themselves what will come in. It becomes appropriate and dramatic at the right time. Wallodorski's direction is very well imitated when characters learn to face each other after everything has happened ... with the right end. All in all, this film should be released nationwide and I hope that it will be for some Academy Awards ... maybe Helen Slater finally gets the credit she deserves. Anyone, this movie is not a hit, leave it all that you have a romantic sexual farce, depicted very dull and aesthetically pleasing. <br /> <br /> Great movie!
