I saw this film today at the Philadelphia Film Festival and enjoyed it overall. It's an interesting and adeptic analysis of the ubiquitous revelation that our parent's marriage was more defective and difficult than we originally thought. In addition, this film is an excellent example of the process of discovering the truths about our parents' lives after their deaths and related issues. However, I found that the sound quality (recording and editing) is relatively poor and unpleasant. *** It could very well be related to specific theatrical and design conditions *** I'm not a filmmaker / student or anything and asking for a real understanding of the audio production process, but as a consumer I found the sound part of the movie canceled. Specifically, I heard very uncomfortable lips that came in (especially one long conversation with a younger sister) of the film, and often the background noise level was higher than the people's voice (for example, a scene where a small group sorted through mother's papers). someone else saw this movie, noticed everything about the sound ... thanks
