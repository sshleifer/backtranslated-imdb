This is the kind of film that people of a certain age will say, "I don't think they've made films like that anymore". Walter Matthau gives its usual above-average performance, but instead of leaving traces of the landscape, it leaves grease stains. It's like the big uncle we all know is still wearing a checkered polyester and shaming everyone, but we still love it. . It gives faithful performance in essence, "good, ordinary man," even in a farce. This film may not appeal to people who prefer blunt humor to confront or offend, but will appeal to people who appreciate a wide-ranging farce played with a straight face. The whole support is excellent in its ability to play such absurd characters while maintaining the reality of each character. Brent Spiner offers great performance as a professional lizard version. Anyone who has a well-known professional host in real life instantly recognizes the type he plays. Completely completes the type. His portrayal of "slime" meritorious studies as a perfect example of contrast between absurd and pathetic. The storyline is rather a straightforward theme of "let's get married", which has the usual results. Just because the conspiracy theme was done a thousand times does not mean that it is dated, but rather a timeless theme. The rest of the support cast shows what can happen when professionals expose their skills to the roles written for them, instead of competing for attention. Second-stage actors also shine in this film. It is also obvious that they enjoyed this film. The storyline can be standard and thin, but allows artists to shine. This film is a real experience for people who want to see professional actors involved in their craft. The story goes down and the artists shine.
