Wow .. I just saw this movie at the Sundance Channel and it's really bizarre. Maybe I'm not a movie expert, but it's probably the most bizarre movie I've ever seen as an average movie fan. The one who came with him had a great imagination. I am a bit of a fan of Japanese dramas and are often actors from dramas in movies. I have to say that if they really debut here, they do a pretty good job. Kirie was a very sympathetic character, I thought he could easily connect with her. She was kind and kind-hearted, maybe not the most popular girl, but nicer than some other girls looking for attention. She was also pretty in a classic way. I hope he's doing more movies, but it's been a couple of years, so maybe he doesn't have such plans. The end was special. I won't give up, but the rest of the movie's bizarre was a bit shamed. Very bizarre but very imaginative and unique film. I would recommend it to Japanese horror fans, even if I warn you, it's more bizarre than Ring. However, I would give him 7.5 out of 10, for originality, imagination, good characterization, above average performance, and just be fascinating.
