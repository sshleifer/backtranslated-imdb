or any story reminiscent of Leopold and Loeb, you can enjoy this movie. The cast includes Robert Culp, with Stephen Caffrey and Garrison Hershberger as college students. Peter Falk is his usual self, pretending to be deceived by premature students. Caffrey ("Longtime Companion", "Buried Alive") is excellent and should do more of these menacing roles. Basically, two Frat friends are tired of their demanding parents, who expect nothing less than academic excellence, and participation in the best schools will only be funded if they are in line. There is an excellent scene where Culp pokes Caffrey through the embers after getting a low grade, threatening to cut off his trust funds and Caffrey later tells his friend: "I hate him, I want him dead" ... Beverly Hills isn't all right. This is always an excellent theme. I believe this film was released in 1990 right after the murder of Menendez. If you look at "Menedez, Killing in Beverly Hills" and then compare it to this movie, you can find interesting parallels.
