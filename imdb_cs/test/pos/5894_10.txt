Blue ribbon banners, stars and stripes forever, decorated with generals, and unconditional surrender from enemies that require tons and tons of radiation, it was to summon the essence of the United States victory in World War II !! Celebrating in Times Square and everywhere else in the United States suggests a national zenith !!! America is at the top right !! one thing, one torturous and perverse thing .. Adjustment period !! .. The real celebration ended when the bottle of champagne was finished .. Now everyone must get on their lives ... just one problem though .. they must get new lives ... old lives are gone forever ... Polite and pleasant smile had fragile facade with long life of ice cubes in boiling water! Each of the characters in the film is marching through the initial doubts and unable to pretend that nothing was wrong, for the simple reason that it was not true !!! Once sergeants and generals and their wives and daughters and sons and virtually all other Americans who were struck by World War II were exposed to disabilities, nightmares, and accusations of World War II and what they actually achieved as well as negated, no one was the same !! For now, social and moral issues have their own interest ... Frederick March and Myrna Loy had to start again !! Dana Andrews realized she should never be married to Virginia Mayo !!! Theresa Wright realized she was constructively selfish !! Last but not least, the character, Homer, is about to marry and thinks everyone around him is just as wounded as he is, in the essence of being unable or unwilling to cope! The reason why this film is so wonderful is that the happy ending was achieved in a hard way as everyone recognized the new beginning of the new United States and the new world overall, the tragedy of World War II was recognized and things That was emotionally torn asunder was taken in step, and dealt accordingly! Frederick March and Myrna Loy have to return to the first chapter in the marriage, Homer met his new bride as to what to marry him (ie, Half Times, Will Feel Like a Nurse) and Thresa Engagement Wright Dana Andrews means her entry into adulthood results in partial responsibility for the break-up of a marriage ... That's the same thing to learn to drive a car to get a driver's license in the Indianapolis 500 ... Characters in the film are typical of WWII Americans in being imprisoned by the indecent awakening of coercive changes in their lives ... Happiness is no longer given the luxury of an adjective cop-aesthetics ... it is now about impressive conditions and a good victory over the evil way less ugly choices !! ... World War II didn't just happen !! From now on he will dominate the social patterns of American life !!! The World War II catastrophe also reflects the feelings of humanity's humanity in America! I loved this movie and also the AFI, probably because it brought problems that were suddenly taboo! .. Bottom Line, See This Movie !! Combat nightmares, dilemmas about marital distress and / or adaptation, coping with your life when they are hit by disabilities and a fundamentally active person, are constantly displayed in movies and TV shows. this is 1946 !! Very new for Americans then .... Remember that !! Director William Wyler has illustrated how the Americans feel the aftermath of World War II when the film industry left him with one hand behind his back !!! Take this into consideration and you will probably realize how sensational this movie really was !!
