This film did not concern stereotypes, dance movements or collection lines. This film was about the vulnerability of people's hearts. It was hard to believe that Kevin James could play a compelling role that Will Smith could satisfy without negotiation and that such a hacked genre of film could succeed in such a way. I have no intention of sounding too enthusiastic about this film - it was by no means a "breakthrough" - but it was a movie worth seeing. Was it believable? No. New York could not be so simple and there was no human being in the history of mankind who has a "hutzpah" Hitch. Sure, there are bar-studs, but not the ones that can get some chicks, anytime - except those raking in seven numbers, of course. The best thing that worked for this movie was its real focus on the dramatic side of things, not just comedy. It was fun for two hours, no doubt. But it was also two hours when you were sitting in your seat, plunging into characters and smiling.
