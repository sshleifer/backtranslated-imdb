This series was recently discovered and excerpts can be seen, at least inside Britain, via http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/527213/index.html. more accessible. The problem is that this series was followed by a series of WARS OF ROSES that had a similarly stellar cast and were available to cable TV, or at least overcrowded. Both series are completely different in dramaturgy; Wars strengthen games through extensive rewriting and scrolling of scenes; BEAUTY AGE follows Shakespeare closer. Both series use integral casting.
