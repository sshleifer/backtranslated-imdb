I think Toy Soldiers is an excellent movie. It is one of the only films that, besides some well-known actors, has an unknown cast that can actually act. In my opinion, the plot is charming. It keeps your attention without having an outrageous story that could not happen in real life. I think everyone would enjoy this movie. It seems that Sean Astin always chooses the perfect movies to show him his talent. It is very underestimated and does not receive the credit it deserves. Other films that were in other actors were in the spotlight, but this movie and Rudy are really showing it because it is the main character of both. I hope he once gets the award he deserves for his playing. If you want to see a great movie, you have to check this out and if you are a fan of Sean Astin, you definitely like this movie.
