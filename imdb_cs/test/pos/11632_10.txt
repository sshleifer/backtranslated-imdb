Barney is about "IMAGINATION" you don't have if my preschooler never wanted to play pretending to do it on that show, then I'd be scared. What 2 or 3 year olds actually gets everything that's all about color and singing. For those of you who say that everything they do at Barney is to eat junk food and recommend Sesame Street better what about a "cookie monster" that's all she eats, but I haven't seen anyone comment that one. I agree that sesame is a better educational show, but barney is just like a show for fun, it's not very serious, if you don't like your child watching TV and worrying about understanding things you don't believe, then you shouldn't '' t be first of all being backed up by the television because all this is fake all that is fake actors are fake, so why take your fake brains and put it to use and think if you have a problem with a fake TV show for kids then turn it off and play with them yourself and teach them what you want them not to learn BIG BIRD or Bert & Ernie or Barney, who once watched all these shows and showed up.
