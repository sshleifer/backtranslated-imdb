This film is one of the few historical documents depicting the talents of so many black singers, actors, actresses and dancers. Many who are no longer with us. Those we are blessed to enjoy today in 1999 through this film allow us to discern the talents that existed then. That's why the people who live today and those who are deceased are superstar icons. Given the educational history of music, drama, filming, design, singing, etc., this film itself belongs to the people of this country. <br /> <br /> I recently viewed this movie. The sound was great! The film seemed to be complete, color and clarity were fare, but well considered how old this film is without any fixes on the frames. I agree with all previous positive reviews. I have no negative opinions. <br /> <br /> I only want one request. Please, to whom I am with me, please make this movie available so that everyone can have this historical experience.
