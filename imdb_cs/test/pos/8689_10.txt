Even Maria Montez / Jon Hall's technolored baubles' 40s are an eclipse of "Princess Nile," Fox's entry in the mid-1950s in Hollywood's obsession with Egyptian things (see "Land of Pharoahs," "Valley of the Kings," etc. "Clean, undisturbed , mindless beams, richly made (in fact low-budgeted, but using sets and costumes left of "The Robe", this Technicolored spectacle looks like it costs millions) 71 minutes of sight (a miracle that has something to do with The shameful derrings-in of ancient Egypt, beside the point), offers the cameraman and viewers a delicate look at Debra Paget wearing a wide selection of veils, mostly landed when shaken and shimmies through a slave production number that is unparalleled in film history. Movie Viewers Were Not Shortened: Fox's youngest young contracting player, Jeffrey Hunter, is as photogenic as Mrs. Paget while Michael Rennie is in the background and develops evil deeds in the pyramid land For those who might think Paget & Hunter cannot act and were hired only for their physical qualities, look at their delicate, overlooked, heartbreaking work a few years later in "White Feather" "(another Fox production that unfortunately disappeared into the realm of" lost movies "). The "Princess of the Nile" still stands in the class itself as a cheerless, breathless fast moving, dazzling testimony to the glory of 3-strip Technicolor - and the seductive spell of Mrs. Paget (all 20 at that time). Put this unique kitsch classic to the top of the list of "wine pleasures" and enjoy it. Satisfaction Guaranteed!
