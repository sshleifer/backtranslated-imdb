This cheerful cheerful English schoolgirl comedy is a neglected gem. The important question is where is the audience? The film is rated by 10 voters most, but how many voters is it? Such comedies no longer do, because films are not distributed or seen. I'd never miss a chance to see this old classic house. But where are the art houses?
