Like many others, I first saw The Water Babies as a child / young teen in the late 1970s / early 1980s. He has stayed with me ever since with his catchy melodies, unforgettable paintings, less successful animation, and a story full of heart, cold, and finally a good defeat of evil. I recently sat down and saw it again after at least two decades, and I noticed this time around its remarkable similarities with The Wizard of Oz. No, it's not obvious, but listen to me. In this we have a boy and his dog - they have personal problems in "home", they run away from something and in the scene right after they run, changing the essence of their appearance. At this one, the boy and the dog revive. In The Wizard Of Oz, Dorothy And This Is In Color. In this, boys and dogs are said to have to find Water Kids for answers and then eventually Kracken for leadership and have the ability to let Tom go home when he shows that he has the courage, etc. Oz, Dorothy must also find an authoritative figure that he tests before he lets her go home. In Water Babies, Tom meets three characters to help him on his way to Water Kids - Dorothy also has three helpers. When every helper is fulfilled, we talk with the interpretation of "Hi, Hi, Hi, HI Cockallorum ... We're on our way." The Guide is "We're gone to see the guide." Dorothy has a good witch for her; Tom has a wife with many roles (Billie Whitelaw). If you look closely at two, there are many other forms. That being said, The Water Babies is by no means a knockoff, I just commented on the scary love between the two. This film has some solid performances from the bad guys Bernard Cribbins and the always fascinating James Mason. Children playing Tom and Ella are good. Joan Greenwood's supporting cast (love her voice!), David Tomlinson, and John Pertwee's vocal talents and Lance Percival make a great contribution to the mix. I have to admit that animation is less than sterling, though it is time-consuming. Three animated characters who help Tom get home are sympathetic. I always have trouble picking my favorite between the French Swordfish and John Inman / Mr.. Humphries like a seahorse. A scene in which we hear this guttural, manic laughter from a ship that was wrecked just to see a sea horse with a huge polka-dotted bow tie, always rolling me! Water kids are a lot of fun. Sure, it's a children's film, but it has and always will have a nice place in my heart. The bulk of the film's success has to be directed by Lionel Jeffries. Jeffries is a great comedy actor and his sense of humor is clear throughout.
