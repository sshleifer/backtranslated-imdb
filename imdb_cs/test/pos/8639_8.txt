Wow what special movie. It's David Lynch's movie, so it's no wonder it's weird. I refuse anyone to explain everything in this movie. I can't do it. After some research after my second review of this movie, I know most of the story to a large extent, but at first glance, and without the help of other reviewers or outside help, it's hard to find things. If you're in that ship and have been confused, you don't feel bad; that's normal. Let me say that the key to the film is Naomi Watts. In any case, I consider the film fascinating. I love the wonderful visual and rich colors and find every character in this movie really different and fun to watch. The camera is excellent and the music is scary, la Lynch's "Blue Velvet". There are also some good sound effects that will help some of the dramatic scenes. In all it's a very good score. Just like Lynch's TV series "Twin Peaks", it was a movie that ended after Lynch thought this movie would be long, drawn. -out TV series. When that didn't happen, this end started at the last minute. This may cause some confusion at the end and a lack of explanations about the characters we see earlier in the movie, but which mysteriously disappear. The story's story is allegedly a negative commentary on Hollywood and what it does to people, especially those whose dreams of being actors are crushed. Both Watts and another top lady, Laura Eleana Harring, are very interesting to watch, especially in their famous lesbians. Sex Scene. Both women were chameleons, occasionally looking mean, stunning at other times. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie more on the second track than the first one. It's not just curiosity; It's a very interesting movie ..... I just don't feel stupid if you can't understand a few things.
