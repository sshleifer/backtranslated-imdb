This movie is a jewel ... the undiscovered classic of Gerry Anderson. The beginnings of both "UFO" and "Space 1999" are obvious from this film, including a cast that includes the late Ed Bishop. and George Sewell, who both went to "UFO". It is unfortunate that Anderson, despite many television successes, had no chance to develop his talent on the big screen. Just think about what he could do with the movie version of "Thunderbirds" (which he completely condemned!). <br /> <br /> I'm sure you will give the "JTTFSOTS" / "Doppleganger" fair a good chance to appreciate.
