Dirty War is one of the best political, government, and well-written television dramas in 25 years. Acting is excellent, writing is spectacular. Diry War reveals the true side of why we're not ready to react to nuclear, biological and radiological terrorist attacks here on US soil. Dirty War should be created as the main movie - It's so good! I highly recommend this great drama to all who want to know the truth. This TV drama reveals how British intelligence (MI5 & MI6) attempts to detect a terrorist conspiracy and conspiracy to destroy innocent victims - because of England's involvement in the Iraq war. Scenes from different parts of London, England are also spectacular. Dirty War needs to be seen !!!
