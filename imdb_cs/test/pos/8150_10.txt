I watched it last night and again in the morning - I liked it. There's something about this movie ... When the movie was almost over, I wanted to cry. I highly recommend "Last Days" to my friends - definitely worth seeing! I agree with those who say some parts of the movie don't look too realistic. For example, the two main characters are absolutely cute and in perfect physical shape (although the wheel is also a shape type :)). I rarely meet people like this single, and I've never met a couple before. Other parts of the movie, including all the "coincidences", do not look too realistic. But in the end it's a MOVIE, not a life story.
