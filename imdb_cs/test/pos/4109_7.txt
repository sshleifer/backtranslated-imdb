Huge cast collected for this remake, which was unfortunately a failure of the box office regardless of the great sound track. I can't say it was a thrilling pastime or a cure for insomnia. However, I enjoyed the film - assuming I was after one afternoon. A good look at those of us who are looking for an ideal life, even imagination. Expect to have moments, a couple of excitement and occasional laughter.
