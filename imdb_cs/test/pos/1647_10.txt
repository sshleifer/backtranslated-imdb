Shtrafbat - Penal Battalion is a moving and mostly honest look at the lives and deaths of Soviet soldiers who have been condemned to get rid of their crimes during the Second World War. You can almost call it the Russian equivalent of "Band of Brothers" miniseries. Originated in July 1942 on the eve of the Battle of Stalingrad, criminal battalions were considered consumer units and suffered terrible casualties. (sometimes up to 90%). Prisoners of GULAG (political prison / concentration camps), deserters, soldiers who were captured by the Germans, but managed to escape, soldiers accused of violating the protocol, were all given the chance to join Shtrafbat and prove that there were "Traitors to their homeland with their Those who have suffered injuries and those who died in battle have been considered rehabilitated and have been restored in the eyes of the law. This miniseries presents a view of one such Shtrafbat, under the command of Tverdokhleb - Honorary Officer Who He was captured by the Germans, shot and left for the dead, characterized by a varied and varied group of people drawn into a non-escaping situation, authoritarian yet honest criminal boss Antip "Kulak" and his small gang of unreformed criminals, young Jewish an intellectual who struck his anti-Semitic officer, the father of the (Orthodox priest) Mikhail, who joins the battalion when he is home parishes, political prisoners who hate the regime that condemned them to GULAG, but who are nevertheless willing to fight for their people and the country for the last time, they must all find their courage and reasons to live and continue to fight. Although during the war, not every episode is characterized by a fight, it is in fact a battle scene that is often chaotic, sporadic and short - probably the director's intent. . Meanwhile, miniseries focus on the different relationships between cast, their background, thoughts and tragedies. The rape of a young woman by one of Shtrafbat's soldiers and then his execution, execution for alleged AWOL, the boredom on the march, the celebration (and subsequent consequences) of finding a German bunker stocked with food (and champagne), the moral dilemma of officers unable to save their men from their own superiors, cheating husband and other situations that are prominent. The camera is unwavering - it does not turn away from the ugliness of war and the ugliness of human nature, nor from the raw human emotions. The dialogue also does not censor curses. Acting is excellent and deep and the script is also well written. Everything from rage, fatigue to resignation, to the joy of hanging around is almost flawless. One complaint may be that some Russian linguistic and cultural idiosyncrasies may not always be understood by someone who is not familiar with language and culture. Because it is a historical drama in a certain sense, some terms and situations (military rank, mention of other battles, certain historical references) may be lost in some viewers. This understanding is not necessary to thoroughly please Shtrafbat, but these links are a nice touch of authenticity. Another complaint that could be picked up is the occasional anachronism and bending of history that would suit the conspiracy, but frankly, this is such a rousing miniseries that it will probably forgive those slight misfortunes.
