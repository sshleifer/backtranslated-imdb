I just watched this short time on PlanetOut Movies. Starcrossed was a very sweet, sad little movie about two brothers in love. There is some great, gentle action from both male executives. Often, films with this theme seem to be too impressed by the controversy and shock value of the plot they forget that there is a real story. Fortunately, director writer James Burkhammer will not do it, and instead lets the story play with honesty. The sequence of the two boys who first fell in love is very sweet.
