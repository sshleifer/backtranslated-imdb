This movie really made use of its sites with some amazing shots, a dark and disturbing movie moving very slowly, but it keeps holding you. Modern Love in this year's Gold Coast Film Fantastic has worked well this year and has offered viewers a view of an Australian cinema that is usually neglected. Most importantly, it is refreshing to see Australian cinematography, which does not take into account the clich√©s of aussie characters and stories we have seen over the years. This film would praise any festival and start a debate after its screening. Performances and characters are well developed and cinematography is fantastic. Interesting exploration of family relationships and environment.
