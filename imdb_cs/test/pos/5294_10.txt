I heard news about this movie from anime-legend Hayao Miyazaki and I wanted to see it. But I was lucky to have a movie online on YouTube; after watching the movie, I knew it was another Miyazaki / Studio Ghibli classic. Named Sosuke, and his relationship with the goldfish princess he named Ponyo, who longs to become human and to be with Sosuke. I won't give you more details, you'll have to see the movie yourself. So overall one of the best animated movies ever made, with a lot of fantasy, adventure and humor ... I loved it!
