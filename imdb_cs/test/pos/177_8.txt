In 1929, director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of the animation with the release of their first installment of their series "Silly Symphonies", "The Skeleton Dance". Iwerks and Disney have worked together since the early twenties, in Disney's "Laugh-O-Gram" comic strip; however, their friendship suffered a huge blow when Iwerks received a competitor's bid to leave Disney and start his own animation studio. It was the birth of Celebrity Productions where Iwerks continued to develop his style and technique (and where he created the character Flip the Frog). While his work kept the same high quality, it was not very popular and by 1936 the studio had been closed. Later that year, Iwerks was hired by Columbia Pictures, and Iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance, this time in color. 1937's "Skeleton Frolics" is essentially, a 1929 remake of the classic "Skeleton Dance", a film that carries him fame and fortune. Just like this short film, it takes place in an abandoned cemetery where creatures of that night come to life and begin to play. The dead rise from the coffins, ready for the show to begin, because a group of skeletons has created an orchestra and started playing a happy melody. Now it's not easy to be a bone-made musician, because some members of the orchestra have problems with those parts of the body, but the band is doing well and another group of skeletons starts dancing. A beautiful pair of them face the same problems that plagued the orchestra: it's hard to dance with free body parts. Everything ends at dawn and just as the sun rises again, the skeletons run to the graves. Direction and animation of Ub Iwerks, "Skeleton Frolics" follows faithfully the pattern set by "Skeleton Dance" years ago, though with a fundamental difference: Iwerks made the whole film at Technicolor. "Clear tonality allowed Iwerks to create visually a more appealing film and also use many of the new techniques he has been practicing since he left Disney to create even better depth and dynamics than those he had previously taken, a more experimental film than "Skeleton Dance", though unfortunately does not mean that it is necessarily a better film. For starters, the film is virtually identical to that he did with Disney, with the only differences being music (more on it later) and color effects. it feels somehow unoriginal. But it is not a non-originality of what the film really hurts (after all, Iwerks does it in a great way), but the fact that The song created by Joe DeNat for the movie is quite uninteresting and lacks the enchanting elegance and whimsical fun of what Carl W. Stalling did for "The Skeleton Dance". In other words, while DeNat's melody is effective and appropriate for the theme, it's easy to forget it quickly, while Stalling has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable. Being a musical film is very important, and so the mediocrity of music brings Iwerk's flawless animation. Personally, I think that with better musical accompaniment, "Skeleton Frolics" would be remembered as a kind of "Skeleton Dance", though it's not so pioneering, because it's still a fun movie you can watch. It's kind of sad that most of Iwerks's work after leaving Disney is now forgotten because of his bad success, however, it must be said that if Iwerks lacked the popularity of Disney or Fleischer (Disney's main rival), he lacked quality This is probably just a bad luck case that caused the man who first made Disney's life to face Disney's failure, despite his shortcomings, "Skeleton Frolics" is very funny and visually stunning. the film that although not the most original and freshest movie (you just can't help but think about "Skeleton Dance" while watching it), it certainly reminds us that Iwerk's skeletons are still here to haunt us and inspire us. <br /> <br /> 8/10
