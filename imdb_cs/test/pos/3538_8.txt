A few months ago I saw MESSIAH 2 and a few days ago I didn't see the original teleplay, which is much better than continuing. Okay, it's not a million miles away from the SEVEN plot, but it's still convincing. Much of my praise has to do with Ken Stott's performance as DCI Red Metcalfe policeman who seems to have led a very unhappy life and someone who has a terrible secret. It would be easy for Stott to go over the top but to play a role in a fairly gentle way. Likewise, murders are very shocking, but - unlike the continuation of murder on screen - rather OTT in a way - little violence is shown here. My only criticism is that the red-tailed herring was too obviously a red herring, which meant I didn't take a shock twist (and you would probably see a shock shock so I wouldn't bother with the spoiler warning) and that when a real killer is revealed, it seemed a little far away He pulled and caused some holes that appeared in the story. If I remember correctly, the sequel had similar problems once the killer was revealed, so it would be good if MESSIAH 3 did not.
