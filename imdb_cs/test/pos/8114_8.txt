I loved that the mood was light and airy. I loved that the leading character wants a guarantee of his future, and that his roommate makes him "straight" to all people. I loved dealing with the dynamics of how male members deal with each other, given that it was driven by a lesbian, the whole issue of masculinity was interpreted, ridiculed, dismantled, and questioned. What makes a man? What makes one straight, gay or bisexual? Not sure if our leader has decided who really wants; he lives in an instant and throws carefully into the wind. These and other reasons make me love this movie.
