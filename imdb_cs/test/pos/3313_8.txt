This 1959 series takes us into the life and love of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. This is followed by the same idea as THREE COINS IN THE FOOT a few years ago. This takes place in New York while COINS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in her first starring role as Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange does well and holds his own counterpart to some of the strong veterans in the industry, namely Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who loses her beau. It's hard to believe that anyone could refuse this beauty for some reason, but Louis Jourdan, her heart pounding, does just that. Somehow, he'll take you back to Paul Neuman, who refuses the wonderful Elizabth Taylor in CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF, right? Diane Baker, the third girl in distress, meets and dates Robert Evans before becoming producer and husband Ali MacGraw. Hope is a friend from home, played by newbie Brett Halsey, promises to marry her. He also meets Stephen Boyd, a colleague who has interests in our hope. All three ladies have drama ahead. Crawford's movie almost steals. Her presence and her usual strong biting self is fun to watch. Veteran actor Brian Aherne plays one of the bosses just for finding the back of the lady. She is beautifully charming. Also in the cast is Martha Hyer, wasted in an ungrateful role that has never been explored. Too bad as I like this actress who never seems to get one role to distinguish her skills. He has a crush on a married man in the office, played by Donald Harron, with whom I was happy to work in several Shakespeare plays in New York. He is a major actor who is also wasted in this film. All in all, it's a great fun at Technicolor and cinema directed by Jean Negulesco.
