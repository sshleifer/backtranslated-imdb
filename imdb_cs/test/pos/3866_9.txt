AristoCats is such a wonderful Disney classic that I love myself as a child. To this day, I can't resist watching, it's just such a wonderful and charming movie with great animation and beautiful songs. I really miss animation movies like AristoCats, they had perfect voices, not to mention the hand-drawn animation that makes it ideal for family. AristoCats is also very funny and clever, the story was just so amazing. This film is beyond the irresistible, I think the most memorable moment for me was the cats playing the piano who learned appecio, lol, it was so cute with piano and painting. Douchess and her kittens are very pampered in their huge mansion, mainly because their lady is very rich and treats them like children. However, when a lady feels that it is time for her to succeed, she leaves everything to the cats and not to her servant. Butler gets angry and takes the kittens on the road and drops them in the middle of nowhere. Douchess and kittens wake up and, with the help of a smooth street cat named Thomas O'Malley, returns home to their mistress, but learns that they are cold cats. AristoCats is just the perfect Disney movie that I think is a little more than it looked. I would always recommend this movie for children or families, anyone could enjoy it. Songs and story is just unforgettable. I will always be involved in the films the best song "Everyone wants to be a cat", so great melody. I also love those dogs who guarded the farm where the cats were abandoned, they were just so cute. This is an amazing movie, please watch, you will not be disappointed. 9/10
