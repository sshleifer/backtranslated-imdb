TOUGH LUCK follows a homeless rogue as he entangles himself in an underground criminal world of fraud and chaos. Archie (Norman Reedus) was released from prison and has nothing to lose. He is almost killed before the carnival owner named Ike (Armand Assante) hires him for work. Soon Ike reveals a strong desire for Archie to murder his wicked wife Divan (Dagmaru Dominczyk), an erotic carnival dancer. Things soon become complicated when Archie falls in love with Divana and warns her about the plan. They engage in a very enthusiastic affair that leaves little to the viewer's imagination, after which a plan is soon to be prepared. Together they conspire to murder Ike, but things don't go as planned. I'd be lying if I said this movie didn't surprise me. Personally, I was blown away by how good this movie was. After several years of renting, I was expecting another thriller clich√© with many typical features and motifs that are featured in many of this type of movies these days. Within minutes I was addicted and found myself in the world of film. It's the kind of movie, just like BUFFALO '66, which just sucks you in and transports you into the style and feeling of paranoia. It's a movie that really impresses him. One thing I especially appreciated was how the film depicted his characters. The film is not as easy and clear as it might appear in the summary of the plot. These are the characters who actually grow to take care of them and are fascinated, including the characters to be evil. In truth, there are no good guys or bad guys in this movie. All characters are wrong ways that are realistic and incredibly true. There are not many films that can accomplish this task as perfectly as this movie does, but it is definitely a movie style that I like and want to see more of the movies today. There were quite a few criminal movies that were like that back in the early 1950s, but there was not one as attractive and unique as this ever since! <br /> <br /> I usually have a very small grip on the shortcomings. The film itself is not entirely original. However, I doubt that most people expect it to be original. The cut of the film can also irritate some people because it tends to have a camera type of shaky cams all the time. Even though I didn't bother and actually felt it added to the atmosphere, I'm sure most viewers won't be so fascinated and may consider it generally unpleasant. Despite minor flaws, however, this is one of the most underrated films of the 2000s. It's so refreshing, if you wish happiness and watch an unknown movie that turns out to be good. Looks like this movie was a direct-to-video release, though this movie is far better than that. If it was given to the theaters, it would not have received any appreciation, nor would it have been much visible, but it would have been much more appreciated than today. The recognition this film deserves. TOUGH LUCK is a stunning, fun and twisted neo-noir thriller with a real sense of class and style.
