The end of Suburbia neatly collects many of the concerns with the upcoming "peak" of the world's oil supply. As the world's population grows, so does the demand for oil and power. When we get oil and energy, we come to a "peak" in production. More oil is required, less oil is generated. The inevitable result is conflict and major change. This movie will be alarming and alarming if you are new to the subject. Initially, you can react with anger and denial because the consequences are so grim. Monitoring should be required. In addition to politics, beyond optimism, mathematics is undeniable. Suburbia is a focal point because our suburban residential areas will be most affected by communities when the price of energy rises. While the intuitive logic would tell you that big cities will be the place to be avoided in times of crisis, the scattered nature of the suburbs makes it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain an efficient community without our vehicles that would transport us. Top oil is no longer a topic for discussing the survival of survivors and fools. This problem will be on our doorstep before we think. This film is a clear, holistic view of it.
