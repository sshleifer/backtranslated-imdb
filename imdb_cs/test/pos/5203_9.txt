This movie shocked me. It was so realistic and the story was incredible. He speaks German and Russian, making him more credible and real. This is a movie you have to see. The actors are also great. A really good job. The story takes place in the German army in World War II. They must go to Stalingrad, Sovjet, to fight the Sovjetian armies. You get more connected with every soldier in this group and follow them with all the threats they're captured in Stalingrad. They receive a personal encounter with death, blood, sorrow and cold of Russia. This is a must-see-movie and you can't afford not to see it.
