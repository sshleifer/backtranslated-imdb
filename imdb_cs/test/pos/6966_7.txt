When I saw that this movie was on IMDB Bottom 20, I just had to rent it. <br /> SUPRISE! SUPRISE! I'm not sorry to see this movie at all. In fact, I really enjoyed it. There is a level camp in this film that puts cult classics into the 80s into shame. Is it stupid? Yes, but Jim Wynorski proves that stupid is not necessarily bad after all. Rent it for laughter, which seems unintended, but it's really funny. Wynorski is a genius. Hope directing another ninja turtle movie
