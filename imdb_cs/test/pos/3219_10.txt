I love this show! it's amazing ... I can never miss an episode, even though I've seen it before. actors are perfect for those parts ... ... i love girls Gilmore! I got all my friends to watch. now their parents are watching. I look at it daily and usually watch it more than once a day. I wish my mom was like Lorelei. my friends say I'm talking and behaving like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have an amazing mother-daughter relationship. This is a great teen show because it actually kind of learning from watching. my vocabulary spread from the sightings of Gilmore girls. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bled el are perfect for parts of Lorelei and Rory. I think Luke and Lorelai should get married because Chris has left Lorelei and Rory too many times. and he broke Lorelei's heart too many times.
