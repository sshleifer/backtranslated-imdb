Conrad Phillips plays in the 1950s a series of action adventures - William Tell. William Tell takes place in the fourteenth century during the hostile Austrian occupation of Switzerland and is a reluctant freedom fighter fighting heroically against tyranny and oppression of assault forces. William tell is the Swiss version of Robin Hood. Conrad Phillips fantastically plays the protagonist. It is possible that Pascal Bugnion would be more successful in this role but was not available at the time of filming. The classic action show is made up of a series of 39. Episodes are in black and white, but this does not harm entertainment in any way.
