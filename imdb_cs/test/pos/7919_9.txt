I believe that anyone who has enjoyed Eisentein's films Ivan the Terrible would enjoy this well-made film. This film took place as "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King", but without any special effect, but as a good and better drama. We have a German who dressed like KKK, conquered Novgorod Russia. The Russian called Nevsky to lead them to fight Germany to save Russia. Nikolai Cherkasov, who played Ivan in the films of Ivan the Terrible, was charismatic as Nevsky. The first 10 minutes of the passage through the Mongol were captivating. <br /> <br /> Many black and white scenes were beautiful. The expectations of war did not require any dialogue, such as "how many enemies we will kill," etc. In addition to several expressions, the film can basically be played as a silent film. The battle scene can cope with the civil war battle scene Birth of a Nation. Another strong point of the film is Sergei Prokofiev's great musical score. Music gave an epic feeling of film in these scenes without dialogue.
