The Twins Effect is a vampire martial art movie available in Cantonese with English subtitles. It is a production by Jackie Chan and he makes a special guest appearance, although it is not for those who like Shanghai Noon / Knights and other recent Hollywood movies that this movie was known to be more special than that. Br /> <br /> Originally called The Vampire Effect, but as a very popular Chinese female pop duo called The Twins (Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung), they took two lead roles and the title was turned into cash for their fame. Br /> <br /> The film will appeal to three types of audience: those who love martial arts movies, those who love vampire movies, and those who hate Hollywood rubbish films are usually released. The prerequisite for the movie is that vampires are probably a secret society trying to hunt them before we all become refreshments for the undead. This bloody work is done by some martial artists who drink some vampire blood to give them the necessary edge, it must be thirsty! Things get into the course until the ugly European vamp learns that if he gets a set of keys held by all the Vampire princes, he can walk in the sun, etc. And generally eat when he wants. To say yet on the plot would spoil the enjoyment of watching a movie. The twins consist of one assigned vampire killer (Chung) and a sister (Choi) of another. It's the twins that really make the film; with some of the freshest and funniest gaming. The battle scenes they perform are fast and furious and well choreographic with a mix of true athletic and wire work. To add cherry to the cake twins are pretty beautiful to watch too. <br /> <br /> The direction is sharp and the script is sharp. There are only 3 things that leave this movie down: make-up for vampires is pretty poor, Jackie Chan seems to be in the movie just for the heck and adds nothing to his content, and some of the grotesque comedy attempted by the male vampire hunter is pretty lame. Fortunately, the twins save the day bringing originality to the film usually only in European films. The best scene for me was one of them (Choi), who communicated only by shouting, her ability to convey ideas through this medium was a comic joy. Their film has many other aspects of originality. Especially I liked the coffin with surround sound stereo and TV screen! And it's a lot of original touches and gaming that prevents it from becoming a tired old flop and turns it into a movie that has to be seen.
