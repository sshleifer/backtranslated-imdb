Recently, I saw Grindhouse, I was watching the video in the United States and looking for some movies that could play in real grindhouse theaters in the city center during the 1970s. The Hockey Action Movie Five Fingers of Death looked like such an image. Caricature-like effects and quick jumps seemed a bit distracting at first glance, but after a while I got involved in the story and the characters I didn't care about. Parts of the musical score sounded like "Ironside" television theme song that was subsequently used in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill movies. Some scenes with the hero's fianc√© seemed to be bordering on a parody, but they were so short that they did not destroy the film. The most exciting parts include tournament and some revenge segments after it. Worth seeing kung fu fans!
