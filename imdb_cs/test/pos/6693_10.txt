Life consists of endless possibilities; some acquaintances, others a mystery and destined to remain so. And what is the unknown, the empire for which knowledge has no set limits or parameters? Who is to say what exists or what is possible? Valid questions, all of which are raised and explored in the story of an individual's personal journey, a strange and dramatic odyssey that defies the facts and logic of "K-PAX" directed by Iain Softley, starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. Following an incident at New York Central Station, a man named Prot (Spacey) is transported to a psychiatric hospital in Manhattan, where he is discharged to the hospital. Mark Powell (Bridges), who is trying to reveal the truth about his patient, who claims to be from the distant planet K-PAX. This quickly becomes a challenge for Dr. Powell, like Prota, with his calm, straightforward, upcoming and propensity to produce (he eats banana peels and all and Red Delicious Apples are his favorites) is quite convincing. But it's Powell's work, like his nature, to be skeptical. But Prot's assertions remain intact and stand under the most intense sounding and careful observation of Dr. Powell, who finds himself indignant - Prot even tells him the exact date and time he will go to K -PAX, a planned return trip that allows Powell a short time to solve it all. And Powell just can't understand the idea of ​​dealing with a real alien being; and it is something he will have to solve quickly if he knows the truth. And he must know. Truth, after all, is the only thing that will free it in its mind. Softley has created and supplied a sensitive, provocative film that challenges the viewer by keeping the secrets surrounding Prot while forcing you to think about your own ideas about what is actually possible. And as you are never sure about Prota until denouement, you are able to identify with Powell, see the situation from his point of view and try to solve the puzzle with him. Softley creates an atmosphere of wonder and a real sense of being confronted with something that is truly unique, as the story unfolds and you realize that Prot can be what it says it is. And in connection with the fact that the film is being wiped out, it's a riveting matter to try to wrap up your mind. How do you react when all the evidence goes against the physical constraints we have set ourselves? At the heart of the film is a profound human depth that is evident not only in Prot, but also in Dr. Powell. All this for an extremely engaging and appealing drama. <br /> <br /> As we have come to expect, Kevin Spacey gives great performance as Prot, representing his character from the outside, emotionally deep and physically persuasive. at the same time. This is a unique individual, and Spacey adds to life with care and ability to share those moments that are particularly revealing, which contributes to the credibility of the character and credibility of the story itself. For this film to work, it is essential that we believe who and what is Prot; we do and do. The cosmic universe simply pulls it down beautifully. It is an unforgettable performance that develops a character that will stay with you for a long, long time. Jeff Bridges meanwhile appears on the same basis as Spacey. Powell. It is a fairly straightforward task and the challenge for bridges was to take this very normal and ordinary character and make it unique in its own right, which, unlike the character of Prot, was not a small task. Again, to make this film work, Bridges needed to take this opportunity. And with the extraordinary skill and the perfect professional he is, he will succeed without success. Bridges is charging Powell with basic complexity, and is so giving in its performance that it makes the interaction between Powell and Prot vibrant, and at times intense. It is a demonstration of the two best business actors who do what they do best, creating a vibrant, inspiring dynamic. It's a brilliant job for Bridges who never try to steal a reflector from Prot, which is used to raise the film's level to an even higher level. Supporting cast includes Mary McCormack (Rachel), Alfre Woodard (Dr. Villers), Ajay Naidu (Dr. Naidiu), Vincent Laresca (Navarro), Kimberly Scott (Joyce), Conchata Ferrell (Betty) and Saul Williams (Ernie). "K-PAX" is a fun, emotionally-active film dissertation on possibilities, as well as exploring the ever-evolving complexity of the human condition. It is a film that requires an open mind and rewards those who can access and accept it on their own terms. Finally, you realize how real K-PAX is; and that makes you an award for Prot's journey, and how much we all share and share with those around us, human or extraterrestrial. And it can make you think about your own path - where you were and where you go. And that's the magic of movies. I rate this one 10/10. <br /> <br />
