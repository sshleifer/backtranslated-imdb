I would like to divert my resentment from NBC Canceling Las Vegas. The show was Top Notch for the past 5 years. Plus, Tom Sellecks was great. He really brought a nice fresh addition to the show. What is NBC now? Lame reality and night game shows. I think let's keep the old and tired law and order? Even the introduction of Jack McCoy as a DA can't keep the show interesting. Gee let's keep a quality program like Deal or No Deal or ED? The ER should be landed. NBC is now worse than in the Pre Seinfeld Cheers days. With cable and internet, NBC can't afford to fall into the face. I remember when murder street life ended as she did. At least they had the final of a two-hour series. Hey CBS are you listening? Please pick up Vegas, it's a great show.
