As a non-theist Im I will not comment on the great mans theory that changed the world 150 years ago. Safe to say, science is based on evidence, religion is based on blind faith. Nuff then said: <br /> <br /> The film was made by the BBC, and to be honest, it could be quite easily displayed on television. While acting is excellent, the film itself is not worthy of a full-length movie. This means that if it reaches a wider audience this way, it is so. But I've seen many period styles drama on BBC TV and they were well up to the standard of this. Don't expect too big a big budget ride when you see it. In some respects, I found that the film almost goes out to the limb to apologize to religious fundamentalists. Although it achieves a good sense of tension all the way, I couldn't help wanting to get to the The Origin of Species release much faster than it actually was (you'll wait until the end). And he seemed to live much more than I ever realized about Darwin's fight with him and his wife Emma, ​​who occasionally portrayed him as a mad madman - which is hardly true. There are many other mistakes and facts that are lacking in relation to the actual story of leadership to the Origin publication, but the entire premise of the film focuses almost exclusively on the difficulties Darwin has faced in the domestic book and a small part of the film. the death of his beloved daughter Annie. This gives the film its most moving scene, where Annie faints as she asks one last time to hear Darwin telling her the story of a captured orangutan who died of pneumonia. Though, you'll probably feel more connected with the primate in this scene than with Darwin's daughter. With an early controversy that seems to surround the movie in the US, it will work well to promote and secure many people. More people will see it. To be honest, in fact, there are very few in it that offend all mythical gods. His barely headline report on a theory that was about 150 years after. But as basic Christians (and many other religions that we are all well aware of) like to wave a banner or two wherever possible, I think this film is as good as an excuse. Personally, I don't see what the fuss is about. But maybe it's just doing ...
