I went straight to the big screen to see this kicker. This is the only film I know that Tarsem Singh was driving, but the boy was intense. This film was a total stimulant and one of the best special effects of this kind. The characters were alive and nothing less than beings created in your own mind or nightmare. This film is scary and interesting and totally bombs senses with fear and enthusiasm. This film is comparable to any other I've seen except for the beautiful strange level. In this respect, it is a relatively big step above the "Orange Watch". Definitely see this movie on the big screen and don't wait until it comes out on the tape. It won't be half good on the tape. This movie is not for scared. It will go crazy with your mind and leave you with pictures that will prevent you from forgetting. But for those who want to be scared ..... ENJOY!
