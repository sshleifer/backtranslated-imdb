The idea came from a real diplomatic incident "The Wind and the Lion" is a very good adventure film that takes place in the deserts of Africa. El Raisuli (Sean Connery) head of an Arab tribe kidnapped an American woman (Candice Bergen) and her two children were given concessions for their country from US President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith). From this simple plot, John Milius gets a very complete and entertaining movie in the genre. <br /> <br /> Outdoor dessert placement, impressive color photos, very well-designed action sequences, and perfect settings turn the image into a kind of epic image with an undeniable sense of size. The musical score is also remarkably suitable. Sean Connery is very good as an Arab leader and evidence that he can handle almost any role. Likewise, Candice Bergen as a woman who shows strength in dangerous circumstances, but deep inside she is afraid and has her weaknesses; she gets to admire Connery and even understand his total different focus on life resulting from their also entirely different cultures. Brian Keith plays one of his best roles as US President Teddy Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> The most entertaining and very good movie pattern in the genre. Give him a chance, you won't regret it.
