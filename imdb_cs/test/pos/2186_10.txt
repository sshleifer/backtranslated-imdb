I saw this game on Showtime a few years back in the comfort of my home and when I hit the last note, I wanted to jump off the couch and give production ovation. As it was, I threw a tear that it was such a bunch of fantastic shows and songs. For my birthday, kids bought me a version of VHS as well as Cd games with Len Cariou as Sween Todd Role. <br /> <br /> I shared a game with many ... some who didn't notice the subject, but we had nothing but praise for the songs. I've always loved the interplay of songs with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn as well as Hearn and Edmund Lyndeck as the Turpin referee. <br /> <br /> I have to own a DVD.
