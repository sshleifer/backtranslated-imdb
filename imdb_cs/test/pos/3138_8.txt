It takes a while to adjust to the sound of Sons of the Pioneers, but then you will enjoy it. If an orchestra like Max Steiner or Dmitri Tiomkin played the soundtrack, he would lose his folklore character. Music leads the film, it seems that everything follows his rhythm. The whole cast is excellent. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. are the young men who drive the caravan. Ward Bond is the leader of Mormon and Joanne Dru is a flirting actress. Ford was able to do what would be ordinary Western, something completely different and original that shows us music, dances and especially people.
