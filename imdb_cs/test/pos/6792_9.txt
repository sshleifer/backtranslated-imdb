This is a wonderful movie. Elizabeth Taylor does a great job, just like Mickey Rooney. The movie just makes you happy. It's inspiring, and although some parts are a little too sentimental, it's easy to forgive. Again and again I could watch this movie. The race at the end is exciting every time I see it. I highly recommend this movie.
