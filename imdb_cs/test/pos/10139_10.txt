Spoilery !!! To understand what actually happened first, you must be a warrior, stay alive in a real war, think off-line, analytically, critically, and not linearly. Otherwise, there will be false conclusions that Maj.Gray was a stupid or unstable man. Truth is something completely different. He was a stiff veteran, and the only way Captain O'Malley could kill him is to want him killed. It was his way out. He chooses it. He was not a retirement man. If you've never been on the front line, you can't understand it. She deliberately prepares her own suicide. First seduced Mary Jane until deliberately acted as stupid until stage arguing - to close the incident before witnesses (to protect her later after she did what he wants her to do if it comes to trial), until she gave her bullet son (to make sure that he could load her weapon later), came that night, loaded her weapon, woke her up, put her gun in her hands, acted when she attacked her, resurrected the knife after the first shot and exclaimed "Kill One", so she again he shot and put down his knife before he died, as if trying to take it back after the first shot. He also gave her a message with the last scream. "After the first kill, everything changes into your mind and destroys your life, that's the only way to die like a man, but being killed by someone I love is my choice and my only privilege, war and army is not what you are They have thought, grow up, and save their lives until you can. ‚ÄùShe eventually left her military life, understood him, and died in vain, the man who helped him prepare everything, and after the trial and the outcome of that trial, was Col Sam Doran for Macy didn't know what was going on and what would be the result, but he did what he was expected to do.He took the photos of Mary Jane and Maj.Gray by ordering Cola Sam Doran who gave this order because Maj.Gray asked him, After refusing to leave the army (as asked by Col.Doran), Col. Doran persuaded the prosecutor to accuse her of prejudice murder (he knew she could not be found on the spot) instead of killing (b) Col.Doran also suppresses an incident of avoiding quarrels to escalate to prevent the plaintiff from having any doubts about a pre-thought murder charge, but letting him reveal during the trial, which greatly affected the jury. I have no doubt about the outcome of this process. Why did Dor do it. Because he'll do anything Maj.Gray asks him to do it. Why? Because he saved his life on the battlefield. Why did Mary Jane decide to go to court? Because she was a person who has integrity, principles. And that's why Maj.Gray chooses it. It must be someone who deserves, someone honest. He keeps his secret about what really happened that night and also shows his honor. Miroslav
