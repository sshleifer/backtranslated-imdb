I find myself happy to have a wonderful movie with two amazing actors. "Kramer vs. Kramer" was great for me because I think I could apply to him. Unfortunately, my parents divorced. Even though I was older than Billy in this movie, I felt his pain and confusion. The worst thing is to have two parents who you thought were happy and end up hating. I really think that thanks to this film, I realized that my parents are also people, and we had as much pain as my sister and I had. Back to the movie, that was a good one. Yes, it's old and Meryl and Dustin are very young. But I would recommend it to a lot of people because I think most can be somehow related. They are funny, sad, happy and relaxing moments that these great actors can carry. It's a good movie and deserves more credit than 7.5. 9/10
