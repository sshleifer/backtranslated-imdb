Gymnast (2006) wrote and directed by Ned Farr. Dreya Weber portrayed Jane Hawkins, a former world class gymnast who was seriously injured and now earns a living as a certified massage therapist. Promotional material leads you to believe that the plot is hung around Jane's accidental encounter. with a former teammate. Although this meeting takes place, this plot line is secondary to the main plot, which includes Jane, her husband, and a professional dancer named Serena (Addie Yungmee). Two women develop a type act performed by Cirque de Soleil. They both complement each other - Jane has more experience with heights and has the tremendous strength of her upper body. Serena is more elegant and artistic, though, of course, also capable of incredible physical performances. The film works because we can understand how Jane would turn to Addie, who is caring and compassionate, while Jane's husband has taken her for granted for many years of their marriage. Both women are incredibly fit and athletic, and Dreya has a slim body and well defined muscles that are characteristic of gymnasts. They clearly fulfill their actions and the results are so excellent that we can believe they will be truly successful in Las Vegas, or anywhere else they traveled. Sexual Stress Between Women It is clear that the situation becomes even more complicated when the law requires them to kiss in the air. A woman with a negligible husband and an attractive female partner make for an explosive situation that is not resolved in a neat and tidy fashion. Of the six films we saw at Leschester and Gay Film and video festival at Rochester NY, we thought this was the best. It will work on DVD, and is definitely worth looking for on a big or small screen.
