To date, I thought there were only three people, including me, who considered the Heavenly Gate (1980) as a masterpiece and perhaps the last great western (since 1970), after Little Big Man (1970), Jeremiah Johnson (1972)), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and The Long Riders (1980). I was impressed and I saw that 22.5% of those who voted in IMDB rated this film 10 as I did. A recent book, the worst films of all time, includes a heavenly gate. Despite its production and release it was vilified, as no film from Cleopatra, nearly twenty years earlier. Suddenly it was considered the most expensive over-budget movie of all time, to overcome even Cleopatra. It was blamed for the fall of his studio, United Artists, until everyone saw that all studios were falling. Michael Cimino, fresh from his fame with a deer hunter, was hated and scorned for his success and overcrowding, but clearly it was a tiny jealousy at worst. Cimino ended up being one of the best exposition of American experience. You should not miss this movie, but no serious American filmmaker.
