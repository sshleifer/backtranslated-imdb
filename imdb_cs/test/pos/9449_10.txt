this is a classic American movie combined with comedy, romance and dream. you can say, "there have been many such films. but believe me it will be good because it is well managed, written and played. Amanda Bynes is just crazy amazing! it is humorous, cute and charming both inside and out of the screen. is really MAN! the message I get is to watch my own fairy tale. what I mean by the term "milk story" is not the one with the prince and the princess, but denotes "faith". This means telling us to keep your faith, dream and things that regret you for a lifetime if you don't. one of those movies you can't miss in your life.
