The various rights and order and CSI franchises should have preferred not to cross the Dolomite. Lady cops, ADAs, and coroners would all be fascinated, and males would be exposed to such soul shaking, a warp-speeding mole badge (It wouldn't just be like seeing David Carusa Horatio and knowing all about CSI getting Dolomite Hush Puppies pulled from their respective donkeys) Ice T can start crying and get back to the Playa Trail. Low Low Budget, Bad, but Enthusiastic Behavior, and Vision on What gutbucket Nightclubs Offered to Its Patrons, Funk Band Soul Singers, Last Remains of Old Style Chitlin Circuit Entertainers (That Weird Dance Ensemble) James Brown, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, and many others came from these clubs to fame while their peers worked at local or regional fame. Rudy Ray Moore came from this background, and the character of the Dolomite is a mixture of bold black badges that stretched out. Should not go to the joint, the pig did not warrant how his middle-aged blubbery self maintained loyal stability kung fu wenches is a mystery only a student of cults can explain, but everything is next to the point. It is the famous home film of the legendary performer, who has hit his mark compared to the actors from established Hollywood to indie film snorefests. Funny stupid movie!
