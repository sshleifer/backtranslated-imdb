Latcho Drom is a film survey of Roma music from several countries. It is touching, sad and joyful. Most segments appear to be completely unstable, misunderstood. Music, from the sensual flamenco music of Spanish Roma to the melancholy music of Central European Roma, is excellent. If you like gypsy music, Latcho Drom is absolutely beautiful. <br /> <br />
