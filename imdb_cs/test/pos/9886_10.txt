I saw the film's premiere during the Phoenix Film Festival in 2005, and I was very impressed by the team of director Jeff Hare who put the current topic on the screen. The cast of the characters combined perfectly and allowed us to explore the issue of seniors who want to die on "their own terms" in a very warm and witty way. Peter Falk was brilliant because Morris and the support group of family and friends were perfectly cast in their roles. The interaction of family, friends and outsiders with Morris has created a realistic view of how families address the issue of parenting and their desire to die with dignity. Although this film is allegedly a film about a Jewish actor and his family, it is really a film about all the families. Family jokes and Morris cracks during this humble life of "nature power" are fresh and realistic. Childhood rivalry, adult achievements and failures and hope for children are an integral part of this scenario. While many will ask how you can "funny" about the topic of suicide, I thought the treatment was logical and timely. If you are not afraid to throw a few tears or laugh at the rats of a family struggling with this problem, then YOU MUST SEEK THIS FILM. The film won the "Best Picture" award in the Phoenix Festival.
