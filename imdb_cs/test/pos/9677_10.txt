When I first saw this show, I was nine, and that immediately caught my eye when Stewie tried to call Lois on the phone at the hotel. I laughed and continued to watch. When the episode was finished, I wrote the name of the cartoon and watched it regularly. This separates from the Simpsons and other shows on saying, Cartoon Network because jokes are more mature, not too much, but it is TV-14 for some reason. Fast movie cuts after each punch line and cute, funny moves and character behavior is special. Talented Seth MacFarlene is the creator and voice of a lot of characters in the show. Good song theme, and crazy family that there's always something fun, it's my favorite cartoon along Sealab 2021 and Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Look at it, it's funny.
