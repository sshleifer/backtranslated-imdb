In 1984, Edgar Reitz surprised film lovers around the world with his epic Heimat: Chronicle of Germany. Eight years later, he came up with The Second Heimat: The Chronicle of Youth, which is even more stunning than his predecessor. Actually, it's not really a sequel. It is rather "midquel" because it covers events that took place between the ninth and the eleventh episode of the first cycle of Heimat. The second Heimat begins in 1960, four years after Hermann Simon (Henry Arnold)) was separated from his first love, Klarchen, the courtesy of his intolerant mother and older brother (controversy had to do with him to be smaller, while she was about 25). The young man still angry with these events promises never to fall in love again (grandiose if it is a scary scene) and decides to move to Munich (just like the director did in the same period) and hopes to become a professional composer. after several years at the music academy. He will stay in Munich for ten years and thirteen two-hour episodes of Heimat 2 cover that time frame, each of which focuses on another person between Hermann's classmates, people who, like him, are looking for a "second home". countries, whether it be music, film or something else they can finally live in peace. Just like the first Heimat, this second cycle is a perfect blend of film and television: episodic structures and various romantic subplots make it look like a soap opera, in fact the second Heimat must be seen in its entirety to be successfully embraced, while some chapters of Heimat 1 could be seen as separate stories (particularly, that concerning Hermann's teenage years). Style and content, however, is pure author's cinemas, with known black-and-white / color transitions (actually, tad more predictable this time around) and ambiguous characters, the latter element being underlined by the relationship between Hermann and the cello player Clarissa \ t they love each other unequivocally, but they continue to deal with other people and stay inevitable until it's too late. This time, Reitz seems more pessimistic about his characters (in one place, Hermann is so disillusioned that he says: "The Beatles are much better than us!"), Building whole episodes around dark, controversial topics like abortion and suicide. The decade he is researching is not suitable for everyone, because some of them are scarred by the major events of the 1960s (especially the '68 revolution). It seems that even Reitz this mini-series specifically for movie-enthusiasts, given numerous film links (including the brilliant Casablanca quote) and clever in-jokes (one episode is given in Venice, whose film festival had an important role in the Heimat Saga success). And since 1992, movie lovers have never stopped thanking him for giving the 26 most compelling hours ever devoted to celluloid.
