Empire of Passion starts deceptively - that is, if you immediately expect it to be a horror movie. It's like a James Cain riff The Postman Always Rings Twice, initially: Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) is a mother of two and obedient, hard-working wife of rickshaw driver Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura). But when he's not around and is at home with a child, the furious and aimless young man Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji) can do his best to bring some things to Seki ... and a little extra. Soon they sleep together, but after doing something to her (say, shaving), she knows she'll find out and immediately suggest that they kill Gisabur. They drink it, strangle it and then throw it into the well. Naturally, it will come back to haunt them - but that is literally, at least for them (first super-scared Seki and then later on skeptical Toyoji), turns into "Kaidan", a Japanese ghost story. This is a movie where horror does not come simply from "oh, spirit, ah", but from the total fear that builds for the characters. In a way, there is film-noir mechanics at work all over the world, if it is loosely translated by a 19th-century Japanese village, unlike an American city or town (ie, a Snooping cop, "evidence" that might find another, bypassing) words, excitement, etc.). It's convincing because Seiko was actually against the plan from the beginning, manipulating him with a lusty but poorly prepared Toyoji, and her reaction to Gisaburo's re-appearances are overwhelming on her. Take the one closest to poetry: Gisaburo's ghost, pale blue face, and mostly a quiet, cool look, movements for Seiko's rickshaw. She reluctantly, and she pushes her around on the road she does not know in hours before dawn, surrounded by smoke. Most Japanese ghost stories want heaven to manage this terrifying atmospheric environment. While it all turns into hysterics, there is so much that director Oshima is right in that it is a big job. After intervening in Sensei (which was ironically banned in his country) in international cinema, he did something he said was even more "brave" to 'Senses'. Maybe he was right; The Empire of Passion has less graphical sexual content than its predecessor (also playing Tatsuya Fuji, a wonderfully physical actor with a vast array of ranges), but his bold lies lie in creating a world of fear. You can believe in ghosts in this story, but you also have to believe how far into their own personal hell these two would-be lovebirds will go. Snooping detective or gossiping townspeople are the least of their worries: the fate of their souls is at stake. And Oshima takes what might be just a juicy pulp in other hands (unfortunately it wouldn't be ') I was surprised if he was already an American remake in the work) and crafts made after a beautiful replay, which got into the mis-en-scene (ie the shots of Seiko and Toyoji who follow this road, the camera at the Dutch angle, the world leaned over and encircled them in a grim blue shade), as well as some of the influential movements that stay with me Long after I have finished writing this (ie Toyoji throwing leaves with one hand into the well in slow motion, or as Seiko's naked body is revealed after becoming blind). It is a courageous lie, based on the spirit-level - not to be confused with the spiritual, though there may be something to it - about the life and mortal connections inseparable from each other. It's a classic waiting to be discovered.
