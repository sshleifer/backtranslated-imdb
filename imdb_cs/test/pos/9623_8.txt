"Five Fingers of Death" is a classic of kung fu cinema. As the movie that "broke out" HK Cinema West, this is a must see for any serious fan of the genre. It's also a damn funny movie, with a solid, non-stop action, solid and mostly believable combat choreography and great dubbing in the first half of the 70s ("Oh, I see ... so you want ALSO HARD WAY !!" HWAA !! "" Five Fingers "is an imaginary story of revenge ... and I mean it literally, an eye for an eye! It's great to see Lo Lieh depicting a hero. He played so many great villains later in his career - including Pai Mei in classic FIST OF THE WHITE LOTUS, which was one of Tarantino's characters used to make Pai Mei KILL BILL. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that I wished there was a better DVD - mine looks like it's a great movie - don't miss it! <br /> <br /> Bart Blackstone Film Club - Hollywood, CA
