One of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. Bechard has a way to look at things that are absolutely unique and this movie won't disappoint. <br /> <br /> This movie is arguing throughout the text and keeps you on the screen with seemingly taboo themes. There are no bad guys or good guys, Bechard will take care of it. The characters are so perfectly complex that you feel at each of them, you care about what they went through. Bechard's attention to detail is in this world of "FAST FOOD MOVIES" and some of these themes can make some unpleasant - you like the feeling of giving it to you. I heard it says too often that there are no new stories. I thank Gorman Bechard for proving to be false. Run, Don't Walk, See This Movie.
