I was really surprised to see that, unlike most documentary films, it was written, directed and produced by film critic Richard Schickel. Most of the times I know where film critics have made significant contributions to movies have proved to be bombs (the main examples are Rex Reed in "Myra Breckenridge" and Roger Ebert "Beyond Dolls"). In this case, however, the powers of criticism are used for good and not for evil - and the results are better (though it doesn't say much, because the films I just mentioned are among the worst films ever made). As for the documentary, Clint Eastwood (quite a good choice) tells him about his long career - from his quiet days to his death in the early 1960s. The only negatives, and they are insignificant, is that the film is very short (just like most movie documents) and there are very few people about Gary Cooper - you really don't know much about his life. However, as a nice overview of his films, he works very well.
