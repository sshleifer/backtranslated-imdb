Overall, I enjoyed Scarlett. I'm a huge Gone fan with the Wind. I've read the book and I've seen a classic movie many times. I even have a small collection of Scarlett O'Hara ornaments and other things. I must admit that Gone with the Wind is my favorite book and movie. Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable are remarkable actors and two of my favorites. Unfortunately, I couldn't read Scarlett's book, but I was thrilled to see the movie. The truth is that the film is nothing close to Gone with the Wind and the actors. However, Joan Whalley Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were pleasant roles actors and Joan sounded like Vivian Leigh in her portrayal of Scarlett. Dalton also occasionally displayed Rhett. It took some time to get used to different actors, but overall I really enjoyed it and I was a fan of Gone with the wind like me. One big disappointment was that Joan didn't have green eyes and Scarlett O'Hara and Vivian Leigh. I also found out that Lord Fenton was absolutely scary and I didn't like his character. If you're a fan of the wind and / or enjoying romantic stories, check out Scarlett. But don't expect it to be remarkable as Gone with the Wind. It's far away, though it's interesting with new characters and so on. I'm glad it's not a remake and some of the events in the story were what I imagined the sequel to Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. If you haven't seen him today, will you marry him tomorrow? :)
