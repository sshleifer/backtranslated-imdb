We don't know why this extraordinary movie has never been officially available on DVD ... Anthony Quinn herself sees it. There are relatively few films in which the actor identifies so deeply with his character, a phenomenon always unique to us, viewers. But Quinn is a strong depiction of an innocent Romanian, literally pulling out of his house, and everyday life with forces he can't understand is just part of what makes this film great. The script is based on a book published in Paris by a Romanian priest who fled the Communist takeover of his country, and the film managed to penetrate deeply into the little known area of ​​Eastern Europe. It is said that the consequences of the fate of Kafka-esquiru, the disaster of Johann Moritz (openly and frankly, without any political correctness in Hollywood, which is so rare today) are in fact praised for the lost innocence of the Romanian people. It is devilishly ironic that this eulog is signed by a French director who works with the American money of an Italian producer and oversees the multinational cast of an extraordinary Mexican native. he saw references to VCD of this film in various Asian online stores, and I was lucky enough to get a digital recording of this movie, broadcast on the UK version of TCM. But it is a pity that "The 25th Hour" is nowhere on the future DVD version of MGM study maps.
