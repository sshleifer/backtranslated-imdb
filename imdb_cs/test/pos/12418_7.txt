I got a Monster Man in a box of three movies where I wanted two more but I had a nice time with them. To mix horror and comedy to a rational effect, helped considerably by respectable performances of Eric Jungman as a freaking edge, Justin Urich as his hole mate and Aimee Brooks as a love interest. The film is quite predictable and has many other films, but it remains amusing around the world, with some good horrible gore thrown in. Director Michael Davis even manages one or two scary scenes, such as the bathroom or the bar. The film is observable all the time, if it is a little chaotic and written, and for me it only lost a little bit to the end when the Monster Man title begins to resemble a member of Slipknot and the film tries to go horror style, but not. t twisted or convincing enough. The last moments are also weak. Yet, despite the lack of great tension and total stupidity, it is a good example of the unpretentious, often harsh, comedy splash that should be admired to fans of the same.
