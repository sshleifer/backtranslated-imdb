Andy McDermott (Tom Everett Scott) is a shy American teenager spending his holiday in Paris with his friends Brad and Chris. Andy rescues Serafine Pigot (beautiful Julie Delpy) from committing suicide in the Eiffel Tour and has a crush on her. He doesn't know he's a werewolf. They go underground and are attacked by werewolves. Andy is injured and becomes a werewolf. He is taught that the only way to kill again normally is to kill the werewolf who attacked him and ate his heart. This film is a violent black humor. Special effects and soundtrack are excellent, accentuating Bush's song. I do not know why some readers compare this film with the masterpiece "The American Werewolf in London". Stories have nothing to do with each other (only the American teenager, the werewolves and the city in Europe). Highly indicated for fans of werewolves and black humor movies. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): "Um Lobisomem Americano em Paris" ("American Werewolf in Paris")
