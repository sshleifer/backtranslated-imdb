Generally, I like SRK as a villain (how not it?) And I believe that SRK and Juhi are the perfect match on the screen because they are both nicer than nice. This movie is a great watch, although it has some major drawbacks: <br /> <br /> 1) A good guy (Sunny) - Not just that less attractive than Shahrukh (which is my opinion) opinion soooooo important in Bollyfilms) but his role is missing character - it would be much better if there were a conflict between two strong personalities, instead we have a conflict between personality and average soldier <br /> <br /> 2) Kiran and Sunil's reaction Rahula's actions are incredibly stupid and naive even for Bollywood's production <br /> <br /> This is not so important compared to the wonderful melodramatic atmosphere, great songs (really great) and (say again) Shahrukh as a thief, me just love him when he's so pagan <br /> <br /> You have to see (along with Anjaam, Baazigar and Duplicate)
