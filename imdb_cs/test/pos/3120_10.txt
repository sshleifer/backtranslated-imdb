For my money, probably the best movie - or at least the purest movie film - director Ford has ever done. The dialogue is fast, clipped, to point.l The story starts at the very beginning and ends only with final credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but drives them and takes pictures with verve and sweeping epic proportions. Grimly realistic, warmly entertaining, brilliantly acted (hard to believe Johnsonj could not become a leading man after this), with the best photography and editing in any American black and white film. She owes her work to the editorial technique of Sergei Eisenstein, but is never so coldly separated or "scientific" as Eisenstein could often get. And great music score. Beautiful panorama of important and misunderstood episodes in American history. One small question: it is not clear why the film concerns Mormons who, as far as I know, have never been pacifists Quakers and Amish. This confusion leaves a slightly bitter flavor. However, the rest of the movie is a holiday that can be easily ignored. In all other ways, a true masterpiece of American cinematography that needs to be revived and looked at again (and again and again).
