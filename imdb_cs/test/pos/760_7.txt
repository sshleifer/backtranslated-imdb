I've never heard of this movie before I met him when I looked at the shelves in the local rental shop. When I was watching Harry Potter's last installment, I was surprised by Rupert Grint and wanted to see more of his work. When I read the description on the back of an "exaggerated, evangelical Christian courtier," and I recognized him as an evangelical Christian, I thought, "That should be interesting. And so it was. I found Mr. Brock's story in both words and images; and sadly, too familiar. The contrast he drew between Ben's parents' interpretations of what it means to be a Christian was a stimulating commentary on how Christians look at themselves and the impact this perception has on those who surround them. On the one hand, we have Ben's mom, who says, "Whatever happens behind these walls, Ben, we are God's ambassadors. We will show the world a smiling face." On the other hand, Ben's dad is in truth in his preaching at the beginning of the film. At the end of his monologue he says: "The more one demonstrates his Christianity to the benefit of others, the less I am willing to believe Christianity that he claims." God tells us that true faith is the freedom of choice of truth. As you express it, in a way, manner, means at your disposal, these things have no meaning, whether you are a Christian or an atheist, unless you are true in your heart. If only our churches were full of Christians who attributed this second definition to what it meant to be a follower of Jesus rather than an earlier one. What difference would it make! As a Christian and psychologist, I want every day to be perfectly perfect, but authentic, over a perfectly polished image. What tragedy? to feel as always must play a role when I really have to rest in the freedom of being who God has made me. I think Mr. Brock provides a refreshing look at how this freedom looks in Christ. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a fresh look at the faith.
