Finally watching this shocking movie last night, and what a disturbing mind is, and incredibly bloody and some unforgettable scenes, and a total attack on the senses. It looks like a movie from Lynch's mind (specifically ERASERHEAD), Buttgereit, and even a little "Begotten". What this guy does to his pregnant sister is out of faith, but then it really happened, or it's the left and right side of the brain that makes the battle. This is the main theme of this art, to draw a subtle line between fantasy and reality, and what would happen if the right side of the brain that dreams and fantasies outpaced the logic and logical left side. And the music in this movie is incredible, an electronic score that is absolutely perfect. Although this movie is absolutely shocking and quite disgusting in some of the most extreme scenes (including the hard core) you will ever see in every movie, I saw it as a work of art and loved it. And the music still impresses me, I have to try to find a soundtrack if it is available. Watching "Subconsciousness of Cruelty" is a real event and not something that the viewer easily forgets. And a note for gorehounds, that's a necessity. <br /> <br /> Warning ... Be careful when buying this movie because some prints are fogged up on graphic sex scenes and extreme gore, especially on copies of the Japanese edition.
