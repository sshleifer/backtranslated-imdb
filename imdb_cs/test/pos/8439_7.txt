It's a pretty good thriller at a Southern California nuclear power plant, directed by James Bridges and stars Jane Fonda, Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas. Fonda plays a television reporter who wants to be an investigative journalist, but can only be a TV reporter. Douglas is an independent cameraman and Lemmon is a nuclear power supervisor. Fonda and Douglas are sent to a routine task at a nuclear power plant and the accident almost happens and they do it all on film. Everyone tries to cover him, except for Fonda and Douglas, so Douglas steals the film. Lemmon begins to investigate and finds that the company is interested in profit more than in-plant safety. It's a good movie with a pretty good ending.
