I was recently on a birthday party with five other girls all my age (eleven.) We all thought it was some harmless little movie like Jaws who rented it along with Rat Race. (We watched Rat Race after a stranger calls to alleviate our fear.) We gave the film at 11:00 at night, and in most cases we were hiding in sleeping bags, hiding behind the covers. I screamed five times, which is unusual for me because I'm scared in movies, but I've never done enough to scream. We were all terrified to leave the bedroom because we were all positive Stalker (Jenkins). how we called him for some reason) would get us. I played the middle trick; one each was gone once the Rat Race ended up I hid under the sleeping bag and said softly and humbly "Did you check the baby?" They all looked like nuts and were scared. The only thing I didn't like was that: 1. There were too many false alarms when Jill thought Stalker was there and 2. The kids never woke up all the way to Jenkins, they kidnapped them and hid them in the closet. At the time all they did was cry like children. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a thriller. But one thing: I DO NOT ACCESS LONG 21:00 EVER AGAIN1!
