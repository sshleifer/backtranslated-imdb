This movie is just great ... It starts really slow and boring, but as the movie progresses ..... even entertainment is coming. The power of the film is perhaps in its subtle references to much (and I think a lot) of other films. The best for me was maybe Bruce Lee / Crouching Tiger, The Hidden Dragon. It was amazing how two actors move from French to Chinese or from any Asian language. Then jokes with names are cheerful, but you may not understand everyone when your American (no offense). Great movie in general
