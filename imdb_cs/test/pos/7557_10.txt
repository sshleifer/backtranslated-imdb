... that sometimes people will wake up. People who can resist the urge to separate everyone and everything and who see the 60s for what they were. People who see that they were individuals who created these times; not the other way around. The comparison of "Forrest Gump" is good. Both films look at the 1960s, but "Four Friends" are about human beings, as opposed to cartoons. FF plunges deep into what FG (quite successfully!) Tries to condense and classify as nothing more than just a background. But while the "Gump" files of the 60s in the attic, such as the old toys in the box, "Four Friends" pick up and embrace each toy, thereby blurring the line between what you hold dearly and what you are. <br /> <br /> If you combine romance with a shoe cushion, you hate this movie.
