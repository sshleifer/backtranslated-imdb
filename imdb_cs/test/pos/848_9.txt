Gene Roddenberry never left her fans down. His death ended in a Sci-Fi heritage that will never be closed. Earth: Ultimate Conflict was proof! His pilot film and the first 2 seasons were well written and carefully made, but somewhere along the way Roddenberry was lost. Loss of leadership, Kevin Kilner (William Boone) definitely hurt the show because he was an important part of what he was doing. The story includes the human race attended by the Taelons, an extraterrestrial race called "The Companions." After 3 years they gave the country new technologies, useful information about the universe and more. Many question their intentions here on Earth. The main point of contact on Earth between races is Da'an (Leni Parker) and he is for many, the most reliable Taelon. Questions arise: why are they here? What are their goals, does Da'an realize any suspicious conspiracy against humans? There is an underground group led by millionaire industrialist Jonathan Doors (David Hemblen) who uses his millions to investigate the Taelons. By the end of the first season, things have been doing well, Da'an seems credible, Boone is helping Doors in his investigation of working with Da'an and Taelons as a liaison partner. In the middle of season 2, things begin to crumble and the once amazing and fascinating series spiraled down, mostly because Roddenberry died and wasn't around to lead producers whose roommate was his wife Majel Barrett-Roddenberry. However, the first season remains interesting and fun.
