This film revolves around an Arab leader (Amir) who dies and wants to live on. Dr. So, Lloyd Trenton is paid for the brain of the Amir transplant into a "willing" participant. But in the basement of Doctor, his dwarf assistant Dorro (Angelo Rossitto) drains the blood of young girls for the purposes of doctors. Until then, Dr. Llyod will pay a man to kill people who helped Amir into the country (which is Reed Hadley, Grant Williams, and various unknown bodyguards). Grant is the only one who survived when his car falls off the road. Although this happened, doctors other assistant Gor is sent to get the body for the amir and hurts him so badly Dr.Llyod cant work. Meanwhile, Grant finds Amirs "girlfriend" Regina Carrol and tells her her story. Grant sees the man who took him out of the way and Dorro kills him. Since Gor couldn't get the body D. Llyod puts the Amir's brain into the Gorsa's disfigured body. Then Grant and Regina go to the Doctors lab <br /> <br /> ------------------------ SPOILERS ------- - ---------------- Find out his secret. Soon Amir (Gor) floats around killing people, and in the mud of what I think is a conspiracy, Dr. Llyod has a brain rays weapon that hurts Amir. It turns out that Dr. Lloyd wants a country where all scientists can work without a law. So then Regina dies. and at the end of Amirse the new body (I think) I say it will be a new country blah blah. I still don't have an end, but overall it was a very nice piece of smelly cheese. This film presents Grant Williams in his second to final film. I recommend for all fans of Al Adamson or if you like Brains.
