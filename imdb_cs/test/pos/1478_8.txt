I rate it high enough just for Sam Elliott. I could do it without a female female nudity, but I was almost nonsense to see Sam recover his things. He gets to the outflows of wonderfully cynical witticisms, many of whom I agree with, and it is a pleasure to see him in the role of actually getting into emotions instead of just standing and frowning and looking masculine as possible. My friend believed that this film was in several ways similar to a movie in which Ed Harris had a Hispanic partner (in the police sense of the term!), Which was a little overeager to prove himself. You can draw your own conclusions on this score, but if you like Sam, you like it. You could say I'm impressed, but who isn't in some way? I would buy it on a DVD at pulse!
