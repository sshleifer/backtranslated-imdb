First I have to say that I am a huge fan of Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento. Even though I didn't see all of their movies, I really enjoyed almost everyone I saw. I really like giallos and I thought Argento was the master of this genre after seeing movies like "Tenebre" and "Phenomena". After seeing Fulci's "New York Ripper", I found out that he could do pretty good giallos along with his graphic zombie movies and even surpass Argento at some level. I like Fulci's style, and yes, I love gore, but I think this movie, though it has more developed conspiracies and characters than its other films, is not its best. What I don't like is that it can sometimes be confusing, especially at the end. And the fact that we're going from one suspect to another and then another until we suspect a retarded girl for a moment, I think it's going too far. I know that giallos should guess you to the end, and the killer should be very hard to find, but this movie plays a bit too much with our mind. But I liked the scene when the witch was killed. The game is also very good and the photo is great. Although it is not a bad movie, I think Lucio Fulci has made better films than this, and I think his best is "The Beyond". , a very different film, but a more atmospheric and visual experience. <br /> <br /> I give "Don't Die the Duckling" and 7 of 10. <br /> <br />
