I disagree with the previous remark that "driving lessons" is more than just a little twee, but one person's accusation is another conjecture. In my book this film succeeds in pure charm, no small performance in itself. I can't help but wish the story was a little less conventional because of the amount of acting talent in it, but by the end it seems more like a background for character interactions. Julie Walters' Dame Evie is solemnly at the top and over the actress hill. Though Evie has not had a steady job in years, it is unclear when she last visited reality, if at all (I think Edina from "AbFab" at 65, at one point is even forced to cope with her kitsch factor). Some may bother her, but I think it's a reason to stress how much he pushes the buttons reserved for Ben (Rupert Grint) to push him out of his shell. Ben is equally isolated from reality, living his whole life under the thumb of his overly addicted mother, who is able to breathe some life into Laura Linney, even though she is a rather one-dimensional character (you are a treacherous religious mother). I was somewhat overwhelmed by Rupert Grint, who found himself giving very honest and believable performance (not to mention sweets as everyone who gets out), I can't think of many teenagers who say that today. The heart of the film is what happens when Ben and Evie collide. Of course, Ben is obviously experimental, but also interested, because Evie is basically the exact opposite of everything he has ever known. With a combination of the perseverance of Evie and Ben's helpful nature, a real sweetness develops between them, culminating in an unlikely trip that gives Ben the first true taste of independence. The short melodramatic bits, but still a surprising amount of emotional resonance, merit of the main actors. All in all, if you are willing to sit back and be enchanted by some beautiful shows, "driving lessons" should not disappoint. However, if "cute" is not in your movie dictionary, best to stay away. One other small note, the soundtrack presents the music of Sufjan Stevens prominently, a nice touch.
