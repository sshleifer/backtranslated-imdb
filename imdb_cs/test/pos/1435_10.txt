I saw this movie about 12 years ago and I still remember it as if I had seen it recently. That's how much this film influenced me. <br /> <br /> Since it's a 50's movie, I think it was a while ago. I was surprised at how he retains his integrity in this matter. Very realistic in how he shows a turbulent and heartbreaking path that the drug addict decides to enter. We can only imagine how viewers were influenced by the realism of this film these days. I personally think it was one of Frank Sinatry's top five performances on the big screen. <br /> <When others discuss films dealing with mental illness and / or addiction, I always recommend Man with Golden Arm as one of the top five girls.
