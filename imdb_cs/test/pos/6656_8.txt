At the weekend I watched Cold Mountain and an English patient. The first of them is the Melodrama of the Inman Civil War (Jude Law), a Confederate soldier who leaves the army to return to Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), whom he hardly knows. Both films were lovingly directed by Anthony Minghell, who has exceptional work. Although Cold Mountain is very good, it could have been a great movie with the right casting and less popular, backwood dialogue. Romantic epics need a compelling heroine. The English patient had Kristin Scott Thomas, who was perfectly cast as intelligent, seductive and beautiful Katherine Clifton. The main problem of Cold Mountain is Ada, who seems silly and dull and lacks the quality that would convince you that Inman might be obsessed with one kiss. As actress Kidman has a limited range, she usually plays strict women who face adversity with stoicism. Kidman was also too old to play human love. The film needed a young actress who could play charming, warm and vulnerable. For someone who reportedly suffered stiffness and almost starved, she looked ridiculously good and well dressed. Kidman was so flawed that it looked like she'd spent three hours preparing for every scene. Michele Pfieffer could play a role in younger days. Even Natalie Portman would improve. Renee Zelleweger was more dressed, but her animated performance chewed the scenery, but she might have tried to compensate for Kidman. Jude's law was in his own silent film in Odysseus's role, but played his part well. Ray Winstone was excellent as a London / South villain. During the Civil War, according to today's standards, people were not sufficiently educated, and perhaps they spoke monosyllables. However, when you watch a BBC adaptation of Dickens, Austen or Mrs. Gaskill, everyone is articulated. Maybe it's unrealistic, but it would improve my fun.
