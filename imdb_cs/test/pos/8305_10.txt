My father took me to see this movie when it was released in 1976. But I was a kid and it was crap. So much that I had to leave the theater during a particularly claustrophobic tunnel scene because it was too intense for me !!! I went home to the safety of my family. I saw the movie all the way I was older and enjoyed it. Pity of men in monster suits. If you overlook the cheapness of production and delve deeper, you will find the excellent performance of Cushing, a stunning introductory score, some nice photos and ever more reliable Mr. McClure, my child hero! end! Titty Bang Bang Cave Woman! Monsters with beaks! Actors in monster suits gliding over wires! It has it all! Splendid.
