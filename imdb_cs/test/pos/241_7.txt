Rita Hayworth lights up the screen in this fun, fantastic and wonderful music play by Gene Kelly. Rita is played by dance dancer Rusty Parker, who has dreams of being a successful Broadway star. Unfortunately, her career is not in the nightclub Danny McGuire. When one of her dancers says she enters the Cover Girl contest, she decides to follow her dreams and enter. She reminds her grandmother's publisher, who was deeply in love with her many years ago. But when she finds this success, her boyfriend is not happy about it. I've never seen Rita before and I'm so glad I did it! She has such a presence on the scene and is a very good actress. There are some good numbers here, not the best of the musical, but they are melodic and good to listen to. One thing I didn't like was Gene Kelly. He was supposed to support his girlfriend! But it is probably the only criticism I have about this film. Cover Girl is a famous, fluffy film - a perfect escape. Not everyone is an ideal movie, but an amazing movie, however, because of Rita Hayworth's star power. Great movie, really stunned.
