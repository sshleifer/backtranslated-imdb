"Buffalo Bill, Hero of the Far West" director Mario Costa The unwavering Spaghetti western "The Beast" with Klaus Kinski could only be made in Europe. Hollywood would never dare to make Western about sexual predators on the hunt as the protagonist of the film. Never mind that Kinski is ideally suited for the role of "Crazy" Johnny. He plays an individual with no sympathy, ironically dressed from head to toe in a white suit, trousers and hat. This low-budget oater has nothing to do with it. Typical breathtaking Spanish scenery around Almeria is nowhere in evidence. Instead, Costa and his cameraman Luciano Trasatti, who shot another Kinski western "and God said to Cain," spun this horse opera in a rather secular environment around Tor Caldara, Lazio, Italy and Monte Gelato Waterfalls, Treja River, Lazio, Italy. . However, the "beast" qualifies as the continental west because it handles wholly unscrupulous characters, and the action could be classified as a film noir because the hero and heroine are imprisoned by the unbearable circumstances that make them resort to crime. Predictably, their well-planned plans give up predominantly Kinski. The real character of Kinski resembles the character of Will E. Coyote. He is consistently trying to have sex with some beautiful women, but each of his efforts is frustrated either by lawmakers or outlaws. Finally, the "beast" equals the tragic character study lining the irony. Stelvio Cipriani's orchestral score sounds like it was canceled by Tony Anthony Western "The Stranger Returns". Mario Costa takes place on the western border between San Diego and Mexico, which is terrorized by the notorious Mexican bandit named Machete (Giovanni Pallavicino from "We're Still Killing the Old Way") and his gang. They prey on the stagecoach and nobody is safe from their destruction. For the first time we see 'Crazy' Johnny Laster, he pauses to refresh himself on the stream and see a beautiful-looking woman washing her clothes. She creeps behind her and attacks her, but she hits a larger man with a rifle and has to escape. He appears in a nearby town, and a pistol sniffer takes it to help the rich man, Mr. Powers, get on the trail and rob him. They close it and receive no money. Mr. Snuff-sniffer inadvertently leaves the tobacco box at the crime scene and the sheriff arrests suspicion of murder. "Crazy" shoots his accomplice from his hotel room so he doesn't have to worry about being involved in a crime. Meanwhile, a young couple in love struggles with the world. . Riccardo (Requiem for Bounty Killer, Steven Tedd) lives on his Mexican couple ranch and helps them raise their real son Juan. In the village, Riccardo is a beautiful friend of Juanita (Gabriella Giorgelli of "Stranger in Sacramento") singing and dancing in the canteen. Riccardo and Juanita are planning to marry, but the last place Juanita wants to settle is on a dusty ranch. She dreams of living in a city, but city life requires more money than either Riccardo or she has. They team up with a blonde outlaw named Glen (Paolo Casella of "Shoot the Living and Pray for the Dead") and plan to kidnap Mr. Power's daughter Nancy when she comes to marry her inheritance. Glen makes a fatal mistake to get Johnny's "Crazy" to help them because Glen knows Johnny needs money to get to the women. They kidnap Powers' daughter and keep her in a remote cabin with Johnny standing guard over her. Meanwhile, Juanita appears to be Powers 'daughter and appears in the city to raise money from Powers' Gary Pinkerton (Giuliano Raffaelli's "Blood and Black Lace") but grows suspicious because Juanita doesn't seem to remember Nancy. . Riccardo wields six weapons and warns Pinkerton that they have kidnapped Nancy. Unfortunately for Riccardo and Juanita, Pinkerton can only lay his hands on 50,000 dollars, because Machete has struck such fear in everyone's hearts that the total heritage of powers cannot be transported across the territory by stagecoach. Meanwhile, in the cabin, horny Johnny is trying to rape Nancy, but she fills him up, knows him with a pretense chair that he needs to be alone while she undresses. After he knocks him unconscious, he steals the stroller and takes him back to town. Johnny is recovering, watching and killing her at the same time that Glen, Riccardo, Juanita and Pinkerton meet him on the trail. They tell Johnny about the complications that Machete causes the reign of terror and give him $ 12,000 for his cuts. Pinkerton is horrified at seeing Nancy's blood corpse and threatens Johnny. Naturally, Johnny shoots him in cold blood on the spot. Things are really getting worse as the law in San Diego tries to capture Machete. Glen, Riccardo and Juanita return to Mexico, while Johnny attacks two women at the ranch and escapes tightly. He's going to Mexico, finding a canteen and going on her when he gets a reward in his face. Johnny admits he knows where they can find more money if they release him. Machete's men follow Johnny's tip and capture Juanita. The villagers join Riccardo to attack Machete and Johnny save Juanita, but later die after a big break. Riccardo is standing alone now. Machete and his men retaliated against their parents, who killed them late, but also a little Juan. Everything Riccardo and Juanita dreamed of as they rose in the clouds of a smoke gun for the unhappy end. 'Crazy' Johnny dies and never tries to hurt his desire. If you think of Costa's uncompromising sagebrusher, "The Beast" appears to be an interesting character study and exercise in film noir in a Western setting where everyone is punished.
