The average adventurous film that took a serious story and that of "Holywoodised" it.The watering effect did especially towards the average script to kidnap this movie instead as if it were a solid classic. Why water such a great story? Probably because he deals with "sensitive" colonial matters and manufacturers do not want to create political heat, thank you very quickly. Direction, cinematography and soundtrack and acting were good. Connery's charm was his poor Arab accent, and all the scenes with President T. Roosevelt were masterpieces. The costumes / sets were very good. what the story requires. Only for big fans of the main actors or fans of exotic Romance / Adventure Holywood .....
