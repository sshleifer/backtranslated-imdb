While Disney has been an animation studio for the past 70 years, there have always been rivals to their superiority. When this review was written in 2009, for example, companies like Dreamworks and (to a lesser extent) Warner Brothers and Ardman, they brought animated movies that could attack Disney's dominance. At the beginning, in the late 1930s and early 1940s, when Disney served for movie banquets like Snow White, Dumbo and Fantasy, the competition was provided by the brothers Dave and Max Fleischer. Despite the release of two very commendable films, have they never intervened in the market? many attribute their downfall to Mr. Buga Goes' commercial failure in the city, released the same week as an attack on Pearl Harbor (which gave the American public something more important to think about going to the movies to watch a cartoon!) This film has disappeared into relative confusion is travesty. There's a lot of bug in terrible danger in the patch of an overgrown city garden. People use land as an abbreviation, throwing trash and cigars and other dangers right up in the houses of error. The honey shop owner, Mr. Bumble (voiced by Jack Mercer), fears that the future is bleak and wonders how he will ever be able to wake his daughter Honey (expressed by Pauline Loth) in a safer environment. The highly reckless creature, Bagley C. Beetle (voiced by Tedd Pierce), offers to give her a safer place to live if he takes his hand in marriage, but Honey is more interested in her childhood pet, the ever-hopping and optimistic Hoppity ( voiced by Stan Freed). Hoppits believe that everything is to be solved for the better, but is left foolish when Bagley Beetle and his few comic sidekicks manipulate the crisis on their own mysterious end. Only at the very end, when their patch becomes the foundation of a giant new skyscraper, they switch bug loyalty back to Hoppity as they look at it as a new, safe home away from the destructive influence of humans. > <br /> What really works in this movie is a wonderful characterization? All bugs are cleverly developed and designed for maximum audience appeal. Sinking Villains Swat Fly and Smack Mosquito (cheerful names if you stop thinking about it) are particularly memorable. Is the narrative story equally admirable? even the youngest children can enjoy this story, while at the same time skillfully conveying a message to older audiences about how human negligence can affect the survival of wildlife. Time inevitably comes from some aspects of the film and when viewed, viewers must accept (and forgive) these occasional signs of general age and wear. But overall, Mr. Bug Goes To Town is a perfect, witty and very gently presented animation with a dignified message.
