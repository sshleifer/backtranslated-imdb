I decided to watch it on FearNet on request for free, because I thought well, nothing else looks nice. And it turned out to be a pretty good surprise! The film serves as an anthology of four urban legends told from the perspective of four teenagers whose car falls apart in the middle of nowhere. After deciding to build a campfire in the woods, they begin to tell their spooky stories and film transitions to story events. Newlyweds - A newlywed couple traveling across the country in RV Las Vegas is terrorized when parked in a wooded area by evil beings that fish in full moon. (I will not spoil you!) Hook-Amy Smart and James Marsden (probably the most famous people in the movie next to the beautiful Christine Taylor) play a young couple face to face with a maniac who has a hand hook in this most famous short. <br /> <br /> People can Lick Too - this is probably the scariest and darkest stories. A young girl chats with another girl on the internet, but it turns out she is actually a man who is obsessed with her and continues to break into the house when she is alone. That was really freezing. The Locket- This is also a great story with Glen Quinn and Jacinda Barrett, who play a motorcyclist and a beautiful, muted girl who is in a mysterious spirit terrorized by the ghosts of the last century. farmhouse. That was good, but it was the weakest of the applications. The group around the campfire is slowly developing its own frightening experience in its segments among the stories, and the end of this film is surprising and truly amazing! Overall, it's not a convulsive spooky bones, but it's definitely a big blame for horror fans to appreciate!
