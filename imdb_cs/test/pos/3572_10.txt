Bluff I really think this movie is very good. It's a basic kind of Colombian film. It's cheerful and actors use local expressions that are financially interesting enough to listen. It shows a different face about Bogota and I think it is very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we have to show that the world This is Felipe Martinez's first film and I really will be the beginning of a big one besides this movie film director's career. We must continue to support the film industry in Colombia, because the film and other good films are the beginning of something big.
