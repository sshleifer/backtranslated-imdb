Walter Matthau is fabulous as a "filandering" dentist. Julian Winston, whose frequent fibs girlfriend Goldie provides textbook proof of the danger of lying. Touchie Goldie Hawn Toni Simmons certainly deserved to win an Oscar. Ingrid Bergman's work as Stephanie's stiff starch also touches as she slowly and nervously looks out of her shell. This is a great movie to watch in the spring or whenever it comes. It is very underestimated; I never heard of it until I found it in the video store, and what finding!
