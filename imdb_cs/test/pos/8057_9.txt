To see the fictionalized biography of "The Phenix City Story," I say it's supposed to enter the field where American filmmakers seldom embarked, director Phil Karlson got his directorial assignment on the "The Untouchables" television mega-hit series mostly based on "Kansas City Confidential and This Movie; and Became One of the Most Admired and Most Imitated Films. The most outstanding performance of American filmmakers is probably a hero directed against a crime movie or TV series; and even the "Untouchables producers" had to work to produce something other than episodes that deal mainly with the unfair activities of criminals, rather than their ethical opponents.This powerful, key and very daring film has its own style, and its lesson seems to be Pay attention to details of resistance There is a twelve-minute overture to the film, in which reporter Clete Roberts interviews real participants from Alabama City's who fought against his corrupt vice gangs. The problem grew out of the presence of Fort Benning across the river, and an almost century-long existence of more dens in the area. The film describes the return of John Patterson from Germany, where he was a prosecutor. His father, defeated for the Attorney General in Alabama, refuses to join his persecution of 14th street vicelords over several provocations including beating his son, revenge Patterson on his torturer. There are several well-developed characters, including Ellie, who works in one of the clubs and her honest friend, syndicate leader, Pattersons and John's wife, Ed Gage, vicelord agents and Zeke Ward, an honest black. for their opposition to them. Harry Neumann's filmmaking and Stanley Fleischer's artistic direction are in BW and are very similar to the news film, which contributes to the realistic power of the film. Harry Sukman's music contributes effectively to the film. Writer Daniel Mainwaring and Crane Wilbur have created a fast and straightforward story that is divided into parts. The first part illustrates the vice-presidents' empire from one of their clubs and shows the fate of the victim who is defeated and then raised by the Mobu police. In the second part, Albert Patterson refuses to oppose Mobu leader, intelligent Rhett Tanner. In part three, young Patterson returns, and after several incidents, including having to beat Mob's head to avenge his own beating, he decided to run his father for the state attorney general. His wife is horrified; and Mob kills Zeke Ward's daughter and throws the body into Patterson's house with a warning that his kids will be next. Several other such incidents, including the loss of the trial in which Pattersoni proves that he killed his friend who found out that the car was involved in the murder of a little girl, and watches the investigation claim a fatal accident, convince Patterson's run, and he wins Democratic National nomination over Mob statistical tactics - and is immediately murdered. John Patterson stops the vigilant crowd from launching open war with 14th Street mob and uses their voices to call capital and demand martial law for Phenix City. Clubs are closed and confiscated, but not before the girl inside is murdered by Mob, and Patterson must be stopped by Zeke Ward to kill Tanner instead of putting him into law. The end of the drama is positive; but the city's forecast is smaller than painted; the crowd actually tried to return, then moved to Tennessee. Richard Kiley is young but very strong as Patterson, playing without accent. John McIntyre as his father is very good, while Edward Andrews as Boss Tanner won the award. Others in the cast include Kathryn Grant as a girl inside, Ellie, Jean Carson and Kathy Marlowe as Mob women, John Larch as their goon, Biff McGuire as a young victim, James Edwards as Zeke Ward, Lenka Peterson as John's wife, and some good actors like townspeople and bosses Mob. It's hard to suggest enough good things about realism and lack of possession in this movie; this is certainly one of Phil Karlsson's best directorial efforts. Karlson also made "Scarface Mob" later made a "walk high" as well. A sober and stimulating look at the ease with which satisfied citizens of democracy of public interest can accept tyranny, and how a few sincere men can teach them the need to fight for their rights.
