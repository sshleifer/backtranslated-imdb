Haruhi Suzumiya Melancholy is based on a somewhat upright pattern of Japanese school anime drama. The formula goes somewhat like this: <br /> <br /> 1. The main protagonist comes from outside the normal society and has great powers. 2. Beautiful and sexy girl is in a supporting role. 3. The normal character is there who shares the lead role in the story. 4. Unusual things happen in the usual social environment. 5. Sometimes there is a story about the main protagonist and about a normal character that is related to the existence or destruction of the world. 6. Absolutely no one makes any effort to gain all the magical powers. They just have it. 7. Usually, people outside this narrow inner group are not aware of their super powers and continue their daily lives. <br /> <br /> That's it. Suzumiya Haruhi's melancholy is made along these lines that have become a successful formula for comics and anime in Japan. Although it follows the formula of pat, the series is greatly crafted and episodes are always placed in an interesting back within the normal social environment that always morphs into unusual circumstances around Haruhi Suzumiya. Every player in the story brings some unusual insights into everyday life that we usually don't realize. The philosophical twist of their insights is what makes this series extra fun. The visuals are first-class and beautiful. The crazy ideas that Haruhi always come up with with the complicated story setting can occasionally cause you a headache. This is further complicated by the fact that episodes are played out of order, which further contributes to confusion. When I watched the episodes in chronological order, some of the charts finally made sense. I recommend doing the same. It's much more fun to watch serials this way.

Let me know if you did.
