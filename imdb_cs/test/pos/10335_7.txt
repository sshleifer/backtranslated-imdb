"The summer of my German soldier" was one of many TV movies, which became the core of small screen in the 1970s (others were "Brian's Song", "Sybil" and "Someone Watches Me!"). It depicts a Jewish girl (Kristy McNichol) who took over a German prisoner (Bruce Davison) during World War II in Georgia. One of the things the film shows is that many of the German soldiers were not really Nazis, but were just ready. When I watched the movie, I had a real sense of what things had to be in the south; Can you imagine being a Jewish person accused of supporting the enemy? So I definitely recommend this movie. I believe it is always important to show the things described here. Occasional overacting keeps the film from being a full-scale masterpiece, but they usually do quite well. I hope the movie will finally be released on DVD. Also starring Esther Rolle and Michael Constantine ("My Big Fat Greek Wedding" Patriarch).
