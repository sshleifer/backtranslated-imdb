The VHS envelope says it all: "Undoubtedly the strongest film of its kind since the Texas Chain Saw Massacre". I am a huge fan of slashes in the 1970s and 1980s and I must say that I agree with 100%. Characters are believable, actors have excellent charms (especially George Kennedy as a forest guard). There is a twisted atmosphere that only TCM has, a stunning soundtrack to reflect the emotions and filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror. This must be one of the most beautiful horror movies ever! Jeff Lieberman, the director of this low-budget film from 1981, and his excellent work and work (Blue Sunshine, Wrong Turn) added that today he must be one of the most underrated directors in the film industry.
