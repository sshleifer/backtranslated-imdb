A jewel from Japan where so many of the best films in the world are produced today. It is nothing special about styling. It's just a simple drama (with some comic subtext) about recognizable people going about their lives. Yuko Tanaka, best known for expressing Lady Eboshi in Princess Mononoke, plays a 50-year-old spinster. She is proud of her health, spends every morning in energetic training as she feeds milk up and down the steep hills of Nagasaki. After she is done with this part-time job, she works her regular job as a clerk at a grocery store (called S-Mart, which made this dark army a fan of giggling). A 50-year-old man, whose wife is dying, lives along the milk route. It turns out that a dairy woman and a man, a child service worker, went to high school, and each of them has something crushed on the other hand. In fact, the film has some significant narrative problems. When the screenwriter really wants two unrequited lovers to unite, he uses a pretty incredible technique deus ex machina. The climactic sequence is also really forced. But most of the film is beautifully small and attentive to the two main characters as well as many side characters. The film also has several subplots that seem to end up weighing the movie down, but never end up. I think the best thing in the movie is Tanaka's heartbreaking performance as a lone milk woman who has given up on herself for the rest of her life. Whatever the problems, the film is usually beyond them.
