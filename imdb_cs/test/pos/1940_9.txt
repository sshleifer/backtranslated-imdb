I just looked at another commentary in which the writer discusses the disturbing ways teenagers use the body of their dead friend in this film. one overlooked in this statement is perhaps the most disturbing of them all, no surprise is what crispin glove is character (layne) does. He is enthusiastic about one of his friends who murdered another friend of his friend's killer. not because a layman does not like this individual, but is excited about his death because it gives him something to do. This poor boy is bored in life and is dead inside that a murdered friend is something to get excited about because he gives him something to focus on.
