A great time that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. Great production design, attractive stars, great lines ("Miss Bender, I don't care if you beat them on a native drum!", Says Amanda Farrow Joan Crawford Hope Lange, when Lange asks in disbelief how he is expected to read a large amount manuscripts in a very short time). If you saw this movie screened and scanned on TV and not in the letterbox version of pay-tv or AMC (American Movie Classics), you didn't see it. Hopefully, this guilty delight in the movie will soon be available on the DVD in the mailbox version and with the original 4-track stereo soundtrack. A great opening sequence of titles that really catches the mood of 1959 in New York, while Johnny Mathis sings the "Best of Everything" theme of an echo chamber song surrounded by a choir of violin and other background choir. Abortions! Madness! Office romance! Shocked cold-blooded bosses! Broken Love! It's all you can enjoy.
