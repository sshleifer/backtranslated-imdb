Forget Jimmy Stewart, who is living his life, and instead choose this intelligent error comedy. I suppose only institutionalized sexism explains why this film and another great Christmas story of Stanwyck, "Meet John Doe", is not worshiped by the same level of love as ... well, you know it's a name. Stanwyck plays food writer for McCall's rag-type rag that lay for years to her pompous publisher about the folk setting for her recipes. It's ace b.s. The artist until the day Morgan's sailor is pulled out of the ocean after 18 days of water & 6 weeks recovery at Navy Hospital. The film, which was released in the last year of World War II, is dusty with subtle patriotic gestures and holiday nostalgia, but never falls into sentiment. Stanwyck is sexy and sassy as always and meets her at hunky Morgan, with whom it is love at first sight. Unfortunately, she must play married Gardiner's prissy architect, who actually sought her hand for years on his CT farm, just to fool his boss. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakall adds a great boost to Hungarian malaprop and double humor in support because the real source of Babs and Una O'Connor's cooking talent is cheerful when Gardiner's unpleasant Irish housekeeper.
