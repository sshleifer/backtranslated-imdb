I was very lucky to have seen this film at the 2005 Melbourne International Film Festival just a few days ago. I must admit that I am very partial to films that focus on human relationships, and especially those that focus on the tragic side of life. I also like most of the Scandinavian movie offerings, often with deep quality as the story unfolds and characters are drawn. The character's character in this film is extraordinary in detail and depth. In spite of the fact that we encounter a number of characters who have very special personal situations and places in their community. The audience at the end of the screening was very quiet and thoughtful. I still play some of these scenes in my mind and I'm still overwhelmed by their power and meaningfulness.
