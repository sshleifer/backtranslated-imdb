Teenage movie about anxiety, friendship, loyalty and adolescence? but it is not a happy trip on his part due to the circumstances and life changing dilemmas of premise. What is happening is somewhat numb, scary and downright cold. But I was expecting a little stronger and more effective, and while I was involved in it and unforgettable, I didn't catch much emotion. The performances are a reasonably mixed bag, but it's all brutal honesty. Dennis Hopper and especially Daniel Roebuck are amazing? Crispin Glover eccentrically over it and Keanu Reeves is dead as wood again seems to pay off in his own slacker role. Joshua John Millar is pretty good as well as Ione Skye. Jim Metzler rings with a short but very engaging performance. The story is dramatically confronted, characterized and harsh in its eventual collapse, where it takes a bold and painful blow. The swirling musical score of JÃ¼rgen Knieper boiled with anxiety, tension and miracle, because morality and commitment are tested and taught.
