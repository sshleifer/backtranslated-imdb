That's something I've never seen before. It broke me all the time, I don't think there was one scene I wasn't allowed to laugh with. It is a girl from a country in the south who goes to a big city for college. At school, he makes friends with RA through the corridor. When he realizes that he has no family to go to Thanksgiving, he invites him to come home with her. Rabecca and her family and her serious friend all go for dinner for one night, and Becca realizes what her boyfriend wants to do ... Design. He urges Cral to do something so he stands up and shouts something like ... Sorry, but you're late, I've asked Becca to take me back to school a few weeks ago and say yes. It all turns into chaos. Please watch this classic that is worth it ... I swear.
