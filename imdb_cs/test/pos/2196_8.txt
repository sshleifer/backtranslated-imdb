Last year I fell in love with the version of Sweeney Todd Tim Burton, so I wanted to look at other versions of this musical and I found it in the library. Though I think Burton is the best, probably because I love the movie much better than theater, that's still a great storytelling. I haven't seen any of the other versions, but I'm trying to get my hands on them. After seeing Johnny Depp as Todd, it's hard for me to imagine someone else in the role, but George Hearn has a fantastic job. Angela Lansbury is great because always and all the songs are fantastic. I found myself singing. This is a game you won't want to miss, but try to see it before you see the movie version, so you won't have a biased opinion like me.
