Chucky's back, but this time it's not scary (a lot) - but it's funny! When Chucky is brought back to life (in a doll, of course) of his old friend with a trailer, Tiffany, he immediately kills her and turns her into a doll. Tiffany and Chucky are now in the case of 2 high school graduates - eekkk !! Don't miss this movie - it's a lot of fun. It's scary, funny, weird, crazy and stupid all in one! <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10.
