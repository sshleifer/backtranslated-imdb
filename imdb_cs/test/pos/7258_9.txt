I don't want to write too much about the film, but basically it's an action / comedy with a bit of romance thrown around two men who meet in unlikely cases and become men on the highway. The fantastic performance of Robert Carlysel and everyone else. Brilliant 'baddy' that really hates you. Some great comic lines - actually loudly laugh, amazing action and a great plot. The choice of music and atmosphere is fantastic, basically brilliantly controlled and brilliant. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good British movie or a good piece of action, I don't know why the movie never went, I thought he didn't have a place where it was the kind of recognition he deserves. If nothing else, watch this movie for one of the greatest finals of all time. Do not give away anything, but this really beats the heart!
