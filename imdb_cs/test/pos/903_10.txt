This is a well done action movie. There are plenty of battle scenes, acting is convincing (for this genre) and RS1 is amazing. I don't know why people feel compelled to waste RS1, I thought his effects were executed very nicely and his design looked great. The storyline was acceptable to the martial arts film. I said Richard Sun is one of the worst actors in Hong Kong I've ever watched. At least RS1 had the right idea to kill him. Now, for all of you who thought Sam Lee (Alien) was a bad actor ... he shouldn't have been taken seriously! I just had the pleasure of watching Gen-X Cops (prequel) and Sam Lee played the same character in the same way! Now please, all of you who are watching the highly acclaimed Oscar winners: DO NOT DECIDE THIS IS A THINKING MAN FILM! NOT SUPPORTED THAT IT CAN BE REQUIRED! That's just to be enjoyed, that's all. I hope they will do more soon.
