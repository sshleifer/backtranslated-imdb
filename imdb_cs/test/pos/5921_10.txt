That's a great story. Although there are some Jimmy Stewart cornball parts, for the most part it is a compelling story about an individual with a convincing drive, vision and sense of adventure - at least. The bottom line is that it's one of my favorite watches and I've done it about tens of times - that is, until someone stole our bag I brefly left in an airplane to fly to California! Some commented on too many flashbacks, but I don't know a better way to keep a long flight interesting. For those of us who actually fly, a flight of boredom can be interrupted by moments of terror. I wouldn't want to see the flight shorten at all. The frightening need for sleep and drone and the surrounding loneliness is part of the story. There are many parts that I especially like, including taking off from Long Island and landing at night in Paris (Wow, things have changed with us and the French since then!). Aircraft scenes and a record flight from San Diego are interesting, as is the incident over the Atlantic on ice (which I understand is not entirely true, but happened on a flight in San Diego). One gets the feeling that one of Lindberg's greatest assets is his enlightened supporters, as well as his perseverance. Some of the lines that circulate in my head now include: "Pull out the wedge!" on the starting scene and "I hope I don't have to use it like this" when describing a submarine "periscope" to a lady who lent him a mirror so he could better see his overhead tools. This movie is not for everyone, but it is definitely for me. I hope to do it soon on DVD so I can replace the stolen version!
