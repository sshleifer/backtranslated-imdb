Begotten is a black and white distorted image. Looks like it might have come from the nineteenth century. However, the sound is crystal clear, minus synchronization and the addition of calm natural sounds. This film was very critical of life struggles. This shows a single mother and child in a violent world that benefits the innocent. Mother does not pay much attention to her surroundings. This leads to a lot of torture, pain and death. You can watch it many times and see the different symbolism, fence device, and basically "what does it mean?". <br /> <br /> If you appreciate the art in movies then you will love it. Otherwise, don't bother.
