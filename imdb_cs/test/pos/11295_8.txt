One day I surfed the IMDb when I came across "The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird". When I noticed how dark it was, I decided to look for it. Thanks to Digiview, it didn't take me long, so I bought it for a dollar and when I got home I watched it, though I must say I was pretty impressed. Three of the paintings in the royal apartment, the shepherd, the chimney sweep and the self-portrait of the king (who is as selfish and sadistic as the king himself) come to life one night while the king sleeps. The shepherd and chimney sweep escape while the king's image calls the police to capture the couple. Fortunately for the couple, Mr. Wonderbird comes to help them, often mocking the police and the king. The back of the DVD case describes this film as "surrealistic visual pleasure and underestimated entry into the history of classical animation." I couldn't agree with it because I think many backgrounds look more bizarre and many characters are weird which include depressed underground city citizens and hungry lions who are appeased by blind man music (who looks like Andy Warhol), not to mention Mr. Wonderbird is somewhat eccentric. The film is very creative and especially fun to watch and its only mistake is that it can move slowly. But overall, this movie was very good and I really recommend it. <br /> <br /> Level: B + (Awesome)
