When one appears dead, the soldier becomes the chief suspect. Undoubtedly the best film featuring three Roberts and all are in good shape. Young is a cold-blooded cop smoking a murder investigation, Mitchum is a murder suspect friend and Ryan is a hot-headed soldier to hide. Grahame has a brief but effective role as a femme fatale. Future Tarzan Barker has a little soldier. This film touches on anti-Semitism, a subject that is also featured in Best Picture Oscar winner's "Gentlemen's Agreement", which was released the same year. It is tightly directed by Dmytryk, who creates an effective film noir atmosphere.
