I agree with the posters earlier that the characters were extremely strong and credible and all the actors were in their best form. I especially loved David Boreanaz, who was stretching out in the section, so unlike everything he did, he once again proved his amazing gift for comedy. The first part of the film was light and witty, some of the blackmail was a bit surreal but interesting - and there it was all downhill. It seemed to me frustrating that at least two of the 3 girls (Keira and Lisa) would get out of extortion and betrayal that are free, a nary footprint that remained on their psyche. I know the movie has changed the darker end of the game - and I'm not saying I missed the murderous part. But I certainly needed to see the two of them get to work somehow, and I stayed moaned with frustration with the end. (That's why I only gave it 9) <br /> <br /> But certainly an interesting movie.
