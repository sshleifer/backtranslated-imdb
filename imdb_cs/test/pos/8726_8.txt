Goldie Hawn, in 1969, was best known for playing in television comedy shows - especially ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH IN, where a nasty young blonde cookie was. Filming movies before the CACTUS FLOWER, Walt Disney's most remarkable feature, ONE AND ONLY GENUINE, ORIGINAL FAMILY HAND. But CACTUS FLOWER took her character from LAUGH-IN and (thanks to a good script by IAL Diamond - Billy Wilder's second partner - based on Abe Burrows) was able to develop a TV character to make the real performance faded. As a result, in 1969, Mrs. Hawn won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and her career took off in such future hits as PRIVATE BENJAMIN and FIRST CLUB. Although the other LAUGH-IN stars have worked well on television (Henry Gibson has a recurring role as a judge on BOSTON LEGAL), only Goldie managed to have a career as a movie star bonifide. LAUGH-IN Goldie's personality would show a naughty personality. Sometimes she realized it and laughed loudly to cover herself, but sometimes she didn't notice her mistake (example: Goldie is introduced to host Gary Moore in 1950, where she says it's "Goldie, it's Mr. Gary Moore." "Shakes hands and says (much to his confusion)," I've always wanted to meet John Gary Moore! ") But as Toni Simmons is quite different, she desperately loves Dr. Julian Winston (Walter Matthau), a successful dentist who she could never marry her, Julian told her that his wife (with whom he had two sons and a daughter) would never give him a divorce, so at the beginning of the film Toni tries to commit suicide with the gas of her stove, but she is saved by her neighbor, Igor Sullivan ( Rick Lenz), a struggling playwright who breaks into his flat and turns off the gas. <br /> <br /> Toni resigns, but sent Julian a suicide note, trying to deliver a message to ignore the note, but Julian's receptionist / zdravotn nurse / assistant, Stephanie Dickinson (Ingrid Bergman) Julian plan to stop work, so he handed the phone when he called Igor. Instead, Julian finds the letter and races to Toni's apartment, just to find her alive. When Igor supports her story, which she tried to kill, Julian realizes the depth of her love and decides to marry such a woman. Unfortunately, Toni swallowed Julian's lies and believed in her wife and children. See, Julian has no wife and children. Given that Toni firmly believes that he cannot marry a man who would lie to his Julian, a tree weakened on the branch. Julian comes to solve it by Stephanie pretending to be a lady. Winston. Stephanie is against it initially, but confronts Toni in her Toni record store on her own, on her first free Saturday. She speaks and Toni notices all the strong character and personality of Stephanie (and since Stephanie has her two nephews with her, Toni thinks they are Julian's children). Toni tells Julian he has to see who the man is supposed to marry. So begins the lie spiral Julian, Stephanie and Toni. Soon, Stephanie is given a lover in the form of Julian's friend and free patient Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston). Greenfield is so slim (Stephanie hates him) that Toni feels he's not a good Stephanie. And so it goes, with one complication (most caused by a well-intentioned, misinformed Toni) who follows the next until the end. The scenario is full of first-class situations and one-liners (example: Julian rewards Stephanie for lying about their marriage, buys two records from Toni's store. Toni brought him a mink, but she decides to send it to Stephanie with Julian's Stephanie card. that she can get a mink, but she does not say a word about the nature of the gift she has received - when she thanked Matthau powerfully, she says she likes Horowitz - that is, Vladomir Horowitz. Bergman had to enjoy filming because several scenes show that the Earth's glow was a trademark for her in later 1940s movies. But there was also a similarity to her 1958 film comedy, the INDISCREET hit. There Cary Grant lied to make sure that the couple would focus on the romance of their affair without having to think about marriage. When Grant's lies reveal to Bergman, he decides to lie down to persuade Grant to make him a cuckold. Instead of being a passive lover who believes Matthau is telling the truth, Bergman carefully tries to get Matthau out of his mess with small white lies just to find someone who leads to another to complicate everyone's lives. Bergman is perceived as a nice woman who becomes part of the problem even though she is trying to be part of the solution. <br /> <br /> All leading performances work well, especially Bergman, all the business thoroughness in the first place, but gradually her cultivation of sexuality. Matthau is amazing because a person who finds a useful lie is an obstacle that simply cannot be thrown aside. Supporting cast, especially Weston as mooching and sexually slimy Harvey, and Vito Scotti as Ambassador U.N., who actually has the heat for Bergman. It was a clever comedy and a really good way for the film career of Goldie Hawn.
