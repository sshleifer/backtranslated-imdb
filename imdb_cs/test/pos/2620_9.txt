This Charmed episode changed everything! The show is approaching the end of the third season, and all hell will be released in this episode. Charmed ones bring Innocent named Dr. Griffiths to the manor to protect him from Shax, a source killer. When Shax attacks, she throws herself like a tornado and then turns into the skin of a demon. Prue tossed the wall out of the way, killing her. Then the explosions of Piper threw what was left of the wall. Phoebe comes from the attic and says before Shax lost his doctor. But because he is the power of one, he just hurts him. Leo comes to heal the other sisters and Prue wants to find Shax and destroy him for real. Meanwhile Phoebe is in the underworld and trying to find Cole. When Prue and Piper come out on the street to find a demon, the demon finds them. After their battle, the witches realize that the camera has caught everything! When he returns to Manor he tries to fight the media and after defeating Shax, the witch away kookoo shoots Piper. Prue uses her telekinesis to move people out of the way to get to the hospital. But they get their late and Piper dies. And just as Prue is about to shoot, time will be dragged to where Dr. Griffiths to Manor. She throws Shax and the explosions of Prue and Piper. But Phoebe is still in the underworld, so Shax kills the doctors and blasts out of the Manor. When Leo finally comes, he can't heal Prue. Prue is dead, and so is the Power of Three. For now. Personally. this episode was sad. Prue was the strength of all of them. I'd like to have her power of telekinesis. I really don't think Phoebe should go to the underworld, because if not, Shax wouldn't kill Prue. But Paige joins The Power of Three again and I'm happy with the progress of the show
