It doesn't have to be Oscar, but it was a very funny movie. I've always been a fan of Eddie (Edmondson) and Richie (Mayall). "Bottom" & "Young Ones" was a legendary TV series and it was time to film. Some of the things they get are brilliant, from pencil to back, to rubber trousers, as well as the infamous line Richie says when he falls and the candle he wears goes into the eye. He tells Eddie: "Candle in the Eye, Candle in the Eye" and Eddie was the Simpleton who is, holding the candle he wears in his eye. He can't forget when Eddie is on a motorcycle and he needs to urinate ... It was a great comedy, not to be taken seriously at all, but the film lacked a ridiculous ending. Overall, an exellent comedy, full of laughter, and lots of fake green vomit. A 9/10. <br /> <br />
