Suzumiya Haruhi no yûutsu (Melancholy Haruhi Suzumiya) might at first glance think this is another animated comedy / drama. Well, it's not! This environment is just a school environment. It's a comedy all right, but very smart with many sarcasms. And the characters have a psychological sublimity that is almost in the same class that is found in the works of Ingmar Bergman. Episodes are sent out of service, ie Pilot is actually episode 11. This makes it possible to present small tracks to the upcoming episodes. The show is an adaptation of the popular novel by Nagaru Tanigawa about Haruhi Suzumiya. And what about the story? Like all episodes, the story revolves around Haruhi Suzumiya, who tries to free her own boredom by embarking on an adventure. Haruhi her I have no interest in ordinary people, and actively seeks strangers, time passengers and espers (people with supernatural powers). To find this kind of people, she created a club called SOS-Brigade (To save the world by filling him with fun: Haruhi Suzumiyas Brigade). With the exception of Haruhi, the other members of the SOS Kyon Brigade are. He's a real protagonist of the show. It's his view that we're following this story. When Haruhi came up with the idea of ​​creating an SOS brigade, he just sits in front of the classroom. He is quite skeptical of most club activities and brands together only to ensure that Haruhi does not go to much to extremes, and he is only in the class that Haruhi likes to talk. Another member is Yuki Nagato, who is an "indispensable silent member" and is also the only remaining member of the Literature Club, whose SOS-Brigade room was in search of a free club room. Never mind that the SOS-Brigade uses its clubhouse if it can sit in the corner and read its books. He also participates in the activities of the brigades. Mikuru Asahina was "voluntarily arrested" by Haruhi because the club needed a mascot similar to Lolita to make something suspicious. She often acts as a maid of clubs. The last member is always the smiling Itsuki Koizumi, who becomes a "mysterious transfer student" (which means that he passed two months into a semester that Haruhi deems mysterious). Haruhi thinks that all members, but Kyon are some randomly selected people in school, but they really are interested in her.
