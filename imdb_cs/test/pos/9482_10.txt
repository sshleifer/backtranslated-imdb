From the opening drum hit "My Gonna Groove" to the last guitar hit "Whole Lotta Love", this set of two DVDs could be one of the best music DVDs ever on the shelves because the Beatles Anthology was finally released. early this year. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this DVD is that on disc 1 you will find a full concert and many TV shows. For example, the entire Royal Albert Hall concert is on DVD, as well as some of the best performances of the last concert of the band in Knebworth. <br /> <br /> At the Royal Albert Hall concert, for example, the band had plenty of room for improvisation. Jimmy Page's guitar solos make "Dazed And Confused" a huge rock ballad unlike the reputed blues song it was on Led Zeppelin I. <br /> <br /> Another, on DVD 2, is a promotional video for Led Zeppelin III hit song "Immigrant Song". One of Zeppelin's hardest rocking songs, the video is about as superficial as the Pre-MTV video, but shows a lot of Jimmy Page's guitar strength because it was taken from a live performance. After the video is over, we are processed, in transition, with a short picture of fans filling out places at Madison Square Garden. Following are the performances that were supposed to be part of "The Song Remains The Same" but didn't cut. Excellent riffs like those in "Black Dog" and "The Ocean" were both present. After the performances, Madison treats Earl's court with us. Most of Led Zeppelin IV was played here, as was the most popular song Zeppelin ever recorded, "Stairway to Heaven". It's as brilliant as ever, even more than the IV version. Finally, to finish 5+ hours of live material, is the last Led Zeppelin concert in Knebworth in August 1979. As a viewer, he must admit that Robert Plan's voice is getting deeper and deeper from all the screams, which he has done in the past, and is evident here. On songs like "Kashmir" and "In the Evening", the race does not have its vocal rise of the old, but on "Whole Lotta Love", it returns to one more song. All in all, one of the best music DVDs ever released, just next to the "Beatles Anthology" big box, released earlier in 2003. Sound in both 5.1 DTS and 5.1 Dolby Digital as well as The Beatles DVD gives you the feeling of being onstage with artists standing beside them, as you would feel on the Beatles DVD when they cancel in the studio. Although the Beatles and Led Zeppelin are different bands, each of them received different DVDs. Although this kit comes only on two discs compared to the five Beatles Set discs, it still feels very crowded for the viewer after they have gone through all this content. It's also a pleasure to watch over and over again, not only because of the sound quality, but because of the sheer energy on the stage when Robert Plant starts singing. Great effort from the Atlantic.
