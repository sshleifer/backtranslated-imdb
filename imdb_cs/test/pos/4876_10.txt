I also attended the International RI Horror Festival and can easily understand why this movie won the best show. SEA OF DUST is a wild blow to horror, comedy and beautiful scenery. Back in time the story of weird going on. An ever-expanding disease with an enormously irritating side effect of the head of a man exploding brings a young apprentice professor; Stefan, investigate. Along his travels, he decided to briefly go round and ask again for his long marriage love, just to be sent back to his extremely stubborn father? On the way out of the city, he hit a sick girl on the road and brought her to Dr. Maitland (brilliantly up and coming up with Vincent Price as actor: Edward X Young.) Who fills Stefan on Evils and foot. Only the doctor is offended that he called for a professor and only got a boy in training? But still, Stefan has been much more than an ordinary spectator. Horror Icon; Tom Savini portrayed the ultimate religious affliction of the monger; Prester John. The Screaming Queen; Ingrid Pitt comes out of retirement to perform as stellar as Anna. Many beautiful and talented supporting actors kept the story together and helped to move it to the top effectively. Dark Religion and Above, but fun and sometimes very original, gore scenes play in this Hammer Movement movie. This stylish movie goes between flashbacks, surrealist worlds, dreams and character reality. Horror and Gore aside; This is also a very funny movie! Slapstick, humor of language and face and dark comedy raise the head between the dark line of the story. Like others they said; it is really like three great movies in one. Very fun and original.
