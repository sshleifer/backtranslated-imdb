The movie is a very good movie.one of the best of Yash Paradise movies. The direction is incredible. The scenario is brilliant. The story is great. It's called Rahul, who is accused of Kiran by his college friend. psycho do things like talk to your mother on the phone (anyway she died 15 years back) etc.Kiran deals with Sunil.Rahul does everything he can to get it. The place where they are going to their honeymoon. Every movie is unreal. Shahrukh is great, Juhi is pretty good, Sunny is average, Anupham is fine and so is Tanvi, Dalip did it well. Dialogs are brilliant (Shahrukh and many if not overclocking and comedy). "Jaadu Teri Nazar" and "Tu Mere Samne" are completely melodic songs.
