"Side Show" is one of the strangest horror movies ever made by Full Moon Pictures. In some places it is very cruel, but not as shocking as the Trailer does (The Trailer for the movies shows all the bloody parts). Also, acting and visual effects are well done. I would recommend this movie to horror fans around the world. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 Fans of horror movies like this one should look at the puppet master, Skinned Alive, party massacre, sleep. Away Camp, and more Full Moon flicks pictures. For more recommendations, please click on any of the other comments I have sent by clicking on my name above this comment section.
