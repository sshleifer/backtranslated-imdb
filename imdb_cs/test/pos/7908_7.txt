Hard life becomes harder when three children of one mom are scheduled to be sent to separate foster homes after they have passed it prematurely. To stay together, the older boy plans a bold, high risk escape to find a distant lost uncle - their only remaining relative. Their trek will take three terrible escapes to hunt across the desert in a classic bug, with no money, hungry, desperate, terrorized offenders and young to drive, hunted by ever-threatening civil authorities. What the film lacks in acting and conspiracy is in a sincere person who must be part of a full and complete family. even if this family is paved with spare parts for broken lives. Sure, the end is forced and too excessive for a critical film visitor, but every heart beats the same cry for family cohesion and belonging. <br /> <br /> With all my weaknesses, I still give this movie a strong recommendation.
