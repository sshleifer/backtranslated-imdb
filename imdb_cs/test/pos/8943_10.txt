I think this movie deserves 10 out of 10 because it's funny funny from start to finish. The storyline is simple and straightforward, but it keeps track of you and there is so much laughter that you really love it. When I went to see this movie, I didn't hear much about it and I didn't know what to expect. I thought it would be an old ladies movie like Calendar Girls or something, but it totally surprised me. Even though I am still a teenager and the film seems to have not been directed to my age group, I still thought it was excellent and I think people of all ages would like it. I think it is a pity that it is not famous at all and deserves more publicity so that more people can see and realize what a great movie it is.
