As a few people I know, I was late for Stingers; not until 2000. Three years later there is no way I would miss an episode. The show is really so good and it has retained its integrity for a better word, as opposed to "Blue Heelers". That crime is a thing; but personal lives are only brought out when they influence the investigation! When Gary Sweet was brought in, some fans seemed to be afraid, but he really was fine, which didn't surprise me. Gary could measure up to some British or American actor in a similar series. The cast sometimes changes, but every change brings something new and fresh. With probably the best Australian crew behind the scenes, 'Stingers' will remain a top dramatic series.
