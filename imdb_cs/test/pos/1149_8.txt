In Morocco, he completely invaded Europeans and Americans, in the early twentieth century, Moroccan leader Mulay Achmed Mohammed el-Raisuli magnificent (Sean Connery) kidnaps the American Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen), her son and her daughter. His intention is to get some money and rifles as a ransom for them, to fight the corrupt Sultan Moroco (Marc Zuber). At the time of the election, President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) agrees with the proposal. But Raisuli is betrayed, and Eden helps him get out of prison with American soldiers. I don't like movies about explicit colonialism and lack of respect for the sovereignty of other countries, but "Lion and the Wind" is a really great adventure. The action scenes are very realistic. Candice Bergen, the most beautiful American actress in the 1970s, is amazing and performs a kidnapped woman as in the remarkable "Soldier Blue" movie. As usual, Sean Connery is a sincere and nationalist religious leader. Brian Keith is great as the US president. I do not know much about the history of Morocco to analyze whether there is any truth in this story, but this film is a useful pastime. It is only available on VHS in Brazil. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `About Vento e o Le√£o '(` Lev and the Wind') <br /> <br />
