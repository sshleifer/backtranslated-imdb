"Murder over New York" is a fun record in the Charlie Chan series, but if you watch out, a lot of hole plot reveals an attentive eye. While traveling to New York for the annual police gathering, Chan (Sidney Toler) meets former Scottish investigator Yard Hugh Drake (Frederick Worlock) on the same flight. He is now busy with military intelligence, and Drake follows Paul Narva and his Hindu servant, suspected of sabotage around the world. Drake believes that by turning to Narvo's elusive wife, he can determine the whereabouts of the chief criminal. When Drake ends up dead in George Kirby's library, president of the Metropolitan Aircraft Corporation, Charlie theorizes that he was killed recently discovered a poisonous gas called "tetrogene", served through a glass pellet that releases the poison when broken. When he summoned Kirby to meet all his guests at the party, Chan and Vance Police Inspector (Donald MacBride) question the participants because one of them might be a killer. Among them are Herbert Fenton (Melville Cooper), a colleague of Oxford student Drake's, actress June Preston (Joan Valerie), who knows Drake, but asked him to attend, Ralph Percy (Kane Richmond), chief designer at Kirby's and Keith Jeffrey ( John Sutton), stockbroker Kirby. Kirby Butler Boggs (Leyland Hodgson) is also suspected, especially after Number # 2 Son Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) catches him smoking an open cablegram, the content of which concerns Boggs himself. There are some other cleverly set characters. Mrs. Narvo appears as Patricia West (Marjorie Weaver), and unlike Drake's suspicion that she could lead him to Narvo, she is in fact on the run from her former husband and catastrophic marriage. He is involved with David Elliott (Robert Lowery), director of a chemical research firm, and is suspected of being a tetrogen angle. As with many Chan films, racial commentaries must be accepted in accordance with governance. . He offers two glaring. When Kirby's black servant is brought to interrogation, he says he knows nothing about Drake's murder, that he is completely "in the dark". Chan's answer: "The condition seems contagious." Later, following Inspector Vance's order to round off all the Hindu in New York, Jimmy Chan comments on their arrival: "Everyone's starting to look like me." In fact, the scene provides one of the comic relief elements in the movie, as Shemp Howard publishes Hindu mystic "The Great Rashid", but is actually uncovered by the police being con artist Shorty McCoy. Before the movie ends, two more victims fall on the clever Narvo - his companion Ramullah, and the aircraft tycoon Kirby himself. To unveil the killer, Chan, in agreement with Elliott, provides a test flight aboard the newly developed TR4 bomber after discovering a poisoned capsule that mechanics had dropped on the plane the previous day. Before he can release a deadly poison, Brit Fenton catches the falling capsule in the air and reveals that he knew about this plant. Arrested and brought to questioning, Chan says Fenton is not Narvo. The actual Narvo appears when he offers a poisoned cup of water to nerve Fenton, who is trying to keep Narvo's secret. But Chan was smart enough to try and try to reveal the real killer - Narva now in the guise of Jeffrey's broker who underwent a reconstruction operation after a car accident. <br /> <br /> Now on the plot of the hole. At the first investigation into the murder of Hugh Drakee, the police claimed that fingerprints found in the library did not match the prints of any dinner guests. However, Jeffrey / Narvo was present at the party. It was already found that Drake had one non-state party in the library, Elliott, a chemist. If fingerprints did not really belong to Narvo, then it was a problem that was useless. Also at the end of the movie, when Narvo offers Fenton poisoned water, how did he think he would get away with him all as a witness? But how better it would be for a world saboteur like Narvo to have time and to establish himself as a stockbroker in New York, it doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> There are a few more points to make for trivia fans. In the movie, number 2 Son Jimmy is a college student studying chemistry when it comes to "Pop's" help to solve the case. In the previous movie Chan - "Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum" - Jimmy was a student of law. The formula for poisonous gas would be revised in a later film by Chan, this time with Monogram with Roland Winters as Chan in "Docks New Orleans". In this story, poison gas is released from broken radio tubes in a similar fashion asking for his' victim.
