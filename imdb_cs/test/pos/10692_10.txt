Wow. I've never seen or heard of this movie. It just came on TV (2:00 am) and I'm in utter amazement. Settings: A bunch of rich fat cats is out of golf. One knocked the ball into the rough. This lands NINJA !!!! A tuxedoed man goes up to pick up the ball up. Ninja grabs her. He crushes it in his hand. A man pulls out a gun. Ninja pulls a blowgun. Ninja blows a dart into the barrel. GUN EXPLODES !!!! That's just the beginning of size, people. Everyone must see this film. 10 large ol fat stars from trusted.
