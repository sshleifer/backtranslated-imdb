If you like your sports movies to be about dignity and best value, then it will work great for you. Excessive Places? Of course it is - and proud of it. It is the biggest and best carnival ride and should be enjoyed. Great production values, simple narration, with creative shots: it's not complicated, it's a very nice and remarkably sweet movie. It's really a feeling of love from Bill Paxton; and I bet his son gets it. The building is slow enough to please it, the conflicts are disgusting, and the British are against it. Americans have managed with the degree of Vaudevilla's wrongdoing, but the dignity between the two main transatlantic protagonists is always in the forefront. I have a tiny grip: the score wants to be James Horner, but it's too crowded, and there are too many close-ups and shots for 2005, but if you want a straightforward, decent and good looking sports movie, I feel like I know my movie, but I actually liked it more than Seabiscuit: which is a better movie, but the biggest story is simply Disney in its core and hugely enjoyable! Thanks, Bill.
