I like a movie that mixes edge-to-seat tension, laughter, style, good acting, and a little self-parody. Hitchcock consistently carried this, and in "Le Cercle rouge" Jean-Pierre Melville does the same. I'm sorry when this long movie ended. I agree with the English commentator who found the chauvinist notes of one of my compatriots. I like French films, Italian films, English films, Indian films and still more rare American good films. I also feel that a writer who made a film for not being a good copy of an American gangster movie has completely missed it. But I think it's like jazz: either you get it or not, so why waste your time trying to explain. Just see "Le Cercle noir" and be ready to be deliciously entertained.
