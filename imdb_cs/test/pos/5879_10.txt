When I saw "The Best Years of Our Lives", I was blown away. The director, actor, screenwriter and director William Wyler (winner of the best director in 1946) is brilliant. The film is about three World War II veterans returning home together on the plane and live. in the same town. They are all reconciled with their families. The first man Al Stephenson (played by Fredric March in his Oscar role) must adapt to his wife Millie (played by Myrna Loy) and the children Peggy and Rob (played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall) are different than before he he went to war. The second man Fred Derry (played by Dana Andrews in the role of Excellence) must find a good job and adapt. a wife who was married only 20 days before going to war. He starts to find out he's not the same. The Third Man Has a much tougher adaptation. Homer Parish (played by Harold Russell in his excellent Oscar role) He has lost his hands in the war and has to deal with the reactions of his family and his wives Wilma (played by Cathy O'Donnell) to the hooks he has instead of his hands. All these men and their families are united in the film in different forms. The stories of these men are beautifully interwoven together. This film really defines the meaning of "classic". This unforgettable drama (winner of best shot in 1946) is a movie that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> If I was asked to choose a favorite movie, I would choose this one. <br /> <br /> From 10 I would give "Best Years of Our Lives" 11. 11. <br /> <br /> So the next time you rent a movie to rent this, you won't regret it.
