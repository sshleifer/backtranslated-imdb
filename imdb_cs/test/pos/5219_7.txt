I don't like boxing, I don't get the attraction. I liked this movie. Positive depiction of Latinos, without drugs, sex or street violence. Actually, the plot showed a stable, loving family. Combat sequences are violent as well as boxing, but not like above as Rocky movies. Nothing wrong with attempting familiar topics with a different angle and ethnicity. It's a good rent.
