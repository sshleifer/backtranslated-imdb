I managed to shoot DION BROTHERS, off the TV (with commercials), in the early 1980s. I have loaned it to many friends, all of whom agree that it is one of the best B bandit movies ever made. One day, when I went to my NYC apartment, I saw Stacy Keach shooting a scene for his Mickey Spilane TV series. We had a moment to talk, and I told him how much I enjoyed THE DION BROS and considered it purely classic. He thanked me and said it was one of the best and most memorable film experiences of his career. He was very friendly and honest, and I was grateful for the few moments he and his fan had talked to. This is one classic that has to be on DVD.
