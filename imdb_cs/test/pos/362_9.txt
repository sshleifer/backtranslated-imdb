The first murder scene is one of the best murders in film history (almost as good as the psycho shower scene) and Robert Walker's acting performance is fantastic. Psychopath dealing with tennis star in murder. this movie is very good but there is one problem: why dosen't guy haines go to the cop first.4 / 5 <br /> <br />
