Just thinking about the movie, I laughed. Anne Ramsey plays an unforgettable part like 'Momma', probably the most ugly but cheerful matriarch ever recorded on film. Danny Devito and Billy Crystal make a fabulous duo that gives the film real warmth. While it's not too complicated, a cute story keeps your attention, and keeps you laughing all the way through. It's a fun comedy that will lighten things up and even entertain children. I give him my full recommendation.
