This film has just been shown on Channel Seven - Australian TV - today. In my opinion, it was very interesting how the Nazis considered the Russian Jews mercilessly as elsewhere. Kellie Martin did a great job and her tears and frustrations like "Frusia" were pretty convincing. The Holocaust is part of our history that we must not forget. Schindlers List was not the first - and it was not the last - description of survival and courage in that five-year nightmare. My family is a Dutch woman and I will always applaud all filmmakers who want to keep the candle alive by telling someone's courage to stand up and help those who have been abused, violated and murdered for being a "Jew".
