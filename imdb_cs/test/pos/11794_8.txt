People watch movies for various reasons. This movie didn't have a big budget, no special effects, no car chases and no explosions. In fact, neither of them has much. At least not in my life. This is a very real movie about very real people, none of them perfect in any way, but together they get into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and do it again order. out of chaos. I'm not ready to limit the possibility of parapsychology because I'm neither an expert nor using the full range of my own brain. So watch this movie for characters. It is full-full of the entire cast of wonderful quirky people. During the first three minutes, Kiefer Sutherland is making a great life for detective Michael Hayden and is constantly developing in the film. Excellent performance, very credible. Henry Czerny couldn't be better cast and the relationship between his 'Harvey' and Kiefer 'Mickey' increases the opacity of their characters. , 'Mrs. Ramsay', I'm sure she and my mother-in-law are good friends !!! <br /> <br /> There are more guests from these wonderful characters, but the space is limited, so watch and enjoy the movie.
