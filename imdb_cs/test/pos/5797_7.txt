An ordinary teenager Vera (Natalya Negoda) lives in Russia with her drunken father and her mother, who is carefree, busy and waiting for a call for a telephone operator's technical course. Her brother Victor (Aleksandr Negreba) lives in Moscow with her own family and occasionally visits her dysfunctional family and Vera, always motivating to quarrel. When Vera meets a university student Sergei (Andrei Sokolov), they fall in love and decide to marry. Sergei moves to the house of Vera, but lives in conflict with his father. This relationship leads the family to tragedy. I just saw "Malenkaya Vera" and I really liked this deep family drama. I am not familiar with the lifestyle of the former URSS, but there are some unusual behaviors that I found very interesting. First, when Victor tells Believe that she is not conceived because her parents wanted her, but because they wanted to move to a larger apartment. Next when the family goes to the beach in the car. Many of Vera's family and friends, repression in the park, and other situations depicted in the film are commonplace in the Third World. This low budget movie is very well directed and the story is very deep and real. The cast has great performances and the actress Natalya Negoda is very beautiful. In the cover of the Brazilian VHS, released by the Sagres distributor, there is information that Natalya Negoda was the center of Playboy. I'm not sure how accurate the subtitles are in Portuguese, because many long sentences spoken in Russian are limited to a short translation in several words. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Pequena Vera" ("Little Vera")
