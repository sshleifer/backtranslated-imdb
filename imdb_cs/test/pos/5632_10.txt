That may be the best movie from 1999. No. Chris Smith's documentary captures the spirit of artistic urge. Smith does a smart thing every documentary director should do: he is invisible and refuses to judge his topic. As the viewer watches Mark and his efforts, no matter how aggressive they may, they can prove they're finishing his films. It rejects the compromise and consequently suffers repeatedly. To remember this, don't forget the Speilberg, Scorses and others who have started the same humbleness. And what a great subject to choose. Mark, his family and friends, are fascinating characters, far more than any character created in last year's fictional film products. This film oscillates to a decade between comedy, tragedy, moving compassion, and ultimately leads us to inspire every viewer with the urge to create, despite the talent problems, to get out of the ass and do something. The film is about Maverick artists and their passions. It's also about families, no matter how co-dependent and non-functional, and how unique and beautiful the organism is. Mark proves in the film that he is totally devoted not only to his dream but also to his family - and to him. Why this film wasn't nominated for a documentary of the year is behind me and criminal (that's supposed to have been eligible last year). This film is to be searched and valued.
