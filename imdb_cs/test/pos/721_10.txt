This is a cult classic for sure !! It's difficult to watch occasionally, but then again, so is the movie like Jacobs Ladder or even say Fight Club. If you want a standard fare, then I will go go rent a Care Bears movie or perhaps an old classic Disney. But if you want to "see the world differently", then I would say that you open up to Enigma and it depends on the film that questions what we see and think. <br /> <br /> The key to me is that the film was original and let me ask all the time. So even though I saw some complaints, all in all I would say to film for what it is and enjoy.
