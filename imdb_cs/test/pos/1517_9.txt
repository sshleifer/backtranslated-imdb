With only two characters, this movie will bring you closer to these two people, investigators and prisoners, before most of the movies take you to any character, whatever it is. The complete confusion, horror and pain that Madeleine Stowe's character will undergo is deeply disturbing, as is the sadistic but charming investigator Alan Rickman. This film is too possible and builds on the shocking climax, the impact of the film as a whole. at the end you sit in silence. He'll haunt you for a long time.
