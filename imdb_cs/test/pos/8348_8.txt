I loved this movie almost as much as the original version! What a teenager doesn't want to go through what Scamp is going through wants to find independence by moving away from your family more and more? .Lady and Tramp look almost exactly as they did in the original feature. They did a good job of voicing the two, also in view of the fact that the original voice actors are probably dead. More lines to Lady, Annette, Colette and Daniel.Oh well, at least they had common sense to keep the same scenery from the original movie.
