Detective Mickey Hayden, who works in a night shift at a dirty police station, stumbles into a life of alcoholic haze, can hardly say he has a firm grasp of the reality to begin with, but when a head wound unleashes a terrifying psychic vision, things get really weird. Soon he is on the trail of a serial killer and deciphering the secrets of his beautiful first victim, the elusive Alice. The role of outrageous burnout seems to be tailored for Keifer Sutherland and most of it. The storyline is a typical serial killer, but it has plenty of quirks, twists and real surprises that raise it above the usual genre fare and even a painfully low budget. (One wonders what the movie could be if there were money for a few more transcripts and a few more.) <br /> <br /> Total "After Alice" is a nice distraction for everyone, but for fans of "Alice" "From Lewis Carroll, it's a real treat. From a topsy-turvy of reality, in which things are rarely what they seem, to more obvious references - a killer called "The Jabberwocky" who leaves playing cards on the victims' bodies - there's a "Alice" link on each turn. Below is a list of those I have uncovered. Since you find them half of the fun, I labeled them as spoilers. SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Mickey - In a sense, Alice, who wanders strange lands herself, meets strange characters, but Harvey recognizing his true nature, he identifies him as an unfortunate, wandering White Knight. John Hatter (Mickey's Boss) - Is He Really 'Mad'? You are a judge of Claudette - an African American transvestite. Obviously, the Black Queen Margaret Ellison - Mickey calls her the Red Queen, but her brutal nature suggests, more precisely, the Queen of Hearts. Gideon Wood - The suspect is Jabberwock's murderer, his ambiguous role is more suggestive of snark (or boojum maybe). Harvey - His role as an unofficial wonders' guide and his name, evoking another famous movie rabbit, I think he must be a White Rabbit <br /> <br /> Dr. Vera Swann - Her surname and relationship with Mickey suggest White Queen. Mickey's adventure begins when he chases a man in white and falls down (rabbit) hole. Mickey Drunk Tells His Cat to Cheshire Cat <br /> <br /> The killer is revealed "through the glass". Climate Showdown ends in the whirl of playing cards as well as Alice's adventure in the book. <br /> <br /> The sculptures in the garden look like giant chess pieces.
