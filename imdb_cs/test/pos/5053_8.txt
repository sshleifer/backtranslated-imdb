If you're tired, the first hour may be slow. The story of the story has a natural calm pace, unhurried - it gives us time to appreciate the kind of everyday life and situations in which the main characters are. Once you reach the story's climatic segment, the turn of events will keep you as it turns out, what happens to our precious Fanda (portrayed to absolute perfection by veteran Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský), how his wife (Stella Zázvorková plays) treats what happens with Fanda's friend Ed (played by Stanislav Zindulka - corresponding sidekick Brodský) and Jára son with a selfishly hidden agenda, blind to the kindness of his parents (sigh!) <br /> <br /> Vladimír Michálek sensitively directed the film with a humor, Jiří Hubač. With a clear subtitle, I have noticed every false phrase that Fanda explains is a hint of "caring" that shows / burys between the lines - and so is the judge's judicious. The fan's '76 goes 80 'and affection for their persistent (persistent) marriage manifests even in their arguing arguments. His playfulness can be contagious. This is "growing the old together 101" (at least) after fifty years and the lessons learned by sons and daughters so that parents do not take for granted. One may need to rethink whether the "home to the older" assumption is a means of achieving the goal, so to speak. The film shouts gently to us so that we can live life to the fullest while we can. (Hint: It's a pleasure to stay on and watch the end of credits.) <br /> <br /> We're lucky to have seen an occasional Czech movie. The dwarf ("Kolya") father and son of 2001 "Dark Blue World" revealed with pathos. It's good to make it slow and then and appreciate the foreign gem - its headlines, scenery, melodic score and engaging human storyline with elegant performances. "Spring in the Fall" (aka Indian Summer) is available on DVD. Enjoy!
