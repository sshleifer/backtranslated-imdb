Joseph Conrad's timeless novel The Heart of Darkness was portrayed in a 1994 movie. Set and costumes brought Conrad's novel to life on the screen as we followed Marlow's journey. Acting also brought characters to life through mannerisms, voices, and personalities. If you read the novel, I suggest you also see this movie. If you haven't read the novel, the movie may be harder to watch. Conrad's Heart of Darkness is too full of action, emotions, and information to be created in the movie just over an hour and a half. Therefore, if you have not read the novel, the plot in the movie may seem too crowded to follow. Overall, I gave this film seven out of ten. The basic storyline of the novel was screened with large files, costumes, and gaming. However, Joseph Conrad's original work cannot replace anything.
