This is a great series of the same Simpsons lines. Watching the family when they are going through life and problems etc. Slightly less realistic than the Simpsons, talking to a baby and a dog anyone? Family Guy goes where SImpsons or Futurama don't dare, reaching around for sick jokes and other rags. And believe me, it works! Almost all gags hit the mark and they will have you in a stitch (especially random, frequent flashes!) When my brother first showed me, I was not addicted, but after several episodes I was addicted. You'll have 2nd 10/10 for a truly brilliant show. He will please Seth Macfarlan for bringing this show to life. :)
