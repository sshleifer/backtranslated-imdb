Excellent cut, excellent performance, especially Epatha Merkerson, and a very enjoyable music soundtrack. This film dates back to the 1940s to comment on the differences in racial lifestyle and some desegregation effect, while weaving the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic lady. An actor portraying the character of young Terrence Howard, an amazing work reflecting the life and times of his upbringing in the small town of New York. The audience laughed, shouted and exploded in applause for the film and its director. Coming soon to HBO (February 7th, I believe) - Shoot TIVO and enjoy a great story!
