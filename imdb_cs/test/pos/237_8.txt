Another great musical from Hollywoods Golden Age! I liked this film story of three friends who are artists in a small nightclub that is far from Broadway and all its glitters. Although not a great time, they are very happy with their lives and a small club where they perform. Gene Kelly plays the owner of a small club and is also a friend of one of his dancers, Rita Hayworth, who happens to get some attention when she gets the chance to be on the cover of the magazine. Problems starting for Gene Kelly as his girlfriend is now talking about the city. Phil Silvers plays one of three friends and does a good job. Of course there is music and dance. One dance performance by Gene Kelly stands out. She walks the street at night and sees her reflection in the shop window. His reflection soon begins to dance with him on the streets, great cinematography. Don't miss this great fun.
