"The Cell" is a relatively difficult movie that can be classified. If you read the outline of the plot, "a psychotherapist travels inside a comatose serial killer in hopes of saving his last victim", maybe you think it's a sci-fi thriller. But it really won't make this movie of justice. In subconscious minds, there is a fantastic aspect that is stunning, with rich visual effects and incredible scenario scenarios. There is a drama like the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez before becoming an exclusively romantic comedy component), being in contact with the child inside and witnessing his frightening upbringing. And it is definitely a horror page because of the malignant acts of a serial killer personality. The film seeks to operate at many different levels and crosses the genre's boundaries as desired. Although I think it will end up as a reasonably bizarre experience, I find it absolutely fascinating. Right from the opening credits, with Lopez on horseback riding across the desert tremendously dressed in white clothes, he'll know you're on visual treatment. Each time an audience leaves reality and follows it into the subconscious depths of their "patients", they are guaranteed an hour of visual and auditory enjoyment. Costumes are beautiful creations of angles and colors. The camera leaves the patterns at the door and goes through the world where they are the same and up. Characters become rulers of their own domains and transform into beings worthy of such a character. If you don't like something like "The Cell," you'll surely be amazed at the work embedded in these scenes. Casting is also top-notch. Jennifer Lopez is here in her element, using her natural, sympathetic and almost maternal feelings, while combining her own distinctive look with fresh surroundings, makeup and costumes. She is incredibly sexy and I personally want someone to find another role for her outside the rom-com world she would be included in, which would allow her to experiment further. Vince Vaughn is quite convincing as an FBI agent who will do anything to save the life of a young woman. But it is undoubtedly Vincent D'Onofrio, who is most impressed here. It is an extremely difficult task because it is obliged to cause more emotion in the viewer. We are disgusted with his actions, yet sympathetic to him for the trauma he has experienced during his life. He looks amazingly powerful in his empire, yet he is uncertain and vulnerable in the real world. It's a great performance from an underrated actor. While "The Cell" doesn't work just as well at all levels, it will try to make ambitious attempts (some character actions aren't believable), and while it's all based on some rather poor scientific logic, it's sometimes shocking, visually a stunning trip that rewards multiple views.
