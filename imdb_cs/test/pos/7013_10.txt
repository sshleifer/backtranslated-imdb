As with most women, this film is the ultimate film. With its hot chemistry, sexy dance rountines and beaitiful songs, I mean timeless classic like (I am) The time of my life and the wonderful She is like the wind makes this movie. I adore Patrick Swayze in this movie and shows that he can sing and dance is so hot. She sings "She's Like the Wind" in the movie. The chemistry between Swayze and co-star Jennifer Gray is amazing. I love dancing and everything related to it. But to say this Dirty Dancing 2: - Havana Nights is also great, but Patrick Swayze's scene does it. I love songs, dance and everything about it, but it's not Dirty Dancing. As I said, he's an amazing baby. Please leave there third because I like to see what happens to Patrick's character Johnny. Jennifer's character could be more sexy, but hey, Patrick does it if you know what I mean !!! Great movie and I'm so glad Billy Zane didn't get a movie role. I heard whispering that he was meant for a role, but they found out he couldn't dance.
