Bizarre, vulnerable, raw, honest and honest watches. I'm not here to give you a summary or a summary of the movie. I just want to congratulate this little film with GREAT BIG HEART. I drop my hat to the filmmaker and it's an excellent cast. If you want to know what's going on in the movie ... go. Michael Parness, writer / director, has worked out a very sensitive and emotional subject, suicide, with great compassion, comedy and empathy. I see a great career for Mr. Parness. This movie works. Right from the indignant start of the race to the tender, honest moment between David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. As with any movie, we have to suspend some distrust, yet I found with MAX and GRACE that I was easily transported and absolutely convinced of his "surrealistic moments". I just wish some of those moments would move even more. Mr. Parness "pulled" some amazing performances from this talented cast. For example, the performance of Guillermo DÃ­az as a patient in asylum was both hysterical and moving. Colossus Ralf Moeller, former Mr. Olympiad, as a terrified patient ... perfect. I can go on and on ... This independent feature has the star power of a big Hollywood movie budget, but you'll forget about STARS on the screen as you go along with this wonderfully written story. The real star is a great script. I look forward to the next meeting from writer / director Michael Parness.
