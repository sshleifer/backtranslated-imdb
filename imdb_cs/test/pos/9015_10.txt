I had the privilege of taking part in this regional premiere, which is one of the most entertaining British films ever, the storyline is fantastic and focuses on a young girl who inadvertently turns into her ideal person at the computer show while making a copy of herself he falls in love with him, is full of jokes, both visual and auditory, and has a clear and fresh feel to him, and the performances are very good, released in the UK on July 2nd. must, go see it !!!
