Pola X is a beautiful adaptation of Herman's Melville 'Pierre; or, "Ambiguity". The comments to this surprise me, I wonder what led to a predominantly negative reaction. The value of shock is the least attractive thing about this film - a tiny detail that has been blown off. The story is about the fall of Pierre - and the subsequent destruction of the people around him - which manifests itself in his features, behavior, and idol. Dialogue and the soundtrack distinguish this film from the others I have seen, turning a traditional story with controversial twists into an unforgettable emotional epic. I can't stress enough the importance of ignoring everything you heard about this movie and watching how I did it with an open mind. I hope you'll be rewarded the same way I do. I felt on the edge and nervous about a half-hour mark, but the film is far from scary in any traditional sense. This will leave you with 1000 thoughts, each of them suddenly disturbing and exciting. I know I'm here, but I feel the need to replace the negative perception of this film. It's the best I've seen all year.
