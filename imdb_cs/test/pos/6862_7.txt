I found the movie pretty well what I expected. Although I am tired because I am afraid of needles, I have come to expect them to come. So if you're not into needles, blood, human body and some good medical entertainment, put this movie back and rent another one. As the other user pointed out, I was also pleased with the German film slasher attempt. I am an American who has just moved to Germany to stay with his family and see it lying on the shelf. I love psychological thrillers and say it's somewhere in those lines. The character falls into place and feels bad. While trying to dig the way out and find some truth in the situation, things get a little sticky and others aren't so sure they're on the right track. So in the whole movie you're on the edge of who's anatomy, you can see and round off the next corner.
