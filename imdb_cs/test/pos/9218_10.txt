That was the very first movie I've ever seen in the theater. I was 7 years old and is still one of my favorite movies to this day. It's pure smarm cheese. The caricature was sold to young girls selling soft body dolls and large plastic heads, one for each rainbow color, with their own special animals, "elves" and even the talking rainbow horse. The typical time is that each show was about how hope, coherence and magic can "do everything better". The film is about the coming of spring, when all the light and color return to the world, but this time it is not for our beautiful hero. The spoiled conspiracy princesses overtake the lightgiver soul (and the implied life of the donor) of the universe, which happens to be a giant diamond, for its own mysterious purposes, regardless of reality, and now Rainbow and her newfound friends Orin, Onyx and Chris must save the universe. As I said before, it's cheese, but it's cute, and it's just like all the other cartoons of that time, such as CareBear, Strawberry Pie, Rose Petal, and Smurfs. All films made to sell dolls to children. And it works. :)
