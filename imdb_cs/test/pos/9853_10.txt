In Sudan, Arabs rule and are constantly at war with Christians and animists who inhabit the southern part of this East Africa. This film follows a group of Dinky boys, a cattle shepherd who was killed in a brutal attack by Arab forces after the village and their families were destroyed. Most of these boys are now teenagers and have been dubbed "The Lost Boys". The director follows the band "Lost Boys" on their way because they were admitted as refugees in the US. where they will land in Houston. Those who have been admitted as refugees get celebrity status as they feel (from what they have heard) that America is amazing. A trip from Sudan to America is like a "trip to heaven", says one young man. A huge party is thrown to their departure and they are told that they should do well with Sudan, and once they are educated, return to Sudan to contribute to Dinka. They are also warned not to be like "those with bag trousers" who are responsible for the negative stereotype of blacks, and also, no matter what happens, not forgetting the Dinka culture. You watch the boys come from the Third World to America and try to integrate into American society because of this place with virtually none of this rich world where everything is massively overproduced and overexploited , they leave a place where there is practically nothing. They are taught about cleanliness and how to use all the tools we take for granted on a daily basis. Sometimes it is funny, humiliating at others. Listening to notes about black Americans and American society / culture is quite interesting. As the film progresses, you will see how American culture begins to corrupt its earlier humble ways of thinking. One of the boys, Peter, is not satisfied with the work and work to survive. is moving from Houston to Kansas City to continue his education. When other boys visit him, they talk about how they can't get to any school. The main reason they came to America was to get education, and the media said the boys were brought to education from Sudan. This happens because boys were given arbitrary ages, which makes them older than they are, preventing them from enrolling in high school. The film attaches pictures from Houston to Kansas. We watch Peter enroll in a school where he befriends a group of Christian conservative children, and how Santiago tries to run a school (even if he runs without his license anyway) and works at Walmart. We see Peter struggling to live in college trying to make his school basketball team, and because Santiago has difficulty in maintaining work, rent, appealing tension at home in Sudan, and, above all, loneliness. He comes to the point where the boys want to go back to Sudan and tell them that everything that is taught about America is a lie. "You have to do it yourself, do everything yourself," says one of the boys. A lost message for a liberal capitalist lifestyle that shows how it makes people become radical individualists (a trend that has led to both neoconservative and radical Islamist movements). Their biggest beef with America is that there is no time; Time is money and we are not losing a second! Despite all this, boys never lose their sense of Dinka culture. They celebrate the Day of Liberation of South Sudan, which marks the day when the SPLA began fighting in Sudan, a struggle that continues today. They also meet other "Lost Boys" on the anniversary of their arrival in America, where they discuss their experiences in America compared to back in Sudan. When he asked him, one boy says that if he could make a living, he would rather live in Sudan. He is too lonely in America, he adds. They never lose a sense of community that is conditioned to them as part of their culture! our societies have created within us. It will also change the way I look at refugees, I will never again take for granted how difficult it must be to work and what immigrants mean to a country like my own, Canada. This is a wonderful movie. I laughed, screaming ... a very emotional way and a very good document. 10 of 10.
