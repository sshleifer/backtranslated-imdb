I tuned in for this movie because there was nothing else to watch. I immediately sucked in the characters. Robin Tunney is nothing but spectacular in this movie. Her portrait of a mentally ill woman is moving and credible. Indeed, this kind of thing is not easy. Fantastically pulls him away. We know he will soon end up tragically on this film, but you can't take your eyes off him. The characters do stupid things, but unlike most Hollywood movies, where people do stupid things because the plot requires it, these people do stupid things because they aren't right in the head - and the things they do are perfectly in line with their characters. This is just a great example of IMHO's filmmaking. Great writing, great gaming, great overhead. A film for people who think film can be more than mindless fun.
