First, I would like to start by saying that it is a refreshing start to see a British drama that finally looks and feels trustworthy. Patrick Stewart performs the role of justice as (Ian Hood), a government science advisor, with his constant and steadfast view of authority and the idea of ​​the future of "real world" science and how he feels that it is either abused by others. Not only is the casting thoroughly maintained throughout the series, but its characters seem more believable than most other British dramas. Ashley Jensen also delivers world-class performance as a bodyguard by Dr. Jensen. Hood (Rachael Young) brings a refreshing look at unscientific, uninteresting everyday views of science and her constant struggle with Hood some very funny and memorable moments between them. The way the series keeps all the scientific elements more realistic I find positive and engaging than psychobabble we are so accustomed to in other Fiction or Science Fiction TV shows. There are, however, remarkable disappointments with the series, every time an episode ends, I find myself disappointed that it does not seem to cover all aspects of the plot and sometimes leave open stories unclosed. While we are aware that this is the first series, I hope that in the near future we will see a return to a form where these open-ended stories can finally get a significant conclusion that they deserve. <br /> <br /> For those who have more sophisticated science-related thematic lines, this is an ideal example to watch because it always stays credible and important.
