Tomorrow is the next day is NOT a continuation of Gone with the Wind, but a story of lovers on canvas and surprisingly alert and moving. For the supposed hack he came down to B-minus features like the Devil Thumb and Ride, Felix Feist turns out to be adept at fulfilling his work with unexpected, resourceful details. Steve Cochran leaves jail after 18 years for killing his brutal father when he was only 13 years old, and now he is still an experimental, gawky pubster operating inside a male wand. Loneome, he visits a 10-cent-and-dance palace and falls on the brassy, ​​grabbing Ruth Roman. However, the sudden shooting of her great-grandfather's police will cause the poorly paired couple to hit the road and end up just like Joads in California's migrant camp. Roman Revelation; in her best-known role as Farley Granger's fiancée in Hitchcock's Strangers on the train, she was sick and underused. Here, she modulates the taxi driver's bottle convincingly to sacrifice her wife and mother (and the brunette to start up). Cochran is almost as good, disappearing between suspicion of a wounded child and the explosive reactions of a subdued man. And the end, though not convincing, is still welcome. Along with The Live By Night and Gun Crazy, Tomorrow is Another Day showing the redeeming sweetness and warmth that runs counter to his film-noir pedigree.
