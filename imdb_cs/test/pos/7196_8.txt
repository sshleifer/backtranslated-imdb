I managed to find a copy of "Mission Cleopatra", which is not as easy as you would think for someone living in the United States. So far I have only watched the first 10 minutes of the movie and I can say with certainty that I laughed more in those 10 minutes than I watched the first * live Asterix movie. Watching the dubbed version and while the dubbing work is a little worrying, I found the movie to be very funny and true to this book. I see that the people who were here said that the dubbed version is very worse than the subtitle version, which can be very true, and after watching the subtitle version (even on my DVD), I may have to come here and change your Assessment. How it costs, but I consider it a very funny movie, and that's more than what's on the first movie.
