This is the only biggest movie I've ever seen. Davey / Mr. Slaussen is at the same time: <br /> <br /> 1) Tortured about his talents (eg "Can I control it; I can! I shouldn't do it!"); 2) Desperately wish, eg <br /> <br /> "How is soup? <br /> <br />" The soup is very good. "<br /> <br />" Would you like some biscuits with soup? "<br /> <br />" I want some more cookies, please. "<br /> <br />" How? " br /> <br /> "Yes, the soup is very good." <br /> <br /> 3) Proud of its achievements (eg "Pretty elegant trick, huh?") <br /> <br /> 4) Ladies Man (eg "Are You So Pretty. Why Don't You Like It?") And <br /> <br /> 5) Sometimes, very, very angry (eg "Can't you get away!") <Br / Connors was to receive the Best Actor Award for this film, I think who might have been better Tanya Roberts went to the stratosphere after her performance in TT, the stars of this masterpiece did not lead to a brilliant career, I highly recommend thi with movie! It's available on amazon.com, everyone should own it, make that night and watch the soup bowl while watching.
