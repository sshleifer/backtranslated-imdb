Best cinematography I've ever seen? Given the year the movie was made, I was absolutely overwhelmed and thoroughly impressed by the amount of attention paid to scenes and what seems authentic. Although I am not particularly a Western film enthusiast, every single scene is dedicated to the most detailed detail and is scary. Nature is a sincere connection. Sometimes I am impressed by the number of events going through the scenes, but I am never bored. I feel like I'm really looking at the time machine and looking back at the old west. I recommend this film to anyone who studies scenography, localization planning and it depends on photography in general. It can be a humiliating film that has experience with visual views of this digital touch era that we are now experiencing.
