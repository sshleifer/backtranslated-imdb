This is the best example of unlimited filmmaking. Richard Greene (who plays well) is looking for his two missing friends who will take him to the Black Forest area and the castle of the one-eyed Earl (Stephen McNally), a past enemy he has never seen face to face. The incredible film has so many amazing elements combined (once) into one film - the crocodile pit; mighty mute (played by Lon Chaney, Jr.); wily doctor (played by Boris Karloff); leopard hunting (very well done and very atmospheric); love story; roost; battle sword; sadistic, one-eyed, and his two criminals (played by John Hoyt and Michael Pate !!!); an interesting story that makes the film even more interesting; and more!. Jerry Sackheim's script does not allow you to be bound - a film that is extremely suitable for anyone in unlimited filmmaking with a hint of horror and atmosphere.
