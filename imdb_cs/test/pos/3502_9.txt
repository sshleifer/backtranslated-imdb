Ali G won his little fame on a small canvas - even though the big screen hadn't lost him in one way. Ali G Indahouse is a funny laugh - the second fun festival - just like on a small screen. He has lost none of his character or stupidity and beyond all - neither film is even mindless. The human side to Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of ​​Ali G running for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the constant stupidity of the man gangster Staines' is well mixed with the strict, cruel world that is politics. The film is also full of brilliant new characters - and instead of talking after the interview, we get a proper comedy movie that never repeats or gets boring. So why didn't I give him ten stars? Well, the end was funny, but also confused and failed - none of it made sense. And in part, the film has become insulting in trying to be funny - but it's Ali G for you - unless it's offensive, it's not in itself, and it's totally and utterly destroyed. Ali G's debut on the big screen was a success in my belief, and he would have gotten into a 6-7 average rating range on IMDb. But it could also get worse, and people are obliged to have mixed views, especially on such a film. Overall, Ali G Indahouse is a cheerful British comedy. the funniest and smartest. Good job! 9/10
