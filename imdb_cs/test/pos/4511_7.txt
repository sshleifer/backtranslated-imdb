Again salute from darkness. The film is based on the mega-best seller by Khaled Hosseini and represents the pinnacle of the ugly post-Russian invasion of Afghanistan and Taliban terror. Director Marc Foster adds a gem to his biography, which already includes "Monster's Ball", "Finding Neverland" and "Stranger Than Fiction". The Story of Young Amir and Hassan Friends and Unknown Generation Handcuffs. It's a story of honor and courage and loyalty, and it's an unusual story of age. Some great scenes of boys when they are kids and then some really amazing scenes when Amir returns as an adult to find Hassan's imprisoned son. This is a tight, compelling storytelling story. Acting is solid in its entirety, with no actor stealing the screen. Though it is not a pleasant story to look around, it is certainly meaningful and heartfelt. Plus a quick shot of Midnight Oil playing in the pool hall is a welcome gift.
