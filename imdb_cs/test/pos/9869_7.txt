Although I brought this movie by accident (I thought it was an original Halloween (stupid eh!))) I was surprised how good it was, many sequels continue the events of previous movies, but it was trying to explain why Michael Myers kills people and how they seem to have supernormal abilities. I thought it was a horror horror movie full of action, tension and surprise, I'm very glad I brought it. I gave it 9 out of 10.
