At this time, when almost everything was released on the DVD (I expect to see My Mother the Car today), this film was unfairly forgotten. There are countless stupid comedies from the 1960s, as well as many other era that have received at least a cursory DVD. This wasn't even on VHS on my knowledge, despite the talent involved in making (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (notable later for co-writing Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut). It is obviously a product of the sixties, but it's about everything else of that time. All films reflect the tastes and habits of the time they were made. This was released in the same year as a president analyst, another absurd masterpiece. The movie was finally released on DVD and developed a cult following. This film has many unforgettable bizarre, goofy, hideous moments. Sure, it's painted in broad strokes and has silly go-go music all over, but it's part of its charm. It creates its own absurd universe. If the one who is in charge of producing DVDs for the Columbia Pictures release (I believe Columbia has released it), is receiving new version polls, he gets my vote.
