If you like the TV series, The Murder Diagnosis, you'll love the 101 murders. It's great to see Dick Van Dyke in the murder mystery again. If we're lucky, it'll be the beginning of a TV series or at least a series of movies. This movie certainly had some great and remarkable actors fulfilling roles. But he didn't feel like a "face" movie. It was really a story that led you to forget the glory of those who are on the screen. I made a riddle in the end, and in the end I was so pleasantly surprised that I had to watch it again! This is to be seen for all the buff or Dick Van Dyke secrets!
