This film was recommended to me by the same person who blessed me with a copy of Narnia's Chronicles. Shadowlands is one of the most amazing scenarios he has ever written. It is well done, acted and managed. The camera is a bit dark for my taste, but I'm sure it was. The script is like poetry in parts of the movie, I found myself pausing over the film to think about the comments on the screen. It's a great piece of cinema and I can only hope that more people will run through it and add reviews. A fair warning, though it was a 6 tissue film for me. Very touching. Very cordial performance.
