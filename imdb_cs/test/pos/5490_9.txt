I watched the perfect storm and thought about Wolfgang Peterson's next film, which is much better - this one. Although definitely not based on the true story, in the line of fire is how the film should be made. He has an amazing story with a great cast. Malkovich won a well-deserved Oscar for his performance as a haunted killer with a hostile attitude towards a government he served too well. Eastwood is good because the tortured secret service and Russo are easy to see. If you haven't seen it, be sure to rent it or buy it like me. Certainly one of the best crime thrillers of the past decade. 9/10
