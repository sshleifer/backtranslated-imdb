For several years I have been involved with IMDB visitors. This is a movie that finally made me write a review. I caught this movie by accident (the initial credits were changed in the past when I turned the TV one morning). I enjoyed the film very well for many reasons, all of which were well covered by other reviewers - moodiness, forgotten history of Czech pilots, subtle magic of supporting characters, fatalism of the main characters and the first. personal look during battle scenes. But the element of the "deep blue world" that really excelled was the lack of dramatic effects, especially during the fight (and that's a good thing!). While the pilots flew in battle, no musical score was accompanied by them, no manipulative shots of the dreaded wives were interwoven, every small air maneuver did not provoke truly patriotic health, and viewers were not asked to swallow the incredible pilot James Bond. . Instead, viewers can feel the melancholy, fear and isolation of these single pilots while trying to fight. As friends are shot down, we are spared weeping howls and typical heroes of vengeance (but a pleasing audience). Instead, the other pilots are watching the fate of their co-owner sadly and quietly - in fact, at this point they still need to focus intensively on their own safety and goals. In short, we will experience the breathing of the pilot and the roar of the engines as we, the audience, witness the spiral silently to his death. And then immediately we have to "jump" back into combat mode and focus on survival. Too often, in Hollywood, we are fed a spoonful of the emotions we should feel, and no room is left to the viewer's imagination. The "dark blue world" preserves the sparseness that captivates and attracts the viewer, allowing us to invest in film and fill gaps and spaces with our own thoughts and feelings. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie worth seeing.
