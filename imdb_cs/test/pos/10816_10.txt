Bon Voyage is an entertainment for the audience because it combines the necessary stupidity of comedy with just as sobriety that viewers are actively involved and invest in outcome. Most importantly, the film is also historically enlightening; it captures the tension of the so-called "false war" and later the years of the French aristocracy from Paris before the German onslaught. Yet Bon Voyage is not a "war film". It is a comedy about the life of a handful of people based on extraordinary times. Bon Voyage expresses the chaos, confusion and emotional confusion of the nation on the verge of collapse and a wide range of French responses to the new political order. This film is a comedy that entertains the audience, a romance that skillfully uses many clich√©s and the story of a handful of people whose nation is collapsing around them.
