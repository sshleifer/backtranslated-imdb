Josie is a newspaper reporter with the task of going back to high school when she is 17 years old. . When she is there, she recalls that it happened to her for the first time when she was in high school, as we see in the flashback scenes. In flashback show that (little spoiler) Josie was kind of a high school nerd and was picked up for a lot and one day a great boy tells her to take her to the ball, just for a ball night when he leaves your house. tense ass and his bitch. What a terrible thing to do (some find it hard to watch it so ugly and it will make you feel warmer Josie). <br /> <br /> I didn't find this movie that funny, but there was something really funny stuff in office scenes much more fun than everything that happened at school. This film had a perfect happy ending as it brought tears to my mom and sister's eyes. Playing in this film was not excellent, it was good for most of the film, there is some poor playing in some parts of the film. I'll give this movie 7 out 10.
