Inspired by real events, Radio is one of the best games the heart felt dramas I've seen widely released in ever. It's definitely one of the best movies of 2003. <br /> <br /> Radio star Ed Harris, who is a good Oscar in this movie, as football coach Harold Jones. Coach Jones teaches football all his life and loves the game. However, Coach Jones doesn't spend much time with his wife and daughter, Debra Winger and Sarah Drew. The Daytime Radio, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., in his best performance from Honest Men, comes on the football pitch while the coaching team practices the game. Some team members then tied the radio and threw it into the building. They then bang on the building and finally coach Jones suspects something is wrong. It comes and helps Radio, which is terrified, and has shared a very special bond with Coach Jones and Radio. Radio becomes the highlight of every football game and really participates in football matches and school events. He also becomes coach Jones's main focus on life through football which first was his main priority before his family and Radio. The film deals with all kinds of real life problems, including what your priorities are life, accept people for who they are, even though they are different, death and family relationships. The film touches on all these questions and more and is well done and director Michael Tollin should be very proud of this film. Most of all, I liked Radio how real it was. The performances were like watching something in real life occur right in front of your eyes. Radio had a great mix of comedy and drama. Some parts were pretty funny, but other parts were very serious and sad. Finally, I think the radio was criticized by the critics only for having received an average rating. There must have heads there butts because of its amazing how this movie can only get 2 stars and something like a rock school can get 3 or 4 stars it doesn't make any sense to me. Also, the performance, as I mentioned, is an excellent and worthy Oscar. In my opinion, as Ed Harris, who I think is underestimated as an actor, also Cuba Gooding Jr. Radio is one of my favorite movies of the year and gives me a reason to still see some of the great Hollywood movies. My final rating for Radio is 9/10.
