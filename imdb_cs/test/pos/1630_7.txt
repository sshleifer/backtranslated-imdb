I was in Rome's premiere last night. I'm not an expert in the book, but there are many changes from book to movie. Stimulating this movie is much faster than Davinci. Many things have been modified, otherwise it would be a 4-hour movie. Many things have also been changed to give the movie a fast pace. I think what's important is the feeling of the film and that it works well for Hanks, Brown and the company. I'm not giving any spoilers except that the end of the movie is processed in a slightly different way. As Leonardo Vetra was found is also different. Those who see the film might be interested in reading the book to get all the details of the story. Some small details are also cut out of the film. Although they were making a film in Rome, they had to re-create internal shots. Since I went for a walk in Rome the day before the film, I can say that the interiors are authentic with their look and feel. Kohler is not in the film, and CERN has not been much shown. Hanks has a good job and there are some interesting scenes involving the Vatican archives. Of course they don't have access to this area and I'm not sure if anyone actually knows what the Vatican archives look like. Eyelet Zurer has a break in this movie as Victoria Vetra and does a good job as an eye candy for Hanks. Ron Howard mentioned several times in interviews and as we saw him and cast before the movie, that's just a movie.
