I watched Grand Champion twice. I liked the story of the film, the characters and the actors were not bad. It's refreshing to see a G rating movie. That's a good movie. The story is mostly from the perspective of children. Interactions between children and adults make the story interesting. I recommend this movie if you're looking for a family movie. If you liked the little painters, you'll probably enjoy it. I watched this movie on the cable. Either in the Encore or Showtime family. This is not a movie I would see in a theater. But I'm just going to the theater because of the big screen effects, so most comedies, romantic movies or dramas I don't have on a big screen-waiting for a TV / cable release. Put your kids together, pop popcorn and enjoy it!
