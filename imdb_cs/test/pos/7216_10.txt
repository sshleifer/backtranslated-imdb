This movie is amazing. It's funny, sexy, violent and sick, but it all holds together for the brilliant rendition of Romeo and Juliet. If you don't mind if you're a little scared (okay, but it's funny grossed out), check out this movie. It's worth it! I've seen it three times and it's still amazing. I recommend it. Go! Understand it!
