I realized that many people commented on the nature of this show, which is racist and homophobic, but I don't think it should be this show. The show is about parents who weren't ready for kids and are not ready for teenagers. This exhibition helps bring humor to a very hard topic that is sometimes overlooked: parenting. Yes, we all had exhibitions that had families in it, for example: Family Affairs, Step by Step, Family Bindings, Full House .... but it would always have the same old recipe for his episodes . "Steph" cuts off school and catches her father. They have a heart to heart conversation and the music is played and it's with more than two weeks of grounding that after "aww, dad ..." gets a smile and the show is over. Where is such a comedy in such a situation? Where is Realism? With the war at home, you get real situations from a real father. Most parents who watch this show hear some of the lines that parents have released and either laugh (because they know they said it!) Or nod their heads (because they know they thought it and never had the courage) Say it!) The war at home has situations that bring a great comedy like a father who thinks his son is gay. It doesn't sound witty, mostly she thinks she makes a homophobic father, but comedy comes in a numbing father trying to talk to his son to open up. What does a parent know what to say, especially in a situation like this? I highly recommend this show to anyone who knows it has a sense of humor, especially for anyone who is a young parent or was young when they had children. You refer to a show like this when you are either.
