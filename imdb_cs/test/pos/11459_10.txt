I have to say. It is easily one of my favorite movies to watch for Halloween. Halloween party, scary actor, guy dressed and also Miami Vice. Skvělá skvělá !!! <br /> ********************* SPOILERS ************** ****** ******* <br /> <br /> I have a huge place in my heart for random 80 horror flicks and this one reached out and pulled my heart. I always went through this movie on a blockbuster and always laughed on the cover of the box. Now every weekend I'd catch a random movie that I haven't seen yet ... it was Angelas one weekend. She seemed to mock me for months. So I took it home and spent most of the film under the blanket. For me, it was frightening and rude. And not just acting! Some of the things that came with this movie were AMAZING. I can honestly say that the best part for me was to watch Suzanne (played by a fellow iowan) to hold a lipstick trumpet over my nipple. It was random and I loved it. Watching the haunted Angel FLOAT through the corridors and hearing her haunted demon voice was enough to wake up ALL NIGHT LONG! It's not one of the smartest or best-played horror movies. But its 80s cheese and its all the elements you need. Goth Kid Creepy, Virgo, Slut, Naked Girls, Haunted House, Bad Negotiations, Oh And I Mean Naked Girls? There were all the elements and they were designed to be one of my favorite movies. Kudos to filmmakers.
