This Blake Edwards movie is not very sure whether he wants to be a comedy, drama or musical. Regardless, the overwhelming presence of Julie Andrews, there is reason to see this comedy-drama-musical-spy spoof. Julie is beautiful and uses many of her talents throughout the film. Rock Hudson looks tired, but more than fine, as Julie's romantic interest is. Authentic cars and airplanes of the First World War, add to appeal. Overall, the movie is very entertaining. The DVD release is edited (Blake Edwards) version of the original release. Probably the only version that Edwards would allow; But, Turner's classic films have shown a complete (theatrical release) version, recently. Recommended.
