Take someone you love or want to love and go see this movie. <br /> <br /> Touching all the right places. <br /> <br /> All other reviewers have said it. Br /> <br /> Maybe cynical won't be overwhelmed. They seem to like only things that leave you depressed for days. This movie is a Ga-run-teed to stay with you for a lifetime. <br /> <br /> I'm so pleased that the director is not trained by USC. <br /> <br /> I hereby confirm my assumption that there is too much mediocrity and consistency in the film these days. It is because of USC lockstep mentality and inbreeding. Hooray for Jeff Hare and Richard Marcus, cast and crew. Great!
