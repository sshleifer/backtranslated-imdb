I watched it on Sky TV late at night as I was a Vampire fan. I have to admit I was half expecting it to be a B-movie disaster, but I was pleasantly bad. The subspecies is about the vampire family. When the Vampire Lord dies, his two sons, handsome and exalted Stefan, and his brother, evil, repugnant to the Council, begin a war with each other over his birth right, Bloodstone. Bloody stone is the holy grail of the vampire species and bleeds the blood of the saints who give the vampire who drinks it the highest peak. The fight for Bloodstone takes an unexpected turn when 3 college students on a school trip appear in Brothers territory and Stefan has to protect them from their Lusts brothers. As I said, I went to this movie and didn't expect anything at all, but it was one of the best low budget movies I've ever seen. Sets and locations (Romania, I think I've been around for a while since I saw it) are very nice and the music score has made movie justice. Most of the games were adequate, but his Anders Hove as the evil line that steals the film (and all subsequent Sequels). Hove's performance as twisted Vamp is really breathtaking and hits the movie just out of order, on nice d @ mn good!
