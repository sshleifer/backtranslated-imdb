Glenn Ford is hired by the bank's crooked owner and wily by the stable owner Edger Buchanan to create a fake robbery while the banker hides real prey. With Ford's no-show, the two instead go with the trigger happy second choice, leaving Ford on the hook for the killing he didn't commit. Columbia Pictures's first color feature, Desperadoes looks fantastic with sets and costumes made to take full advantage of Technicolor's accentuating tons of well-staged Western theater. This has the irresistible connection of young Glenn Ford (third, but mainly stellar). Prime Minister Randolph Scott leads the incredible support of casting great actor characters in color roles, including the stealing-theft of Edger Buchanan as a good-natured but slightly yokel villain who is not as stupid as he looks and who has quite a few unforgettable lines. Br /> <br /> A rather complex scenario combines incredible action sequences, melodrama and comedy directed by Charles Vidor. It is one of the biggest westerns of the nineteen years and highly recommended.
