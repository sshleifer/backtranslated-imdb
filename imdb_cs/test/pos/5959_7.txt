I've seen a movie, it's actually pretty good. The trailers gave me the impression that this was another film, Dujardin-one-man-show-reversed film (Ã  la _Brice de Nice_) or an expensive, silly French comedy. It is not surprising. The secret agent of OSS 117 is stupid, but at least he knows I always found out that James Bond was stupid, but he acted like a smart ass. Dialogue is witty with lots of language humor that one would expect from British rather than French. Women and music are beautiful. A refreshing trip to the past, when the militants were former Nazis or Soviet brothers, the cars were shiny and France had colonies!
