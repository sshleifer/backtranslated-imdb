This movie was great and I waited a long time for it. When it finally came out, I was really happy and looked forward to 10 out of 10. It was great and lived to my potential. The performances were great for both adults and most children. The only bad performance was Milo himself. There was one problem that I met with this (and others like) movie. All the characters I wanted to live were killed. Overall, I have this movie excellent 9 out of 10. Maybe we should choose better people to kill next time, though, ok?
