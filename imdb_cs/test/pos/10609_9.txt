I had no expectations (I never saw previews on "Marigold") and enjoyed characters, contemporary music and a sharp dance in this merry movie. Although 98% of the dialogue is English (a great thing for me), I wish the DVD had subtitles to help you with some of the quick moments when it is difficult to understand the character's accent. I would not rate this film against Bollywood movies, but only on its own merits as a fun pastime (a movie of musicians). I'm addicted to Ali Larter as an actress (and her conversations in Bonus Material indicate he's a nice person). I've been watching this movie several times since then (always better).
