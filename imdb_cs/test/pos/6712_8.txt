The guy who invented the idea for Lifeforce, I have one thing: Thank you, sir! Lifeforce combines big-budget sci-fi pomp Star Trek: The Motion Picture with the inexpensive horror thrills of Phantasm and the tops of everything with t-ts-- and some real meat hangers on it .. And best of all, it's a good movie! It amazes me that someone actually justified the mainstream movie that is a hot chick vehicle that appears naked on the screen for an hour and a half to manufacturers. God bless you, all of you who have been involved. Steve Railsback (Helter Skelter) plays Cola Carlson, US commander of the International Space Mission sent to investigate Halley's comet. Carlson's crew finds an alien ship inside the comet, and inside they find three naked people in suspended animation - two boys and a hot wide (Mathilda May). Well, to make a long story short, it's "space vampires" ... naked "space vampires". They dropped the crew except Col. Blueballs, who decided to release a hot chick from his lucit showcase, because a part of his brain that controls his matrix fluids told him it was the right thing to do. Col. Wings It Back Into Our Big Blue Sphere In Run Under. Meanwhile, another Space Shuttle crew discovered his ship floating dead in space and brought three Living Dead Martians back to London. And that's when people turn to pork skins and s - t generally get out of hand too damn fast. Carlson team up with the intolerable Cole Caine (Peter Firth) British SAS to watch our naked cutie - who the hell time sucking guys from left and right. Carlson found that he had a mental bond with Vampire that allowed them to watch her, with the ultimate goal of blowing her ass away and destroying her large space with an umbrella that sucks the energy of the people the vampires attack. . Will they manage it in time? MINOR SPOILER: Yes. Wow. What can I say but "Wow"? This damn movie really works. I can't believe there were real British actors like Aubrey Morris (Clockwork Orange) and Patrick Stewart (Sexiest Man Alive or some sort of title) in this movie. All actors are good. The direction is good and it really shines during the last half, when we see the fantastic devastation of London. Scales are not special effects either. For 1985, this film had to be with - t as fx goes. All the effects are quite impressive, and there is a wide range of talents available in animotronics, make-up, light shows and very nice spatial scenes with good old-fashioned modeling and matte painting. There are even some gore and bloody squib shots for all the fanboys horrors out there. Lifeforce is a great movie for anyone who has nostalgia when popular movies on bigsceen were made with 100% love from start to finish. The filmmakers really made sure that all the basics were covered, and the end result is an extremely fun thing that won't let you turn away because the controls are just too pretty. Real hard fun here: 8 1/2 of 10.
