This was one of the most emotional movies I saw. Passion, joy, pain, despair, sadness, healing, cleansing and love. The whole movie was overwhelming. Everything was so good; book adaptations, actors, files, camera shots. This film deeply touched me in so many ways. It reminded me of the despair that loses his love and the time it took to heal the wound. You can love again, but you always risk the pain that comes with separation. Isn't this one of the most important ages of concern? <br /> <br /> "Is it better to have love and lose? than never "Did you love before?" <br /> <br /> -Ascension
