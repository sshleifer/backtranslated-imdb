First of all, I believe that this film is much more appreciated by viewers who have read Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness", which was the literary basis of the film. With that, I said that this film is overwhelming. It is a great war film that does not focus too much on the gore and brutality of the Vietnam conflict, but on the psychological tax they have taken on young, inexperienced "children" who have been sent to battle. Coppola showed a real genius in film art-making, using many visual aids to tell a story. The meeting I felt was definitely all around. Marlon Brando is part of the film, which actually brought me to acting. His clarification to Willard at the end of the film will guide you and reveal the emptiness of the person you have heard about and want to see the whole movie. Those who consider it another war film must examine in detail all the literary elements that are intertwined with this film, because there is a lot of meaning behind it. In my opinion, this is one of the most carved and best made films of all time.
