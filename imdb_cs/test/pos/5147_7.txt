This surrealistic, absurdistic film is the first film I saw in the cult Swedish director Roy Andersson. He is a veteran filmmaker who has made his live commercials, directing only four feature films over the past forty years. This background shows: the film looks like a collection of fifty two-minute art ads. There is no story linking these medallions, although some characters appear in more than one medallion (but there is a theme under them: the absurdity of modern life). Some of the movie manners (with actors appearing in light white makeup) are more irritating than lighting. Some of these parodies make very little (one is not sure in which front they stand?). But other parodies are better. The best one is about a rock chick dreaming of going on a honeymoon with her bride rock guitarist in the house who is turning to something similar to a train (you have to watch it to get it). A film that is worth seeing, though it seems that a comparison of some film critics with such great filmmakers as Keaton, Dad and Kaurismaki is exaggerated: Andersson is lacking a vision and the lack of a story linking the vignettes is a deadly consequence of the prejudices of this film masterpiece .
