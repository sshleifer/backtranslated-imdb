I enjoyed this film very much. He effectively combines humor, fantasy and a few moments of horror with the solid film effort of Higuchinsky. Brilliant visuals and a very original spiral story. My only complaints are that he had his dull moments and wasn't as brave as he could be. Yet I give this solid 8 out of 10. Americans should take note of this and other fine Japanese horror / fantasy movies that have come recently and have them available on Region 1 DVD. In fact, Asian cinema in general, have some of the best movies that have been unnoticed by the American public because they are hard to find. I strongly encourage people to look at these treasures, it's hard to find them, but once you find them, you'll be glad you did.
