It is a movie that really thinks about your life, our culture, family structures and situational events. I'm not going to give a plot in this post, I think others have beaten me. I hope that despite reading the views on this site, you will have a chance and see this movie for yourself. I went to see this film with my husband and friend, and I must say that after the movie the theater was utterly quiet. After a few minutes I looked at me and everyone in the theater stared at the screen, lost in thought. This allows you to dive deep into your psychological abyss to think about several things: How much does society influence my life and the lives of my generation? <br /> <br /> How long does anyone pay for the mistakes they made? <br /> <br /> If a second chance is given, is it ever realized? Is it better to live in a box or not to live at all? My questions aren't meant to show my consent or disagreement with Leland's actions. I don't want my opinion to dictate in any way what you take from this movie, so I won't. You see it yourself. I'm still lost in thought and trying to answer many questions from the movie. I really liked it and I hope you do. This film does not seek to answer questions, justify any acts or promote punishment. This film tries to make us all evaluate our lives and take off the pink glasses that most of us see the world through. <br /> <br /> Great movie. 9 out of 10 stars
