I'm just looking at this move recently on the Encore channel. What a great movie, great cast. Flatliners are very exciting and unpredictable. The film has a great opening scene by the ocean and then a series of scenes that raise questions about life after death that provide a very powerful start to the engagement story. Therefore Nelson played Kiefer Sutherland was the first to go through the test to die and return to life. Then it's very dramatic by returning his bad act from the past to life. Then all the above-mentioned characters experienced the same experience except for Randy's steckle playing Olliver's pay. Then the story unfolds in a resolution and a basic understanding of the life and presence and meaning of God. David Labraccio, played by Kevin Bacon Atheist, finally challenges his own belief in God. It's amazing to watch Julia Roberts along with Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt, William Baldwin and Kiefer Sutherland at their best time in their careers. We can ask how we don't have such a great movie anymore. This is one of Joel Schumacher's best productions. I really enjoy this movie.
