After watching Tipping the Velvet by Sarah Waters, I decided to watch Fingersmith, the characters were as good in both shows, even though Rachael Stirling in the Fingersmith adaptation is missing. <br /> <br /> The overall story was a good choice, the twists and revelations of the characters were amazing! Excellent Watches Missing Rachael Stirling! <br /> <br /> If you're enjoying the romance of two girls, it's not one of the best movies you should watch. Tipping The Velvet insists on a different spin but just as good. <br /> <br /> He would recommend it to everyone!
