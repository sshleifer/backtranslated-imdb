I didn't know what to expect. I only watched it on a rainy Sunday afternoon on a pay TV. Right from the start it pulled me in. Music and settings and characters were excellent. I haven't heard of any of the actors, but everyone was great. Great thriller. <br /> <br /> Now that I have read more comments on this movie with reference to past versions and a book, I'll try to find out more about this great movie
