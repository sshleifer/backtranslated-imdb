Thanks to the relatively high quality of TV broadcasting, was it possible for people to be able to produce, directly, financially and / or play a star in their own films that would otherwise not be able to? Is that a good thing? This movie doesn't answer the second question either, but without Garban, Jeff Garlin wouldn't be able to do anything to eat. Like most new producers / directors, Jeff Garlin's independent piece is a stronger and more sensitive sigh than a Curb. And yet is it a sensitive movie? He's not really a sensitive person. Likable, sure. Really. What this movie really is about is a little hard to say, I can only deal with what I got from it. I rented the movie for trailers, especially in the scene of an adviser portrayed by Amy Sedaris, who told James Aaron (Garlin) that he was particularly interested in a woman because he was a "chubby pursuer." "I just got out of my seat. Based on this scene, I ran to the computer to write a note to rent this movie. Reason - I thought the school counselor (Sedaris) was talking about Beth, pictured by Sarah Silverman. that there is a light romantic comedy between Silverman and Fat Garlin, I didn't think that this story was anything original, but that the dialogue was elegant and the scenes would move at a satisfactory pace. It was interesting that the movie started like this, but then a much more realistic turn when Beth gives James heave him because "I've never been with a fat guy before." So we live alive and it was absolutely realistic It only meant that Beth was leaving the building with her, the only sensitive person in the movie. <br /> <br /> James's relationship with his mother was also interesting. I was wondering if the whole concept started out like a game. (The whole movie "Marty" in the movie was totally lost to me as I never saw the movie.) <br /> <br /> It was a serious doubt I had about James Aaron's character. Is it really possible that he had no serious relationship at age 39? And he's an actor? That really wasn't with me. For me, his personality was less actor and more corporate. I couldn't really buy his ordinary. No doubt he was extremely disappointed that things didn't work with Beth. We felt it. But then did he really care? Another thing - how in the world, how does he and his mother allow them to go at the same time? Didn't he just lose his job? The last thing he had? That was one of the reasons why I didn't seem to be ordinary. Where does his life come from? And I read the reviews that talk about a realistic depiction of loneliness, so that's the case. Yes, it is very realistic, the way we have to be content with what we have because it is all we have. The way we disappear from ourselves and from each other in interactions (James and Stella), some kind of self-expression that happens just to move on to the next moment. This, unlike the possibility of defining ourselves through our moments, our thoughts as James had with Beth, it is really crushing. <br /> <br /> Very well done.
