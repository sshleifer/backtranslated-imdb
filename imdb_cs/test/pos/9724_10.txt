Series as a whole - Jim Henson's best work. John Hurt * is a story. Often Oscar-caliber scenarios are no wonder when you think Minghella is doing writing. Oscar-caliber, always. Sapsorrow - Everyone loves 'soldier and death', but something about 'Sapsorrow' pushes iota higher in my favor. In the first social scene, costumes, music - perfection. Hurt and the dog typically semi-interacting with the story, but this time Minghella pushes that another notch in the 'ring' scene between Hurt and Sapsorrow. Chemistry among the characters is especially well developed, more than usually in the series, in reference to the friendship between Straggletag and the Prince. I have seen it? You see it again. Pay more attention (to those of you who hate this 22-minute cinematic perfection). I have never seen that? I'm so, I'm sorry. Child's Happiness - Not as sophisticated as Sapsorrow, but very smart. This is a story of irony. Irony of irony, irony ... I love it. Every character acts to perfection, except for the ferryman. He did drama; everyone else was making a romantic comedy. I'll forgive him. This is my favorite from primarily comedy episodes, 'Sapsorrow' and 'Soldier and Death' are examples of more dramatic episodes. <br /> <br /> Side note: Greek myths. What he lacks in the subtlety of Minghella (a different writer) is partly compensated for in bold because it shows four chosen myths with more sympathy and respect and history than usual. Also check out Jim Henson's hour if you can get your hands on it. For Storyteller adicts, it features the Man Himself featuring myths, a lion from 'The True Bride,' and ... No Annoying Opening Theme! Half Storyteller, half pure, pure muppet joke.
