STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film for our cinema history. This second performance by Mickey Mouse (followed by the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier this year) is probably his most famous film - mostly because it was so groundbreaking. It's because it was the first sound cartoon. While you still can't hear Mickey talking, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the movie - something we take for granted today, but which was a huge crowd in 1928. Now that it was just a major historical one film, it is worth seeing - especially for lovers of animation. After seeing the short time after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the movie really is. While Mickey and Minnie behave a little strangely compared to the characters we grew up to love (mainly because of the rough mind and talent of the animator Ub Iwerks), the film is contagious. It's just cute to see Mickey play "Turkey in the straw" in a very imaginative (if at times cruel) way. Clever and Real Crowd-Pleasure - This film is still one of Mickey's best films after 80 beautiful years.
