Why did Ramón (Carlos Fuentes) bring his five college friends to the scary abandoned school building that served the wealth of black sheep? This answer can only lie in the diary held by his dying father. In fact, a re-discovered episode involving another group of six is ​​in contact with them, five of whom are likely to encounter graphic fates in the hands of a sadistic guardian (Paul Naschy) 20 years ago. But when they are looking for a way to escape from this place, they are awaited by the horrific moment when the group is running for their lives, often in a panic when the killer starts to hunt them and destroy them in various bloody groups. ways. Will Ramon and any of his friends survive this night of horror or will he ever be a ghost who repeats the same night as you before them? Stylish Spanish slasher has this professional shine and strong, shocking violence. Some funny exchanges between characters ... in their dialogue are links to pop-culture American horror movies that can bother some viewers. Demented Naschy is really furious with the baby when they attack them with joy. Experience a bloodthirsty maniac who is forcibly carrying out his acts of violence. I found loud musical impulses a little annoying and filmmakers often use flashbacks from previous movie events as reminders to viewers. I don't think these tricks are absolutely necessary, but I felt that the director wished he could communicate with the viewer in depth, so he used cues and flashbacks. The smaller deviation from this film is still moving, and the camera follows the tempo of the characters and how they react to the chaotic situation that has been presented to them. Your enjoyment of this film may eventually come to accept paranormal supernatural aspects of the plot. The moments and the murderer, who seemingly left the grave in his work, immediately awoke. The twist seems a little uncomfortable and violent, but it might (or maybe not) work with the story going on why Ramon's father is shown among those spirits who have been making these events two dozen years. I will say that this film wouldn't hold on if it was scrutinized, but as a flicker of whipping it is the breath of fresh air.
