Wow! A stunning, lost piece of Australia and a lost film from the glam-rock of the 1970s rolled into one. This film deserves to be viewed just to see what can be done with no budget but a lot of enthusiasm. Like telling the story of Oz, the film borders on being too obvious, but rescued by its idiosyncrasies. The chances of a glimpse of how glam rock manifests in Australia will please fans of this genre. This film was doubled with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indicator of the film type that Oz is. Although not as frivolous or well designed as RHPS, it's hard to talk to Oz. Amazingly Oz has matured well - perhaps a byproduct of what it is definitely in real Australia in 1976. \ t The course of history shows that many of the ideas that have been explored would eventually enter the mainstream. The film's willingness to give meaning to homosexual characters is notable, especially as it dates back to the 'Revolution' period for Australian gay rights pushing. Performances range from flinchingly amateur to gently nuance brilliance. The direction is lacking in subtlety and many of the dialogs can benefit from another proposal or two. Somehow, these flaws add to the appeal of a movie that is mercifully unpretentious. Like Australia in the 1970s, this film has some naive magic. There are several links with the original Australian productions of Rocky Horror Show, which will keep their obsessions on their feet. Oz is certainly a smaller classic and a potential cult favorite to review. Laughing with the appalling fashion of the 1970s, swinging along with the AusRock soundtrack, leave any expectations on the door, and Oz is likely to be pleased.
