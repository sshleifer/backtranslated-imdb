After a summer of opponents and disappointment, Sister Betty is inhaled with fresh air. The movie is like no other I've ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can direct more than disturbing images of men and women and how he gets close to sex (his previous two films were brilliant in the men's and almost brilliant friends and neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives her best career as a Betty waitress who, witnessing the brutal death of her husband's asshole (LaBute mainstay Aaron Eckhart), is losing her fantasy world. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock play hitmans who killed her husband and are now in her court. The trick to the movie is that Freeman and Zellweger are really parallel characters. While Zellweger falls in love with the picture of handsome and polite Dr Dave Ravell on the series, Freeman idealizes Betty. Sister Betty is a brilliant film full of life, humor, love and graphic violence. My class: 10/10.
