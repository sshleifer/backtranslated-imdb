I swear I have ever tried cocaine that I could perfectly connect with this film. His pace, as well as dialogue, spews at speeds that some viewers may need to stop and relax. There are big little elements that pop out of the movie as if it were Rob Lowe's character seems to always be losing shoes, or how some characters keep spirals around his winding path. The story was connected very well and the direction seems to be flawless. <br /> <br /> The film boasts clumsiness and delicacy. I think most of them could look forward. A few moments of laughter-loud-loud-even-if-you-yourself-yourself ensure that I'm sure to watch it again.
