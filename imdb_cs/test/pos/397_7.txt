One of the more obscure Anthony Mann's Westerns, the last frontier was also his only Western cavalry (aside from one short episode in Winchester '73), though naturally he focuses on outsiders and internal conflicts rather than offering Fordian Friendship celebration and shared ideals. It is a much more cynical view of the life of the border, in many ways its Fort Apache, without the need to preserve the legend: this base consists of mistakes, failures, failures, failures. cowards and odd competent officers ignored by his superiors, misguided, while civil war takes precedence and all the best the army has to offer. Victor Mature and James Whitmore are free hunters who find civilization creeping on them when they are released from their fur and packhorses by a local tribe damaged by cavalry intrusion in their territory. Rather than blaming the Indians for their losses, they decide that it is the army's fault to build a fort and decide to demand compensation from them, and eventually join their ranks. But despite Guy Madison's best efforts for a friendly and competent commander to bring Mature to the 19th century and make him wear a uniform, the humiliated Colonel Robert Preston, who longs to get revenge on the tribe who brought him out of his own power base? and the elder's clumsy infatuation with Colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft, too much of the slate here to do much with the role of a woman who is tired of being rescued by a man who thinks they know what's best for her)? soon he will mount matters in a much darker territory. It does not take long before some soldiers are willing to kill, both sides are trying to deceive their subordinates to do things for them: a little miracle that at one point a mature man discards a bluecoat, who has long longed for disgust, scream "I would be for it died, but it's nothing but a dirty dirty blue rag! Stallone of his day, mature was one of those actors who might have surprised you with a strange great performance here and there when they matched the right part and the right director. This is not one of his better days, even though he has his most complicated part, perverted enough as a simple man? well-intentioned, but drunk, violent, uneducated and with an erratic, almost childish desire for life, part seems to be designed with Burt Lancaster in mind, with some striking similarities to his character in Kentuckian. But Colonel Robert Preston of Aabon is clearly the best role, determined to revive a career he has destroyed in one catastrophic suicide engagement in the Civil War by launching another nonsensical suicide campaign against the tribe that has added further humiliation to a list that keeps him out of sight and out mind promotion board. In his obsession with redeeming his career, he moves away from any hope of moral redemption, fueled so much by his shame for his wife's sympathy, such as the promotion of former comrades he regards as his subordinates. He is out of salvation, but is there still a recognizable human being there and one is not completely without a sense of integrity? does he really admire Madison's courage in a futile attempt to get Preston's orders rejected by their superiors? fatally sloping even if it is. Like his hero, the film is a bit rough around the edges (and boasts one of the most realistic and noble songs of all the Westerns), but it tends to make it more interesting, and there's a lot of Mann's elegant camera movements and perspective playing, while the boundary setting is convincingly cruel and primitive. Unfortunately, the shortcomings of the CinemaScope early lenses are very evident on DVD in Colombia, with the image often dark (2.55: 1 CinemaScope required a huge amount of additional lighting and early Scope films show many attempts at error and error) and grainy.
