When referring to independent cinema in the United States, it is often assumed that this means that the filmmaker or the people behind the project had much creative freedom and did what they wanted. This, today, is not always the case if someone is not a solid "author" and creative freedom still comes up with the warning that one has to find a distribution with one of the independent major study divisions or by picking it up in some way. low-level trade at a valuable film festival. Putney Swope, a Robert Downey film about nails African-American randomly promoted to lead advertising guru in a production company, * is * an independent cinema, a kind of work that went along with the favorite or Romero's Night Living the Dead and Cassavetes at the same time They get no real typical studio distributions, but they cause waves, kick ass and take names in the cinema. For all his moments, which are coarse and gross, it is unforgettable. It's also a movie that's witty, very, and excruciatingly funny. Sometimes the sense of humor is so ridiculous that it is almost impossible to laugh, from the mere appearance of President Mime and his wife to the lines of dialogue from the ads that Swope's team associates as "I can't eat air conditioning" into a real "soul" voice. It is as clever as the audience it is targeting, which is anyone with two brain cells that can put together who sees that this work is not offensive or too shocking because it is supposed to churn out a cage and that's nice in the first five minutes. Once it is the past Downey Sr. goes on his blitz kind as far as being a filmmaker with none to lose: his protagonist is part of Fidel Castro, part of Isaac Hayes circa 1972 (and yes, it is 1969 in the film) and part of the hard ass exec with the firestrip to make Mr. Spacely look kind to the Jetsons. And don't forget those side figures, dear God. <br /> <br /> There are so many unforgettable lines and moments that it's hard to watch. From perhaps the most hilarious attempted murder in any movie to one ad on "Face-Off" skin cream that includes lines that South Park would run for its dirty mouth money, just a little aside with one guy from Jack Hill's movies playing at a Muslim who still gives Swope a lip and that one boy with a nun who cursed a storm and impresses Swope with a quick move. It's a pretty direct news about media and advertising, but there's also a lot of powerful moments when it just hits a nail on the head about racism in America, sometimes without having to do more than just a gesture and sometimes with something like black. Types of panthers go like this around the Swope advertising mode. And for low-budget production (I think super low, a comparison with the Living Dead Night and Face), Downey got some really good actors, all non-members, and it's hard to imagine some of them having their first time on camera here. It should be noted that Downey's style does not make it perfect: he is rude and sometimes crazy and dated for his own good, and I'm sure I didn't do it to get some basic humor a few ads because I've been generating after these ads have been aired (though "Miss Redneck Jersey" was definitely not lost to me). Generally though this is one of the finest of its time period, the satire that stings and features with a predominantly black cast that is too familiar with what comes from excess power, regardless of skin color. It's how someone could say "good with ***".
