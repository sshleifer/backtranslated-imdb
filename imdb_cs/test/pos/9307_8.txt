We watched this film in our chemistry class, so of course it had educational value. I thought the film did a really good job of blending in with science subjects, moral questions, and personal experiences from the Manhattan project, but it wasn't exactly focused on strong acting. I would recommend this movie to scientifically inclined or those who are interested in moral issues beyond Fat Man and Little Boy, but if you are bored with the theme of nuclear bombs, you don't see it.
