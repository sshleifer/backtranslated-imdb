He loved this movie, what fun it is. Rupert and Julie are great together with Rupert, who is almost baptized against Julia's animation that worked well. Laura did a good job as an inverted mother. Of course, Julie is amazing as usual. While this movie will keep you laughing for most of the time, it also has a moving side to it, as it reveals the secrets in the life of the main characters. Interestingly, it was called Driving Lessons, because it could lead to the belief that this is the main feature of the film, which is not directly there, although it could certainly be seen as "Ben", who is finally in his driver's seat own life. Like most things that are funny in life, there is always a sad side and some moving moments appear in this movie. Very nice movie and worth watching.
