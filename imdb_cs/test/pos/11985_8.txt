This is not particularly well written. Songs are not unforgettable. But the cast of Martin and Lewis in the Navy situation squeezes a lot. They both look great as young sailors. They're believable. Submarine scenes show how cramped it must have been on those submarine missions in the 1950s and earlier. A lot of sailors in many scenes. Hundreds maybe, in the big outdoor training ground, and again in the boxing arena. <br /> <br /> You'll see James Dean in your scene. It stands out, even if it's here. In a scene where Jerry walks on a busy street, we see some of his "almost accident" comedies that he would bring to play a few years later at The Patsy. Dean gives the boxing instruction Jerry a good comedy to watch. In the boxing ring, Jerry shows his high energy, which was his trademark in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Dean and Jerry's dance is a little delicacy. It's not great, but better than most other than dancing movies. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing if it's black and white. Happy end. Tom Willett
