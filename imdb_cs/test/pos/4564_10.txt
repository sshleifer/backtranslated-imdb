Facing, people - "DK3" are more challenging, innovative and smarter than its predecessor. Challenging - its levels are extremely difficult for a considerable time. One particularly difficult level is called "Lightning Lookout" in which you can be hit by lightning at a given time. Innovative - opened a lot of doors. Too bad SNES died long after this title. And clever-level titles range from word markings ("Lake Orangatanga") to funny links that the game's target audience doesn't get for many years ("Bleak's House"). <br /> <Br /> I'm sorry about the criticism of most people in this game, especially two words: Kiddy Kong. He is a worthy "little-buddy" successor to Diddy Kong, and definitely does not deserve to be referred to as "that retarded monkey." T "DK3" remains classic until the end of time.
