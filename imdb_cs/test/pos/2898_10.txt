How do these guys go on? Each of them is about 50 years old and behaves as if they were only 30. They play 3 hours of music at each concert and barely break. This DVD is their first concert in Rio, Brazil. Although people don't speak English, they try to remember words in the most famous Rush songs and try to sing a foreign language at a concert with their best friends. From Tom Sawyer to The Spirit of Radio, this concert DVD will keep you in the chair and don't want to stop or give up on the classics you listened to when you were young. This is their 30th reunion tour (started in 1974). I went to their Scranton PA concert, and that was just as good, even though Freewill didn't play in PA, so I was upset. They have Freewill, have The Trees, have YYZ, Pass, Driven, Dreamline, Red Sector A, Limelight, Roll the Bones, 2112 and much more. 10 out of 10 because he doesn't compare anything else. If you never go to a Rush concert, then you can buy this DVD at least.
