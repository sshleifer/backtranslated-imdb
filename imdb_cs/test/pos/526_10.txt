I've never been so impressed with the movie as this little piece of the four groups of people facing the crisis or many. In some ways it is a bit like Short Cuts, but quite different. There is a bunch of leaders who will all learn well how their stories unfold and are how people show their good and bad sides, their weaknesses and strengths, with lots of drama and laughter. The closest equivalent to an American movie that I think is much weaker in every respect is Royal Tenenbaums. The Four Brown Shades, as the title in English, tells the story of a stressed hotelier and his wife and his older parents (who are traveling magicians); o Receptionist in the crematorium of animals and his family disasters; about members of the cooking course (who mostly talk about their lives) and fourthly about the funeral for a womanish trotter who tries to continue to organize the family outside the grave, singing and performing in the funeral during the funeral, thanks to the high tech equipment that cost him the whole fortune (the family gets zero, even the famous horse is put into the family)! This film has warmth and compassion that is full of grief and laughter I've never experienced before. Most of the actors were new to me, with the exception of Robert Gustafsson and one or two others, but they all deserve a big slam that the film shot in Guldbagge extravaganza (Sweden's "Oscar" Awards) a week ago! The male, female and male actors' awards supported by this film, plus a few others, to start! <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, go and see - the clock is floating very fast!
