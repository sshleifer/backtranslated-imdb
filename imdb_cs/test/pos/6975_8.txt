I have a letter from Mrs. Knight who went to college with my older sister. In it he tells of the hardships of making this film. She was pregnant - an interesting connection with the film conspiracy - and the novice director was not sure, quite green and had great difficulty with all the decisions, logistics, etc. They were constantly moving and it was very hard to shoot. However, the film, with a strong debut for James Caan, remains effective and influencing. It's a great showcase for the talent that Mrs Knight has shown her entire career - on TV, in movies and on stage, where Tony won "Kennedy's Kids". This film has an age.
