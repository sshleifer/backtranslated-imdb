In addition to being a clever and well-sold variation on a very popular horror genre today and a great formula to attract potential new fans in general, I have always considered "supernatural" a massive giant tribute to the genre over the decades. Although not always visible to younger viewers and / or people who have only an interest in more recent horror movies, each and every single episode contains a few obvious and subtle references to classical and influential titles. From this point of view, it was only a matter of time before writers paid tribute to the "haunted car without driver's films", and more specifically the 70's "Duel" (Steven Spielberg's acclaimed debut) and "Auto". He enjoyed "Route 666" a lot despite his shortcomings and shortcomings, and the episode opens up tense and atmospheric on the distant Missourian Road, where a black man is hunted and eventually killed by a formidable monster truck seemingly no driver behind the wheel. ex-girlfriend and calling Winchester Brothers The brothers cannot prevent two similar "accidents" before the sudden presence of phantoms occurs when they return to the 1960s racial dispute, which includes both Cassie's parents and several other major town dwellers. associates here tend to label "Route 666" as one of the weak ch items in one season, mainly because the script is too much preaching about the racial issues and other shows and emotional side of Dean's character. Usually it is a strong silent type, while here it is confronted with unfinished romantic issues from the past. To some extent, I agree with the debate on racism, but I didn't mind that much. Writers eventually had to explain the presence of a ghost truck and racial conflict is acceptable as far as I am concerned. As far as Dean's emotional vulnerability is concerned, I can only say that it is admirable to see how writers are constantly trying to give the main characters depth and detail. Indeed, Dean's behavior towards Cassie is giving him a whole new light. In addition, in this episode really depends on the miraculously sinister truck and its violent attacks. It is an impressive and powerful vehicle that produces blinding lights and noisy engines. In case you worshiped the brilliant above mentioned "Duel", you will surely find some amusement in the convincing chase sequences described in "Route 666".
