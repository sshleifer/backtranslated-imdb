I caught the movie late at night and I never knew what hit me. This was one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen, but I waited at the edge of my seat to see what was next. Alan Rickman is an excellent "bad guy" but this character beats everyone else. I've never been so hit by the movie! It's been 6 years now and I still can't forget "Closet Land".
