Ingmar Bergman's meditation on war involves a couple living an idyllic existence on a small island off the coast (from which country is not specified). There is a raging war in the distance, which they only know from the news. When they go around their day, the war comes to them, and soon it becomes a struggle for survival, as both sides seem not to care for. A gloomy look at the human cost of war and those who do not take part in the battle, but they cross, but still. It is a film before his time as about 40 years since the concept of the army was created in the war, where most of the victims are civilians. It is a dark disturbing film that is narrated from the point of view of the average person with the full sense of hopelessness and confusion, which is best expressed by the idea that keeps going through my mind, "what do I do now?" The film is an intellectual exercise, a film that will think of you. He touches as an emotional film, but never moves. I have never moved emotionally because the horror of this situation has made my brain flip-flops. (I should say that I admire Bergman intellectually for the ideas he brings to the table, but I've never moved his movies. I'm not a "fan" who was better because he had more feelings for his films). Booking aside this is requiring tracking, especially since we live in a world where war, for most of us, is just a thing on the TV screen.
