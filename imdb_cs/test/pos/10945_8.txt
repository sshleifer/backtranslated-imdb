With Twins, Ekin Cheng and Edison Chen, no one should expect a masterpiece of cinema. However, what you get is a fun movie that is easily visible to the brain. There is a lot of Hollywood vampires (no hopping Chinese bloodsuckers here), cute girls, handsome heroes and occasionally a very funny moment. And Jackie Chan. Sure, kung-fu relies on wire and CGI. Sure, the script reminds you of Blade. And certainly, the whole thing is immediately forgotten. But for a really nice piece of film fluff, it would be hard to push to find a better one.
