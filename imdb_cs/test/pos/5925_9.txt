Every year, a much-anticipated title with a large budget, which would be the right combination of star, director and theme that fails at the box office, cannot be missed every year. This year it was Superman Returns. In 1982 it was Blade Runner. In 1957 Billy Wilder's The Spirit of St. Louis, a film that had everything - a top director, a huge star, the best-selling true story of an American hero - except for a sufficient number of viewers to cover their costs. Perhaps the public still remembered Lucky Lindy's anti-Semitism and his loud admiration for the achievements of Nazi Germany before the war (or in the film that ends with his arrival in Paris before the legend became too dilapidated). Maybe because they thought they knew the story, or that it would be just one person stuck in the cockpit for two hours. Certainly Wilder and co-founder of Wendell Mayes are aware of the dramatic pitfalls of Lindbergh's relatively unassuming flight, alternating between a well-executed flashback structure and key points in his life and building the flight itself. Once the film is in the air, it's both surprising and thrilling to find a real drama in its attempts to stay awake and navigate without proper tools. It also creates a remarkable sense of horror that is unlike anything else. in Wilder's filmography, in conjunction with the real meaning of the epic: shots such as ominous storm clouds above the peg, the dark dawn before the flight carry the real cold of foreboding. Even the typically muffled and problematic WarnerColor adds to the film rather than downplaying. Along with the excellent use of the CinemaScope, there is a notable score from Franz Waxman: majestic, hovering, but filled with an underestimated threat, and cleverly used as part of a film fabric rather than mere musical accompaniment. The film loses points for indicating though it never actually said it was the first race to fly over the Atlantic - in fact, Lindbergh was the third man to fly across the Atlantic after almost forgotten British Alcock and Brown's amazing eight-year film. years ago - but it is still a remarkably tense and exciting adventure story that deserves a success that has never been found.
