Sherlock Holmes' great adventure starring with brilliant Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. Despite the many other actors who play Holmes and Watson superbly and do a great job - Rathbone and Bruce will always be the best two. Holmes takes Professor Tobell from Switzerland to London. Tobell wants the Nazis. He has a bomb that could win World War II. His bomb-site was divided into four parts, each hidden in books. Tobell agrees to give his bomb to the British government. On the night of his arrival, Tobell goes to his girlfriend's house. He drew some figures of the men, if Tobell disappeared, the lady should give Holm drawings. He is attacked on his way home, but the policeman stops it and the attacker runs away. Tobell is glad that the British government used his bomb, but refuses to give it, Tobell wants to take care of her. The bomb-site is divided into four parts, each part totally useless without another. He gives one of his scientific friends to each of these bomb spots. Then Holmes' greatest fear becomes, Tobell disappears. Holmes visits young Miss Tobell, who was attacked at night. He tells him about drawings. The drawings were stolen. He says that during the time Tobell left, only one man came to fix the bulb. The man he describes is Professor Moriarty. He works for the Nazi. Seen as he has drawings, Holmes is for. But he finds that the desk he used and used science can figure out what Tobell drew when he looked at the next page of the pad. He sees it as a code. He sees it as the name of four scientists. The first three will produce a code, but it cannot fourth. The three scientists he worked out were murdered and the bomb was taken. Holmes can't work out a fourth scientist, but not even Moriarty. Disguised as a sailor, Holmes can get into Moriarty's office. Moriarty sees it as Holmes, puts it in a box and lets it throw into the sea. But Watson and Lestrade insist they search the box and find Holmes in it. Now it is clear that Moriarty is great. Holmes manages to produce the fourth code, Frederick Hoffner. Holmes immediately gets to his house and gets Hoffner and the fourth most important to safety. Now Holmes must get Moriarty for working with the Nazis. He pretends to be Hoffner. Moriarty draws the fourth code and gets two men to go to Hoffner. They take him back and he stands in the face of Moriarty. Meanwhile, Tobell is not on track, tortured and tortured to get the name of a fourth scientist. Moriarty has it with Holmes now, he has it, and his death must be long for Holmes. The idea is to put him in a hospital, put a needle in his vein and watch him die of a blood loss. Watson is running and saving the day. Moriarty gets away, but Holmes was just careless to let Moriarty's trap open. Moriarty casts sixty feet. So Moriarty died. No. He makes his final trip in the film Woman in Green, but in 'Green' he is definitely dead, suicide, he jumps off his roof. It was Moriarty's second of three shows in Rathbone. His first appearance in 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' was played by George Zucco, his second in the film, starring Lionell Atwill and Henry Daniels playing in his final trip to The Woman in Green. how Holmes triumphs over the Nazi. 'The Voice of Horror' was the first, then this film and then 'Sherlock Holmes in Washington' Then it was back to Victorian times, with certain relationships to Edwardian and Georgian (George Fifth and Sixth) times. This film had a close reference to the Sherlock Holmes short story "Dancing Men" found in "The Return of Sherlock Holmes" The Big Movie, although there was obvious propaganda, it was a great Holmes trip.
