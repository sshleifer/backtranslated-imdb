This solid black and white grotesque comedy with a dark (but hopelessly conceived) conspiracy is a real crowd that will delight you with laughter (as well as disbelieving eye movements). It's an old psychopath on the train's story, but it's not of great importance because the thriller part of the film almost seems to be just a counterweight to the antiquity of the great comedian Robert Gustafsson. His unhappy, almost unpredictably optimistic soldier raises both compassion and schadenfreude in fashion that almost rivals Chevy Chase. The thing about the movie that has addressed me the most is that it is wedged between the unlikely and the cheerful are precisely portrayed of the everyday joys and inconveniences of traveling by train. They add the most welcome sense of realism and recognition. This thriller comedy has undoubtedly borrowed most of its "tension" from Hitchcock, and in my opinion it should be tracked only for its comic value (which is high). In addition to Gustafsson, Lars Amble's solid performance stands out as a beautifully cynical misogynist at the cost of acceptance. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend.
