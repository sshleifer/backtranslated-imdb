Dennis Patrick plays a man who accidentally kills his daughter's friend and then reveals his secret at a local bar. Joe (Peter Boyle), the bigot who got drunk there, takes him first as a joke, but the story is confirmed in the evening news. Instead of calling the cops or the like, Joe decided that because the guy killed a hippie, they must be ghosts! He blackmails the man to become his friend. At first, the film seemed cruel and incriminating, but as it turned out, in fact, it became a fairly complex portrait of contemporary society. Yes, I think it exaggerated a little, but in fun ways that actually don't take the power of his message. Susan Sarandon made her debut in this movie and it's a shock to see how pretty she was around 23. Well worth seeing.
