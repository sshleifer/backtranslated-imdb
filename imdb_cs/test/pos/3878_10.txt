Since the show was soon shortened, I never realized why I recently read the story behind the show. I felt that this show never got its rewards as one of the biggest shows, this show is iconic in nature and deserves a movie that it should have always had, if not with the original cast of the team included in the story or a lengthy portrait, perhaps on end to commemorate this late Col. Hanibal Smith (Preppard). This cast gave us so much to bring us the happiness that grew to us that it deserved the last lift that the show ended openly because the show was enough reason. This crew and cast forced us to realize that children are the essence of being one of the good guys who saw the world right today, I think a milder version like the original should be set in motion which I have already read and know, these are not plans, but if something like a DVD movie, I would definitely buy it. I really do not get as crappy shows the finals series, but this great show that still runs regularly today and probably gets watched more than some of the current garbage samples today will not always remember the Incredible Hulk series, Knight Rider, Airwolf and Team A because you The kinds of shows show the time, I am almost positive that they knew that the ones you see about detectives will not be remembered in 10 years, so why not return something to show people what is and what is. how these old shows really are.
