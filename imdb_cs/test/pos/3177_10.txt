"The Honkers" is probably Slim Pickens best performance ever. When we were filming, all those who were associated with the production thought Slim was an Oscar material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a James Bond picture in release at the same time and did not pay much attention to "The Honkers". I personally believe that this film has been criticized by most critics. "Junior Bonner" Sam Peckinpawa was at the same time and seemed to impress more critics than our film. Also, Cliff Robertson had a rodeo film out of a few months before our release and it might hurt us as well. The film is worth seeing if only for rodeo shots - some of the best movies shot by James Crabb. The director and my co-author, Steve Ianat, died a few weeks after the release of the film, shortened his promising career and left his beautiful wife Sally, his daughter, Gaby, and the newborn son Stefan. Please provide this movie. I bet you say it was worth it. Thank you to anyone who read it. Stephen Lodge
