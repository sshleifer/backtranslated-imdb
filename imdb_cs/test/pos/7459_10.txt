For the first time I saw this movie by accident when I visited my uncle in Arizona three and a half years ago. The VHS print was a little faded, but I was very persecuted by what I was watching. Did it all make sense? Well, honestly, no. However, this is a film that requires more than one viewing to understand all its aspects. The beautifully tragic score haunted me and the bizarre images softened the impression. Well, when I found out that Anchor Bay had released this weirdness on DVD, I picked it up immediately. I was very pleased with the transfer, although I felt that extras were rather missing. Although the film relates to "O" and Sir Stephen, it has nothing to do with the original Pauline Reage or The Story of O. "O" decides to prostitute for Sir Stephen in the violent 1920s Hong Kong. Its mission is to prove its infinite devotion and love to its master by giving it its body to other people. Naturally, Sir Stephen looks forward to seeing her during her unpleasant sexual escapades and even finds herself a lover. However, the tables are turned when "O" really finds a kind of love with a young male admirer. Suddenly Sir Stephen feels like a threat ... <br /> <br /> I feel that the profound meaning of the film (including the tragic score and artistic direction) really makes this film a classic. The viewer is introduced not only to the lives and past of "O" fellow brothers, but also to the confusion of the 20th century in Hong Kong. Prostitutes, like the political environment, are in need of belonging. No one is happy in the movie, even if they believe they are. (However, "O" finds a sense of happiness with her young admirer). One prostitute remembers tearfully how her father was a dog when she was drunk, which naturally led to a fetish that her customers acted like a dog. Another older prostitute is obsessed with her past as an actress. He can't let this vision go. He treats clients like stars and swears he hears a piano in the river. As for "O", she has a flashback about her father leaving her in a chalk circle. When she leaves, she feels abandoned. Of course, in the same flash, Kinski suddenly becomes her father. I was very, very concerned about this picture. I really felt for the "O" at this point in the movie. He barely smiles and this scene really explains why. Her fear of abandonment is so great that she sees her father as Sir Stephen and satisfies every obscene demand in hopes of proving her love. Another special aspect of the movie is the little baby (which age at the end) that sells wealth in the box. It is a very random character, but somehow it contributes to the loss and emptiness of the film. At one point, the director even uses painted cardboard figures to represent people. If it's not symbolic for you! (Laughter) <br /> <br /> All in all, I really like this movie. I feel like it's a very deep and somewhat touching experience. It has erotic scenes but the scenes are not really meant to wake up. Like the lives of characters, sexual acts are empty. They are movements, but they lack feeling and tenderness. (Again, the only scene is between "O" and a young man). "O" believes that he is in love and that reducing himself is an honor, but eventually finds that he has a choice. She too can be her own person and watch her own happiness, but she also has the opportunity to stay in this circle that her father drew. The director leaves many unanswered questions, but some things don't need answers. The viewer makes the judgment that works for them. I have to say that I wish that a special edition of this DVD was released that had a director's commentary. I think it would be fascinating to hear his opinion on the film and his message later. It is a pity that the soundtrack has never been released. This movie has a really scary and heart breaking score. There is something about the continuing vocals that send the cold. I feel I feel lonely in the movie just by listening to music.
