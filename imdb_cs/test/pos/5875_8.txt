This film went out of fashion more often than a miniskirt. The post-war triumph was practically forgotten in the 1970s, with the exception of cinema students. Recently, it has become recognized as perhaps the most similar representation of the integration of soldiers into the post-war life that it has ever been (and that certainly includes films like "Deer Hunter"). evaluation is somewhere between these extremes. The story is simple. Three very different soldiers who went home after World War II (The Big One!), Flew home to their midwestern city, trying to restore or create civilian lives. One has a disability, one is waiting for him a good job and the other has nothing to do but determination. <br /> <br /> There are some good but uneven performances. Fredric March won the Best Oscar Actor for playing an old sergeant who returns to his job at a local bank. Personally, I think Jimmy Stewart deserved it for "It's a wonderful life", which also earned the Best Picture Award, but this film obviously touched the post-war viewer. As I said, it was fashionable. March has one fantastic scene, a humorous speech that recalled a somewhat similar incident involving a true World War II hero Pappy Boyington, and otherwise is solid but unpredictable. I'm going against the grain, but I thought the Academy justly ignored Myrna Loy, who played the March wife. I barely found it hot. In fact, I still thought she was going to apologize to Frederic March. Every time she was together, she grinned. There was certainly something missing, in her forced smiles and in the air of tolerance rather than joy. I think all this nonsense about being a "perfect woman" is right only if you think a passionate man in the 50's is your ideal. You may disagree, but academic voters may not. It's a big deal with this movie, terribly wrong. Dana Andrews as a former jerk who became a war hero, then back at the counter is amazing. He is saddled with a wife who apparently married him immediately before he retired to war for all bad reasons, and his future looks bleak. But then hope for the daughter of Peggy in March (Teresa Wright, in a fantastic turn) and fireworks explode. Both are great, but then there comes the inequality that pervades this film. Some moments of pure soap opera came in, interrupted by the ordinary classic line, "I'm going to this marriage!" Romance is uplifting and reflects a common condition after the war that the return of soldiers find love after their return. Speaking of uplifting, we've now reached Harold Russell. It has the naturalistic quality of its acting, or it is inactivity that sounds just as true as it is today. Taking a nonsensical approach to our situation is an inspiration. His best scene, one of the best in all cinemas, is when he brings a girl who likes him in her bedroom to show her the truth about her condition. "I'm lucky I still have my elbows unlike some boys." Really great things. The film has a few moments that rise. It also has a few moments that belong to afternoon soaps. Take the good with the bad and look at this peak.
