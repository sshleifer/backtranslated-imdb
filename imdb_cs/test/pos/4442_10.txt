Lucio Fulci has done a lot of great movies throughout his career, and the way many of them have featured the gore of the crystal has led him to the title of Godfather Gore. While Don't Torture Duckling was done before Fulci became well known among gorehounds, and not all that gory; it is definitely a brave and ugly little thriller and for my money the best movie ever made by Fulci! It's not torture duckling is really head and shoulders over much of the Giallo genre in terms of production value and unlike many later Fulci movies, all about this giallo is great. The story focuses on a small rural community where dead bodies began to appear. The murders are still shocking because the victims are just young boys. Shortly after the police condemned an innocent man of crimes, a reporter named Andrea Martelli comes to the village and decides to start a murder investigation on his own. Martelli soon meets various suspects, including a sexy young lady named Patricia, a sinister priest and a local witch who likes wax figurines and sticky pins in them. While this movie doesn't have to contain a lot of gore, it has two Fulci's most beautiful sequences to replace it. The worst thing is a woman who is brutally defeated by a group of men in a graveyard, while an image of a man falling from a cliff and hitting any number of stones on the way down can cause some stomachs to turn. Don't torture duckling features absolutely great Italian cast. Barbara Bouchet (my favorite) is incredibly sexy in her role as Patricia, and gets to bend her acting muscles more than in many later movies. Tomas Millian is excellent, as usual, while the rest of the cast is well completed with the likes of Irene Pappas, Florinda Bolkan and Marc Porel. Display cinematography is overwhelming and Fulci gives the viewer the impression that he puts a lot of care and effort into every scene. The story is slow, and it's always interesting, because Fulci never lets the film go too far from the central line. There are not many mysteries about the identity of the killer; But Fulci can almost bargain us to the end and don't make a duckling on top. Overall, it is a pity that Fulci did not create such films. It's not torture duckling is his out and out of the best job and I insist that every giallo fan sees it!
