For the first time I watched this movie when it first came out and also took an LP recording of the soundtrack. I liked it so well that I came back to see it several times .. can't understand why it was considered a flop. Julie Andrews was beautiful in this movie, her voice was in top form and the costumes were beautiful! The movie contains a little bit of everything, though some scenes were a little cumbersome, they were still fun. I recently found out that I could get a DVD copy and order it ...... I was disappointed that a few songs and sequences in the movie were not part of the DVD I ordered.
