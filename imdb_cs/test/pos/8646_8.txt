After two short scenes that are not initially related to the rest of the film, we see a dark-haired, apparently rich beauty in the back of the limousine. Her driver stops at a special place on Mulholland Drive, a twisted, densely forested two-lane road full of settlements overlooking Los Angeles. Like her driver and another man in the passenger seat, he turns two cars from the opposite direction into the limousine. Only a dark-haired woman survives. She works along the ridge on Sunset Boulevard and hides in a holiday women's apartment. Shortly thereafter, Betty (Naomi Watts), a niece of a holiday woman, appears in the apartment and runs into a dark-haired woman who now has amnesia. Most of the first part of the film is Betty and a dark-haired woman trying to figure out who this is, why people try to kill her and why she has thousands of dollars in her wallet and a special key. This is scattered by the strangely surrealistic threads about Hollywood producers and directors, with occasional forays into the land of hoodlums and prostitutes. <br /> <br /> The above may sound a bit complicated and incoherent, but that's not half of it. The film is constructed so that meaning is always open to interpretation. It is essentially guaranteed that you will not understand this film and for the first time will not be sure that you will come to your own interpretation. Although you have a lot of experience with like-minded movies - like Memento (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), I Inside (2003) and The Butterfly Effect (2004) - you don't have to understand it for the second viewing. The studio realized this to the point of having director David Lynch, who wrote "10 feet to unlock this thriller" and placed it on the back of a chapter that is embedded in a DVD. Lynch is a strange disposition, these tracks are almost as mysterious as the movie itself. This does not help when trying to figure out in the early stages that the structure is very complex. It takes a long time to find out which parts are supposed to be "real" and in some sections there is a complicated embedding of flashbacks, with only contextual guides that are flashbacks. But is it a film worth watching or worth discovering? This, of course, depends on your taste. At the surface level, the film is certainly attractive if you are a surrealist fan, although it will tend to seem a little slow and too incoherent with some viewers. These features and many other surrealistic aspects of the film are typical of Lynch. Lynchian's first moment is that old couple bizarre in the beginning, almost as if they were extraterrestrial people trying to get to the front. If you are familiar with this style and like it, you'll find a lot to love, though in many ways Mulholland Drive is quite undervalued for Lynch. It is also noteworthy that viewers who are primarily interested in it, or who enjoy it as well as other aspects, have the Mulholland Drive quite enthusiastic about the lesbian scene. It's not unreasonable, even if I have no problems with gratuitousness, but instead is an important hinge in the film. Like all Lynch movies, it's easy to be charmed by its unique approach to every aspect of filmmaking. art and its attention to detail. Every serious film student (including "cinephiles") should study Mulholland Drive; many will love him. Lynch won't let anything go unmanipulated. Includes brilliant color schemes (eg Red and Pink) with significant symbolism. He makes an unusual use of sound, such as the ringing phone transmitting to the score section that follows it (when Betty first arrives at the airport). He leads his actors to deliver their lines in a wealth of bizarre ways, such as his distinctive breaks. He lets his strange and surprising sense of humor poke, such as the name "Winkie's", and "Hot Dogs - Made for the Pinks" sign that provides guidance to some of the colorful symbolism. Lynch's attention to detail in manufacturing design provides important, subtle clues throughout the film to help one unlock meaning. It is interesting to note that Lynch obviously requires that DVD programming be unusual - there are no chapters on the disc; you must either watch the movie in real time or fast forward or backward to get back to certain points. If surrealism and the veiled meaning of the movie are appealing to you, or if you just love the "puzzles" then Mulholland Drive is well worth watching for this aspect. There is quite a accepted interpretation of the film, at least on a broad, generalized level. I will not describe the standard interpretation here - it is worth exploring, but only after you have seen the film several times and reached your own conclusions. Many articles and monographs have been written about film and interpretations; there are also websites that are designed for this purpose. For my money, even though I generally like Lynch and find many things about Mulholland Drive attractive, it's not quite 10 for me, at least not yet (I feel like my score might still be on subsequent views) rise). For me, however, the "twist" aspect of the film is much better in other works, such as I Inside and The Butterfly Effect. Mulholland Drive is more attractive to me for its superficial surrealistic touches, but the conspiracy doesn't wear them like some of Lynch's other movies. Yet Mulholland Drive is definitely recommended for the right crowd. If you are serious about film and do not mind if you think about what you are watching (as if these two things do not necessarily match), you should not miss this.
