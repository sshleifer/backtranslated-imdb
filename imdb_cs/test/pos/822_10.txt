This film was created on a relatively small budget ($ 10-20 million?) With almost no promotion at all from its distributors. I only knew about it because I was a longtime fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme and I always looked at his latest movies in the hope of being at least observable and apart from some real turkeys (Derailed, Second In Command),. This film has an easy plot to follow, and Van Damme puts a good, humorous performance over but the film owes all of his credit to combat scenes involving Van Damme, Scott Adkins and the final one of them together. Camera editing and work for most of the movie is pretty horrible, but Isaac Florentine can definitely make a good battle scene. I am also glad that Van Damme has been working better recently (In Hell, Wake of Death, Do Death), but with less good art, less martial arts have come. In The Shepherd, Van Damme proves he has it.
