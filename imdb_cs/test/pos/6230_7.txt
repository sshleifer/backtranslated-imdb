"Tourist Trap" is one of my favorite horror shocks in the late 1980s. A group of young people heading somewhere, one couple in the car ahead, and the car is flat, and our movie opens with a young man, Woody, who pushes the tire and looks for a service station. He finds a seemingly abandoned place, yet he hears voices and explores, and ends up with a piece of pipe over his stomach for his efforts. Together, the rest of the young people (in VW Thing) come and pick up Woody's girlfriend and find the same place, Slausen's Oasis, or something like that. immersion in the stream. Of course, VW Thing mysteriously died at this point, so Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors) offers his help. Mr. Slausen has a museum with lots of wax figures and lives in a museum, but behind him is a big house where Davey says. And who is Davey? Why, Davey Crockett, he says ... but if it was Davey Crockett, everyone would probably be safer. The girls are left alone while Slausen goes to help repair the car, but of course curiosity gets better from one & she goes to investigate, and finds a house full of scary dummies and one rather animated one named ... Davey. What follows is a somewhat scary night of horror, one after another, taken by Davey's prisoner, who says he's brother Slausen. One girl (formerly kidnapped) is plastered, resulting in her death as she covers her air. In any case, it's a bit of a twist to this and kind (but strange) Mr. Slausen is not exactly what it seems. Good, spooky late 70-year horror flick, and lots of dummies for a very scary atmosphere. 7 out of 10.
