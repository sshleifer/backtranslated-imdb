Robin Hood: Men in Stockings (1993) was a much needed parody by Mel Brooks. He has the task of spoofing the heritage of Robin Hood and a few films dealing with the mythical honest thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes plays as Robin Hood. He searches for a couple of good men who join him in his quest to overthrow the evil sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and win the righteous hand of Maid Marian. Robin also has to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis). Tracey Ullman co-stars as personal prince John's Latrine who has her eyes on the sheriff. Will Robin Find His Cheerful Men? How far will the prince cast his weight in the absence of his father? Why does Sheriff hate Robin so much? To learn, you'll need to watch ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TESTS! Look at the cheerful portrait of Dom De Luis, who plays the Duke of Jersey. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
