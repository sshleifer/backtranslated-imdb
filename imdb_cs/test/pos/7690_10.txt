I've seen it on television many years before I remember, but I've never forgotten Sammy Davis, Jr. This portrayal of Porgy and Bess is a treasure. I'd like to see it again and introduce my son to him. I can't imagine why it's not announced as one of Sammy Davis's greatest performances, Jr. Whoever is responsible for not telling the audience should be ashamed of his ignorance. But I'll keep looking for it. Perhaps the managers responsible for such things will realize the forgotten work of many African American actors.
