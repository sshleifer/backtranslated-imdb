I probably wouldn't bother commenting on this movie if it didn't break my constant references to it in North America as a porn movie. Our obsession with what is or should be considered pornographic remains a relic of the "guidelines" that filmmakers have provided to the Hayes Committee many years ago, and it is now really time for us to push it back into the past. So far we have not progressed further than we have set ourselves a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now call "soft" and "hard" porn, both bearing the same pornographic label. It's time for everyone to realize that neither the R (soft porn?) Version of this movie nor the non-rating (hard porn?) Available on DVD was by no means pornographic. <br /> <br /> In legal terms pornography is defined by its ability to dishonor or harm. Many classic books, such as Lady Chatterley's lover, Fanny Hill, Love in Women, 'O' Story, or Moll Flanders, have been prosecuted for pornographic content, jury rehearsed, and accounted for by this definition, but in practice most ordinary citizens are not interested in what they regard as legal ambiguity, and apply a simpler test that is too strict when it applies to books or movies that are very close to that line but serve to quickly remove most of the other from any pornography. Although the Hayes code would rate AIW as unacceptable for both nudity and depiction of sexual activity, most people today accept that where the basic message of a book or film is clearly designed to support the development of long-term stable family relationships in which participants find true fulfillment cannot be considered pornographic (this does not mean that works depicting unsatisfactory or unstable relationships should be recognized as pornographic, only that they may need more sophisticated ratings). At AIW, we have a film about a young female librarian who is more of a sheltered upbringing and holds a suitor for a gun length because she feels that this is what morality requires. Having become too frustrated and threatened to abandon it, she falls asleep and dreams of being taken to the wonderland (closely based on what Lewis Carrol has), where everyone she is concerned about is not entirely interested in your sexual needs. She is shocked, but she is a kind person who takes things as she finds them and so long before she learns that her own prejudices are gradually melting. She wakes up when her boyfriend returns to get out of their affairs, but her attitude towards him has changed so completely that their relationship is fully restored, and the film ends when they live "happily ever" with their children in the house with white fence and family dog ​​- the end clearly focused on those romance who remain very young in the heart. <br /> <br /> Pornographic? - Hardly! <br /> <br /> Appropriate observation for children? - Well, probably not entirely unless they have very progressive parents. <br /> <br /> R rating? - PG would be more appropriate today. <br /> <br /> Fun for viewers in most age groups? - Yes, but the movie has its mistakes - they are discussed in many IMDb comments, but most commentators have clearly appreciated it and enjoyed it. I believe the only pornography associated with this film was a reporter claiming that an anti-pornographic activist of "scientific evidence" that the picture of Kristin deBell magazine was a photomontage of 10-year-old facial images with different body parts of adult models. These and other comments seriously damaged the career of a very promising young actress, but today the film seems to be on the road to a cult classic, several home video productions have been released in both VHS and DVD format; the last was a DVD that contained both r and non-rated versions of the movie released by Subversive Cinema in 2007. Copies of this material were available only a few months ago, are now almost exhausted, and mail order suppliers still have copies in stock they sell many times the original price - a situation that usually results in a new DVD release. This persistent interest almost 35 years after the release of the original film points to an almost classic status. It is expected that commentators on this database will provide other viewers with useful advice on whether the film is worth watching or even collecting - my comments were aimed at highlighting the persistent damage to industry that still results from the pressure on large studios, to follow the recommendations of self-censorship from Hayes. In this database, readers refer to such general comments as "useless" and rarely create them; but fortunately, I still have room to add that in my opinion this film is completely unusual and worth watching or even shopping. This is wrong, but Kristine deBell gives great performance and the movie provides a fairly unique and enriching viewing experience. Overall, I would rate it at 7 stars and buy a copy of the next DVD release if it appears. If Mrs deBell is still alive today, I would like to hear her comments on both the attempts to suppress this film and the late recognition it has gradually achieved.
