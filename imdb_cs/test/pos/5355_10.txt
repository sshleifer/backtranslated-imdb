I really refused to see this movie. I refused to go to school and refused to go with my parents. Just by looking at the trailer, it looked just as stupid. One of my friends wanted to take me to the movies that day and offered me two options: "Dukes of Hazzard" or "Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of Rabbits." I decided 17 minutes. Time is running out. I had to choose. It came on the screen "Few" as in a few tickets left. By the time we had to descend and get a ticket, only one of us could go inside. I desperately wanted Nicholas to see him. But he made me. I crossed my arms and was very moody and disappointed that I was going to see this childhood. I went in, sat in the single seat that was available and ready for the movie! must say that I was very surprised that I sat over it MASTERPIECE! It was amazing. I don't know what I complained about. Clay animation was by far the best I've ever seen in my life. The story was brilliant. A rabbit that breaks and smashes a carnival that has been planned for more than 500 years. Anti-Pest Control protects people who compete in the Vegetables competition. Anti Pesto known as Wallace and Gromit (who is in charge of this store) are trying to keep all rabbits away from the vegetable carnival. I haven't said that before. It's too good to say. I admit that the whole idea of ​​Were-Rabbit is ab-incredible and ab-childish, but Nick Park adds a substance that does it to everyone who loves it. I mean, there aren't 10 freelance rabbits and there won't be 8 werewolf feet, as stated in "Dog Soldiers". Then again, Were-Rabbits and WereWolves are not real creatures. But in any case, it turned out very well. Jokes have also grown up. Children don't get some jokes. It goes over their heads. There were plenty of British jokes. If you like British humor, it's a movie for you. I also loved casting and voices. Everything about film is so incredibly well done. The direction and stimulation was absolutely ... FANTASTIC! I recommend it to fans of old Wallace And Gromit shorts (and I haven't seen them yet) and I recommend it to fans who liked "Shrek" and "Shrek 2 and most importantly I recommend it to people who love Clay Animation
