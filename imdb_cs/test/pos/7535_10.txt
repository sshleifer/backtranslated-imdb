I think this film is underestimated. For me it seemed like a sip of fresh air. Some people complain about the improbability of conspiracy, overlapping sequences, and lack of sex (the latter is, in my opinion, the main reason for "improbability", and how come drunk teenagers who talk dirty?) But it's not just their thing and good for them unless they can relate to the story. Performances are great; I'd like to see more actors in other movies. Emotions are real. The whole unrequited love thing is presented with a strange subtlety. And that gives you the feeling that you can get out of a good movie.
