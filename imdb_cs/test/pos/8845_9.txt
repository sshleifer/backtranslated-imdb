This is my first film by John Carpenter, I have to say that I have greatly impressed Things. Right from the start, the film pulls you in and never stops. Special effects and film models will survive today. Apart from Kurt Russell, I didn't recognize any of the members of the cast, but they were all exceptional in that they were afraid, paranoid and desperate to survive. Universal DVD has a lot of interesting backstage. Very recommended, 9/10.
