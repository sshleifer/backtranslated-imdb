Kramer vs. Kramer is one movie you can stick to and don't forget. It's not one of the most popular movies ever made, and it's definitely one of the weakest best films, but it doesn't mean it's not important yet. I thought the movie is well done and you do just want to watch more and more. The performance was the best positive for the film, and Dustin Hoffman played one of his best roles he had ever done as a lonely workaholic who has to worry about his son because his wife is separated from him. Billy, who is Hoffman's son, played another great performance with Meryl Streep, playing Billy's depressed mother. Kramer vs. Kramer is not one of the biggest films and is not perfect 10, but he succeeds in the fact that the film is worth watching and worth taking care of. Sure, one of Hoffman's best movies ever made. I warmly recommend. Hedeen's View: 9/10 *** + A-
