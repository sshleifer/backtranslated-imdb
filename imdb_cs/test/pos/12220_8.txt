The problem with TV today is that people have been spoiled by "lite" TV watching. This type of TV show is equivalent to elevator music or "easy listening" jazz. A typical viewer of "continuity" remembers who voted off the island last week, wondering who will be next. Show them a program like surface, firefly, dr. Who, or anything with a plot conspiracy with more than three episodes and ... well, will play back to Survivor. 95% of sheep watching TV don't want to hold their brains. They want excuses not to think. They want to make sure that the "boob trumpet" lives up to its name ... and they don't want a show that tries and goes a different way. Thanks to this, Surface and many other high-quality shows, which were to last much longer, were given an ax. TV viewers don't want stories or morals, nor philosophy, nor over a third. vocabulary level. They want people who eat earthworms or an exaggerated series of "real life" (nothing like that! You can't observe anything without changing the nature of what you see) or hormonal performances involving groups of people who have experience and then it boasts. Friends. Today's television is nothing but a wasteland, and a few diamonds you can choose from dust are just thrown away because nobody even knows what a diamond is already. The surface was one of those diamonds.
