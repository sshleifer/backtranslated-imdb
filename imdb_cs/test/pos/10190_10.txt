This program was for a short while when I was a kid, I remember watching him as I ate fish and chips. Riding on the back of Tron Humbug this series was in the style of streethawk, manimal and the like, with the exception of multiple computers. There was a geeky boy who somehow created the computer - an automan. He should go around solving crimes and much. Everything I really remember was his luxury car and the little flashy cursor thing that was used to draw a car and help him in general. When I mentioned it to anyone, he also remembers very little. Was it real or maybe a dream?
