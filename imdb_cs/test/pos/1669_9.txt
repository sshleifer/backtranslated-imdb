The recent re-edition of the French film crime (the original name "Du Rififi Chez les Hommes"), with its famous 20-minute silent jewelry store, now comes in the US in a beautiful new print from the Criterion collection with enhanced headlines and some additions. Jules Dassin was an American (born Julius Dassin in Middletown Connecticut) who was forced to shoot films in Europe because he was blacklisted. Rififi has been well published in the United States and has done well in art houses. Later Dassin became more famous in the US for 'Never On Sunday' (1960) starring his wife, Greek actress and political activist Melina Mercouri. (Greece was once again enchanted and popularized for Americans and others with Anthony Quinn in Mihalis Kakogiannis' 1964 'Zorba Greek', which was even a big hit in Cairo.) The new Rififi DVD includes a recent interview with Dassin. I never realized that one of the main robbers, Cesar Milanese, was playing Dassin, who entered when the original actor became inaccessible. It's one of the most memorable characters, a fake Italian secure cracker that doesn't speak French. Although this classic has all the decorations of the French film noir - a black and white twilight world of well-lit apartments, shiny black cars, men in suits, nightclub scenes, including a dramatically shot and burnt title song in the club, Stone Face and Gauloise in hand or mouth - I don't think it's so atmospheric, or it has such a distinctive style as Melville's films do. But there is a fascinating robbery that still remains as a tour. It's like a movement with a subtle sense of crafts and teamwork among thugs. Some cops' noses are being dealt with effectively. Things go wrong when they get home and distribute the loot when one of the players gets sloppy and gives a dame ring with a million dollar bracelet. Was there ever a film about a lie whose pleasures lived happily to the end? It's a wordless sequence that guarantees this special place, and Dassin, an American director who had an unusually varied and exotic career, deserves it. He took the novel so conventional he wanted to reject it, and added some key elements that make it special. In this case, he could not pass the adaptation: he needed too much money. Jean Servais, starring Tony le Stephanois, was his actor. His grim face is ideal for this role. He was later playing the lead in Dassin's Who Who Must Die (1957), which used French actors in Greece for a political story. "Topkapi" is a somewhat unsatisfactory 1964 film (compared to "Rififi"), which also received American distribution. He has a good set up, but it's useless, gone all bland and clear and pretended. Dassin's post-Hollywood work, 'Never On Sunday,' with his catchy themed song and charismatic heroine, is a popular choice (and won the best film at Cannes 1960); "Who must die" is a political choice; 'Rififi' genre choice. The strange piece is his 'Phaedra' with Mercouri and Tony Perkins (1962). The purists of the hard work of the Hollywood genre would have avoided these and favored Dassin's early films, which included the prison drama "Brute Force" (1947), a cop flicked "The Naked City" (1948); and two hard core noirs, 'thieves' road' (1949), and 'night and city' (1950). Personally, I like French noir and American neo-noir spinoffs better than the original American noir source - my permanent 'Rififi' fascination. But Dassin is somewhat unique in not only making Hollywood noira, but then going to Paris to create an unforgettable example of his French derivation of the 1950s.
