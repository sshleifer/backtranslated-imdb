Black Rain is an excellent movie, but watch out for DVDs that are currently selling for $ 300 a piece. I have a DVD and it's terrible. A very small non-anamorphic image that must be thrown up to the size of the killing resolution. Acceptable sound. This is a primitive DVD that is absolutely * to be reissued. VHS is a huge step up from the DVD! And the laserdisc has by far the best picture of all subtitles in black, sharp, big, simple but very good soundtrack. Buy VHS and avoid the senseless prizes that these underwater artists require!
