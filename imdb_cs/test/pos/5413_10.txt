This film is now a powerful commentary on family life in North America. The story is so well designed that it almost feels like it's going across the street right now! If you are somehow connected to your family and community, this movie will catch you and take you to Travis' house and won't let you leave until the credits are done. Our imaginary heroes, through the myriad of innocent circumstances, often unknowingly, take us through the path of sadness, confusion and isolation. The Travis family invites each of us after a terrible tragedy; Father, Mother, Brother and Sister, into their lives, to share their experiences in a dynamic set of circumstances that just don't end up. We see all of the above and finally the joy, in the strong performances of the main players and the rest of the cast, so this film is a movie visitor an absolute treasure. <br /> <br /> In a movie that's as good as this, it's usually difficult to find something special, but Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of Sandy Travis was excellent. I would be surprised if the others didn't recognize it as such. <br /> <br /> Sure 10. Good work!
