Well, I don't want to add to the diatribe that was 'preached' about this movie. All I can add is that at no time does it even pretend to be a "historical" image. Unlike the "brave heart", "Titanic" or "Patriot", all of which have very credible and serious historical changes, purely for the theatric effect (perhaps the worst apologies). Did everyone take a sense of bypassing humor? All I can add is a paraphrase of good Captain Maclean - "It looked fantastic and we have a bloody good laugh." <br /> <br /> - Last point. What astonishes me is that there are comments about "modern music" in the historical setting. I wonder if the same people believed the Moulin Rouge anyway. I suggest no.
