Wales seems to have been outwitting some strange movies lately. In fact, Wales seems to be developing its own small film industry. I recently saw a very Annie Mary, whom I thought was very good. However, the land of sight is not only unpredictable, it is laughing out loud, it is a cast of beautifully talented actors (Brenda Blethyn is amazing) and a conspiracy that is not entirely original, but it is cleverly written that one is always happy to choose what would it could have been almost a throw. It was the kind of movie I wanted to watch once I was done, and one of the few I'd like to own. Although many of the characters are cartoons, and you had to be in a Welsh village to appreciate it, they are also very people, and the relationship between Blethyn and Molina is a pleasure to see.
