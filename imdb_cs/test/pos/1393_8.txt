I saw this movie on TV as SCREAMERS and loved it. I've heard an interesting story about this movie. When Roger Corman dismissed him in the summer of 1981, his trailer department sent out a trailer that wasn't really a movie. It was reportedly the footage of a naked woman who was being chased around a lab-built monster. During the opening of the movie on the drive cars, the complainants complained that they had not seen the movie they paid to see. Theater owners were named Corman and said that their customers felt ripped off. So Corman had to run a copy of the shots and send a positive film to the theater owners to join the film itself. Since the shots were never negative in the movie, they did not appear in any video, DVD or television. Did anyone see this footage? Anyone who saw this movie at the start of the summer of 1981, remembers it?
