I thought I wrote a comment on this movie before, but I can't find it here. I'm writing it again anyway. I happened to find this film from the library collections of my college. It was free to watch, so why not. I'm definitely glad I watched it. I love this movie. I've seen several Russian films, most of them have serious themes. I'm surprised it was a good comedy. I had a lot of laughter while watching. and that's the movie I want to buy. the thing is so funny. And it's not just silly jokes, these plots were very original and well thought out, so they don't seem stupid at all. I am surprised that this film did not attract many viewers. This is a classic that you can watch over and over again. These actors were also very authentic, their acting was real, not forged. if you haven't seen it, get a copy soon! definitely recommended.
