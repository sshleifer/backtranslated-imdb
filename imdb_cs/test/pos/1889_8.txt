These are the kinds of movies that I loved and still love to grow up. Unlike large budget films that transport huge holes and never recognize them. This movie takes in all the steps and just does something you can sit back and enjoy. There was some movie student before that complained that it wasn't a material list. But that's not the reason. The aim of this movie is that no one likes huge CGI Clich√© 'movies. There are a lot of people who like movies that are meant to keep you entertained and not get as much money as they can. Besides, it's also good to know that good ol 'Bruce isn't dead yet.
