Start by saying that I am a punk fan of most of my life. I've always had such a lack of respect for the LA scene of the early 1980s, when The Decline of Western Civilization, with the exception of X and Black Flag, is rather a New York and English punk guy. After I saw this movie, it changed completely. Exposed people may look like a bunch of idiots who choose children who think they could achieve something beyond Cree street through their lifestyle, but it's a great example of hedonism at its best, along with some fun, loud rock n roll. One of the best scenes, and actually the most intelligent, is the interview with Claude Bessy of Catholic discipline, or "Kick-Boy," as readers of Slash magazine knew him. Originally from France, punk acts as a dirty old Frenchman and guides in viewers to many aspects of punk, DIY, attitudes to music, politics, and life in general. Darby Crash of the Germs will be a complete idiot for most of the time, but the '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' very good, complete with young Pat Smear. The performance of Black Flag with Chavo Pederast on vocals (that was filmed a few years before Henry Rollins joined the band) is decent and X and FEAR give the best performances in the movie. Check out interviews with young punk kids. You will hear the fun things you have ever heard in a documentary. Highly recommended.
