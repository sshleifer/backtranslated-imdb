My curiosity and patience to finally see this controversial film, which has now been released on DVD for the first time in the UK, has been more than rewarded. Peter Watkins excelled in his audacity and technical skills. This pseudo-document is certainly premature and still frighteningly relevant and timely. The film is inspired by the shock of the late 1960s in the US, when the government increased its legitimate use. violence and oppression, while the anti-war movement is increasingly violent and radical. The government has introduced so-called Penalty Parks to deal with this excess of prisons and to provide special training for riot police units. Convicted "criminals", mostly activists, are given "choice" to be imprisoned for years or years, or spent three days in one of these parks, where they either acquire freedom or death, or even a longer prison sentence. . However, the situation in the parks exceeds their worst expectations. It reminded me of a realistic version of Battle Royale (2000). The film's structure is extremely effective and resembles parallels with the cannibal holocaust, which is created almost ten years later. Both films are designed and filmed in such a way that the viewer is challenged in thinking and feeling that he is truly watching a real document and is therefore shocked, even though he is aware that: this is a film. They both confront us with the naturally violent nature of mankind, but where a cannibal Holocaust lacks a deeper meaning (especially a exploitative film in every sense of the word) and raises no critical questions about the world, Penalty Park does just that. I was deeply overwhelmed by the Punishment Park and it is hard to believe how such a powerful and important film could have been rejected and marginalized for so long. Maybe it says enough about the truth of its content, about the way power structures in this world work. I disagree with the criticism that Watkins polarizes and stereotypes because the film depicts activists and protectors of legitimized power structures that are actually so polarized as they are here. If not, there would be no conflict in our societies and therefore no change. In fact, confrontations between these two groups often take stereotypical forms, whether you place them between activists and found in Latin America, Russia or New York. If these groups were not polarized to these extremes, activists would be part of the silent majority, who are silently complaining, but at the same time staying in the world's injustices. As Peter Watkins tells us a DVD introduction, the actors in Punishment Park are largely amateurs. Most children were true LA activists, most of the police were part of national forces, and even some members of the tribunals are part of the social and political establishment of time. Not introducing both groups before filming the scenes that take place in an improvised courtroom gives a spontaneous and improvised feeling. Parallels are drawn with questions of time, such as the suppression of members of the Black Panther (one of the black prisoners is said to resemble the condemned charismatic BPeader Bobby Seale) and the trial of Chicago Seven. I admire Watkins's apparent and sincere engagement with injustice and his concern for human rights and the increasingly repressive measures of governments (today in the name of war in terror) to silence those who disagree and refuse to brainwash. Punishment Park remains an extremely important film that should be presented in schools and seen by everyone who shares these concerns. Maybe marginalization can finally be corrected.
