Peter Lorre gives one of his worst performances as a homeowner. The plot has a new government agent built on the footprint of Peter Lorra. When the G-man contacts his killed one of Lorr's agents, the G-man is sent to jail for killing, though everyone knows there is more to the story. Lorre has a man who has been discharged and brought to the island where there are mining diamonds. Lorre wants to know what our hero knows, but he does not speak and the battle of wills is set in motion. This is a good solid little thriller that isn't very good. sense of conspiracy wise, but still the film keeps your interest. Last night I gave the movie to use it as something I could drift, instead I found the fairy rivet enough to be another 70 minutes. Lorre is why you fall into it. His pretty much stands out. He does very little, but it is clear from his commands and the way everyone reacts to him (watch him light cigarettes), he is a bad dude. It's worth checking if you should run through it.
