Brysomme Mannen is one of the best films of all time and is about a person trapped in a world where there are no senses, no feelings, no love, no truth and certainly no freedom. A world in which people are afraid when someone speaks with their mind, expresses or displays affection, a world where no one is Free and no one has any idea what it means. Just like the world we live in, the world in Den Brysomme Mannen is a world of lost souls that it seeks to fulfill, but they focus on the complete opposite of what fills them, materialism, social acceptance and average satisfaction. Den Brysomme Mannen deserves the full attention of every human soul because we all could enjoy the fresh call of Wake Up.
