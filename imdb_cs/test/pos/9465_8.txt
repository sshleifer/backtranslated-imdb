I have to be honest, I really had a good time watching him be a man. Despite being a typical teenage comedy, or if you switch the film about sex, it was pretty decent laughs that I think someone might get. Adults and adolescents would still enjoy this movie. Amanda Bynes is your typical rebellious teenager who dresses and acts like a guy, and when he is refused to try the boy's football team, he decided to take on the look of his brother to prove that he was worthy of being boy's football team. Of course, love turns out to meet another guy who thinks she's her brother. She also has a girl who is following her. Well, the tag line says it all. <br /> <br /> This is a fun little teen drama that I think will remember for a while. Amanda Bynes has done something in the movie, it's really hard to really act like a guy. : D Well, it's true! <br /> <br /> 8/10
