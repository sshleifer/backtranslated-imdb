the first real movie this year. amazing long shots, sometimes with a fixed camera, so specific to Nordic cinema (leave Dogma aside). The real movie I found. Athmospherique :-) Simply pleased with all my senses and keep in mind how the picture scenario when trying to kill. This is what I do not think will stand on the whole plot. Why, if it were an ideal world, couldn't you die, but still keep your conscience? Either there was a real world with "tailor-made" rules or it was a "fantastic" world, but in this case there could be no accidents like the people who remembered how it was before. It reminded me of Kafka and perhaps more, Huxley's Brave New World, especially in the part where sex was actually available to all because it was seen as a right to pleasure. She lacked a plot, but I think it was better because you realized and felt all the strange behavior of everyone, the absurdity and the lack of real feelings in this "happy" world. I think also that the end was brilliant. the real world is really homo lupus, you're eating if you're not strong enough.
