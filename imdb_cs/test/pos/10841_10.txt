The adaptation of Andrew Davies to Sarah Waters was excellent. The characters of Nan and Kitty were famously portrayed by Rachael Stirling and Kelley Hawes respectively. The whole series was a pleasure to watch. He captured the imagination of all members, whether straight or gay. I wish it could be a sequel!
