Not too many top is a classic "top gun" or "Independence Day" when it comes to fighter jet excitement. Yes, the film above is based on a truly imaginary example of how anyone can download a rescue, but it's cool because it violates all the traditional rules. The boy does what he wants to do in the nozzle the way he wants to do it. I can't really put my finger on what I like about this movie, but others know that seeing the film feels just like me. I think it's basically a lot of fun, but maybe a little unrealistic to be bought by some. Again, regardless of the fact that I loved it, the people I know saw it, they loved it, so it was definitely worth it to decide for themselves. That's how it was, I thought Top Gun was one of the best fighter pilots ever and I like this movie, if not more than the Top Gun. Don't miss it, it's a really inspiring movie.
