So funny is the perfect way to describe this 12 minute spoof of the original Star Wars. Hardware wars are incredibly funny. It is presented as a trailer space epic hardware war. The joke is this: imagine Star Wars playing bad actors and incredibly bad special effects. The characters include "intergalactic boy-miracle" Fluke Starbucker, "ace mercenary and intergalactic wise guy" Ham Salad, Darph Nader, "villain" and many other fantastic characters. It's impossible to not laugh when you look at this treasure in 12 minutes. It's stupid, but it's fun. You'll laugh from start to finish, and you'll feel the need to watch it over and over and over and over again ... And you'll laugh every time you see it! 10 of 10. The funniest 12 minutes. You'll believe it took a minute!
