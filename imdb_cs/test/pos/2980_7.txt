I haven't seen this movie since it came out in the theater, and I've been looking for it ever since. At that time I was 12 and the story excited me; and NOW, the end escapes me. It was a young love that impressed me most, not to mention John's vocals and Taupin's lyrics. The story (at the time) hit my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental films and still in my head after 35 years - it's so good. Place yourself in an adolescent age and let your imagination run. If this movie wasn't your curiosity, then you were too old. I look forward to seeing it again (even at my age)! If there is nostalgia in your place, I'm sure it's an interesting movie you can see. It's innocence is simply overwhelming and it's simplicity is so easy and enjoyable.
