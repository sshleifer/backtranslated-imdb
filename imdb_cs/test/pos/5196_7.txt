This film is basically a very well-produced production and gives a good impression of the war situation and its effects on those involved. To change it is always interesting to see the story from the "other" party. This film focuses on a group of German soldiers who, after fighting in the North Africa campaign, are sent to Stalingrad, Russia, where they are fighting for one of the best known and bloodiest battles of World War II. It's interesting to see the other side of this battle, because we've always only seen the Germans as "villains". In this film, these "villains" receive a human face and voice, and you realize that the only real enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those you are fighting with. Initially, it is hard to focus on film, because you always have in mind that the Germans are evil rascals. But of course you get used to it quickly and soon you will adapt the Germans as the main characters of the film and you will even start to care - and be interested in them. <br /> <br /> But this story is not the best. It's hard to follow the story occasionally as it jumps from one sequence to another. The film is not always the logic in its narration and features a little too many sequences that remain too vague. It is also mostly difficult to keep characters apart and see who is who. This is not always making this movie easy to watch, but than again on the other hand, there are plenty of sequences and moments present in this movie to make it worthwhile and interesting, just not the most coherent one around. In this respect, Hollywood movies are always better than European films. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are high and have some good looking sets and locations, even though the movie wasn't filmed in Russia itself. It helps to create a good time situation during the war. The character is usually an interesting, though perhaps a tad bit formulation. But I don't know, for some reason, formal characters always work in war movies and strengthen drama and realism. It also helps to play actors. All actors are not the best known actors in the area (Thomas Kretschmann was still an unknown actor at the time), but each of them fits well with their role and gives their characters a unique face and personality. Overall, it's not the best or most consistent World War II drama, but it's definitely worth a look, given the original approach of the German side of the Battle of Stalingrad and good production values. / 10
