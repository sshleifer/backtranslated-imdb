[Contains SPOILERS !!!] <br /> <br /> Garfield and his owner Jon Arbuckle were in heat. Basically, they had no life at all. All they did was lie and count the ceiling tiles. Jon even organized his sock drawer by color and fabric. He needed life. So he looks at a book on the subject that tells him to meet a woman. The singles bar was a great place to start. Unfortunately, when the music started and Jon hit the dance floor, we see what made the disco dying: Jon killed him. Jon tried to pick up the girls in the video store. His mouth was finished. Literally. Laundry wasn't even a prize when Jon and his date could see their underwear. Jon tried to act on the beach, but he soon became angry with the real guy Jon had left in his mouth. Literally. Jon then tried to pick up the girls who walk and run. No. Jon pulled out his guitar and sang the blues. Unfortunately, when he mentioned that his cat was fat, a fat man came out and stamped on Jon's guitar. It was hopeless. Fortunately for Jon, TV commercials appeared: Lorenz School for Personality Disabled. It guaranteed a lifeless person to enjoy life in a few simple steps. Jon and Garfield attend class. The building didn't look exactly like she did on television, nor did Lorenzo feel as if he was on television. Jon was sitting next to a pretty girl named Mona. So while Lorenzo taught his lessons how to imagine, control your pulse and pretend to speak a foreign language, Jon and Mona get to know each other. Together they leave and forget Garfield. At home Jon and Mona sat on the porch and chatted. Garfield was jealous of Mona for fear of taking Jon from him. Garfield envisioned the future: Jon and Mona got married, and a little Arbuckle was born, who was delighted with Garfield's story. Back to the present, Garfield wouldn't be worth it. He tried to get Jon to get rid of Mona until he scratched his ears. But then Jon learned that Mona was allergic to cats. So it was basically the end of their relationship. But they still saw each other and Garfield was sure he would be with them. <br /> <br /> Another funny Garfield TV special! This was made during the run of TV Garfield and Friends. Garfield sank a little down. Somewhat. From the early 1980s cartoon. Jon's scenes trying to pick up the chicks is funny, so that's where the fat guy stamps on Jon's guitar. Good ol 'Lorenzo Music is back as Garfield. Thom Huge is Jon. Frank Welker (Third Man 1000 votes) is Lorenzo. And June Foray is a Mona. If you like Garfield, then I suggest you see Garfield today! That, together with Here Comes Garfield, and Garfield in the City, have just been released on DVD! Look at them today! You are guaranteed a good time. Hey, has Garfield left you before? <br /> <br /> -
