I really liked this movie. If other people want it on average around 5.0 / 10, it's their choice. I would give it 10/10. The performance of Sutherland as a private eye is absolutely amazing. The story is amazing, human, exciting, intelligent. Dialogue is good. The story doesn't have to be perfect, but anyway - the mood of the movie is good enough to compensate. In addition, the end is incredibly cool and their jig-saw puzzle really comes back. So I liked it anyway. I also thought the female lead actress was playing very well. I'm not a big fan of detective movies, but this was really good because it doesn't give a damn about supernatural conventions.
