His music, especially what we hear about her, is very slow. Since Bach's death, composers have worked on ways to move slower and slower: more than a century later, Wagner and then Mahler wrote songs that are as slow as possible to get music. - Of course, one can cheat by writing a 4/4 march and then specifying the tempo, say, semiquaver = 1, but the pace would not be the right pace. Wagner and Mahler wrote the music that is PROPERLY played at the snail's pace. Since slowness does not sound too slow in any sense "snail pace" is a bad expression. A critic wrote the famous Wagner conductor, "He does not beat the time, he defeats eternity." T For all I know it was considered a compliment. I feel that around the beginning of the seventies directors have devised how to make the slowest possible movies: "Death in Venice" and "Solyaris" ". I very much prefer the former. For one thing," Solyaris "steps through a line, or some line, and becomes soporious; "Death in Venice" keeps from beginning to end. Nothing happens, but it all happens in the right order, at the right pace, with the photo you can lose in <br /> By the way, another way to cheat music is to write something that is not I have no pace at all, such music sounds slower, but it's just not necessarily, as many movies feel slow because they lack rhythm and form. "Death in Venice" is not one of them. Beautiful in every respect will remind you of timelessness and impeccable quality. It's a great job.
