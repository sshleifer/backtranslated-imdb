Recently, finally available on DVD (11/11/08), Severo Pérez 'film ... and Earth has not met him (1994) is based on one of the most respected and discussed novels in Chicano literature. Tomás Rivera is ... y no se lo tragó la tierra / ... and the Earth does not absorb it (1972) is still widely acknowledged by many critics and serious readers as the classic Chicano novel. Originally written in the Spanish characteristics of South Texas and also translated into English, Rivera's novel continues as an indispensable presence within the Chicano literary landscape. Perez's film, originally produced as a highly acclaimed American Playhouse PBS production, took some time to be released on DVD. We can only be interested in this matter because its high quality is not a problem. However, the film, and now the DVD, remains, as far as I know, the only film adaptation of any Chicano novel, and it is clearly a tribute to the incredible power of the Earth. This film version also extends extremely deep-rooted nerves, which I say are specifically ethnic, but also generally universal. Doubts about Earth may have arisen because it is too "ethnic", too foreign to the basic American mainstream, too "foreign" artistic india, too limited in economic resources. However, Perez, in my version of art, is very effective in my opinion, combining artistically and creating a sharply etched image of the Chicano migrant collective, which focuses on everyday family life. In terms of production with relatively limited economic resources, her beautiful cinematographic work and scary music far exceed her available funding. Simply watch the film's artistic value (or DVD). In short, the Earth has not met him in the neo-naturalistic manner of misery, suffering and despair of the migrant Chicana workers who follow the harvest north of South Texas to Minnesota in 1952. Local priests bless the losers, crowded the vehicles of these Chicano workers, who can no longer find work in this area and must follow the agricultural footprint of the migrant worker north. This collectivity of Chicana, as well as the depression-era of Joads in Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath, form an epic tide, fueled by economic need, survival instinct, and anxious despair, and barely blinking faith. Tribute to these people on Earth, a collective hero, is a DVD focused on focal families, and the most prominent is the young protagonist in the family, a boy, perhaps twelve. This work then also functions as a bildungsroman. Finally, the viewer's sense of identification is generated through the experience, subjectivity and struggle of the protagonist. Poverty, alienation, child labor, illness (escape and death of pregnancy), discrimination, school absences (the boy's escape from violence against discrimination is spent lying in a beautiful, quiet cemetery). , also symbolically. Worse still, the problematic conflict between the juvenile and his mother goes beyond socioeconomics and political conflict, into deeper spheres of psychology and metaphysics. In a desperate but artistically expressed struggle, the young struggle with their mother, the archetypic Mexican-American traditionalist, the representative of God's will, satisfied with prayer, resignation, comfort and acceptance. A rebellious youth cannot believe in a god who would allow to visit such evil and suffering. How can God be as cruel as he asks, because his little sister is certainly purely innocent to get to the ground with a serious illness? At this point, the boy must overcome obstacles even more daunting than poverty and discrimination. Problems now include death, doubt and despair, and lack of meaning. He has few resources available - the strength of his character, his own will, his intelligence and his strong survival instinct. In this desperate but artistically expressed struggle, an unnamed young man, a central character, feels the need for his lasting, elevated sense of meaning, and the viewer hopes that a renewed and strengthened life force can serve as inspiration to Chicanos and others. This fierce battle uses the device's plot to just touch the original work to bind episodic work together: missing immigrant workers from Mexico who leave no trace of their death, though this DVD does not deal with Mexican but Mexican-American migrant workers Highly existential work: anxiety and despair; search; project focus; and redemption of all under the auspices of free will, despite deterministic socio-economic and religious circumstances. Perez has a long list of credits essentially as a documentarist. His many awards are confirming. Producer Paul Espinosa is also known and was also honored for his work. The 1994 film actually won and earned a number of awards: first place, popular audience at the Santa Barbara Film Festival in 1995; first place at Cairo Film Festival; and a number of other well-deserved awards. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie and DVD, Earth, is the best Chicano movie ever made.
