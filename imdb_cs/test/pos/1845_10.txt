I have to admit I didn't get to see this movie in the theater. As it was released at the beginning of the summer blockbuster season, this cute little movie couldn't help but a little lost in the shade of multi-million dollar special movie effects, could it? "Return to Me" at its core has a beautiful and simple story and is extremely well-managed and written by Bonnie Hunt (who in many major paintings as an actress alone ... along with this!) The charming storyline is beautifully woven with clever comedy and married the excellent performances of veterans and younger actors. <br /> <br /> For those who say David Duchovny really didn't have a good shot when he was out of the game. I agree its form "Fox Mulder". I saw his next film work and is by far the best he could do for himself. Minnie driver is simply beautiful, charming, funny and lively in his role as Grace. Beyond these two leadership positions, you are surrounded by a close family and friends of Grace. Jim Belushi's absolute stitch, Bonnie Hunt's stable and real-life power. But I cannot go without mentioning the talents of Robert Loggie, and dearly abandoned Carroll O'Connor. Ironically, I watched this movie again on the DVD just a day before he died. This was his last film and he gave a performance that his caliber actor could certainly be proud to leave as a final to a great career. Overall, "Return To Me" turned what should still be just a fun love story, and grew into a movie that became one of my favorites! Take the time to rent this ..... it is well worth the effort!
