I have to admit I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. I also didn't expect Samuel L. Jackson to play the slide and sing blue. The Beaver County PA Cinemark often does this. They promote the movies in the lobby, everyone will be excited when you see it, and then they disappoint you not showing it ... 'Syncer (Timberlake) that this movie would show at least a week. But no, at the time, when I remember correctly, MI3 showed up on 3 screens (or some other kind of supposed blockbuster). Like Blues Brothers and Crossroads, this film contains mysticism and legend about what blues music is about. Passion and hard times. Religion and sex. Hell's chases of the past. Redemption. I mean so many elements that get into the blues to make it work. That was just a good story. Of course, not many people will see it because they don't have pirates or dangling spiders. But he's got Samuel L. Jackson ... <br /> <br /> Think about what happens to a Jackson character from Pulp Fiction after going through the country and settling it down as essentially "T". Great and underestimated, but not all good?
