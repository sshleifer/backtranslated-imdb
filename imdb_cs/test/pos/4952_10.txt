Lou Gossett, Jr. is great as 'Chappy Sinclair', a super-pilot of the US Air Force, who is going to rescue a nice but undisciplined "Doug Masters" (Jason Gedrick) son of a captive pilot who is determined to borrow a few F-16 fighters to use save your father from dictator (David Suchet) enemy land enemy. <br /> <br /> Better than 'Top Gun', this aviation air movie has excitement and lots of blasts - you know all the great things you'd like from a contemporary military adventure film. Great music, including Dee Snider from Twisted Sister's 'We Not Gonna Take It' and Excellent King Cobra 'Never Say Die'. <br /> <br /> High! Air force!
