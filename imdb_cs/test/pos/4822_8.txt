This has no relation to Virtual Encounters 1, so it's not really a sequel. These two videos share a general concept of people who have simulated sex through a virtual reality machine. So if you were really fired by the story and dialogue in VC 1 (yeah, right) and expectation of continuing in VC 2, be warned. All actors and actresses are new, but have the same excellent director, Sybil Richards. But like VC 1, you have plenty of beautiful women and lots of great sex scenes that push the envelope to the soft core just as far as you can. <br /> <br /> If you have VC 1 and you liked it, you'll love VC 2. If you don't have one but as really good softcore sex, both.
