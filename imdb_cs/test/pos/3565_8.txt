George Hilton is never interested in me as Franco Nero or Clint Eastwood, but this is a great trip for him. Basically rippin off Django / Man with No Name and doing a damn good job. The opening sequence of this jewel is the classic and cat games that follow are a pleasure to watch. Fans of this genre will be in heaven.
