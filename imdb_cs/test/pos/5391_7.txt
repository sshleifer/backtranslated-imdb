Dallas stars Gary Cooper, Ruth Roman, Steve Cochran, Barbara Payton and Raymond Massey. It is Stuart Heisler's director, the photo is from Ernest Haller & pen duty fell on John Twist. Made from Warner Brothers, Dallas is vividly filmed in Technicolor out of Iverson and Warner Ranch in California. The film is firmly in the face with the film, the film is a return to Western ages that do not exist without prejudice or profoundly profound meanings. On the plot lies the renegade of Cooper's civil war, Blayde "Reb" Hollister, a false death to kill his reputation and free himself for the persecution of brothers who massacred his family. Essentially a routine plot, Twist's story is implicated in the way of many fun and exciting distractions. There is a roll of twists, dandy fashion, horseback riding, shoot outs, a love triangle, vigorous dialogue and nimble little twists to make a piece purely by painting by numbers. Cooper also seems to enjoy, which further enhances the good factor in the offer. It is true that he is not really asked to do more than just a laconic dude on a mission. But when he called for action, he would supply the goods his fans expected during his successful career. Thieves are having fun (especially Steve Cochran's ugly and dopey Bryant Marlow) because each of them has their own little peccadilloes to keep them from excessive blandness. Both ladies of this piece look beautiful and well-held between the machine, while the high production value allows Haller to actually treat the eyes with a fresh Technicolor technique and involve working with the camera around the locations. <br /> <br /> It has the ideals of being an Oater list doing Dallas, something that it simply cannot achieve. However, it is not for lack of effort and the result is pure entertainment that should really be enjoyed on cold winter days when the viewer needs to pick me up. 7/10
