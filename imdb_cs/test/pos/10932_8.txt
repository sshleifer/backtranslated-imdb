"Eagle's Wing" is a pleasant surprise for the film and keeps the viewer interested. I didn't know anything about the British doing them until I read the viewer's comments. I can understand why he won the cinematography award because it was greatly presented and had to look beautiful on a huge theater screen. It seemed to be much more realistic than most Western, how to portray how the West was actually won. As well as the complexity of the characters it represents. The Indian-Sam Waterson character is particularly interesting. He seems to be brutal in the wild environment he is conditioned to, but shows remarkable respect for the fragility he witnesses in the white men and women he encounters. He is neither friendly nor sensitive to these intruders in his country, but he has a limit on his sense of revenge, even compassion, when he is in power and observes the waning white man trying to avenge himself, just like a girl. kidnapping after stagecoach. His character seems complicated, but contrary to the harsh lands he lived in and threatened by these intruders, he is not ruthless in his actions. The spectacular horse that runs is a critical article & It is interesting to notice how the Indian manages it, compared to the figure of Martin Sheen who holds it in his possession and power. "Eagle's Wing" is an unusual western genre that I am not attracted to, but I really appreciated this great offer, which I would rank second only to "A Man Called Horse".
