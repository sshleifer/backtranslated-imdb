On one level, Hari Om is a movie that uses a familiar genre - the road movie - to tell a familiar story: a curious Westerner explores the mysterious east. But in his heart, there are two people, a young French beauty (Isa) who seeks to experience life full and motorized rickshaw driver (Hari Om) with the ambitions of Bollywood, from totally different cultures, their slowly growing attraction to everyone. another, and beautiful crazy chaos that is today India. The gap between them can never be bridged, but the director succeeds in bringing both of them closer to the boundary of the affair without damaging the credibility of the story. India and its people are the essential components of the narrative, and besides the main characters, the roles are played beautifully and convincingly by the locals who were recruited during film production on the road between Indian cities and villages that make up the film environment. One major negative for this viewer: Keystone Kops pursuit near the film is the conclusion of how Hari flees gangsters seeking to collect gambling debt. But the final scenes where Isa and Hari say goodbye are both annoying and unforgettable.
