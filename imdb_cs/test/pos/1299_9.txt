I was focused on not making this movie, and doing nothing for the first 10 minutes or so to get rid of my fear. It starts with two colleges stretching against each other with bad kung fu. Scenario found in many other Korean movies. Ho-hum. Let's add the fact that the story was written by the same person who wrote "On Was Cool" (which was barely passable), and I thought I was for two hours. <br /> <br /> Don't give up so fast! "Romance of their own" was directed by Tae-gyun Kim, who also made "Volcano High" (which I thought was a lot of fun). Anyway, "Romance their own" will soon turn a lot for the better. A high school girl who has just moved to Seoul finds herself in the spotlight of two potential suitors. Every guy has his own merits, and it is not clear which one (if one) would be the right choice. What follows is not your usual teen love triangle. Emotions are complex, and although you do not agree with certain choices or actions as the film evolves, you will surely understand why the characters do it. The film asks about characters and audiences. Who chooses? At what point is one obliged to even decide (and is it unfair to one if it appears to be strung)? After you (or your heart) make a choice, how do you react (and how should you respond) when new information comes to shed new light on the situation? In the end, there is one scene that is very subtle, but it perfectly captures what, in my opinion, would be a real reaction instead of being a "film response". The subtlety is in the character's background scene. Recent events and revelations left him confused and emotionally stunned. Basically, he doesn't know what to do. Instead of "doing something" or looking at everything that is happening in his mouth, he just stares at a fixed point that can't respond at all. It's like someone pulling him out. His reaction came to me and I appreciated the scene. Like most Korean movies, there is a combination of action, bravado, slapstick and melodrama. Korean movies often take a sudden turn (see "Sex Is Zero" for a great example), which may be quite a shock to the uninitiated. Continue and start with this. I like it, love it or hate it, I think most viewers will be able to relate to the actions and reactions of the characters.
