This video was my first performance about Resident, and I couldn't stop playing in the last three days. The visuals are dynamite and more inventive and technically complex than I've ever seen on a big screen or small screen. However, the DVD loses points for unnecessarily adding new music. Original Music Residents is unlike anything else you have ever heard, and it will really tweak your brain in the best possible way. However, the new music is unanimously uninteresting, and in most cases it is somewhat poor compared to some classical songs. Also, the unfinished video of Vileness Fats feels VERY incomplete and I could understand the plot of the story from the extensive reading of notes on the disc. Speaking of disk notes, this DVD contains many cool Easter eggs that are likely to appeal to long-time fans of residents. Tip: search for icons on note pages that should not be there. <br /> <br /> Technically, the drive is one of the best available DVDs. There is virtually no observable pixelization, and only a small edge in strong contrast points. <br /> <br /> Kudos for top notch presentation. This disc deserves your attention.
