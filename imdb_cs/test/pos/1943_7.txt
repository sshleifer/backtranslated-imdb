I went through the channels and had to stop and laugh when I came across this movie. It was so clear about adolescents in the early 1980s, and I called my mom "hahaha, turning to a channel like that and such a baby absolutely looks like a father was a kid". <br /> <br /> Um. Yeah. It turned out that this film is about my dad and his friends. Even without it being freely based on my father's childhood, I'd say watch this movie! It's just ... bizarre, at least, apathy instilled by teens even then. This is a good "human interest" and shows off some strange side of the psyche.
