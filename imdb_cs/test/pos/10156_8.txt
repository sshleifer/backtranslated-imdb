If there's one good thrilling movie, it's one of them. James Stewart sets off for a brilliant performance like the American dr. Ben McKenna, who is on tour in Africa with his wife and son. They stumble at the murder scene and the son of Dr. McKenny is kidnapped a few hours later. <br /> <br /> Before you can say, "Fasten your seat belts," Dr. McKenna is trying too hard to find an assassination attempt and tries to stop. But other people know that it can be dangerous (dangerous for them, it means) and try to get rid of it. Finally, Hank, the son, found himself alive and well. <br /> If you like thrilling movies, it's the one you can watch. <br /> <br /> My score: 8/10.
