Okay, "pretty good" didn't scream, but I was surprised how much I enjoyed Campfire Tales. While classical directors have no idea what the tension is. Spooks just don't jump at you, but directors are constantly building into climatic moments. The film is based on popular urban legends and scary stories. The writers updated these stories fairly well and filmed them so much that the known ends still packed the blow. The best of these shorts are "The Honeymoon" and "People Can Lick Too". "The Locket" was a good ghost story and wrap around "The Campfire" is pretty good too, except that they go for one too many twists at the end. The only unsatisfactory segment is "The Hook", which is fine because it's quite short. Overall, I give it 7 out of 10. It has the tension that is missing from most horror movies today, and the good cast. It may not be rate out there with Halloween and Exorcist, but it's a good little movie well worth the rental price.
