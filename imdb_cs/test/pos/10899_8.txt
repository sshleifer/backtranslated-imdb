"Lonely among us" is definitely one of the best episodes of the first season. The plot, though somewhat confusing, creates a lot of tension, supported by a horrible synthesizer driven soundtrack. This is a typical "extraterrestrial invasion" scenario, but in the end no bad purpose is evolving (death of Assistant Chief Engineer Singh was an accident for me). Two delegated species provide an entertaining picture (the best make-up yet) and finally add a bit of black humor to the series (the last scene). Patrick Stewart apparently enjoys some of his Picard character and explores some new terrain just like Data by acting as Sherlock Holmes (another classic of all time). Special effects are also convincing and director Cliff Bole has done his job well. He is the first to try to compensate for Trois' lack of acting ability by improving her appearance. She looks beautiful in some scenes and the neck of her dress improves her look a lot. Picard's "lightning scene" on the bridge gives him a gentle air of Star Wars "Return of the Jedi" (which is a personal impression, but he made me smile). There is also some playing with the lighting of the corridors (simulating the night on board) and the first moving camera stretching out of Picard as they enter the transport room to get into the cloud ... Nice work. Clever cutting, creating a continuous dialogue through various scenes (Troi's hypnosis message) adds to the impression of a really well-formed TNG episode. The first one, where Wesley Crusher seemed to be almost tolerable ... <br /> <br /> But the end is a bit confusing, just as manufacturers are running out of time. "P for Picard" is a little far more appealing and its return is too simple, but it can be left aside for the many moments that this episode offers ...
