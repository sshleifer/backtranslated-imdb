I've seen this movie about 50 times and it doesn't seem like I would ever get bored. I always look at it with my best friend and it has become almost a tradition for us to look at it almost every month. Every time we see this movie, we are both very emotional and together with laughter and weeping in front of the TV and singing all the songs loudly and finally we always danced. hearts and watching a movie feel like on TV with our own friends. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect! although I have to admit that the story itself is a bit shabby, but the characters, dance, music and even the place where everything is happening, you have forgotten it all and you believe that such things are really happening and that the song you need is love "actually has some meaning. I'm a really normal person and not very serious about this comment, but I can't wait until next time. see Dirty Dancing.
