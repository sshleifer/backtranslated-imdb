In my personal opinion, "Patriot" is one of Steven Seagal's best films. <br /> <br /> I've heard people say it's the worst, it's not like the SS, etc. I disagree. The great master Seagal, as a highly spiritual man, has established a good tradition in action movies. He always has good background, great action, high professionalism and a clever message. This movie has it all. You have good shooting scenes, great aikido. Although not much, it shows us its quiet side. This change in his filmmaking only proves his spiritual growth (at the end he didn't kill Chisolm's friend). "Patriot" is definitely one of the best movies from the filmmaker's look that I have seen lately. You have great panoramic shots of Montana, we see real American nature and beautiful wildlife (among others - horses and flowers). The soundtrack also deserves a few words. During the film, I had a great opportunity to listen to classic American-cowboy music (not Country). Similar music has been heard in "Back to the Future Prt.3". His performances have improved dramatically since his last films. His role is unknown to him (unlike cops and commandos), but he does a good job of playing a retired-to-government. His actions are convincing and his lines are good. <br /> <br /> I was really satisfied with the cast. LQ Jones proves that life and death come to Earth, Whitney Yellow Robe plays a beautiful and clever scientist, Camilla Belle presents herself as McClaren's daughter. Mr. Seagal discusses the debated "Real American" Tradition and militia units that give their own opinion (he likes the constitution well, but chubby bearded men have nothing to do with it). There are also good points about the East-West medicine and nature system. Best is Seagal. And opening up new horizons in his film career. <br /> <br />
