What a wonderful movie, full of eccentric, unique characters that greatly performs a great set. The director has also done a great job of keeping the story together, making the wonderful performance (not to deal with them) and the music (and the wonderful music it is) great. Epatha's starring role is great. I've always heard what a brilliant actor is, and although I liked her right and right, it really shows what she can do with a full, complex role. Macy Gray is amazing, Mos Def, as usual, amazing. Lou Gossett, great. Jimmy Smits, amazing, and doesn't try to focus because he's a star. A real piece of the ensemble. <br /> <br /> Rent it, enjoy it, groove it and check it out. Something special.
