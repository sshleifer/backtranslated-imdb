Just return from the European premiere of The Gamers: Dorkness Rising. The only thing I can say is that if you are a player (CRPG, RPG or LARP) then this movie is for you. And if you're not a player? Well, it's still a lot of fun. Acting is definitely not Oscar-worthy, but it adds to the charm of the entire film element. Humor is everywhere, along with some very nice touches (Gary Gygax's tribute is especially well done if you can see him). The cast is very earthy in its appearance, it is suitable for being ordinary people enjoying an ordinary hobby. <br /> <br /> The sound quality and vision of the film is adequate, but again it all adds to the atmosphere that helps define this movie as a Dungeons and Dragons movie written and executed by players for the player. You are not afraid to use system-specific terminology, yet they are able to allow product placement to be part of the film, but in a very clear and fair manner. It also touches on some of the perceived prejudices that some players may have about other players, and who are quite concerned about it. In all cases, the film is heavily driven by a well thought out balance. character, conspiracy and fun (Bard is incredibly good value for money). Finally, it makes the rating of this movie pretty hard, so I gave it 2 results. > <br /> Scores (for non-RP'ers): 7/10 (A few moments could go over the head, but the main parts of the movie just work so hard and reach much more.) (for RP'ers): 10/10 (Everything fits together, in perfect quantities, and with perfect charm and sentiment)
