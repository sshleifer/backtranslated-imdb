I think this show was right for me. I was looking at it through the plane, but there were parts in the movie that forced me to control myself from where I was tearing. The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane lane was very believable (a fantastic game on both sides)! I loved Diane lane's daughter. She showed maturity and as she transformed throughout the show it was easy to believe that what a teenager could be like in real life. <br /> <br /> I loved this show from start to finish. We definitely recommend it for romantic people out there!
