A while ago, I watched Paul Thomas Anderson's video in which he expressed a great interest in porn movies and how the industry could produce better films and, as a result, a complete genre and not just sex on videotape. Paul Thomas Anderson gave his own belief in the porn industry in the character she played in the amazing Burt Reynolds tour. His name is Jack Horner, the director whose biggest dream is to create a "real" movie that can keep the viewer in tension as a result of a great dramatic story and exciting beauty? and with "big cocks and breasts". Soon as he meets Eddie Adams (Mark Walhberg), he believes he has found a new star for his films. And so the story of young Eddie in the porn industry begins. The film begins with a nightclub sequence where we see all the people who will be part of Eddie's life and later see them outside the porn industry, living their daily routine. But soon we'll see them inside the porn industry and the story of the new Eddie, the story of Dirk Diggler, will start after one party. All of them will be able to enjoy real success with Dirk as the star, winning a lot of prizes and helping Jack make his greatest dream with the series of Brock Landers films, the new Dirk character. This kind of exploitation film is a great success, and for Jack, his first "real" movies. But here's the beginning of the end and the beginning of the "horrible 80's" when Dirk and friends will be $ ex, DRUGS and Rock & Roll. But we all know that excesses can destroy any person, and erectile dysfunction can destroy any porn star, and here the film focuses on its life after overall success and how everyone has a real bad time with a lot of trouble because of a bad company perspective. and on a period with many excesses. In Dirk's decadence, after the attempt and failure in the music industry, there's a brilliant succession that can perfectly build on how things happen for Dirk and his friends. This succession is one of his first drug deal, with Alfred Molina performing, which ends in utter mess. It is funny for us and a terrible experience for Dirk and his friends, but there is always a solution if you go back to what you know and when Dirk is back, Brock is back. Well, I didn't mention most of the characters in my kind of summary, but I have to say that they're all amazingly well developed. The cast is just great with the best performance I've seen with Mark Walhberg. Julianne Moore has powerful performance in a truly moving character; Reilly, Macy, Hoffman, Heather Graham, Guzman, etc. They're just unforgettable, all their characters with funny and sad moments. Finally, I really like Anderson's amazing film style with a unique view of the porn industry in the late 1970s and early 1980s. I said "Magnolia" was my favorite from Anderson, but now that I've watched everyone except "Sidney", I can't say I have a favorite because I love them all! PS: Somewhere I read that this movie is a "Scorsese movie" by Anderson, so I'm more than sure that if you like "Goodfellas" and "Casino", you'll love this too. I f * cking love "Boogie Nights"!
