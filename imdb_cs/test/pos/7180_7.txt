You can't see the same movie if you haven't grown up in France (or have spent at least 10 years there like me). I do not know if this will ever be done outside the French cultural boundaries (this includes Belgium and Luxembourg). You can't translate his kind of fun - every name is a joke (how many people outside Paris would understand the pun in "Couloirdebus", the name of one of the Roman legionaries?). However, Monica Bel (l?) ​​Ucci is so beautiful, I almost forgot to breathe when I saw her.
