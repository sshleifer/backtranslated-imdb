This is the biggest show ever made next to the South Park. I love this show! it's so fun and Peter's laughter is cheerful. You have to look at this show right away for a few people who have never seen this show before. One of my favorite shows of all time. <br /> <br /> If you can, try some of the later episodes, such as the Dream of Jesus, or Nothing. But there was never an episode I didn't like. All episodes are absolutely cheerful. It also has a great satire. There's a lot of clips on it. If you're somewhere near your computer or television, check out as soon as you can.
