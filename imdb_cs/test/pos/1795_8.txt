Seemingly, Hans's isolation and despair is caused by the stereotypically frigid bourgeois mother, annoying wife, and the rejection of a lover. And despite the complicated depiction - Hans himself does not exactly mention these demands - the above must also be an essential part of Fassbinder's thinking (his use of Freud and Marx). But the viewer cannot look beyond Hans's sex and sexism to find the true cause of his crushed spirit. First, it is very unlikely that his mother will not love the pressure to join the Foreign Program. Legion. It was much more likely, and in part suggested, that it was a search for adventure, male friendship (escape from the female world of mother and sister) and the male identity itself - which both the Legion and the war offered. Second, Hans loses his successful job as a policeman because of his own sexism. By working on prostitutes, she not only raises prostitution as a repressive institution, but shows that she cannot even control her sexuality in a professional arena - and is even willing to jeopardize a desirable career. Third, he commits a serious verbal abuse against his wife in front of his male male friends, without distinction between her absence or - when she looks for - the present. In fact, he is more brutal in his presence. A few hours later, in a violent and drunken state, he beats his wife before his daughter, who intervenes for her mother. The horror he puts into her and his daughter are tangible. But both he and the audience continue to bemoan the whim of conscience or protest. Why? Because his wife is cruelly characterized as annoying and sexually promiscuous (yes, this may be Fassbinder's view of what capitalism does to women - owned, insecure and commodity - but it barely removes Hans's brutality or Fassbinder's exploitation of it) in the battery scene). And then there is the pressure of a male role that Hans could choose and refuse and accept instead. It is too short for a man to achieve worldly success that the male role recommends. But how this can be the cause of despair when not only gaining his lost love as a lover, but marrying a tall woman who is substantially more attractive than himself. in the opposite sense, in their house. Not only does this decision show that he is more tied to Harry than to his wife, but that the male bond replaces his love for women. And finally, at the end of his life, because it is Harry's excellent ability and spirit around the house that makes Hans's star fall. Hans, a trader, may be to some extent a victim of capitalism, but rather a victim of his own devotion to his own male identity. His inability to let go is the ultimate reason for his isolation and despair. This is something that is lost, I think not only at Fassbinder, but also at Sister Han, Anna - though, only to some extent lost. For Anna (and Fassbinder's) support of her brother - over her mother, she goes so far. She is quite urgent that only he can save himself - that her support and love cannot in itself end her own hatred. Unfortunately, he does not offer any such support and love to his wife, who must be much more upset than Hans, but who is eventually able to pick up the pieces and save herself and her daughter and show a strong contrast. Han's fall.
