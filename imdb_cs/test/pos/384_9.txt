"Allows the exchange of murderers - your wife, my father" - a seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony and Guy Haines, when they meet on a train trip during lunch. Guy, a solid, decent tennis player whose problem is that his wife, flirtatious Miriam, does not divorce him in order to marry the senators daughter Anna, she laughs as a joke. He is not laughing the next week. In the scene of classical Hitchcock's tension, Bruno goes through Miriam through the carnival and strangles her. Her glasses fall and we see the murder in her lenses bounce twice. Cold and immoral Bruno, his part of the deal, approaches the horrified Guy, who is waiting, and even forces him to "do his bit". The issues don't help when Anne is premature and the open younger sister appears to the suspected murderer Miriam. So accused of a murder he didn't commit and expected to do next, what would Guy do? The power of this film is in the performance of human beings as the murderous side of their nature - and that makes Hitchcock perfect.
