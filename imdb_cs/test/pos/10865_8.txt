I started to watch that I was expecting the worst, I was glad to find that the film was pleasant, slightly confusing in parts like everyone started to sing. It gave me a chance to see Daniel Wu in action for the first time, he's a better actor than I thought, sometimes he seemed to be a little off. I thought the violet storm deserved to get his Hong Kong legends because it differs from most of the other HK movies, it's about men's emotional struggles when confronted with memory loss, it may sound sinister, but when it finally breaks what and what who actually is really making the movie more interesting. Once you get into the movie, you'll find that you are holding it as if you are missing one piece, then a lot of the film will make sense, for example, I missed a bit at the beginning and would recommend to anyone watching it. So I can say that this film is worth watching and a grateful surprise for me that I enjoyed it.
