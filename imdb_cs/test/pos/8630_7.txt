I wanted to see this movie because I am a very huge Abbott and Costello fan, and when I saw it I like it. This movie is fun, not hysterical, but funny. I mean, I laughed at a lot of funny parts and I just enjoyed it. Although it's not the best of Perfect Straight Man and Perfect Buffoon, you should see it when I really love Abbott and Costello. Of all the Abbott and Costello movies I've seen, I can't say I saw the one I hated. This is decent, fun and fun. Abbott and Costello, at least, made pretty decent films in their later years. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie, it's not one of their best, but I like it. <br/> 7/10
