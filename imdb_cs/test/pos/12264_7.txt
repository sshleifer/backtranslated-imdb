James L. Brook is one of those directors who always look at life with a strange look. He is not just a producer for "The Simpsons," he has some classic comedies under his belt - "Broadcast News" is one of them. Although it does not match his later efforts "As good as it gets," "Broadcast News" is still a very clever, humorous and witty movie about the television broadcasting station and all the problems they suffer. There is a great comic sequence of physical humor where Joan Cusack runs around the building trying to rush the tape of news to the newsroom within minutes of being broadcast live on TV. This is not only very true when it comes to how hectic broadcasting stations are run, but also the skillful and honest portrayal of human beings. Low, fine film with good acting (especially from Hurt, whom I don't always like) and apt direction.
