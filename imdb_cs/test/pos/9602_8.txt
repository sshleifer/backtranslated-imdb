Airplane apart, I don't think I ever laughed at the movie so much in my whole life. I like football as crazy, but I tend to hate almost all the songs or movies about football as they tend to be unrealistic. It was not. Once I watched it, it was more than 2 years and it was great. Everyone I know loved it. I remember homosexual physiotherapy, a 45 degree pitched pitch, and 'Shoes' (a player so named because he once appeared on a new pair of training sessions). Brilliant, that's what's going on in the football park. <br /> <br /> Certain 10/10. If somebody from the TV industry reads it, taking all the bullshit you repeat on an English calf, please let it show you again (and the Muppets when you're on it). Also, does anyone know if it was shown on BBC or ITV. I think it was ITV, so it's worth asking them if they want to show it again. They should do it.
