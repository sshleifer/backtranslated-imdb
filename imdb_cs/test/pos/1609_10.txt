A story of strange love and desire for a fall. A poem about beauty and its perfection, fear and touch. Slice of Visconti, Mahler and Mann. And the torturous Venice. I don't know if it's a masterpiece, a poem or a reflection of the film director's world. It's absolutely "memento mori". and exploring illusion. Old mirror limits, signs and delicacy of death. Trip in the old space, nostalgic, cruel and gorgeous. "Death" is a copy of Orfeu's journey in immediate reality. And the essence is music. Soft, sweet music like honey or winter fire. Like every regret and every grief. As a refuge in deep solitude. Gustav is gay. He is the Researcher of the Last Form of God's Presence. Beauty, the beauty that gives the meaning of life, which is both sin and virtue, the gift of expectation and suffering. He dies because he has the right to hope, to believe in the reality of miracle and in a way. Sacrifice? In any case! Only Tadzio can give freedom as an insignificant sacrifice. Who saw that the sun could hope to live in the same state?
