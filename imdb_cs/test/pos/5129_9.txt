I thought it was a really great movie, especially since it was a jut filler for me. I was bored, I got it from the library and I really enjoyed it! I watched it twice in two days and the more I looked at it, the more I liked it. I thought the plot would be really scaly, but in the end it would be true. I liked the main characters and thought they were well occupied and you can see real friendship. I thought everyone was doing a great job. The end was good. And you really hate those guys and you really like good guys. What is the movie to be.
