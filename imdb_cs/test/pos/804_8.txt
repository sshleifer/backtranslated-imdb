Immediately after moving to his new cottage in the English country, Hercule Poirot gets an invitation to dinner from Sir Henry and Lady Angkatelle, the owners of a large estate in the area. But the next day, one of the guests is found shot by the pool, and his clumsy wife holds a revolver a few steps away .... <br /> <br /> This Agatha Christie secret is somewhat thin, though the killer plan is still very clever. It is an excellent filmmaking and cinematography that elevates the story to a higher level. This episode mostly holds the serious tone of "five small pigs" and "sad cypress", but contains more dark humor than they do. The cast includes perhaps the two most famous actors who worked on the series with this point, Edward Fox (as a servant) and Sarah Miles (as Lady Angkatell), although standout performance is given by the dazzlingly beautiful Megan Dodds as forward - Henrietta: her one-on-one confrontation they sparkle with Suchet and are the highlight of the film. Oh, and since the English Police Inspector got involved, I think they could bring Philip Jackson back to this. (***)
