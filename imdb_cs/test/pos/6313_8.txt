While I totally agree with the previous commentary on Toni Servillo's amazing acting as Titty Di Girolamo, I would also like to add some beautiful filming and assembly that will turn this film into a picture. Young director Paolo Sorrentino had the courage to experiment with different types of camera techniques that reminded me of Darren Aronofsky's' Requiem for a Dream. Both used the same MTV-style filming combined with modern (alternative / techno) music, so the movie? Le Consequenze dell'Amore - stands among other crime / mafia movies in its genre. Although the film can start at a very slow pace of almost "sec" compared to faster Hollywood productions, it should look forward to its serenity, amazing character and wonderful ending. You must definitely see people who like European / Italian cinema. PS Toni is still behaving like this, we need an addition.
