This trio of 30-minute short films on homosexual-related topics is being honestly done. The story of every age takes place with pleasant charm and naturalness. This film deserves to be widely distributed and readily available. However, it is not. I had to order my copy of the video; none of the local video stores or even libraries had it in stock.
