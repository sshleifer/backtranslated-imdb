Why this film was released in only four states is behind me. I thought this movie was a divine story. The name says it all: Other people's vision. This movie has more logic than laughter, which I suppose why it works so well. Common sense also makes an appearance in what would seem to be another sexual sex comedy. Alice cools down in winter when she feels irrational about the way she can perform for her fianc√©, not only sexually, but also as a partner and friend, etc. of them. One fling after another leads to problems as if it were not a bad idea from the beginning. Witty dialog and comic set-up to make this funny as hell! Nicholson and Mohr set the tone of the film early and followed the promise they had expected. Other attractions include Lauren Graham, Andy Richter and Helen Slater (in her first theatrical film in 10 years!). Climax begins taking a crazy turn, but a simple ending makes this one far more enjoyable than most movies today. Mohr fans will see something different in his character Ed and Helena Slater fans will enjoy her shiny moments of fast but excellent return. Any Richter will take home a prize for most of his moralistic character. Romantic and funny or just fun. Seeing other people is a gem to be noticed.
