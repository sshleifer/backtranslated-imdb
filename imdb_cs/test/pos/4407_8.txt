I first saw "The Knowledge" during the Thames Television marathon at one of the local independent stations in Los Angeles when it was new. I liked it very well along with the danger of UXB. That the movie I saw more than twenty years ago should stick to my memory so well is a testament to its originality and quality of cast performance. . I was looking for a DVD copy in the US and I didn't find any. I finally bet and bought a British DVD from Ebay and I was glad it had no region code. So those of us who would like to see this little gem can get a copy.
