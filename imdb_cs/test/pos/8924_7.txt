This film was clearly an early attempt at a new director, but he still managed to be original and entertaining, as in some moments of provocative thoughts. However, I have to say that the story would not even have happened without Paul Anthony's star performance as Pipa. He made well written parts very trustworthy and influential, and the more weakly written parts were much more tolerant. I also have to mention Alan Cumming's performance. It was refreshing to see him in that part. He brought weight to his role, which provided a very grounding element of the film. As for Paul Anthony: Who's the guy? Why didn't I see him more? Someone will give him more roles, please!
