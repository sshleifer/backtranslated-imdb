I've seen so many bad reviews at Supervivientes de los Andes that I felt compelled to (or at least try). First, of course, it looks out of the day, it was done in the seventies with a very low budget, but it is part of its magic. I like contemporary films, but also the old ones for what's worth. I am not the one who feels the urge to see or enjoy modern treatment and effects movies; besides, almost every film enthusiast likes old-fashioned movies (who don't like movies from El Santo or Plan 9 from space, regardless of overall quality?). In terms of pace, it's just a tool to cover (again) it's a low price, and I think constant dialogues are in the order of better character and evolution of the situation. Sure, Alive has a better FX, but for that I won't despise the old one, and I don't feel quite attracted to English speakers in action involving people from Uruguay and for me who give the Supervivientes de los Andes. It's as if, even if Canoa, since the 1970s and the real event too, had a better remake of the advancement of technology, but I think I would stick to being based on the emotions it offers, regardless of the date of production . All of this is based on the impact he had on me because I first saw that he was on TV and nowadays I don't think he would lose some of his original strength. Of course it's been a long time and I've seen a lot of better movies in every aspect of the movie, but it doesn't diminish its true value. It's not a bad movie, and I'll put it over Alive without hesitation. Just do it.
