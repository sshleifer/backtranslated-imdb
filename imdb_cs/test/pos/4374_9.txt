This is unfortunately Carlin's last recorded HBO concert from a series that lasted over 30 years. Although it may not be his "best" job, it is an excellent, funny and provocative mindset. The recording is also a bit different from most other gigs, which are slightly longer than most other gigs. During his long, fruitful and influential career, Carlin has moved away from more observational humor and fart jokes, towards a "more humanitarian" view of society and culture. His focus on English language and euphemism has grown over the years and culminates in this performance. Although, I would argue that his audio book "When Will Jesus Bring Pork Chops?" best displays his huge joke with regard to language, euphemisms and the breakdown of our values. It's bad for Ya is quite indicative of his long transformation from comic to writer. <br /> <br /> If you are offended by a nasty language or dishonor of the Church, you will probably not be like any of Carlin's materials. However, if you are looking forward to mental stimulation and you can tolerate tongue and blasphemy, you might like this concert a lot.
