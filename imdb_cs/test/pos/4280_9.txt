Those who dislike this film seem to think that someone close to them "belongs" and must be liquidated if they leave with someone else. Fortunately, human nature is much deeper than this; Loving someone deeply inevitably brings suffering - even if we are lucky only at their death. This film is true in the ambience, atmosphere and dialogue with Nigel Balchin's original novel (The Path Through the Forest), and by identifying a seemingly irreconcilable dilemma captures the silent despair that lies behind many seemingly idyllic lives (and the portrayal of the English life in the upper class is very accurate). <br /> <br /> I loved the movie and hope to appear soon as a UK-compatible DVD
