This is one of those movies where I just want to move my legs and dance around the house. It's a very positive and happy kind of music. The film has some sad parts, but mainly music is what I like. Gary Busey did a great job like Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly continued his journey to the pastor, his parents and Nashville record producer didn't tell him. Buddy Holly didn't give up what he liked. I didn't know much about Buddy Holly until I was watching this movie. I was in the Surf Ballroom where he last played but didn't pay much attention to it until I saw this movie. It's an incredible movie with lots of fun so you can get to your feet and watch this movie.
