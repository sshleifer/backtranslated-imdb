I had a new feeling after watching this movie. I watched a movie in which the main actor introduced a performance that almost competed with the Chevy Chase legend in 'Fletch'. This does not mean that the performances are comparable, but both provide virtually flawless delivery of their lines. The actor is Marc Singer! The singer is Jack Ford, the 'Droid Gunner' title, breaking a vivid collection of rewards on androids. ...... it really doesn't matter. This film depends on the dry way Singer delivers his lines, resulting in painful humor! What matters to this film is that director Fred Olen Ray realizes that serious science fiction rarely works, and when your budget is modest, it's best not to take it seriously. Olen Ray said that everyone who participated in this film had great fun and this movie transfer. I dare to criticize a film that allows the futuristic Earth to be depicted as eternally dark and neon, and then ends in "tubes and valves". 'stock. Custom parody is a very redeemable quality. To sum up, Fred Olen Ray is the ambassador for independent filmmaking and Marc Singer the perfect B-film lead. If only Olen Ray could design Tim Thomerson to the equation, then we would have a movie on our hands.
