What I can say, this movie is amazing. It has its drawbacks, as every film makes for example shaky tombstones in a cemetery, a clearly visible slide image during the Death Penguin scene, Max Shreck loses his heavy coat in a split second between shots during a picture of the consulting scene, batman loses his black eye makeup at once between The shots so that Bruce Wayne Catwoman can reveal the dialogue is recorded, but is played and spoken differently than when it was said first and finally Catwoman suddenly knows how to use whips without any training. these shortcomings are compared to some that you would see, for example, in batman forever, where there is obviously a puzzle apparently waiting for his cue or val Kilmer's hair to alternate between shots. <br /> <br /> 8/10 is a great performance because the performances are absolutely amazing. Michael Keaton repeats his role as Batman and has a lot more in this movie. He looks more comfortable in the role, a second time and is on par with the villains' performances. Danny Devito is the perfect penguin. I really like the transformation of a penguin into a grotesque penguin instead of a threatening character from a comic book or a TV show, because now the character is more in depth and has a more interesting story that is based on the family's basic needs and feels accepted and in demand. this gives us an evil character with whom we feel compassion because he was rejected for being what he is, which is not his fault. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as Catwoman. She is sleeping and sexy and she is also a villain we can regret because of the way she is a victim. Christopher Walken is a great secondary villain and is so interesting in character, even though he is not even in the batman universe. The soundtrack is much better than the first one and Danny Elfman gets more chances to show this time from his musical talents. The sets are amazing. They are detailed, engaging, sinister, Gothic, unique, dark, and many other adjectives can describe how amazing they look. The costumes and makeup are great, and of course a lot of work went into making and all the work pays off because the Batsuit is better, the cat suit is awesome to look at and the penguin makeup and effects are so compelling. Penguins look really realistic and play well. The script is really good and the story is, in my opinion, plausible. overall, given all these factors, this film deserves 8/10 and stands as my favorite of all Batman movies
