I remember watching it when it was done, and I think it was brilliant at the time. I've been watching him for the second time twenty years later, and I still think Traffik is great and much better than an American film based on this drama. tomorrow politicians who think they can win the drug war, because the issues raised in this film are as relevant today as they were at the end of the 1980s, and if they do not change their policies, it will be another 20 years. <br /> <br /> Well written, well done, beautifully crafted and great shot. The idea of ​​provoking drama that entertains while bringing to light some of the hard realities of drug trafficking.
