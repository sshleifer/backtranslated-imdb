Renowned Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský, known mainly in North America for his starring Jakob in the original Estonian German / Czech production of Jak Lhár (Jakob, der Lügner 1974), gives us the last brilliant performance as an 80-year-old joke who refuses to admit he is dying. Jiri Hubak's script is excellent. Funny, moving and well developed. He explores both the subject of advanced aging and the motivation of characters who are uncertainly strong and fragile, happy and dissatisfied. Frantisek (Vlastimil Brodsky) and his best friend Ed (Stanislav Zindulka) on all types of shenanigans and make sure to make the best of their dying days. Meanwhile, Francis is preparing for their death, saving their funeral money and punishing Francis for his infinite childhood and irresponsible attitude. Their son is going to bring his flat and put them in a retirement home, but Frantisek doesn't want to hear any of this. He wants to enjoy life and laugh. He wants to help and love and give ... but at what price? This great film by talented director Vladimir Michalek is certainly charming and witty. Thinking about how we live our lives and why we live our lives. It brings a simple story of a charming, stubborn old man to the fore and allows us to think and feel what our lives are all about. After an active career of more than 40 years, it's a bit nasty. Knowing that Vlastimil Brodsk died in April 2002, no longer in a bout of terminal cancer. However, it is uplifting to think that he had a chance to be part of such a moving scenario and to be the catalyst of this era for the joyful age that even in the North American repertoire did not begin to create the waves to create. cinema. After the international success of Jan Hřebejk's "Divided Fall (2000)", it becomes clear that Czech cinema really has something to offer the world. At least he must see this film.
