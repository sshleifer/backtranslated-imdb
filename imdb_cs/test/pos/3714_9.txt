Based on the story of William Faulkner, two soldiers are a top short film, a film that has enough stories, emotions and great cinematography for a feature film and definitely doesn't want you in the end. The story includes two dirty poor Mississippi brothers, one single child, another old enough voluntarily for war effort shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The younger brother, playing brilliantly with rookie Jonathan Furr, doesn't want to let his older brother go and embark on a journey to get into the army alone. Ron Perlman gives grumpy but touches performance as an army colonel who has decided to help a boy. Because it is only 39 minutes long, this gemstone will be hard to find (it will most likely be limited to the festival circuit now), but remember the name Aaron Schneider - this picture marks him as a director who is looking.
