Maybe this movie was supposed to be just funny. Maybe it meant that teenage boys would be thrilled with nudity. But what I got from it was actually something that many people believe. And that's "Nice guys end last". In Angel Heart is Lisa Bonet's character who says: she takes a bad ass to make girls beat faster. Probably. Women always say they want flowers and sweets and courtesy and whatever. But (at least at an early age) they end up on a good-looking, slimy, disrespectful, indomitable boy. The one they know they can't adapt to their beliefs. And that is part of the attraction. After all, what's exciting about a guy who's the way you want him to be? I believe it could have happened to Boaz Davidson. And what he has in this movie, which is disguised by sex and nudity and parties, and everything else teenagers can do is break your heart. It happens to everyone and it happens to you. And this is a strong final statement in the movie. But when I said it all, the movie is fun. It's funny and it shows that it's a super-schoolgirl pretty well. It is a rare film that is calm enough to please a teenage crowd that will satisfy but at the same time be intelligent and touching to show what it is. he wanted your heart to break. No high school movie ever did it better. As I said, I think writers had to experience a situation like this first hand. Maybe we all have one. This is an old movie, but if you've ever come across it to collect dust on a shelf in a local video store one night, pick it up, you might be surprised. It's a hell of a lot better than never been kissed.
