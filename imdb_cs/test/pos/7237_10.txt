Yes!! They finally got to perfection. What a great idea, a refreshing epic for X generation, whether it knows it or not. After disasters like Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD, and as he got on the market, our hero, Lloyd Kaufman, decided to go after him, stop supplying the distributors and let Tromo be the Tromo he could be. Lloyd would make him the most dangerous, noble and utterly cheerful movie Troma. This time Lloyd takes Shakespeare's love story, turns it out, Tromatizes it and adds that long, lost, fun values ​​that have always been missing. Fun value, like Lemmy Kilmister (narrator), Debbie Rochon (cook), Joe Fleishaker (fat guy) and of course brutal mutilation and toilet humor. Tromeo and Juliet are the definitive release of a rather bland story and crown jewel of the Troma universe. <br /> <br /> Years ago in Tromaville, NJ business partners, Monty Que and Cap Capetet are starting a film company called Silky Films that would probably produce tasteful, soft core films. Monty considers Capa to be his friend, but Cap is out of the question to eliminate the poor shoot from his share in the company. On paper and in books, Monty seems to have freed his life work for free. Fast forward to Manhattan in the mid-1990s, we have two families that are extremely dissatisfied with each other, to the point that they are looking for a reason to take a limb or, most preferably, a life. Monty has a son, Tromeo, nephew, Benny, they, with their boyfriend, Murray Martini, who is just a little excited about all the bloodshed, leads a war with incest Capulets, except Monty, he's too drunk to care for. As in the original, there is a confusing situation that leads Tromeo to fall on Capo's daughter, whom he never met, and never knew about. Unfortunately, Cap is a sadistic pervert who, unlike Trome's father, has something for a bottle, and of course this would make Dad's little Chenshaw melon physically, emotionally abused and harassed and kept in Plexiglas, off and on, Depending on how the mood of Cap's mood is in. Cap is also forcing his vegetarian daughter to marry London's Arbuckle, a billionaire butcher who would do no one dissatisfied, with or without a raisin loaf. With all the inconveniences, young lovers believe that eloping would be the best decision, but how does this effect provoke a great controversy? It could, or maybe not, go somewhat like an original, but to figure out how this is going to happen just won't happen, you'll never see it. <br /> <br /> "The One with Leo" is just as sleepy compared to Tromeo & Juliet, but if it's watered, oversized, big budget, Hollywood, Garbage is what you've been programmed to go to , and then do it all, but if you're in the mood for something a little more varied, something that really packs a punch, and doesn't follow a "normal" movie pattern, and if you have a somewhat abnormal sense of humor, then it may hate that movie. Tromeo And Juliet gives finger to everyone who is mainstream. Full exploitation with as many medieval humor as anything from young John Waters. Along with some badass acting, Tromeo and Juliet boast a tremendous score that includes the legendary Motorhead, and not to mention that much of what James Gunn provided has brought it together. For more of James Gunn's glamor, look at Lollilove, and for Lloyd Kaufman's perfection, look at his next vision, Terror Firmer. Tromeo And Juliet is a stubbornly exploitable exploitation for the 1990s brought by one and only King of B movies. Thanks, Lloyd. 10/10
