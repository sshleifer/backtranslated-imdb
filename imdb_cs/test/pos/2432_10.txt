This film is a very nice homage to Bogart and other old detective films. Robert Sacchi doesn't play like Bogie and Michelle Phillips is really timeless beauty like Gena Anastas. However, the most remarkable part of this film includes the longest belly dance scene ever made in Hollywood film. One well-known professional instructor noted that nothing else in the cinema would bring dance excitement closer. The scene, which ends up as an important part of the conspiracy, takes place in a lush, beautiful nightclub in the Middle East and is charming. Vibrant music, swirling veils and ringing finger cymbals, free-flowing ripples and beautiful costumes - and a surprising twist involving the seductive Sybil Danning - build tension and excitement to the very end. Three talented dancers with a beautiful, professional nightclub are led by the exotic beauty of Kamala Almanzara, one of the leading belly dancers in the United States since the mid-1970s. She was a hand-picked famous Armenian musician Guy Chookoorian traveling with his orchestra on the road. Guy's ensemble is a live band that dancers perform in the scene. If you look at the trailer on this page, you will see Kamal's view (playing finger cymbals for Sybil Danning). <br /> <br /> If you are not yet a belly dance fan, you will be following this movie, and if you are a fan, it keeps it well after repeated viewing.
