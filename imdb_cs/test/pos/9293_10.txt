This show is there with the best Comedys made in Australia because it makes fun of almost what is what many of our public wants. Some of the best pieces on the show are a road test that tests how real life advertising is going on. What is really great about the show is how original it is and the fact that it has people (persecutors) who love to do what they do and who doesn't. This show has a lot of pieces that anyone can challenge as a road test I have already mentioned, Mr. 10. Questions where 10 questions really ask fast before famous celebrities like Hugh Jackman and Beach Boys, temporary. as The Chasers Emmys and those that have been there from the beginning, as we have learned from this week about current affairs. Overall, I rated a thin show of 98%.
