I probably watched the movie 4 or 5 times. Every time I become more and more amazed at how far the wishes of the young heart can go, and by the power of Kai and Gertha to fight for what they believe. And the whole story is presented in such a way, you just need to convert to the land and before you know it you're there. you can see ... yeah, there's kai ... working hard on the mirror ... little jump .... there's gertha, fighting for her love ..... and there is the snow queen ... <br / It's just an amazing blend of love, adventure, tension. it's amazing 10 out of 10
