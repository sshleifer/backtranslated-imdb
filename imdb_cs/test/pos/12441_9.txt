This film is undoubtedly the clearest example of British humor that the Germans do not understand. The single-liners run rampant in the film spawning one of the largest series of films in the history of British cinema (St.Trinians). The story of a bureaucratic incompetence in the midst of post-war processes allows Frank Launder to direct the maximum talent of all games. It is probably the only movie in which Margaret Rutherford meets her struggle, in Alastair Sim, for a strong characterization (but still wins). Joyce Grenfell (bless her) and Richard Wattis both deserve mention in Dighton's masterpiece of English etiquette and the hard upper lip under pressure. Absolutely brilliant. Why 9/10? Just 83 minutes.
