I thought Besson's film could do without words a few films could do with them; Capture real human emotions. Fights of the main character, triumphs, backs, hopes and desires are so sincerely shown that you are asking if they are acting at all. The film has a low budget and is obviously made without glitters and glamor that offers most Hollywood productions, but minimalism is what makes this movie overcome the stereotypical Sci-Fi tagging and become a real drama. However, calling this film only drama would take away from a fantastic post-apocalyptic plot. The truth is that this type of movie was done before, but I think this one captures the joys and sorrows of this type of world, perhaps better than any other.
