Where should I start? Let me say that after watching the whole movie and the special features on the DVD, I watched my wife and I watch the whole film again with the director's commentary. I can't remember ever having lasted more than 7 minutes of this movie commentary. Worth hearing. I'm not a Southern boy, but I've spent some time around Memphis long ago and I feel like it's an area. This film almost smells south, it's so real. Samuel Jackson, one of my favorite actors, is spectacular because Lazarus and Christina Ricci are emotionally bent over life as Rae, a woman who has been seriously injured during her short life. I always liked Mrs. Ricci's work, but in this performance she gives 137% of herself on the screen every second. The award and the small sculptures are not enough to reward her for what lies in front of the audience. <br /> <br /> There are other places where you can read the essence of the story so I'm just commenting on the work. I heard the name Justin Timberlake before I saw "BSM", but he had no idea how he looked or even why he was famous. He hit my head for 60 years, I'm out of his demographic goal, at least. After seeing this movie, I know him. He can act! He gives substantial, believable performance as a loving soulmate county whore. The director comes from Memphis and worships his homeland. It's also a great teller. <br /> <br /> ..... and I have to mention music. I love Blues and the Black Snake Moan soundtrack is a true feast for the blues fan. I write less cohesively than usual because my enthusiasm for this film overcomes the sentence structure. Look at this movie and I mean now.
