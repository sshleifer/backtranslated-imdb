One true thing proves that these are the characters who make the film. Streep will certainly receive an Oscar nomination for his role. Beautiful drama, One True Thing is a prime example of filmmaking in the late 1990s - there are still people who are interested in how to make and watch movies other than big million-dollar blockbusters. It's not the best picture or anything ... don't be stupid. But the amount of emotion brought by the actors and the writer hit me like a shock wave. I shouted twice in this movie, which says a lot to a 24-year-old man.
