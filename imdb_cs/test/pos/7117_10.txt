My sister, Dad, and I'm really in D&D, and we were watching Netflix one night and looking for a movie to watch this one appear. We thought we'd try and ended up almost laughing. Writing and playing in this movie is so amazing! Witty characters, great interaction and happy moments kept us in stitch all the time. I love this movie! For those who don't know about Dungeons & Dragons, that wouldn't make sense, but it's a good movie. It just shows that movies don't need an astronomical budget and a big name for actors / actresses to be successful. Look at it if you want a good, clean comedy.
