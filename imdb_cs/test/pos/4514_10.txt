I saw it in a preliminary screening that I didn't read the book, but I heard a lot of good things about it. The film was absolutely fantastic, very moving. With the roller coaster of emotions, you fully associate with the characters. Shaun Toub was great, it was a complete move away from his usual roles, and playing for those who understood Persian / Dari was incredible. One thing to note is that Khaled Hosseini actually loved a film that is unusual for film adaptations. Even after seeing the movie several times "he sobbed". <br /> <br /> Also, the intro animation was excellent, with titles displayed as if it were Persian calligraphy, very unique! Occasionally the translation did not effectively convey the message, but it was all a great movie.
