I recently bought this movie for three money in a garage sale, and while I'm glad I didn't have to pay the usual $ 19.99 for this DVD, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was. It's set as a horror anthology, divided into 5 stories, including a 'connector' story, which includes four teenagers who break the car over a dark, lonely road in the middle of the night. These kiddos seem like horror stories because that's what they decide to do in the morning - to tell the scary stories around the campfire. Each character is on the line and tells a story, after which their own story is wrapped up with a nice little twist. The first story of "Hook" is a bit of a waste of time, a bit bland and boring. Fortunately, it is not one of the main stories and only takes about 5 minutes. It's just imagining a movie and it's easy to overlook the unoriginality of this piece. Second Story, "The Honeymooners" is, eh, okay. It's about it - you guessed it - two honeymooners! They travel around RV heading to Las Vegas. They decide to stop somewhere for the night, but the mysterious stranger quickly warns them to leave the place or risk being attacked by dangerous, unknown creatures. This story has a pretty good setup, but just a "ok" delivery. Basically it's pretty fun and mysterious until the monsters show up, then it's just a little iffy. The Third Story "People Can Lick Too" is my personal favorite. She is a young girl whose parents go out for the night and who's the older one you let her go to the party. So she will be alone - the fact that she learns about her friend from the Internet. The problem is that the internet friend? She's not exactly a 13-year-old girl. The end of this story is a little less climatic than I may have liked to see, but I'm still pretty good. The last story of "The Locket" is definitely the one that is full of that atmosphere. In a haunted mansion in a dark, rainy night, it's the story of a young man (playing Glenn Quinn!) Who travels on a motorcycle stumbling across this house just as he has a problem with his engine. She meets a little girl who lives in the house and falls in love with her at first sight. Unfortunately, not everything is all right and dandy - and it could have something to do with hanging around her beautiful neck ... <br /> <br /> After the stories are wrapped, we have an idea with a twist includes four teens in the car, a spin that should obviously show up in retrospect, but which was not really visible and it is quite a nice conclusion to the film. So, all in all, a good movie. Rent it out if you can, because unfortunately I don't think it has a lot of re-tracking value. But the next time you are in the mood for a vaguely scary littl flick in the same vein as "Tales of the Darkside" or something, grab this movie and some popcorn, turn off all the lights and enjoy this surprisingly clever little flick.
