I loved the film absolutely, positively. I saw it and I can't wait to release it on DVD. It's a beautifully mastered masterpiece. I always am impressed by the intricate drawing of Ghibli's studies. Others commented on Sosuke's name Risa on her behalf. He never tells his Father by his first name unless he tells someone else about it. I didn't think Risa was his mother. Nobody ever mentioned it or suggested it. It is obvious that he is his stepmother. That's why he promises to come home and why he gets so upset when he finds his empty car. His mother had to die when he was a child because he mentions that she is being treated by Risa. That, together with his father, who is out there, is why he has problems with abandonment. Everyone also talks about how mature she is. This usually happens when a child loses a parent.
