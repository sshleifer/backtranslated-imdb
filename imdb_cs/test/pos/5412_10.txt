Wow. When I went to film at the Toronto Film Festival, I didn't know what I was in. This film takes you to an emotional roller coaster in the best sense of the word. Sigourney Weaver was better than I had seen her in years; Emile Hirsch was great and Jeff Daniels broke my heart. I can see how it will not be a cup of every man's tea, as it sometimes discusses some of the rough things that can happen to a family. Don't get me wrong - it's funny too - when I was screening, the audience was upset when they laughed again and again. I just think that if you are open to exploring your own life, Imaginary Heroes will sincerely touch you. I can't wait to get it out in theaters.
