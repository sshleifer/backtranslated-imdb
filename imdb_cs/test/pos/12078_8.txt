It must be the ultimate movie chick. We recorded it a few years ago and I watched it about thirty times over the years. I haven't seen it for about 12 years and I recently watched this movie. I'm not lying, I cried from the opening credits to the final credits. This movie really breaks your heart even if you don't have children.
