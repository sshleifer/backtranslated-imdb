This is another of Hitchcock's films with the highest rating and right. This is the story of two men who meet on a train and exchange playfully fantasy murders. One of them (Robert Walker) takes it seriously and this leads Guy Haines (Farley Granger) to trouble with the law. Another fast moving Hitchcock movie with lots of great scenes (carousel scene and tennis match deserves to be mentioned). It's not a movie that would be left out - it's a pity that no one on DVD will reload it with a lot of bonuses - that's the cheap Warner Brothers DVD, it's all there.
