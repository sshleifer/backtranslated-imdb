If you have a fabric box, a comfortable couch, a big bowl of popcorn and no social commitment on Friday night, it's definitely your movie! Its romantic, hot and challenging. For most of us gay people, religion is just one of those things we did when we were kids and probably just played alter boy and how cute he was! But in the Latter Days you see the struggle for a gay man when the whole world revolves around a belief that is totally contrary to the gay. Both main members were totally hot, but at the same time you managed to capture your heart and even "almost" cry (I never cried in the movie!), Which I thought was quite impressive for a class B movie. I highly recommend this movie, you will laugh, you will cry (if your self) and you will definitely drool! I love it so much that I bought a DVD for my collection. It's really the most beautiful movie ever
