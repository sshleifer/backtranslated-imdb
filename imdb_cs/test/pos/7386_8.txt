A few things you can touch in response to an older person's comment. All you have to do is do what's going on in the movie. <br /> <br /> (I think they're spoilers) <br /> <br /> Red things under David's mouth? Poison ivy, wife says it doesn't have to scratch or otherwise "spread". David goes "insane" because the stranger tells HIM to get out of the house, which probably proves David's theory of the matter that is happening between wife and stranger; he runs after the man. David won't lose him in the woods, hit strangers several times and leave him on his wife to pick up the pieces. Only a wife eats a sponge. I have to say that after one point with my wife and stranger I started to feel disappointed. But the end was the whole movie. And for this and the last scene ... this is one of my favorite movies ever. I should have put it together earlier, but let it turn. I was really surprised, honestly. This film is, at least, interesting. But if you're not watching it for performances that actors give, I'd say you'd better let it go because that's all that holds this movie together.
