A film about government failure and adult selfishness. The vast impossibility of dealing with life and the means that children go to try to achieve life. Only to live. Stay alive in a cruel world. A nightmare world, we are afraid to observe it because we see the truth and are afraid to see it. Seeing the world of despair when we are so comfortable in our lives and even complaining about what we didn't get when it is so trivial compared to someone else. They, the children of the film, are numb. They are more than numb by what is around them. They see sex as an act, as if watching a television program. When the boy is with the hooker, Pixote sits on the bed and looks with a blank look, without feeling. He wants to be a little boy and have a family, but the hooker doesn't even have sympathy and pushes him away. "Human" film with "human" relationships and moral judgment in an ugly, terrible, cruel world. It reminds us that life is not fair, but you can still have a human connection.
