I couldn't agree more than the remark left by "coldshitaction" and how this film is a masterpiece. I've never seen a movie that had my adrenaline that made this movie, and it usually happened when Bronson comes out of the fire like an M-60 and sails like 20 gang guys, he's a genius. Quite possibly the best action movie ever (without exaggeration) can be the best action movie. From the beginning, one should know that you're in something sweet when the police let Bronson go and tell him to clear the slums. Once again, genius. And again Bronson is a bad ass. Paul Kersey is just as cool, maybe even cooler than John McClain or Terminator, it's just a bad ass. And what's still great is the fact that he's a nice boy and he buys a kid some ice cream and helps the old couple kill a bag. genius. Highly recommended, if you hate this movie, you're crazy.
