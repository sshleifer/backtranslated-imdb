It seems sad to me that just because Edward Norton didn't want to be in the movie or has anything to do with it, people automatically think that the film gets angry without even watching or giving it a chance. I really hope Norton didn't. He's a great actor and everyone, but he scared people from a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I found it fun. It wasn't a blow of mind or something with crazy special effects, but it wasn't bad. Watching was fun. But yeah, definitely not a bad / horrible movie. <br/> 7/10
