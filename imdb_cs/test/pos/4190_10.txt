The 1960s cinema was, like the time of revolution, politics and music. Filmmakers dared to make avant-garde films discussing taboo topics that were only allowed in exploitative films. From "Breathless" and the underground American cinema (eg Kenneth Anger), movies have become increasingly experimental. All of this was accumulated when Hollywood realized they had a mass commercial appeal with "Easy Rider." One of the best (and most surprising) outcomes of this era was also one of the least successful at first. "The Head" was made when The Monkees' career was seriously diminishing, which is one of the best psychedelic films ever made. <br /> <br /> The storyline? Well, there really isn't one as many have said. These are Monkees who go from one surrealist scenario to another. However, all of these sequences are clearly LSD-tinged and basically ridiculed as The Monkees were sick of being limited to their light pre-fab reputation. It's a pity that the movie didn't find any audience. The little boppers who loved them switched to a new fashion, as always. The psychedelic / Haight-Ashbury mob, to which the film was collected, would never be caught dead at the Monkees movie. Its all losses. This film may be slightly smaller, but it is definitely not meaningless and is very intelligently assembled. The crew later made "Easy Rider" and "Five Easy Pieces". The film was later revived by Raybert's 1973 retrospective and received a very positive response that deserved a cult following for a long time. Ironically, Monkees would be the victim of the same commercial system that protested in this film with their later 80th reunion. (10/10)
