First, let me say that I will find films like Shaykhhan's Redemption and Green Mile, and most Spielbergs are absolutely horrible and gastric turning. Although the National Velvet on the surface seems to be in the same genre and has what should be cruel-worthy moments, I enjoyed it, laughed and twitched all over the movie. The assumption of land, a young girl with an unknown horse from a small village entering the Grand National is certainly as unlikely as it could be, but it's the only thing you have to accept to act as a fairy tale or allegory. Characters have depth and grow throughout the story. Ann Revere performs absolutely stunning performance as one of the wisest women ever captured in American film. Her interaction with the kind-hearted Donald Crisp is funny and sweet. While Liz Taylor is struggling a little harder than Margaret O'Brien (btw), her passion and love for her horse shines through her face. Mickey Rooney gives a beautifully zero performance coach. This is far from a perfect movie. Some of these situations and scenes are a bit spoiled and dated (children's antiquity and Rooney's scenes on the track and in the pub, for example), but it doesn't matter. The story remains true to the characters and leaves quite a bit unspoken. We don't have unnatural too dramatic and preaching moments - sometimes more is less. The final scene is a great example - the emotional dialogue is left to the viewer to fill. Strong undervalued performance, rounded characters, overwhelming dialogue, intelligent and internally consistent action. We believe in characters and move their story. Yeah - they don't do that anymore ...
