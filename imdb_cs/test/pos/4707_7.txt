I'd like to give this movie a good 7th Though it's certainly not the biggest movie, or even one of the best movies of its kind (The Killing Fields is better), at least trying to tell the story. I think the way Laura was introduced to Burma was a bit biased. First of all, Burma is not exactly the simplest country in the world, especially in the late 1980s. Second, if you did Burma, your passport would not be lost. Sane man would be sure they know where their passport is all the time. With that in mind, I'm sure the screenwriter knew he was weak, but he needed something. Patricia Arquette's performance was undervalued and I just didn't buy her a doctor. However, at least it has not played its role, which is often the case in films like this. Aung Ko was good but also undervalued. The end is difficult to watch because most of the dialogue is in Burma, with people who translate Laura. It would be difficult for Laura and difficult for the viewer. Another plus is the strong SE scene in a movie that was nice to see.
