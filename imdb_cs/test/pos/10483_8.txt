Stephane Audran is the eponymous hero of this beautifully measured study of a small Danish community at the end of the last century. Two beautiful and musically gifted sisters give up their own prospects of happiness and marriage to care for their aging father. One day a French woman, Babette, comes to see them. After a few years, he wins the lottery and is determined to do something for the sisters who took her. Its solution is to prepare a wonderful and luxurious feast that will change the lives of all the invited. It is a film about human and cultural interaction, which is reflected in the changing language of dialogue from Danish to French, and especially between the obedient sobriety of Protestant Northern Europe and the sensuality of the Catholic South. It is also about human needs and how heat and kindness can be expressed and stimulated by the cultivation of the senses. A deeply uplifting film.
