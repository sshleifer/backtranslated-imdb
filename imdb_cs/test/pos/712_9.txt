I really enjoyed this movie - I like prison movies in general (I'm not sure why - I'm sure it could do something about it!) I spent one night in prison more than 20 years ago and I would never know did not return - I got an individual version of "frightened straight"! (A couple of hours I got into an isolation cell on Alcatraz, compliments the park guard, but that's another story!) The genre really interests me. Rolling Stones' "Sympathy for the Devil" soundtrack was the perfect backdrop for the film. I still think of "The Jericho Mile" every time I hear a song.
