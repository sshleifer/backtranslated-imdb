The reason this movie is not more familiar to me and more appreciated seems to be for its subject. Because of its controversial theme this film never got a proper big release and still remains quite unknown one to this day. Not that it was the subject of controversial now but now. Basically, it's a white man movie that treats a black man. Friendship doesn't seem to be forced or unrealistic, but the way it is shown in this film makes it really real. We see that these different ethnic groups mingle as if it were perfectly normal. Unfortunately, of course, in those days it wasn't really considered anything normal. When he saw a black man talking to a white girl and having fun with her as a friend, it had to be difficult to follow, for example, for some of his 1957 spectators. You can really understand why Sidney Poitier was always and still respected by Hollywood society and the black community in general. Of course, this is one of the reasons why he won the Oscar Award in 2002. He often fights discrimination and prejudice in his films, with "In the Heat of the Night" the best example. A true model that has certainly inspired many African-American actors to this day. In addition, he was also a great actor. Yes, he is still alive, but the movies seem to be retiring because his last role has been since 2001. This film was Martin Ritt's directorial debut and he also didn't get too much film to spend on his film. The studio was probably also a little reluctant, mainly because of its concept and / or because it was Ritta's first film. Or perhaps it was simply because MGM wasn't that big and left his best days behind. There was something good about Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer since the 1950s that they didn't make too big and cheap movies, while in the early years it was really one of the biggest studios with a lot of stars and acclaimed directors. who made many award winning classic films. Fortunately for them, their reputation is beginning to change again, and whenever the MGM logo appears in the movie, people no longer expect a smaller film. Anyway, even with a limited budget and limited resources from this, we made a great movie. The movie is very simple, has only a few characters and a simplistic graph. However, the film can still impress you with its story and themes, without preaching it or anything about it. It makes the film an effective one also with its subjects. Really a movie that deserves to be seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10
