My skateboarding career ended in 1974, when my two-seat skateboard with steel roller skates hit a rock and I crashed down the sidewalk outside my birthplace in Boston for a few days. By the time my hand was lost, summer was gone. But I have always admired the types of games and surfers. I think I spent the first month after I moved to Southern California on the surfers' beaches and piers, and refused to miss my call. It is something you should teach young people before the horrible senses of self-preservation and self-awareness begin to collapse. Like a trained bear. I've always admired how a good surfer doesn't seem to care for anything but that moment, this wave, this experience. On one with the forces of nature. A good surfer seems to be nothing but that wave there, and the way you communicate with it. It's a lot of Zen for me. <br /> <br /> This document outlines how several young people have adopted the surfing concept and extended it to skateboarding. Ramps, dips, low sweep curves when interacting with cement waves underfoot. It was all new in her day and time. radical. Before the Zephyr Skate team, the idea seemed to go as fast as you could on a skateboard, so I had a long "Evel Knievel at Caesers Palace" as a fall from the front hall. This film looks beyond time, to America, until everything was labeled, labeled, marketed, and stuck in the throat like "extreme." (Seriously, what's "extreme" about "Extreme value meal" at Taco Bell? Besides being an extreme danger to the colon ...) <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and watch the birth of "extreme sports" â€œ. Before the X-games appeared, before the Huck-Jam boom-boom, before the Crusty Demons, before the ASA ... there were these young street urchins who created "extreme sports" without really trying. Just doing it for cleanliness, pure pleasure, skateboarding in the sun with friends. <br /> <br /> I hope they get "extreme" money there. Good knows they won't get the credit they deserve. Maybe the movie can fix it. An excellent movie with a great soundtrack, a portrait of Southern California, actually America, that no longer exists. I don't care about Sean Penn, but she does a decent job of telling.
