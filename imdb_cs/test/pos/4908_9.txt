Directed by: Michael Curtiz, Four Daughters is about four musically gifted sisters, their suitors and their father, the smaller conductor. Playing sardonic, quick talking Mickey Borden is John Garfield in a role that made him an instant star. Rains like Adam Lemp and Sisters Lane, Lola, Rosemary and Priscilla, and Gale Page as his spirited daughters. His definitive scene is set in the Lemps living room. Borden plays on his lips and plays one of his songs. Ann Lemp Priscilla Lane told him it was beautiful. But he says, "It stinks." He goes on, "He has no beginning or end, just in the middle." Ann urges him to create a beginning and an end. Borden says, "What is it? The fates are against me. They threw a coin - my heads are poor, my tails are rich. The audience loved the way Garfield said in his hard urban voice that it stinks. The scene created the personality of Garfield's screen as an eternal outsider. Four daughters are a piece of America with Garfield, in a compelling performance that adds more than a hint of darkness. <br /> <br />
