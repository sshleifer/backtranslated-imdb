It is quite a success that the three stories filmed by three very different filmmakers could be so bright about gay and bi-sexual relationships and their struggles! "Pool Days" is about the inconvenience of adolescence and attraction between an older man and a younger man. The story of experience and vulnerability! "Friend of Dorothy" shows a common dilemma of many gay and bi-sexual people experiences at some point in their lives: intense attraction to someone who is heterosexual. Sensitively examined, this story really left me feeling of movement! "The Disco Years" shows another version of the no-win situation: engaging with someone who is not only confused about their sexual orientation but is also afraid of being exposed to anything other than equal! A very encouraging story for those of us who have experienced betrayal in the hands of a sexually confused and frightened man! Although these three stories appeal to anyone who has an iota of empathy for others, they psychologically empower those who consider themselves gay, bi-sexual or seeking. Every story is uplifting in its own unique way!
