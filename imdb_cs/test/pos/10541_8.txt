I know what you say, "O man, Pinochio is not scary!" but this film goes far beyond manic pinochio. Behind him tells the story of a mother and her daughter who is strangely attached to her doll Pinnochio, who apparently talks to her. The only strange thing is that no one else can hear the doll except her. In the end, it is a shocking revelation that shocks you like me. Bach. Try.
