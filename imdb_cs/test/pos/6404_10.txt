Right now I'm watching "The Big Chill" on DVD. One of his actors is Meg Tilly. I looked at the IMDb, which led me to read Meg's bio, who mentioned and reminded me of Meg's sister Jennifer Tilly, whose filmography included "Key West", which was one of my wives and my favorite shows. Then I read this entire review overview. Wow, I really loved that they also show and agree with all the feelings about the unpredictability and uniqueness of characters and situations. Like most others, I would like it to be on DVD or otherwise available. <br /> <br /> The last reviewer says he's looking at reps, so I wish I knew what the network, channel, day, times was. <br /> <br /> So if someone knows how we can watch the "Key West" episodes, please let us know.
