As a longtime fan of Studio Ghibli and especially Hayao Miyazaki, I opened the film on that day. When I came out of the theater, I had this strange feeling that something was missing, this "magical" feeling I had previously experienced in all Miyazaki movies, but I couldn't tell why it failed this time. After thinking about other Ghibli movies, I know the reason: this movie had most of the big anime elements Miyazaki: cute characters, amazing key animation, a great soundtrack composed by Joe Hisaishi and a warm story that gives you the feeling of watching quality Japanese animated film. But two elements were missing: deep story and dramaturgy. Of course, the purpose of this film was to entertain little children with a simple story like "Totoro," so the intricate story, as said in "Spirited Away" or "Princess Mononoke", is not really necessary, but on the other hand, this story was just too much shallow. I couldn't get in touch with the main characters because there were no characters, the dramatic scenes were limited and they didn't last long. I really hate giving only 7 stars to Miyazaki movie because I would give 10 stars to all previous movies right away, but this time it wasn't just that wonderful "ghibli experience".
