Recently, I was fortunate enough to see "The Kite Runner" in a small theater, surrounded by experienced moviegoers who knew how to enjoy a masterpiece of such sophistication. With all the controversial circumstances in this central movie scene, I was expecting a rough and violent piece these days. But the way Mr. Forster was dealing with a sensitive subject touched and really, deeply moved. Although movie credits have shown that China is the main venue for filming, I could have sworn I saw Kabul during the scenes to be held in Afghanistan. Acting, both professionals and professionals, is excellent and the cast is spectacular. This is a movie that I would see again and again because, although undeniably sad in his subject, the masterly way it was created awakens a whole new hope in the modern cinema.
