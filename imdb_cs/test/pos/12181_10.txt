I am quite this adaptation of Anne Rice's book. While most of the film is filmed here in Australia, it offers a lot of scenery and a fantastic area in which to shoot. Lestat (Stuart Townsend) recently woke up from a long sleep and decided to betray his vampire oath. revealing band. When he becomes a popular movie icon by his fellow vampires, grimly, go crazy and plot his death. Meanwhile, Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), a lone member of the supernatural studies, who has an ancient vampire pedigree, became deeply obsessed with Lestat. Her boss David (Paul McGann) understands her obsession and renews her obsession with vampire Mario (Vincent Perez) who is an ancient vampire and a man who also made Lestata a vampire. Jesse is given a Lestats diary and reads his first killing and meeting with the queen-damned-Akasha (Aaliyah). When Lestat organizes a concert in Death Valley, he gets the message that not only are vampires Akasha angry there, too. Meanwhile, Akasha has other plans. He goes to a vampire monastery, a bar, and kills everyone on her way. With Lestat tempted by the kingdom and loving care of Akasha, the old vampires consisting of Marius and Jesses Aunt Maharet (Lena Olin) stood against them. Join her Or Die? <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was fantastic, had great fighting scenes, great music and great places. Aaliyah sadly died in a plane crash shortly before the movies premiered, but she looked stunning on stage and off set. I've given this movie 10/10 because it was a fantastic movie and I urge you to see it!
