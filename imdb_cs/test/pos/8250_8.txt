The jewel of the British comedy. The bad American club Pinky Green (Richard Jordan, playing another bad guy, but this time adorable) gets out of the British prison and tries to go straight, but his bank maintenance is too attractive for his never-reformed criminals, led by a really ugly Ivan (David Niven in one of his last roles). Pinky defends himself, but the lure of all that money is too much for him. Things are crumbling and repeating and it's joyful to watch. Jordan had to play 20 bad guys in his career, but he never played the same thing twice - this is just nice to hate. Niven never played a stupid evil guy, oil everywhere. Two dear actors we've lost, I wish we had them back.
