On Monday, early this week, sometime in July, I was under the influence of a sweet leaf and I am a horror fan, I wanted to see something scary. I was thinking about The Ammityville Horror 2, but I had something better. I was in my friend's house and had VHS Evil Ed. No cover or nothing, nor did he see the whole thing on his own, but he told me it was about "the guy who went crazy and kills a lot of people." Well, this movie was very shocking, I never saw the real brutal nature of sadistic violence until this movie, It Blows Ted Bundy and Ed Gein Both! It's pretty funny too, with links to the Evil Dead trilogy (plus the Evil Dead 2 poster is everywhere in the movie!) The movie is about Edward, an obsessive-compulsive, kind guy who becomes a film editor. He is then borrowed to another department in the building, and he is sent to a classy yet violent world by Sam Campbell, Splatter and Gore Department. Sam Campbell, Eddy's new boss, tells Eddy a big break on his films, the horrific Loose Limbs series, and needs Eddy to pursue the film a little less so they can be exposed all over Europe. Eddy's regrets soon because of the images and scenes depicted from the lonely suburban home he is sent to work with, and then what's going on there are really scary. Imagine you are in his place! Acting is great, overdubbing is a little funny (Sam Campbell's voice is often found to be funny, just like other actors). However, overdubbing work has been done quite well, I give this movie 10/10, and it's a good introduction to Gore's sub-genre Horror. Very good, nightmare, bloody ....... You have to see it yourself. quote from the movie: "Where is f ** k is my scene of rape Beaver?!"
