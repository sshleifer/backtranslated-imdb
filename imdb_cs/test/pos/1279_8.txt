The messy man, known as Bill, lives in a small, clumsy apartment with Marilyn Monroe's poster on the wall and a typewriter for the company. Only the man cannot think of anything he would write. He travels through the streets for people, just to see where they go. Maybe it will give him some inspiration to write. He starts watching a well-dressed man holding a bag. He follows him for a few days. A well-dressed man is sitting in a cafe, sitting at a table on the opposite side of Bill, asking why Bill is watching him. A well-dressed man says his name is Cobb. Then, surprisingly, Cobb informs Bill that he is a thief and even takes Bill to his home to steal things; Although Cobb insists that they do not go to other people's homes to steal. He says he likes to let people know he was there and cut off things they take for granted. He puts panties from another burglary into a man's pants, for example. The movie sometimes also appears in flashbacks. The director used this technique in a larger volume in his recent film Memento. Bill finally decides to cut his hair and dress in his suit, Cobb's advice. She meets a blonde lady in a club he has used to the owner, a bald man who is very dangerous, he says. We see a scene in which a man who is bald by a man is used by a hammer on a man's fingers in a Blonde apartment. These are some of the many pieces the puzzle shows us, and they all fit in when we arrive at a surprising conclusion.
