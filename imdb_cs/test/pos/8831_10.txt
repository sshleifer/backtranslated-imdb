Duck_of_Death has to watch this film again because its main criticism is completely unfounded. The film has never forgotten the time delay, and it has been explicitly mentioned in several places. The crew never appeared with mission management talks that did not follow the time delay rules. One thing I thought was a bit more attractive was the level of risk. on a planet where pressure suits would last only two hours? I doubt it. Will a spaceship with a crew approach the stellar corona? I doubt it. Could people land on a moon that was bombarded with huge amounts of radiation? I doubt it. Also the ship looked too robust. Could a ship so dangerous be slowing down? I doubt it. Would it survive if they were hit by the wreckage of comets? I doubt it. I think in both cases the tension on the structure would be too much. But the pervasive scenarios were offset by some nicely done special effects, good editing and production, and some good acting performances, especially actors depicting the ship's master and the Russian astronaut.
