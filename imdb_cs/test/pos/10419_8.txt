After a recent trip to NYC, I put this movie on a whim and I couldn't believe I never heard of it! He has all the prerequisites of a cult classic, starting with characters. They are archetypal roles that we recognize from every part of everyday life, but the actors who played them (Peter Stormare and Bai Ling's performances were particularly strong) were zero and fully realized. Their interaction with each other is irritated and grounded, and at the same time it boils down with a gentle, unpredictable humor that is too rare in American films today. Writer / director Ramin Niami does a beautiful job weaving these scenes together into a funny and moving portrait of the city's past. Highly recommended!
