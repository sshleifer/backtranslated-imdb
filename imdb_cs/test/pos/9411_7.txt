Yes, it's a little ugly. But it's exciting and fun and one of my favorites; There are some excellent actors in the film, and they do commendable work due to the limitations of plot and characters. It is interesting to see David Soul as a "bad guy"; I thought it was quite believable - and rather cool - as more and more paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a longtime favorite - I think he revives his character very well; and Sam Waterston was a stellar quality in everything I watched - movies or television. <br /> <br /> I watch this movie so often, but our tape (VHS TV copy I got) is so bad quality that it's hard to fully enjoy it. This is a movie to put on DVD; Maybe it wouldn't be universally sought, but I'm sure there are a lot of people like me who like this kind of movie so there would be a market for the DVD version. I will hope!
