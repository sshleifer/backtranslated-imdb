For the first time I saw this film as a teenager (I am now in my 40s) and have long considered it my favorite movie. The story is extremely moving without being sentimental. Acting, especially in March and Loy, is dead. And the fact that Dana Andrews is too old for her role does not take away the credibility of his romance with Theresa Wright (whom I believe to be the only main character in the film she lives on). This could turn out to be another post-war melodrama, but the script and cast are just too good for it.
