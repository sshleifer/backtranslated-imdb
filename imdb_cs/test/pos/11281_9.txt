God cuts with a razor, then gives birth to Mother Earth, who then gives birth through the gods the seed, the son of the earth. This is a one and a half hour movie that captures the dark version of how God created the world. His surreal, dark and poetic. The most important aspect of the film is visual for me. His shot in a very grainy black and white film, using both slow and normal shooting. Sometimes even fast movie and stop-motion. The scenes are long and pulled out, creating a very special mood. No sounds were recorded during the shooting (I think), then sound effects such as criccety, water and other ambient sounds were repeated over and over. How would you understand that this film is certainly not for an impatient person ... I often felt that it was similar to Eraserhead David Lynch, but this one is even harder to understand, and even more to drag it , but it's okay for me, I like the kind of stuff. Sure it is not fun (at least not a Hollywood kind), so if your going to check it out, I recommend you set it up. Be open and apart from something like the end of 2001: the spatial odyssey.
