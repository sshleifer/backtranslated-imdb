In one of his best performances, Peter Lorre is transformed into a Hungarian watchmaker coming to United Staes to create a new life for himself and one day to bring his girl over a large pond to be with him. Lorre's infectious optimism and clear vision unfolds very effectively, so the performance is all the better when he has his face scorchingly burned in the hotel fire, and when nobody gives him a chance to work, he reluctantly turns to the life of the crime. Lorre's range as an actor is rarely as evident as in this movie with his jovial, good-natured immigrant, his depressing, melancholic, mutilated self-search for truth for what he believed America was offering him, for his polite, intelligent and better. than your average hood, to his sympathetic dealing with a blind woman he falls in love with. The story is well-paced, has some interesting twists, and gives Lorre many opportunities to shine. Director Robert Florey does a good job behind the lens, and all supporting casts help the film with Evelyn Keyes give a particularly good turn as a blind girl. I loved the end - and the truth - that glowed to exist in Lorre's character despite all the negative things society had done to him. For a small B painting, the man behind the mask is a good film-making for his time.
