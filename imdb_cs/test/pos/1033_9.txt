I also found "Oppenheimer" as a great series and one of the best deals on American PBS. David Suchet was particularly effective as Edward Teller as I recall, and the overall concept was incredibly good. The only reason the series doesn't rate full 10/10 is in low budget values ​​in some areas. Current content is absolutely first-class in my memory. Oppenheimer Miniseries will be released in the UK on July 31! It will be a Region 2 / PAL file, but the Region 1 / NTSC file seems to be in the game soon. <br /> <br /> If you have a universal player in the US, you can order a series from Amazon UK. <br /> <br /> http://tinyurl.com/znyyq <br /> <br /> Huzzah !!
