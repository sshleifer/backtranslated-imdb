At the beginning I didn't have much faith, but as a Costa Rica citizen, I can confirm that the film shows the reality that we live from day to day, and shows a lot of things of our culture, such as our way of speaking, Our music, our way to stand for their rights without fear, without any weapons. I'm really proud of the work they did and how they didn't forget the movie. they wanted us to get money, not to take care of them, but in fact we worked with a short budget, which allowed us to appreciate the beautiful scenarios and great photography. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend seeing this movie, you won't regret it.
