Viva Variety was a unique hybrid program that was both a parody and a tribute to the programs it represented. It was the most directly mock-up classic 1970s favorite, "Sonny & Cher Show," with Thomas Lennon and Kerri Kenney playing a divorced show couple who were somehow forced to host this program together, the female pair towering over the man, and the constant firing of "insult humor" the couple tossed at each other, plus a sketch comedy stunts and performances of what are most kindly described as "specials" acts! "Hybrid" was a mixture of reality and imagination. Of course, there was no "Mr. and Mrs. Laupin" and the program announcer, Johnny Bluejeans, was just as fictional. But all the actions that were taken were certainly real and some were even fun! But there were some acts that would be more appropriate for older Chuck Barris "Gong Show". The show itself was actually more like an extended sketch of "SCTV" (carried from the MTV series, "State After All") and some would suggest that it would be better than a five-minute bit in the mix a program like this one rather than a separate series. But "Viva Variety" should definitely get high marks for original concepts, and although it was often more than odd, it was certainly useful, especially when they set out on a trip to Las Vegas and brought glittering acts. It's unlikely we'll see anything like that on TV.
