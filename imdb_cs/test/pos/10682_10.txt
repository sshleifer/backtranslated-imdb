Gerry Anderson is the first live action invasion in the way of a big movie that benefits from the incredible FX work model and the great Barry Gray music score. Analog Computers with Reel Reels, Far "2069" (I think Anderson really wanted a safer date 100 years later!), They're funny to see how fashion gurus are, but one could easily be accused of 2001 the same violations, but no one could predict some things as it turned out. This movie was a springboard for the UFO series the following year, and in fact not only had the same FX people, but also the producers, but many of them were regular in this series. the future of "alternative history" more than anything else - the "Apollo-like" rocket used in an elevator, it always seems to be a different planet than the earth. Given the "alternative country" plot, one might assume that it was the feeling they wanted. We will end with an end that poses more questions than answers. That's because "other country" exists every movement, event, and the thing that is said to be duplicated as it happens on both worlds. Since given, and the sun between them, two versions of the same person (in this case Glenn Ross, an astronaut) can never meet. A complete accident discovered the planet in the first place when it would most likely remain a secret forever. Recorded mainly in Portugal with FX work in England, it's a must for any Gerry Anderson fan. I have a bare DVD DVD from a few years before the press, but I hope Universal releases it, maybe even extras and even Gerry Anderson's commentary.
