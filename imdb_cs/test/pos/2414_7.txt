I first saw this film shortly after being screened in 1995, I refused it, I said Julie wasn't Daniel, it never gives a chance and says it's horrible. But here it is, 5 years later, it's on Disney and im watching them again. And I found it not as bad as I did. Miyagi is still Miyagi as well as kool as always, the music score is still as enjoyable as ever. And Swank's character is not that bad, her actions are pretty good with the script. He beats the third installment with a big margin. So my original rating of 4 was increased to 7.
