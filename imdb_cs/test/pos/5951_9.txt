I loved this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes a good spy spoof and who thought Johnny English was embarrassed. This is the movie to be. But it's based on the old French movie series, so it's not really Bond related. <br /> <br /> Production is brilliant, you'll almost believe that the film was shot in the 60s. He even has the same pastel kind of movie coloring in those days. Jean Dujardin plays his part with the right amount of stupidity and naivety, not the ham of the pantomime that a ham like Rowan Atkinson has. And even if you don't like the movie, you'll want to see him for Berenice Bejo. Ooh la la! She's hot ...
