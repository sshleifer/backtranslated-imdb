I rented this movie, but I wasn't sure what to expect from it. I was very glad to find out that this is the best Brazilian film I've ever seen. The story is somewhat strange and simple and above all extremely original. We have Antonio, a young man living in Nordestine, a city in the middle of nowhere in northeastern Brazil, who is deeply in love with Karina. The main conflict between them is that while Antonio loves his little town and does not want to leave him, Karina wants to see the world and hate it. As proof of her love for her, she decides to go out and bring the world to her. He says he'll put Nordest on the map. And the way he does it is incredible. That's a good movie; it may be a bit staggering for some people because of its different editing tasks, but I think it's also that this story improves the story. It's just fun, and it gives you a good feeling.
