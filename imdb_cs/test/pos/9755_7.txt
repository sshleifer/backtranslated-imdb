If "Love Me Tonight" is a "musical for people who don't like musicals," it must be said that "Gay Desperado" is definitely not a musical for people who don't like opera. In fact - despite being based on a comic operetta - it is not at all a musical, but a spoof story of bandits with interpolated unrelated arias to show off the voice of one character; and what a voice it is. Nino Martini, as the young singer Chivo who joins the bandit army to gain a place on the radio (no, the conspiracy doesn't mean it will make more sense later) either ...), has a famous golden a tenor whose style didn't hit the day since it was recorded. The trillings and warblings of some of his musical contemporaries belong to the past fashion, but it's very easy to imagine Chivo belting out "Nessun Dorma" into the World Cup crowd and frosting charts in the process. Unfortunately, although he has a gripping smile and a decent dramatic range, he is also totally incapable of playing and singing. The result is that otherwise fast-paced film grinds on shuddering stops every time Chivo puts his hand on his breast and begins to declare, and the viewer tolerance of the result is likely to depend on his opera performance awards. In addition to this disadvantage, the film is a pleasant widescreen satire on Hollywood conventions, and especially a Mexican bandit stereotype that achieves the vital goal of all such spoofs in making its characters engage in their own right. keep the viewer interested when the joke would otherwise grow outdated. The bandit boss and his sidekick have a traditional double-acting relationship, there is a mysterious peon with carved teak and a lively heroine (young Ida Lupino) who performs a generic "you say you hate me but you love me really" routine with a refreshing twist. Overall, the movie is fun and pretty funny, and I feel like I get my money-worthwhile - but it can't be denied that musical interludes while admirably introducing severe stimulation problems in a way.
