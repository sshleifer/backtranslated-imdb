As a modern Marco Polo, from Venice to China, here we come again with Amelius, who is in charge of creating a gray area in the middle of two worlds in solid colors. Europe's pessimistic vision, which is marked by global damage, is correlated with China. The view of this charming but mysterious land is solved from below, without any demands for learning or opinion. But the reality is hard. Abandoned and exploited children, hive-houses, backward areas are OTHER porcelain that we ignore. Vincenzo (Castellitto), a steelworks technician, is one of us. His journey to China is a pretext for understanding, learning from inside the country, where progress and problems of the Third World live together in an infamous balance. It is not entirely clear whether Vincenzo knew for the first time that a mechanical component was already repaired, I think; in any case, it is a smaller aspect. Liu, a Chinese girl, is the key to the film. He has a lot of trouble on his back, has the power to overcome, but how could she fight small money and little help? The real and impartial look at the facts from the girl, the rejection of Vincenzo's money, touched me a lot. A banknote package cannot return to her husband, her child (forced to heal as a stranger for the Law), to protect her with contempt. Liu knew his intentions were harmless and kind, far from the cold charity. Their friendship is beautifully narrated, the way it grows step by step, dignified and formative, unique. An invaluable heritage to be sustained. Some scenes are stunning, either for acting (Vincenzo crying on the ferry), or for dialogues (in the restaurant, on the rail). In addition to the careless cut and nice lazy start, "La Stella che non c'Ã¨" is brilliant and sharp just because it records countless truths. <br /> <br /> In the competition at the 63rd Venice Film Festival, a lot of Tai Ling bets for the Mastroianni, dedicated to emerging stars. She certainly deserved this award. <br /> <br /> [8/10]
