Note: This should probably be read only after watching the movie. It is very rare to find a document or film that focuses on the loser. Deep Water does just this, making it one of the most thought provoking movies in a very long time. It does not provide us with a hero who would watch, but rather an anti-hero who forces us to look into ourselves. The film is about a group of men trying to sail around the world, one-time and no stopping. One person will do it, a few die, one chooses not to return home, each one on a psychological path that is so interesting that they deserve all the movies for themselves. But most interesting is Donald Crowhurst, or rather the way his creators and his reactions are portrayed as viewers. According to all standards, this person should be considered contemptuous, but why did he describe them so heroically? Why are we so likeable to him? He made all the wrong choices from the beginning. He risked his family financially getting the ship, he left for a more dangerous time to get more publicity, he ignored all warnings despite his lack of experience, he decided to lie instead of admitting defeat, these choices of snowball until inevitable and last: suicide. For what? A place in history? The feeling of success? Maybe. It is important to consider whether this human situation is inevitable. Every individual has to ask himself whether his natural human pursuit of fame and success would lead to such negligence and I believe that exploring your own response to Crowhurst's story will offer at least some answer to this question.
