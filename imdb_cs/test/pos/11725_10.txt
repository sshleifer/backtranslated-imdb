I am a fan of the B Class 80s movies, in which the hero is a little bad man, a strong man who finds love - and this film brings! Towards a goal that you don't know how Sharky won't be killed (and doesn't beat! I believe he is realistically portrayed). However he does it and it's not over some exaggerated 'Die Hard' bit. The "past" team they work with, and therefore the title. His team is all the characters - people on the sideline at work because they are not completely in line. These images are funny and sympathetic - they feel real about them. They are against one of the murderers, with their own good team. The result is a great film noir.
