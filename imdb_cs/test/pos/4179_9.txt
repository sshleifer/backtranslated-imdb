The fact that this film hit the box office and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today is a pity - yet somehow appropriate. The business suicide Monkees committed by creating this film is reflected in the metaphorical suicide they have committed on the screen. To destroy so brutally their carefully built image as a healthy American alternative to The Beatles is bold to the point of rashness, as well as accepting being no more than pawns in the entertainment industry, imprisoned (in the movie, literally) in their own artificiality. The TV series Monkees were not so conventional, but HEAD is totally fruitless ... although in the end it is some kind of circular logic. An unreal story is an unreal story that becomes merry and somewhat disturbing. The biggest irony is that the Monkees effectively signed their warrant as a commercial force when they reached their artistic peak. Their research into psychedelia has reached its zenith with a HEAD soundtrack (all songs are unforgettably woven into film), one of the landmarks of the 1960s album. Monkees began to disintegrate after the failure of this movie box office, but HEAD serves as a noble legacy.
