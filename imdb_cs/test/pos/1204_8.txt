When I first saw this movie, I was four years old. I remember I love it and everything about it. 13 years later I am now 17 years old and decided to watch it about a month ago because I go to school in the 1960s at school. I didn't know what to expect because it was 13 years since I last saw it, but I was completely destroyed. The actors were amazing, the music was so fun and I now treat every song. Treat Williams is great as Berger, the "leader" of a hippie group who always gets what he wants, one way or another (except at the very end, of course). John Savage is actually very convincing as Claude, Oklahoma draftee, who falls in love with Sheila (Beverly D'Angelo). D'Angelo is beautiful as a prime and the right rich girl who eventually revolts against her upbringing and joins hippies. Other hippies play Annie Golden, Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright. Annie Golden is just as adorable as Jeannie, a girl who is pregnant but still as cute and innocent as a child. Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright are good as Woof and Hud, two other members of the band and Cheryl Barnes, who plays Hud's fiancee, has an amazing voice. The only problem I have with this film is that the relationship between Claude and Sheila is not very convincing. They are scarcely ever shown together, and when they are, they fight (remember the skinny soaking scene?). Their relationship seems to be very weak, and at the end of the film we should believe that they are madly in love, only on the basis of a few meetings they have. I also see that many people who have written reviews here are upset by the PG's rating for this movie. I personally would increase the rating up to PG-13, just because there is some drug use ... but I remember in 1979, PG-13 did not exist. I do not think that nudity is bad at all, it is by no means sexual (in fact there is no sex at all in this film) and it is only to show the child's innocence that the group maintains. In most European countries, nudity is not considered to be a bad thing and I do not know why it is here in the US. Anyway, I give this movie a high rating, and I'm glad it happened when, in a madly "politically correct" world today, they wouldn't think they would, and even if they did, it would be a very "watering" version, and I'm sure you would not get the full effect. Finally, this is a very underrated film that is definitely worth checking.
