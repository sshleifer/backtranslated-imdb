I wanted to see this movie since the previews came out. I don't understand why everyone is so strong on this movie. This may not be all technically true to rugby sport, but this film is not mainly about sports. It's about the rugby team that is learning how to be more than the world expects from them. They learn to become men, not temporarily futile boys. Hollywood is never 100% correct in its productions. They are there to produce the product they sell. Something fun. The story of coach Gelwix and what he has taught over the years is just amazing. They teach about service, honor, integrity and moral purity. How many more movies does this teach our children these days? I was proud to have seen such a wonderful story that taught respect and respect.
