Oz is a great series, one of the televisions underestimated shows. He has a relationship to the soap opera in that something bad always happens and it is the unwinding of every instance of evil that fascinates. From my conversations with people who are actually in prison, that sounds true. Every interaction has some machinations in the background. Behind every action lies a scheme, a plot to make someone else. I like this series so much that it's one of the few TV shows I've bought completely on DVD. And, yes, I agree with the writer before me who remarked that there are elements of satire in it. The wheelchair character, who offers his glimpse of life, does it with some ironic humor.
