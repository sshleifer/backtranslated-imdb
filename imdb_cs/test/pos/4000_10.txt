Fire Gives Everybody ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most beautiful arts art meditations. Set in the 19th century Korea it tells the story of the famous painter Ohwon, but rather than stick to the anecdote sauces, melodrama, or psychological hunting of eggs, it portrays a series of episodes throughout his life, all of which are beautiful works of art in themselves. It does not give any interpretation of these episodes, but leaves them for the viewer to think along with the pictures of Ohwon himself. In this way, the viewer enters the same kind of contemplation as Ohwon, and minus his talent can "feel" their way into the inspiration of his paintings. Part of why it is so effective is the absolutely masterful induction of Korea in the 19th century and the music / art world Ohwon has moved to. There are many wonderful shots of the world beyond the images that we get a mirror effect where we see a beautiful world inspiring Ohwon, Ohwon living and seeking This world and the artwork it creates is reflected off itself. The story is told with the extreme economy. The feeling evoked hardly ever persists or is explained, just appears quickly and then is gone to make another one appear. It is more like Mozart's work of art (endless and fast succession of great ideas) than Beethovin (Obsessive on one great idea). It has a classic limitation, just like Ohwon's paintings. There is indeed no music to suggest how to feel, except for a few classic Korean songs used with great efficiency in several scenes (and mostly played by movie characters). One angry picture, if I remember correctly, is a flock of birds hovering over blue mountains, while a female king singer <br /> "This life is like a dream and only death will awaken us" Br /> <br One of the movies in the film, one of Ohwon's teachers, is that "the image lies between the moves." The film follows this attitude because there are so many things between film and word *. I saw it twice and it was very beneficial for the second tracking. A very thin film, with a little way to avoid explanation, can be seen as it's Im's 96th film. It's a work of art. Like Ohwon's great friend and mentor, he says he describes one of his paintings: "It's not the only stroke." I compare it to Andrej Rubyle in quality, although it's very different in style. It's much easier and more straightforward to watch, but classic in the form where Andrei gothic. <br /> <br /> Everything in all cases is recommended to almost anyone who has an appetite. I left the film both times, I felt a wonderful spiritual renewal. One point of Ohwon's life that haunted me was that his mad drinking and waving began suddenly after a noble visit, who told him that "good art can only come from great knowledge and learning." "The next short scene of Ohwon was very angry and another drunken drunk who often stayed for the rest of the movie." I wonder why noble words influenced him so much and led to a drink that dominated the rest of his life. Or was it just a coincidence?
