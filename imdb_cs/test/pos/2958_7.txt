This second feature Lone Ranger does not measure classics until 1956, but it is a fine film with enough coarse and drum action and moves on a good clip. The Ranger looks at a series of mysterious murders that have a sinister pattern with peaceful Indians who are the victims of a gang of hooded killers. There is more killing and violence usually associated with Lone Ranger adventure and the film has undercurrent racial insensitivity, comments that are sprinkled throughout the scenario. The Ranger uses disguises because only he can put together tracks and expose the band and put them in front of justice. Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels play in a colorful presentation that shows the desert and cactus land of old Tucson. The musical score is good, but the familiar theme of William Tell Overture is pushed by vocals that are interesting but lack the heyday and beauty of the traditional Ranger theme.
