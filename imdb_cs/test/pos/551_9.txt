Natile Portman and Susan Sarandon will act as a symphony of this story about a young girl who is doomed to the daughter of one of the most beautiful women you'll ever meet. Sarandon has this ability, to call her a talent, if you want, to play some of the most off-beat characters and bring their humanity to the forefront of any movie he does. As the mother of this apparently brilliant and mutant talent of her young girl, Sarandon alternates with being a mother and being a child with the ease of a ballet dancer. More importantly, it does it with strength and flare, without stamping Portman's daughter. The question is always asked when we discuss a film chart that changes? This movie is definitely about a daughter, but if you look closely at the dreams and sacrifices your mother makes to you, you will understand that she is changing her step with her daughter. I'm willing to bet that all of us in the audience will also change. A distinctive feature of drama
