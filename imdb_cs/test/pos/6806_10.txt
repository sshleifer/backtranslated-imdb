My daughter has already written a review of this movie in my login ... but I want to add a few words. <br /> <br /> ?? National Velvet 'was one of my two favorite movies as a child. (Second Being "Wizard of Oz.") The camera, acting, script, and music have come together, it's such a wonderful little heart that feels drama that can bring tears to my tired eyes. Based on the book by Enid Bagnold, the script followed the book pretty well. The characters are so thoughtfully created. It is easy to feel emotionally about the whole family and the picturesque Irish village in which they live. Prerequisite ... a complete outsider believes in his horse and himself a good chance to try the biggest horse racing in the world ... it's amazing for all young people, especially young girls in the 1940s ... the time when girls were ever ignored, because people, let alone athletes. You would have to be so hard not to appreciate his merits. But the perspective I most appreciated about this film is total innocence in its moral message. It's almost magical, like the movies "mom and apple pie". I was really surprised by the IMDB inspector, who asked ... "Was the world really such trust?" and then proceeded to chastize the director for his satisfaction regarding? unchaperoned 'night travel include two main characters. My answer to his question is clear YES !!!! The world in which the film takes place is credible in the 1940s. <br /> <br /> My grandparents remember that Mum got into this movie when it was released. Then my mother took me to see her when I was young, and my daughter was lucky to be born when she could watch her repeatedly on videotape. Now we have it on DVD. It was a family favorite for generations, even though the generation of horse lovers. It was never about sex ... it's about coming of age! It's about faith in yourself and a hard effort to reach your goals. Also, so old-fashioned it wasn't even about the prize money! It's about a girl who understood that her horse had what it takes to be the best. And yes, the director was really interested in the lack of physical development of Elizabeth Taylor, because the book did a great deal of information about the character of Velvet Brown (Liz Taylor's character) that she had to cut her hair and tie her chest so she could walk like a male jockey when she went to the Great National Steeplechase. That was just a sport boy at that time ... I think there were only 12 women in this race. It is almost offensive that someone bothered to think about Lolita about this particular film ... except that anyone who had anything to do with a teenage girl and her horse would know that the only thing about the stars in their Eyes have four hooves and a tail. And now for a great deal of trivia ... The stunted stunt show today is played by the famous Whisperer horse, Monty Roberts. I believe he is listed for his film credits. This movie I give 10 out of 10! I'm never tired of watching it again.
