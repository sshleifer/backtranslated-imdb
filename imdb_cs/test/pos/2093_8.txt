Finally! Third happiness. This film has always been in my mind, but I have forgotten about it for the first time and only caught the other half of the film. Only a few months later I had a second chance to watch it, so I decided to record it. Just to find out that my timer was late and late, I missed the first half of the movie. I didn't want it to happen again. So, when it came back on TV, I thought I'd wait for it to come, then I'll record it. And it was a good choice. I just watched the movie, but at midnight they went for a week. After discovering a hole in his overcrowded cell, nine prisoners escaped their prison to track down the key of the universe that the inmate known as the counterfeit king said hid. He thinks this key could be an opening for the hidden prey of counterfeit banknotes. Naturally, on this path he sees this as an opportunity to pick up life before being brought up. Although things do not manifest as intended, most criminals' plans have been lost. "9 Souls" is a lively spiritual journey of Japanese director Toshiaki Toyada, who has played audiences in a film of two completely different halves. The first half of the story is more like a psychic comedy with criminals and situations in which they find themselves as sales outlets, but everything that makes the moral and dramatic wrapping of the second half where real problems begin. Some pretty ugly and bloody moments that replaced the goofball tone, it started. While the first half is quite entertaining with its on the road, screwball doodling and offbeat joking. But it's really a terrible half when it's a strange turn of events that have hit you so hard with some surprising touches that make you really sympathetic to these very human characters. While they are not really innocent of their crimes, you will just become rooted in these first-half mass figures that when you see them as spirals in their fall, you know it's an effective drama when you become shocked in a dramatic change. Nine characters have enough time on the screen to really understand their personal story and what weakness they might eventually reduce. The way the story works is that Michiru and Torakichi are leading characters and we usually see them from their perspective. The escapism story is an undeniably engaging character study that is clear in its goal and gives you many questions about society and the path you choose to escape life and free yourself from these limitations. While the symbolic story is full of clarity and lively communication. The visual element will not go unnoticed because there is only a dream and trance environment that returns to a unique atmosphere. What HIGH contributed to this factor and gave the film an elevator was an immensely moody instrumental rock soundtrack. The soft atmospheric gel that he was able to create in many scenes left me breathless with eternal emotions he could provoke. Just beautiful and downright powerful control on this front. Stimulating for such a long film (2 hours) seems to be a breeze and editing done quickly because we're just so wrapped up in it all. Hypnotic photography is detailed. While the performances of cast as a special bunch of criminals are of high quality, each of them provides enough personality and features to separate. I found "9 Souls" to be a pleasant and pretty amazing surrealist movie that excites emotions and then strikes you almighty when they change direction. Highly recommended.
