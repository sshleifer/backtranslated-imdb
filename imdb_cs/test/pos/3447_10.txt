I saw some of Mr. Boorman's movies and they didn't like much. Not that they're bad movies, on the contrary, they're good movies, but not content that I personally found fun. However, I think that where the heart is, even though it is ready to satisfy less than a savvy American audience, it is as masterful as a satire, and as a social commentary on the times it was created. At least half a dozen times because every time I lend it to someone I know, he could appreciate his art at all levels, my copy won't come home, lol. The last time it took 7 years to replace it because it was out of print for VHS sales, it was never made as a DVD I know about and had to wait for one of the premium cable channels to run before I could record it again. My favorite aspect after the social commentary on the nails is Timny Woollard's paintings. I've been looking for 15 years to find someone or anywhere that could lead me to where her work is available for sale. Or an even better copy of the pictures in the movie without the final credits rolling over them. I have a room in the house that I devoted to making copies of my paintings, and no one seems to know if it has ever been published as a coffee table book or video aquarium, or as a documentary about her work. If anyone knows where I can get any copy of Timny's work or where her studio is in England, don't hesitate to contact me via email.
