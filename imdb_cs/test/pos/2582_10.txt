I knew as soon as I saw the first Black Snake Moan trailer I would have to see. I was not disappointed in the film, written and directed by the creator of Hustle and Flow Craig Brewer. This tells the story of a broken blues man and a nymphomaniac whom he wants to heal not only for her but also for his own ... but it's much more. It's complicated and rich, and you can handle a steep, sticky, sultry blue Memphis without feeling like you need a bath later. well written and executed. Accents and dialogue were flawless. However, there was one weak link in the chain: Justin Timberlake. The best thing I can say for him is that he can go crying ... he's a rare male actor who can cry convincingly. However, Justin's Ronnie was flat, but as an actor he tried very hard. I would definitely give him another chance. Lazarus and Rae (Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci) have great chemistry and mutual respect. This is one of those films, no matter how good an actor is, if the other is not on the job, and fortunately both actors have done their job. The music was a bit good as you would expect, especially when Samuel L. Jackson sings the blues. Phenomenal. <br /> <br /> On the technical side, everything I saw was brilliant. He was well groomed, well shot and well mixed ... everything was great. The character and scenography were fine, casting support characters (even Justin Timberlake and especially Kim Richards) was in place ... She loved it.
