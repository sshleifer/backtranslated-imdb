What's your crazy problem? Do you have anything better than sitting on your fat ass and blog about how to find something in bad taste? Here's the idea: Go out. That's right: Walk out of your mom's basement where you lived for 13 years and GO OUTSIDE. "But I can't leave! Star Trek is in 30 minutes and I got married to this World of Warcraft avatar!" Oh my God, in that case, stay inside! Well, maybe I went over there. Star Trek is fine, but I'm not looking at it anymore. Either way, you really have to write crap about the Mind of Mencia. It's a good show. Maybe you just blew your anger because the girl fired you on World of Warcraft. Or you're constipated. Try putting fiber in your diet.
