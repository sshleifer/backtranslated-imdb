Two great stars and a legendary director have created a wonderful story of vibrant love that is unforgettable and moves on many levels. Henry King directed Jennifer Jones in her first song Song of Bernadette and again directed by Jennifer Jones this film, and Miss Jones is perfect in this role and gives a strange, beautiful performance that captures the conflict in the character and Bill Holden who, after a home run in 1950 with a home hit, played a series of hit films starting with Sunset Blvd, Stalag 17, Born Yesterday, Country Girl, Picnic, and of course River Kwai is great in this role. Imagine someone other than Holden in this movie loved the end and wept every time I saw it. For everyone who has loved and lost, you will understand. For those who don't, you won't.
