This is the second Hitchcock movie to appear on the list, and the second Hitchcock movie I saw in its entirety was Rope, which I really enjoyed. There was more room with Saboteur Hitchcock to wander while Rope was held in one room. I didn't like this as much as a rope, but it doesn't say it's a bad movie, it just looks like an average movie that could have been something more. It seems that the Hitchcock movie would do as a break between his more serious ones. As a thriller, I feel that I have not managed to get to the edge of my place or deal with a leading figure running around the states. The film's climax appears to be a flawed opportunity to truly accelerate tension. There is almost no sound design. You can hear their dialogue and a little environment around them, but important things are missing, stitches torn from the sleeve, the need for music to amplify the tension, all missing. There is no doubt about it, but it lacks the emotional strike that one would want from such a scene. Then it ends suddenly leaves you empty inside. The film does not feel it should be, they are almost a globe trotting from place to place, but it's more limited. The script itself is very mediocre and seems to be a blunt way to get the plot moving. The performances are there, but nothing wonderful. Everyone plays their parts to write words on the page. The relationship between the two leaders is weak and requires more work. One of them is Otto Kruger, who has a rich, ego, evil personality who is on his heels. Finally, I wanted more from this. I understand it's one of the least exciting Hitchcock movies, but I had a good time watching him. I can recommend it, just not enthusiastically.
