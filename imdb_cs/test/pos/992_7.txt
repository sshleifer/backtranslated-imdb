Above all, it is love in World War II, but we must realize that it is also a biot for Dylan Thomas and his surroundings at this stage of his life. The timing of the movie is just great. It really captures what I think would be a ghost at that time; he smiled, hoping you wouldn't be bombarded. Although it may prove boring to some, the film has a particularly dangerous edge to it. <br /> <br /> At one point my heart raced to the end when the film hit its peak. It really features some annoying moments that are handled with the skill of four major actors. Cillian Murphy is fine here, just like Matthew Rhys. Both are polar opposites and it makes interesting watches. The relationship between Sienna Miller and Keira Knightley is amazing and we have the honor to thank (and watch out for Suggs 'Madness' portraits). Despite all this, it's a rather slow movie. Along with being shy for two hours, it's pretty slog to get to the conclusion. Overall, it's a solid non-fiction war movie with many wonderfully created moments that have been undoubtedly helped by the wonderful number of famous British names behind the scenes. But it sometimes does so much. Still worth watching. 7/10
