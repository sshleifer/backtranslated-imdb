It is an extremely involved series that is well cast and portrays a sensitive subject with great splendor. We follow Michael Ealy as FBI secret agent Darwyn, who is about to break into a terrorist cell led by Farik (Oder Fehr). The series is very well written, and has enough plot twists to keep you sitting on the edge of your seat waiting for anything to go on. Michael Ealy is, in my opinion, one of the best actors I've ever seen showing a secret agent. Outside cold ice, but still a good man who was trying to keep his head above the water in the heavily emotional rollercoaster ride the FBI had taken. Oder Fehr, on the other hand, comes from the guy who might come in handy in a social scenario. Big and strong, but still able to disappear into the gray matter if needed. Highly authoritative and very smart. The way they both communicate on the screen is nothing less than spectacular. The way the story evolves and the level of detail the script offers makes the story extremely credible and also very true to life I imagine. It is so large that you have left with a feeling of uncertainty, not knowing what might happen in real life. Every day we read about horror, and here we have a good sneak into the underworld, of which most of us know very little. It's a series that will surely bring you another one, sitting there on the edge of your seat, waiting for the next weeks. She's a sure winner in my eyes and I have no trouble with this series being on my list of best times.
