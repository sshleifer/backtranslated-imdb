If you're fine with the overwhelming work of the Italian premier horror director, able to accept his outrageous storyline and beautiful style, then you should have a great time with Opera. If not, then you will not. Cristina Marsillach plays Betty, a beautiful young opera musician who is exposed to fame (in Macbeth's avant-garde production) when the show star is hit by a car. As each of those who have a "plate awareness" will know, Macbeth is a production that bears a curse, and Betty soon discovers that the show he is now a star is no exception: the killer systematically harasses Theater staff? and poor Betty is forced to watch a sadistic killer (who records the needles under her eyes to stop her!). With the help of a little girl who walks through the air - conductor, her director and agent, and a few ravens who have seen the killer's face (!!!), Betty discovers the killer's identity and the truth about her mysterious past. Let's face it ... Opera is one crazy movie, with its nonsensical plot, intricate mortal scenes and the end that beg faith. And while director Dario Argento has never been one of them, say, conventional storylines, this particular giallo is so stupid and presents many of his stylish, stylish expressions (they all grow to the max) that it's almost as if he sees every subsequent film what he manages to get away (sometimes almost parodying his earlier work). <br /> <br /> That's exactly why I find the movie so fun !!! Argento camera movements are absolutely incredible: gliding, creeping and in one amazing scene, even swooping around the opera above the audience; the power of Verdi's music is perfectly combined with the synthesis of Claudio Simonetti's majesty score, which provides a suitably spectacular accompaniment to magnificent visual images; and several excellent set-pieces (featuring Serge Stivaletti's nauseating gore FX) go show that no-one makes death better than Argento (look at one character's overwhelming demise in which a bullet goes through a spy hole in the door in slow motion) \ t right in the eye!). <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10, rounded to 8 for IMDb.
