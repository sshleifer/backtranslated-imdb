Two horse merchants arrive in the city and meet the leader of the Mormon Group who are bound to the valley where they can settle down and live in peace. The scenes of the corral in the city where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson are negotiating, and Bond introducing their idea (Johnson and his partner played by Harry Carey Jr.), who lead the train to this valley, are some of the best in the movie, as Johnson, the real cowboy, it fades a piece of wood while he pokes with Bond. Once on the road they come to Joanne Dru, who may have seen John Ford on the Red River, and offered her a much better part in this movie. There are a number of notable characters in Morman's train. The Mormans are a mild group that is being challenged by a truly low-energy group of outlaws. In their case (outlaws), in the case of people on the train, and later the band Navajos whom they meet, and in well-written characters played by Ben Johnson and Ward Bond, the film completely avoids stereotypes, while the Camera seems to spend so much time that it gives the viewer a picture of Monument Valley, which frames the train as it moves along with several water transitions along the way, in stunning black and white, and then returns to what is happening in this rolled community. to accompany the beautiful vocalizations of the sons of the pioneers.
