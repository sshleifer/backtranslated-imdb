When I checked 3 of 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I'd get them all now. Dad's army, it's my favorite sitcom, it's not half hot mom's also a classic as you Rang M'Lord. I don't consider Hi De Hi a classic, but it's still funny. It's about a holiday camp, like Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow cloaks. This is Jeffery Fairbrother's run, a good-looking man, but he has a sock personality. Employees include the fun entertainment manager Ted, his sidekick Spike (he ended up being thrown into the pool by almost every episode), the yellow coat Gladys, the careless Peggy maid who longed to be a yellow coat and Punch and Judy the man Mr. Partridge who hates kids. The situation was mostly around the pool where someone in every episode (with the clothes of course) would be thrown. <br /> <br /> It's not classic, but it's still funny. Jeffery Fairbrother left halfway, so this, like just fools and horses, overcame his welcome. Jimmy Perry was actually a red coat in Butlins. Best Episode: Peggy's Big Chance, Series 2, Episode 2.
