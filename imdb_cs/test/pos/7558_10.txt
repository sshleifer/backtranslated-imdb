A Great Look at the Sixties Through the Eyes of Four Friends of Their Student Days in 1960 to Reunion Ten Years Later - A Yugoslav immigrant in love with an American dream and an effort to deal with the often violent reality; son of a prematurely balding businessman; soldier; and crazy hippie girl they love. Good direction and strong cast do justice to Steve Tesich's brilliant scenario; Dialogue is not as clever as in "Breaking Away," but the topics of cultivation and conflict between father and son are treated equally well, and there are still several beautifully comical moments between shock and drama.
