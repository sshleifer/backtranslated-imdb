If this film is examined in detail, it's a little sad. It is detailed enough to address the very real problems of children growing up in bad, dysfunctional environments. Yet he retains his comedic value, with daring performances by Diahann Carroll and James Earl Jones. Sadness lies in the struggles and dysfunction of the mother (Carroll), which cannot really help her children, not because she does not want or try, but because it is obvious she does not know how. Remember, it's a comedy, but if you've never seen it, or if you have, watch this movie and see humanity, in characters. A good movie.
