Talk about your classics! Ernie Fossilus (Foss From Here Out) came up with a cute and creative trailer absolutely spoofing Star Wars. This jewel is so stuck that it is loaded with honors and gags. Not only did Star Wars make new problems with the new effects, then the Hardware Wars did the same! Talk about a spoof that just won't die! That's why George Lucas calls it his favorite parody. He was so impressed that he hired Foss to work on "The Return of the Jedi" (Don't Trust Me, Check His Record in IMDb!) <br /> <br /> This must be the first and in my opinion, the best parody ever done. I think the Special Edition was a bit exaggerated, but for thought, I think it's perfect for a modern day Star Wars re-release, and it proves that sometimes it is wrong to keep up with perfection. Yes, it's only 10 minutes, but it's worth your time. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss $ 3 goodbye! Well, maybe 15 on DVD, but you'll be really happy you did it.
