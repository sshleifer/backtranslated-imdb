I first saw it in the theater in 1969 when I was nine and fell in love with it immediately. I am sad that Sony has not seen it appropriate to release on DVD ("but one day, one day ..."). I recently got a copy of this VHS on eBay and sat down to watch it 39 years later. I'm glad to announce that he's still a test of time. Acting is spot-on, John Williams' orchestrations are fresh and Leslie Bricusse's songs unforgettable ("When I'm Elder," "You and I," "Fill the World With Love," "London's London" are just a few of it. There's not much to say about Peter O 'Toole, Petula Clarke, Michael Redgrave, and Michael Bryant's acting, Terence Rattigan deserves A + for his update of James Hilton's story. A CD with lots of bonuses that Sony would hurry to do with the movie.
