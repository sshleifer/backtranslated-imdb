"Mishima: Life in Four Chapters" is a visually stunning production that handles complex problems with evocative ease. It is based on the life of controversial Japanese author Yukio Mishima, who committed suicide in the 1970s. It is not a biopsy - at least one in the traditional sense - but an examination of Mishim's iconoclastic creation. The film succeeds in presenting abstract concepts in an uninitiated, intriguing manner. Paul Schrader makes you sympathize with Mishima without having to deconstruct him. It's not a complete puzzle to solve, but it does. Added Bonus: As we see Mishim's fury at the lack of tradition in a morally relaxed modern society, Schrader gives us an excellent example of the dichotomy between thinking and execution in the cinema. John Bailey's cinematography is amazingly good. The generosity of Philip Glass's work is perfectly suited to this project. "Mishima" is the best movie I've seen this year.
