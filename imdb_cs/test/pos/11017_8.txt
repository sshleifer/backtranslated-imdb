Niagra Niagra was definitely not the best movie I saw. However, I cannot describe the way the film watched me while watching, and how I felt how it ended, and how I felt. Very few movies have such an impact on me. I like it or not. I look at Niagra Niagra as a work of art. We all see something in it and can remind us of something, or it can instill fear or fun, etc. This movie didn't have me in the best mood. In fact, it somehow left me. I think the lives of the two people were so empty. They had no direction. Their only direction was to have no direction. They had many problems to deal with, and I think we need to get away from what could not have been a happy life. But on how things really got worse. Permanent decline from where it started. It was sad because it was so well done and I think we all most likely saw someone in a situation that might somehow resemble the situation in which they were. They could have had a good life if they had an idea of ​​how. But it's clear they didn't know what to do. So they're kind of Rambled that they heard something. No real goal. They had no idea how to have a goal. They had no idea how to overcome the life built before them. I felt bad, but I couldn't stop watching the movie. Only good actors can bother me so much about a movie that I wouldn't like if it was played. These two did a great job to the point where you didn't see acting. I am very impressed and want to buy a movie when it is available on DVD. You know. I felt a bit like Leaving Los Vegas. But again it's in its own classroom. It's not a great movie, but it's worth an hour or two on the right day. If you are a person with problems, I do not recommend that you view it. That could push you. This depressed me and I do not have the conditions that these people had. JimmyJoeJetter
