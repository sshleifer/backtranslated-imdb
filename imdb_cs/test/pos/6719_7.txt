Although it hardly compares it to other sci-fi film giants like 2001: SPACE ODYSSEY or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THIRD TYPES, LIFEFORCE works as a totally shocking and bizarre fusion of science fiction and horror elements. Despite the dialogue that takes on the ridiculous and acting behavior that does the same, he manages to work for several very different elements. Loosely based on Colin Wilson's 1976 novel "The Space Vampires" by Tobe Hooper (POLTERGEIST; TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE) focuses on a joint US-British mission aboard the British space shuttle Churchill to study Halley's comet . Led by the US commander (Steve Railsback), they discover a spaceship in a stranger's coma. And when they examine the interior of the spacecraft, they will find strangers who look like giant bats. Later, Churchill reaches Earth's orbit, but no response is given from radio talks published from the home base of the mission, the Space Research Center in London. Columbia is launched to meet Churchill, but they find an entire ship gutted by fire - all except for extraterrestrial beings enclosed in glass who, far from being unaffected by fire, seem utterly perfect. Aliens are being bought back to Earth ... and that's where incredible things are happening. These cosmic vampires escape from the Space Research Center, and instead of injecting their blood with their blood victims, sucking their victims "Life is completely out of them." One of them is Space Girl, a thoroughly naked vampire played by Mathilda May. Railsback, the only real survivor from Churchill, is bought by the chief of SRC (Frank Finlay) and British specialist (Peter Firth) to watch May, who is in telepathic contact with him. Soon, however, vampires turned from London to a pure Holocaust scene; People are either dessicated or turning into zombies, and the threat of NATO to sterilize a city with thermonuclear radiation floats large. Railsback finally catches up with May, and sacrifices herself by taking her with a large metal saber. Undoubtedly discontinuous, undeniably uneven, but still worth watching, LIFEFORCE, despite the frequent mismatch of its script and its acting, benefits from some of the drop-dead outstanding special effects of John Dykstra (STAR ​​WARS) , some of the best ever seen. Another surprise feature is Henry Mancini's incredible orchestral score, almost Wagnerian as well as John Williams's score for STAR WARS - and Mancini, like Williams in front of him, uses the London Symphony Orchestra at the start! To a large extent forgotten these days, and the critical and treasury catastrophe in 1985, LIFEFORCE, if for no other reason, it should still be seen for anyone looking for bizarre. There had never been a movie before, like it was, and it certainly wouldn't be like that.
