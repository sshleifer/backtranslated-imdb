I put this movie on not expecting much, other than the B movie gore fest. Fortunately, I was presented with a very well-made film that built tension and managed to keep it throughout the run. That was a great success. The meeting was solid, forming the characters you cared for and related to; and although some may find the movie slow, it made you think about what you would do in the same situation. A great camera added to it, and the directors admire it admirably. A great effort that is worth your time if you prefer development and tension over the gore.
