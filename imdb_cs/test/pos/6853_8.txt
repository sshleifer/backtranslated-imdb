(spoilers?) <br /> <br /> I've heard some shocks about special effects. But that should discourage the film. The movie is a thrilling movie. And it's very good. So from this point of view, this film rocks. Franke Rocks. Enjoy the content of your plastic heart. So there are no complaints for this movie. If you don't watch English oak, which is an absolute farce. This creates the illusion that it is a B movie. <br /> <br /> One complaint I have is a music video on DVD. He doesn't say who sings it. I'd like to know. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 5/10
