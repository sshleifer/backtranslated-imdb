I have to say: all modern Korean martial arts films are worth checking. It wasn't as epic as Musa-The Warriors and it didn't even develop characters, but it had many nice ideas. A simple story: an elite soldier thought he was dead, returning after years to end Japanese rule in Korea in medieval days. His counterpart was previously the best friend he had, and now he's out to stop him. Combat scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very fun to watch. The characters motifs are first discovered near the end. You may need to follow again to get all the connections properly. And I personally ... I loved the end. I could watch it over and over again. Maybe a bit pathetic, but the real story of a freedom fighter ... People can be killed, but not the ideas that are worth it.
