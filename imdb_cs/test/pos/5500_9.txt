'In a line of fire' is one of those Hollywood movies that appear quite a lot on TV, but even though I've seen it several times, I usually end up sitting around the whole thing again. Why? - It's good! Clint Eastwood is great, as usual, and the character he plays is interesting and more tried than usual. Character, secret service agent Frank Horrigan, is being persecuted for being in detail who could not protect President Kennedy in Dallas, and is now forced to wrestle with a professional killer who openly claims to kill the president. . However, the film does not make him depressed, tense and obsessed with character. It is charming and personality and is realistic as a person who has experienced a lot in life and is comfortable in his / her own skin. He is even quite convincing when he flirts with a younger agent who plays Rene Russo. The killer, played by John Malkovich at his best, is a cerebral, intentional, and likes to play high stakes games of life and death. It's even the name of another presidential murderer, John Booth. The film is always enjoyable and brings all the goods - tension, action, romance and drama - all in the right amount. It's a fun movie that great actors really do!
