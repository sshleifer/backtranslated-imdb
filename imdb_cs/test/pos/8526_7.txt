When I first saw it on the tape, about 10 years after its release, I thought it was one of James Bond's better films. However, after seeing it again at the turn of the century, I was disappointed. I think it's a bit overestimated just because the critics were so happy that Sean Connery ended his 12-year-old hiatus from playing Bond that they don't dare to criticize the movie. What disappointed me was over. After investing two hours in the movie, you expect a less hockey, more satisfying ending. And it can be nitpicking, but I was disappointed when I didn't see regular actors in support roles like Miss Moneypenny, Q, Felix Leiter, etc. and the two villains were interesting. I thought Klaus Maria Brandauer was more interesting from the two because he was so low and looked like a "nice guy next door." He wasn't your normal Bond villain. It had a lot of "skin," for PG movie, especially with Kim Basinger playing, never being an actress known for hiding her character. The tongue was very tame, but most Bond movies are pretty good in this department. All in all, it's "fair" Bond and nothing else. Just because Connery's in it doesn't mean it's good. Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan have shown that they could also play a role well.
