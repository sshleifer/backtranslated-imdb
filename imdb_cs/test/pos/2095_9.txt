The third movie I watched at the philly film festival was this excellent drama from Japan. After escaping from prison, nine escaped convicts plan to find a "key to the universe," which the tenth convict did not tell them. On the way we know each of these men pretty well. Everyone has their own dreams. For much of the movie it seems to be mostly comedy, but the shift occurs that the film ends in a tragedy. All actors give great performances. I can't say much more without spoiling it, but it's enough to say that you will end up for some of these individuals. In 2 hours, this film is long, but still good. I have no criticisms that would recommend it with a warning that it has a somewhat disturbing violence for tender love. Toshiaki Toyoda hit home run this time, so I wanted to look for his previous films and look forward to his future. <br /> <br /> My Class: A
