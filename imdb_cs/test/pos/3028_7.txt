Style over cloth. But what is the style. "The Cell" is the inner version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, the story hardly supports visuals. Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) goes to her patients' dreams with artificial means to discover and help them come up with phobia and obsession. A new patient who is unconscious is alerted to the FBI. He is a serial killer who drowns his female victims, then presents his body in grotesque scenarios such as dummies. Deane has to enter the mind of the killer and walk with her sick fantasies to find and save his last victim. Director Tarsem Singh has incredible visions and pieces for this production. Each dream sequence is like a nightmare-ish image in motion, from landscape to costume. But the plot suffers from a lack of history of his characters. Stargher is the only person with a thorough background and is the last person you want to care for. Essentially, without it, you have a film that only moves in the present tense, which is a shame because the film is so visually stunning and truly scary. Lopez is useless, but just as amazing an actress, though she is as beautiful as ever. And Vince Vaughn? I don't even know why he was chosen. This is not his forte and he tosses up. He tried too hard to become his character and it turned out. Stay with the comedy, Vince! Still, this film is so visually scary, I still watch this movie with lights on and I can never fall asleep right afterwards.
