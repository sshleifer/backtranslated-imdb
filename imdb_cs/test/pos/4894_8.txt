After three outstanding BBC TV series and Christmas specials, the bizarre and grotesque (yet perversely loving) characters of the bleak fictional city of Royston Vasey make a jump to the celluloid, along with their creators - the Lords League. Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith are more famous three-quarters of the foursome, with central roles shared between the trio. Team member Jeremy Dyson is portrayed by actor Michael Sheen. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Dyson (Sheen) is in conversation with his writing cohorts, when - the horror of horrors - is visited by two of his most serious characters. Both Tubbs (Pemberton) and Edward Tattsyrup (Shearsmith) are unhappy at The League's decision to kill the Vasey residents. "You're not real!" Screaming Dyson in vain as local merchants from hell just take revenge. Mayhem follows, as reality and Vasey converge with a huge number of characters entering our world to save theirs. Confused? You'll be like an inutendo-ridden Germanic camp, Herr Lipp (Pemberton) is forced to take Pemberton (Pemberton) on a daily wound while Pemberton (Pemberton) is kidnapped by cannibalist butcher Hillary Briss (Gatiss) and Geoff Tipps (Shearsmith). Briss tries to force Pemberton to rewrite the film - and so to continue his life - but to let Geoff in charge is not a good idea. The former comedian has become involved in the latest adventures of The League - the post-Vasey adventure - King's Evil - entering the typically twisted 17th-century England, complete with portraits of Victoria Wood, Peter Kay and David Warner. Known as George of Asda (due to his vintage line of clothing), Geoff rescues the day and is treated as a hero, but for the denouement of the film, he joins the characters old and new at Royston Vasey's church to meet their creators. <br /> <br /> For fans of the series, the film is a must-see. And yes, it is Papa Lazarou (though a little too fast). The pearl-loving Pauline, Mickey, Barbara and the cursed veterinarian Matthew Chinnery are some of the other favorites at the show and the show itself (plus Sheen's as Dyson) is also a fascinating sight. The Gentlemen's League is Radiohead's British comedy - they are ambitious, pioneering (witnessing excellent three) and dissatisfied with rest on their laurels. They also share the opinion accordingly. Certainly, their mysterious sense of humor is not for every floor, and if not written exclusively for 'fans', understanding the story would benefit those who had previously viewed the series. However, the Apocalypse is a movie in its own right and the League will undoubtedly succeed in attracting a new breed of fans as well as appealing and enjoyable existing.
