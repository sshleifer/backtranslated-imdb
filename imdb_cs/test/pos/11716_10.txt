Meesteri Sharka, you look so ... normal. You would never get a table in this luxury cocktail restaurant / bistro. I on the other side and every day eat grapes and pate. Do you like my fur with all the fine cuts? My gold gold rings of gold? Or maybe these blondes, "say?", Bombs that are all qualified in aerobics and nude petanques that decorate my long, chestnut velvet sofa like so many soft boiled carrots on a plate of fried foie gras and figs. You like? You can't have it! Zey is all mine. Domino was the best except Maman. You don't understand the art of making love. Just look at your lower mustache. It's almost funny for me, no, to think of that ridiculous promontory on your silly face as you climb Domin's loving hill like a pig looking for truffles in the woods, a forest rising and swaying in the hot winds of desire! You'll lose Sharky again. <br /> <br /> When I love women, you know, Sharky, zey knows. Zey learns, zey learns until the zey becomes a teacher. Not nano-mathematics, the art of love. Domino was the seedling I watered. I watered it so often. Everywhere Sharky. Her scented petals, a proud stem, everywhere. She will dilapidate under your ridiculous hose, like a souffle removed from the oven for five minutes too soon. I have to go now, Sharky, you were so bored with your shameful behavior. It is you who will wash down le pissoir like a smelly thing. <br /> <br /> Bon Chance!
