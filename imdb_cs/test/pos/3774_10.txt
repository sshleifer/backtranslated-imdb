I loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was ideal for this role. More Classic sci / fie / horror movies should be redesigned to this level of comedy that is at the very top of the line in my opinion. No movie about drinking, laughing so hard that you will spill it all over. Can we expect more? Hopefully. I would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes has made several remake of classic movies. Dorian Gray's picture would be a good suggestion. I hope a producer or director gets into this idea and brings us a new comedy on our screens. we need a good comedy rebellion to make our laughter level higher than ever. Good comedy FIX.
