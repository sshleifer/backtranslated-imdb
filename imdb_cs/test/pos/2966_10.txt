I liked this movie. I wasn't sure what it was before I started to watch him, but I still enjoyed it. It was a girl (Meredith Monroe) whose mother didn't want to show up as she was. She meets and falls in love with a boy (Riley Smith), who is the city of a charity football game. It's a good movie. I just hope it will be again or come to video.
