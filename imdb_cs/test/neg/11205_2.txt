Look, this movie is terrible ... "conspiracy" includes twins who are neglected by the parents who have absorbed, leaving in the care a succession of babysitters and babies, all of whom are leaving because they are completely unpleasant. Finally, a child engineer ex-convicts Beverly D'Angelo that she is their new babysitter, does it matter to you why? And D'Angelo watches a TV talk show about selling children and decides to try to sell twins ... and, well, oh, you don't want to know. It's all very unpleasant and not funny at all. In fact, the announcer presented this film before coming to the TV channel I watched! Just don't bother wasting one moment of your life on this pile of waste.
