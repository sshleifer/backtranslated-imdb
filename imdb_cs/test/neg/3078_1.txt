More of the character study then the movie, COMMITTED is just another relationship frolic with trimmings specially for the young, target audience. The direction seems to be very basic, with obvious dramatic irony and the classic case of lost loser versus helpless committing. SHUTTLE is occasionally guarded and there is little originality from Lisa Krueger. Expected to be totally aimless for the first twenty minutes. We know Joline, but the movie goes up when her husband disappears. Joline goes to him. <br /> <br /> Some parts are special. At other times the film is moving. The other half is more funny when we see that Jolin's spiritual antiquity has become more intense. Annoying guitar music is terrible, but maybe it's a necessary evil as COMMITTED offers it. The average film that is hindered by some utterly unnecessary moments is COMMITTED's only benefit, Heather Graham and Patricia Velazquez.
