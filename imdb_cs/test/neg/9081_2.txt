Someone remembers an alternative comedy that shows COMMENTS. One edition featuring Charles Bronson (Robbie Coltrane) interviewed about his new film GLC: <br /> <br /> "It's about a person, an ordinary man whose wife and family are going to be horrified and have to catch them and kill them with sadistic and graphic "And after GLC, what's next for Bronson?" <br /> <br /> "We use the new angle. get erased, but I'm going crawling as well" <br /> <br It accurately describes that people do. It's a Bronson vigilante thriller where his motivation is not up to the litigation but it leads to credibility becoming tense <br /> <br /> Bronson is a retired hit-man who doesn't give up his retirement for anything other than someone shows him a videotape with interviews with "The Doctor", not a legendary traveler, but an infamous torture expert. It never really explains why the doctor is so infamous, because every police state has a myriad of these sadists, nor does it explain why the doctor and his sister have ridiculous English accents. film and incidents happen because the screenwriter needs to happen that he will continue to conspire no matter how unlikely they are, as one of the bad guys, invited to the trio to be killed or to reveal things like is a doctor's sister who is a lesbian, so some T&A can be included <br /> <br /> In many ways it's like one of those ugly Chuck Norris vehicles that was released at the same time, but the most disappointing is that the director is also the same man who made ICE Cold in ALEX and two very well-regarded war dramas in GUNS OF NAVERONE, which often appear Sunday afternoon. Believe me, this film won't be shown until after the river basin is over
