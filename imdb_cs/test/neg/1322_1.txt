What's fun. This is undoubtedly a low-class B movie. German elite StormTroopers attacked Russian bunkers in bulk as an old World War II battle. Negotiations are average, thin and fibrous. Sometimes it's hard to see where he goes. Action sequences are quite worthless (when it shows), except that they use authentic equipment / vehicles from World War II. This is in NO WAY at the same level as "Saving Pvt. Ryan" or "Platoon". Lots of worthless attempts to develop characters that go nowhere. Old theme good officer / bad officer who is highly predictable. Even the action sequences look like a 12 year old boy. I could have done better. Too bad it's the same guy who made "Das Boot (The Boat)" because it was a good movie. After this success, he had to take part because he lost this film. I bought it on DVD, I'd rather rent it.
