"Alien" is a story of foreign intrigue with Seagal in the center as a deep cover operative that has a package that everyone wants and are willing to kill to get. Flick is uninspired with the less common action things that Seagal put on the movie map (fire fighting, hand-to-hand combat, pyrotechnics, stunts, etc.) and another story that's intricate, uninteresting and full of insignificant filler. What activity seems to be peculiar and unreasonable, while Seagal, who is more and more resembling a pork chop, meanders this expressionless and bored expression with no fiber movement and shows no improvement in acting ability. Somewhere around "Glimmer Man" or "Fire Down" Seagal flick took his nose to dive and "Alien" is just a continuation of this trend. Nothing worth watching except the hardest Seagal fans. (C-)
