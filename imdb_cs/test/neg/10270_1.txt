Despite the all-star cast, this attempt at epic fails. It occurs as a set of flat cartoon stereotypes that are linked by too powerful, too clever social commentary. It's as if with every bit of dialogue and an introduction to the new character, the writer has looked out and said, "Isn't that clever? I'm not clever? Isn't that a biting social commentary?" Unfortunately, the answer is always "Ummmm ... no." Wearing self-absorbing things that are more like soap opera (in the worst sense of the word) than film ... and an obvious attempt at television immortality. Fortunately, she died young. Empire Falls falls.
