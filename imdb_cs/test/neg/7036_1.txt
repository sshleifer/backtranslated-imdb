one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but extremely funny (though not intentionally). Every scene that has something in common; plane, romance, script or gaming is wrong. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all pilots, it's so bad that at some point in the movie you should be laughing (see also Airport 79 Concorde for the same reason). Anyone else, avoid this movie as plague (except B-movie fans, of course) <br /> <br />
