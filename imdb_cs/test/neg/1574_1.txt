This attempt at "thriller" would have no substance at all! Some may say that this movie "has everything?" Autism, arson, robbery, lost love, sack of money, throat cuts, murder, blood, frayed nose, revolver, clenched teeth moaning, breasts (different definitions can be used), big flashlights, indigenous people, fraternal duo trying to out-portray "stupid and stupid," white wolves, fighting scenes that resemble "happy slap," snow mobile (s), large tracked vehicle, and motel under reconstruction? All this with the "Enyanesque" tune towards the end ... <br /> <br /> Maybe my review is a bit rough, but one tracking will definitely be enough for a healthy kinemafil with nothing else. <br /> <br /> Yeowza!
