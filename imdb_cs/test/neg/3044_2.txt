This is almost all I can say about this flat and uninspired Carol Kane remake of 1979. Camilla Belle is not much of an actress, and brings no energy and vitality to the role of Jill Johnson, a nanny bothered by anonymous phone callers. But if you're looking for some great home architecture and interior design ideas, this movie provides more inspiration than anything you see on TLC or HGTV. Jill spends almost 90 minutes wandering through the home of a wealthy doctor and wife, providing her with sitting services, looking for the origins of strange sounds and things that "come at night". Lurking around the corners and peers down the corridors, we will see a beautiful bathroom with its and its sinks that look like Roman baths, a huge kitchen with incredibly lit glass shelves and a piece of resistance, a separate aviary and a coy pond that has a self-irrigation system. As the film is not so convincing to drag us into Jill's fear, we are distracted by the grandeur of the house, which is not something you should do while watching a thriller. Even as Jill is watched by anonymous maniac, we cringe because she is breaking valuables and spoiling the coy pond, not because she is to be murdered. The film plods along as predictably as most teen slasher movies and the end is something different than the original. Before it was over, I wanted to find out where the house was and if it was real. Never mind Jill and the children she was watching. <br /> <br /> 2 stars - both for the house.
