Girl in Lane Lovers: 3 of 10: Homoerotic subtext in movies is a well known phenomenon. Lots of dissertations came out of film schools about hidden subtitles in Top Gun and Spartacus. The girl in Lover's Lane certainly fits into a homoerotic trope. In fact, it is so glaring and over the top even MST3K, who rarely notices such things in their riffing, just can't avoid it. The movie is about two drifters. One rich kid (Lowell Brown) running away from home with a hundred dollars and no street junk, the other is a professional hobo (Brett Halsey). Hobo rescues a kid from a gang of criminals and ends up in a small town consisting of a dining room, a billiard hall and a whorehouse. Our drift scholar gets a second look from a guest waitress (Joyce Meadows as the titular Girl in Lovers Lane), which has clearly passed since she was picky and whose only prospect is the creepy Jack Elam who impresses Steve Buscemi. <br /> <br /> It looks like a weird film on the surface to treat MST3K. While the casts are old for the characters they play, acting is actually pretty good with both Brett Halsey and Jack Elam giving solid performances. The story is mild but barely Robot vs. The Aztec mummy material and production values ​​are a cheap back lot but relatively competent. It's a strange Batman and his department of gay undercurrents that make this movie both horrible and merry. Halsey's worst objections to children are trying to get into girls, they're merry, his inability to commit to a waitress (or at least go through the first base), and dozens of views between him and the child; hand on shoulder, sleeping, blowing up data with girl to shave. You don't have to be Freud to find out this undercurrent.
