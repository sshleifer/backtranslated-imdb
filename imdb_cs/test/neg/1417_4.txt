Last night I saw a screening of this movie. I had great expectations, but I was definitely disappointed. Within 5 minutes of the launch of Williams, there is already a campaign under his presidency. And he becomes president in the first 40 minutes. So there is all that aspect of the movie. The first half hour is cheerful. Don't get me wrong, the movie has its moments. But after the first half hour it takes the worst. It becomes less comedy and more thriller / drama / love story ... which is useless. the movie goes nowhere and costs 30 minutes. there and there laugh laughter, but a consistently funny part is just beginning and just beginning. In one place, the greatest joy I have heard in the audience is when a man in the crowd shouted 'boooo' during a very confusing emotional scene. Williams gives great performance, right on par with his comic style. Walken also provides a strong support role as he can. I think one character who is underestimated is Lewis Black. Consistently vulgar and political, his funny to see him tone for PG-13 ratings. Overall, I wouldn't pay the movie. I finally saw it for free and I was even disappointed. The first half hour is stiff and hence everything. In fact, the film does not realize that it should be halfway through the fact that it should be no more than a one-hour comedy center. 4.5 / 10
