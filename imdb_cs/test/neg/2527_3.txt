While everyone is doing a decent job in this movie, I agree with another comment: it's too loose and scattered, too much like a script-free experiment with really talented actors. As such, it is not enough to keep your attention. I said there are a few really funny moments, one of which includes Dylan McDermott and a flaming glass that I think anyone who was so drunk would be as fun as I am; the second is a fraction of a second with an inflatable dinosaur. Crispin Glover makes his usual nut twitch-fest guy and makes it okay, Harry Dean Stanton makes his usual nut patriarch (Repo Man, Anyone?) Etc. Good cast, not enough to keep it going. Just a few gems, a few seconds.
