Let me start with a personal comment as a film and television enthusiast, more about life enjoyment: I love what James Woods can do and what he has done, and I always love Melanie Griffith and Natasha Wagner were in this terrible, miserable, smelly "true crime" essay. Whoever wrote this film probably never spent any time talking to real criminals with real criminal talent: yes, some thieves are drug addicts, but they have a very short career as thieves. Really successful thieves are rarely caught because they don't make "junk" or drugs before they go to score (work). James Woods' character was true to this paradigm at the beginning of this film, and then the script fell apart. It turns into a furious, alcoholic lunatic .... nice work for a guy with a high tension like Woods, maybe, but not a little believable. Most criminals are lazy. If they wanted to work, they should work. These people in this movie are beautiful, self-confident, drug addicts. They couldn't get rid of the real score in the real world, in the real world, where there is a big and muscular guard who beats a living hell out of a thin guy (as it happens in the early scenes of this "DOG"), keeps him defeated and not let him get up. How many times have I found out that I hate this movie? Many. Even totally vulgar people - like most thieves and drug addicts - have more vocabulary than these assholes. And rip-off scenes with neo-Nazi cyclists? Puhlease. All rednecks are not neo-Nazis and those who are neo-Nazi speed sellers are not that stupid !! This film made two because Natasha Wagner was in her role as Rose and extremely good. because Melanie Griffith still has "something special", or at least she had it for this brutal and insulting silly movie. I am not one who for some reason sings the praise of real criminals, but the reality of these criminal types in this horrible movie is that they would all be dead or in jail under Law # 2, Scene 1. Watching the crappy Zombie movie would be a time better spent than this .... thing ... and i hate zombies.
