I own this movie. And it's hard to find. This is a unique low budget little gore movie about a doctor looking for a perfect companion. He has a really humorous low budget for it, and gore is surprisingly good for what seems to be a $ 500 budget. The director is claimed to be a gore master. I wouldn't go that far, but maybe in his time he was. Total 6/10 on the gore chart.
