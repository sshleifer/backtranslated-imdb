Revisionist history - making the evil Marquis de Sade semi-heroic romance - is pretty overwhelming. But scary acting, amateur cinematography and horrible dubbing make this film painfully wrong. The only reason to watch is that almost all the women in the movie are wonderful. And incredibly, torture for several days, with hands tied overhead, obviously does not hurt female beauty, hairstyle and makeup. My guess is that the producers shot mostly in Russia, they chose women for their looks - and the willingness to work cheaply - rather than the actors. If you decide to follow this because you have nothing better, or if you are a film student looking for bad examples, he quickly progresses through every scene that does not involve nudity.
