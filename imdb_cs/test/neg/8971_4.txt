This is to a large extent very haughty and patronizing. The whole conspiracy is extremely enforced - especially "gallant" efforts to save college from ruins, and the moralistic subtext (especially the front lady) is growing a little. But there is one or two comic moments that help alleviate boredom, and dance is pretty fun (especially for alleged amateurs - ha, ha!) <br /> <br /> Store owner and young the guy who makes a great stepping was the main point. And I also liked Peter Hayes from Charles Laughton and Ronald Coleman.
