A modern scary movie? Yeah, that's .. <br /> <br /> Hippies, peaceniks and environmentalists have teamed up to give us a horrible movie. I didn't recognize it when I watched it just two years ago that it was a movie of fear, but that's exactly what it is .. <br /> <br /> There's no difference between this movie and the Nazi films about us in ww2 and the same movies we are about them. This is pure propaganda and speaks only to those. Believing in Aliens, Conspiracy Conspiracy 9/11, False Moon Landing, Top Oil and Significant Environmental Approach What can I say is that this movie makes buttons, asks you and eventually forgets it. .. so if your scarred gets to your home, you lock the door and put it to a nuclear winter, we all know it comes when Bush provokes the Chinese into a nuclear war.
