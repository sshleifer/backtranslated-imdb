Its hard to decide where to start. I bought it for a few pounds and its worst couple quid Iv ever wasted. The back of the DVD had no pictures and a few lines, a summary, it was supposed to warn me, but I usually like bad movies for laughter, so I decided it was possible. The film consists of three stories, each rotating around someone who has been in a particular bus in one particular place (it was never clear what the meaning of the bus is, or what city of its setting) <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILERS (as if there was something that should be spoiled) The first story is about a man who is persuaded by a car to cleanse him against the wishes of his wife. his life. The second is about a person who never cleans the refrigerator and grows monster bacteria out of it. The third about a woman who goes to a dating agency just to find out her date isnt it all normal. Among these, we treat the shots of the bus (or bus as well), while the whittles narrator on the load of garbage for relationships (really, like him, is on behalf of being called 'relationships' ) <br /> <br /> The film doesn't have any redemption features anything. The actor, costumes and little Spfx are all vile Tent.There arent neither any attractive female cast members to admire.Simply gave, this film is a debacle.
