When I saw 6.0 on IMDb, I was quite impressed and excited to watch this movie, as 6 for horror should be rather fun. At first I thought it would be some disturbing, invisible evil force (which did not read the book) to scare the audience - but it turned out to be something that is more mundane - killer plants. Regardless of the film, I'm somewhat open-minded, so I thought the movie could bring some breakthrough in carnivorous vineyards. Unfortunately, I failed to meet my expectations because of the excessive amount of cliché and lack of any originality. To top it off, the female lead character continues to get mad with you with her stupidity. If a movie is not a deliberately bad B-rated movie that is fun in annoyance, no movie would ever have a main character that irritates you if one expects to take care of the character. These roles should be reserved for secondary characters. The characters were undeveloped, the monsters (plants in this case) remained inexplicable, and clichés dripped everywhere. The only thing that is slightly effective is some bloody / bloody scenes, even when gore fades. compared to films like High Tension or Ichi The Killer. A consistently unsuccessful logic (for example, why a character during the second attempt to descend into the ruin would not observe the top of the rope when it was cracked and almost killed someone), even if it is small, adds and continues to anger the audience. The film might save itself by using characters or some sort of narrative device to reprimand or "redeem" idiot characters who only did something stupid (or at least let the character recognize or repent of her own mistakes). But continuing to allow the idiots to preside over will certainly cause the audience to abandon all character care, again taking away the horror of the film. Overall, it's a bad movie. An example of a well-made film that includes a total of twenty years of killing is a remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre massacre (and also the prequel), which certainly instilled fear and had much smaller character logical errors. In short, if you have a lot of time to kill, look at it if there is nothing else. Otherwise, do not waste your time with this sub-par movie and go see something really scary and highly satisfying as the Hills have eyes remake.
