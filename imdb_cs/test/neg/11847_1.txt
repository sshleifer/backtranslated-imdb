This movie is a failed, dead attempt to try to combine several bad movies and make some extra-bad movie. This fails even in this, because there are too many "conspiracies" and not so much goofy puppets and ridiculous gore. Seriously, the puppets are sweet and the boys in suits melt quite well. The performances are at best C-grade and lame whole, with special props on Spec-Ops guy who talked about some bizarre East Coast / Venus dialect that was almost impossible to decipher. Not that you really care about what he says, because only the cursed words are different. Cinematographically, it is non-offensive, almost what you would expect from low-rent straight-to-video offal (as well as a script). The fact that New Concorde used footage from the "Carnosaur" movies is offensive and quite confusing. For stud, New Concorde. For shame. "Carnosaur" is one of my favorite horrible movies. Watch "Carnosaur" movies to see the shocking dinosaur chaos. I give him one star because I like the movies he steals from and also because the scale is zero.
