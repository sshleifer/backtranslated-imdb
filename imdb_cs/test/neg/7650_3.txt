John Sayles, what have you done? "Silver City" had moments in which I saw a glimpse of hope for a good story, well-built characters, a dialogue provoking thoughts. And these moments would then quickly cover the layers of bad writing, clumsy direction, and abysmal action. I really love almost all the work of John Sayles, but "Silver City" is scary. I felt that Sayles might be working at the beginning of a good story about illegal work and industry. Corruption plot lines, but then got rushed and stuck the secondary plot line satirizing the Bush administration on it. In fact, these two stories do not link each other and the weaker elements of the political theme dominate the first three quarters of the film, causing the loss of patience with the entire affair. Another major mistake is Danny Huston's performance. His dialogue in each scene comes with a gawping grin, regardless of its suitability for mood. I hated the guy for the end of the movie because I was alerted to every bad actor in every high school game I ever saw. I haven't seen Huston in anything else, I don't know whether to blame him or blame Sayles's direction. Despite being an unfortunate focus of a very unfortunate film. Right up to the last toboggan-subtle final scene, I was disappointed with "Silver City". Sayles to his best, or damn, even Sayles to average, can be so much better than this movie. Instead, read ANY of his other work. It's not even for renting.
