Choose a stereotype, any stereotype (whether racial, sexual, cultural, etc.) And I bet you'll find it in Wassup Rockers. Do you think all Hispanic teen boys are stupid, furry, incomprehensible and dirty troublemakers? Are Hispanic sex girls crazy, easy, ass-baring sluts? Do all blacks want to start fighting and carrying weapons? Do all homosexuals throw a themed party with pink drinks and ask young boys to take a model for them? Are all the white teen girls rich, stuck princesses bored with white teen boys looking for something a little more dangerous? If you answered "yes" to any of the previous questions, you, my friend, are a bigoted player and you will be LOVE Wassup Rockers. Director Larry Clark likes to shock his audience (I was 15 years old) old first time I saw kids and I think that's why I'm still a virgin) but Wassup Rockers isn't shocking ?? it's just bad. They try to be nervous and realistic with minimal dialogue and detailed body-hairs, but these characters and this story are completely unrealistic. Simply put, Wassup Rockers is a fantasy teen boy. What a 14-year-old boy doesn't want to be a skater who gets into trouble, crashes at a party, drinks 40 years and is told by a hot, rich, white girl that his uncircumcised penis "looks dangerous?" Besides demographic, I really don't know who will enjoy this movie.
