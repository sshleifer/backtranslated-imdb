This was real for me. The original white-haired bride is a great kung fu fantasy movie, but this was pretty weak. I was not interested in new characters at all, which unfortunately dominated the screen and the story was not well developed. While the first film was tragic and included this one was boring (as I just counted the time until the end when the unhappy lovers actually meet). This action was poor in this one. The fighting was not choreographic very well and there really wasn't much kung fu at all. Just a few weak sword fights between the highly sympathetic Lui and one of Lin's wives. Lin mainly uses a kind of telekinesis to throw people into the walls and sometimes into the hair, away from the impressive whip and kung fu depiction she showed in the previous film. I still gave this movie 4 because at least it was a fast pace and I wanted to see what was going to happen at the end, though (like most people who watched the first one) predicted it would go as it went. and after seeing it, I found it to be antis climactic and wished they either made a proper sequel or simply left the story alone. I really recommend the first one, but as for the continuation of the genre fans only and those who really want to see Lin as a bride once again pay.
