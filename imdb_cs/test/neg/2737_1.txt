This movie is a great movie ONLY if you need to sit and laugh at its stupidity. As a geologist, this film gets the most important facts wrong and uses actors who are too young to be considered the top of their fields. Interestingly, it turns out that lava flows in massive caves below the earth's surface. It is also funny, as it turned out, that seismically active regions have massive destruction since the 6.5 magnitude earthquake. They seem to forget that building standards in these areas would be higher if more earthquakes were needed to do so. It is also funny how much it is that the coastline of Washington State and also Oregon look like it is a nice beach in southern California. The analogy of Jelly analogs is very entertaining, although the way it is used is wrong. The director does a good job of adding more comic relief to a PhD.
