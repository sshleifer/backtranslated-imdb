What is it !! it's so bad. The animation looks so awful, it looks like a ps1 game. Actors are terrible, they just can't act to save their lives. I sat the whole movie and I was upset when I realized I had wasted 3 hours of my life. Didn't I hear about this movie, did it actually come out at the movies or did it go straight to DVD? The girl was shot?! What's wrong with that was just a silly movie. They completely copied "The Day After Tomorrow". It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would definitely recommend to people not to waste time. You can spend your time watching "The Day After Tomorrow", its much better. Well that's what I think about the movie. In fact, why did I waste my time writing about it, ah lads! It's really annoying me, its useless 3 hours and 10 minutes.
