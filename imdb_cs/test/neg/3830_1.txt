I was invited to the early screening of the film about four months before it was released. I had to watch the movie and later on my thoughts to fill the packet. It was the hardest on earth. The show is just crawling and you quickly wish you were dead. The point is, there are two types of Mormon films. Those good with real good stories and those miserable who just stink. Saints and soldiers, now is a good movie. But with these would-be comedies, writers and actors are trying too hard. Basically, they're trying to be funny when they're not. No wonder why there is such a small target audience for these films; They are filled with 'inner jokes' that aren't fun to start with, and they just try to throw fun on average stuff. It's the story that makes the movie, and the stories for these movies are only weak. I bet you can guess how my packet looked when I was told to fill it out after the movie. ;)
