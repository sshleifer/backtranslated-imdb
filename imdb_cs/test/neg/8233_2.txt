This film is a classic in my country because it was filmed in my own little town. Now I have many friends who are guardians at Dixon Correctional, and I myself worked for 3 years at the SuperAmerica store next to the Krogers store, where the old lady was. However, this is still the dumbest movie ever made, destined to be introduced by Gilbert Godfreid or Rhonda Shearer, if it was not already. A little trivia, Illinois doesn't even have a conditional release hearing, and Dixon Prison is a medium security device that hides thieves and vending machines. The classic clucking / seduction scene is perhaps the funniest piece of writing I've ever seen, especially with thrilling building-ups
