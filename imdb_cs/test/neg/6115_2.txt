These writers try to recreate the characters who have a "scrub" in another profession, but the characters they are stranded with do not have any charisma or actor's ability to talk about writing seems bad and effortless. These guys are trying to create something that would be good if writing wasn't so disgusting that the show only leaves the lifeline to be two attractive teachers who barely keep it alive. The humor in this show seems to be trying to target the audience to I.Q. 40 or less. Another reason why this exhibition becomes a failure may be that writing at the "scrub" exhibition is excellent and this exhibition must follow to keep the viewer in a strange position without knowing whether to cry or simply lose hope in new situations. all together. That's just my opinion, but I think these guys should stop before they're humiliated before they have.
