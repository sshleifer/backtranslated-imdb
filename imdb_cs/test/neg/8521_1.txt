You're Dead is an indescribably terrible attempt at a British gangster movie. It doesn't have a single original idea in being a terrible copy of various Lock Stock elements & two smoking barrels, the usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction. Negotiations and dialogue are absolutely unbearable, the plot is ridiculous and utterly predictable, despite constant conspiracy attempts, and contains nothing but one-dimensional stock and clich√©. He has several good actors in him, but they are off-form, and unable to do much with the terrible material they work with. It is total torture to sit in this drive.
