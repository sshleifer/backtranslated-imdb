When I heard the first song in the first few seconds of the show, I gave her a chance. LEARN when someone offers a line that is just fun and you hear that an apparently fake laughter will explode in a commotion of laughter, it's a fool's show to say "yes it's funny, go and laugh". Ugh. I couldn't stand this show as it turned out. I can't talk for everyone - after all people like that IDIOTIC show "Stacked" (which is a desire to vomit). I can imagine that those who like "Stacked" might like it. Some people still get a kick out of an old "blow with a finger" gag. This show is so funny for me - just as original. Topics were old and tired. The jokes were lame and frayed. The characters were the ones we saw everywhere - and the worst of them you could imagine. So ... if you like things like cracking words and neighbors who say "pull your finger". Maybe you like this show. Otherwise ... hand it over. It's stupid - and not a clever or original way. This one is about as old and tired as ever at his premiere.
