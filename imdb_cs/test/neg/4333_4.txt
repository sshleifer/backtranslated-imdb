The author of "Prince" manages to capture an excellent cast, a decent story, an average script, and carefully put them into one boring, monotonous, amateur mess. Despite the strong central performance of Frank Nasso, the prince, this discontinuous film wanders aimlessly from the scene to the scene and painfully breaks down into a hash. The result brings a sigh of relief at the end where tears of joy should be. Sad loss of time and talent and a good example of how the movie should NOT be directed. <br /> <br />
