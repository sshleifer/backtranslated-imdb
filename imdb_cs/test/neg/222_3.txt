I went to see this movie today, hoping it will include at least half an intelligent story. I was very disappointed, as it was not. The story and decision of the main character were so distant. I was hoping for a "Friday Friday afternoon" movie, but instead got something totally unacceptable. Actually, I found myself absolutely in the hope that the "hero" would be knocked down and I left the theater on several occasions when it was to happen, but not. Heist movies are not huge to feel good, and this is what it was trying to be. Every few minutes during the second half of the movie, I found myself saying, "No way". Without giving the whole story away, it spun around an armored guard who was financially down and out and whose house went into closure. He was invited to a robbery and accepted only to return once the action began. Weak.
