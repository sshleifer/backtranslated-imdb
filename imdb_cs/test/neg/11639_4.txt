A blackface man lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in a monkey shack. He picks it up with her phone and teaches him how to Charleston. Then they fly in the spacecraft and leave the monkey behind. This short film, no matter what's on it, makes no sense. I think it's a conspiracy, but I'm not sure about a long shot. You can't say it's Renoir at work, despite his characteristic humanism. Good use of slow motion. I believe they can be found on the NY Film Annex series.
