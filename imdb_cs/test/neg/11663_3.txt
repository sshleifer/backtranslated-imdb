"Delusion" is what you experience when you watch this movie and then believe that you have seen something worth it. This film, which tells of a trio of semi-psycho passengers who are somewhere in the CA desert, is amateurish and just stupid. The film suffers from a terrible story, a miserable scenario and some terrible direction to mention only a few shortcomings. If anything is all about it, it's even the performance of the B-movie diva Rubin. Don't waste your time on this turkey. (D)
