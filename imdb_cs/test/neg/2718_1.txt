As Joe Bob Briggs would say, this film is based on the actress's talent rather than their talent. In the early 1990s, the show-the-babes-in-bikinis-fest has very little to redeem it to show beautiful women almost naked. Joe Estevez, Martin Sheen's little brother, proves once again that his film career is nowhere near what his brother's career is. <br /> <br /> Avoid this if you can't watch beautiful women in modest clothes. It's about the only thing that will redeem her.
