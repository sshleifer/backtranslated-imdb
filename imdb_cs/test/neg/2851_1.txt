First I have to say that I really like Udo Kiera and I have always respected Armand Assante, but nothing could save this wreck of the movie. Udo doesn't appear in the film much later, and acting from everyone is just awful. The script is everywhere, the dialogue is wooden, the "action" is ridiculous and the plot can be summarized on a dirty cocktail napkin. I really wanted to find something to redeem in this movie, but I found myself in my hand, holding my hands over my eyes, shaking my head and repeating over and over, "Oh Udo ..... why ??? .... why? " ??? If you are a Udo or Armand fan, please do not watch this movie.
