On his recent spoiled reality-show, Mr. Shore admitted that his film work is best to use stoned. No, he had to say "best watched." While a healthy toke could see you through closing credits, there is little pleasure of finding you, except for the sporadic laughter in the picture, not with him. The titular absence of hyphenate is the smallest complaint. Another hyphen, healthy Tiffani-Amber Thiessen (dare you erase that "Stored by the patina of purity of Bell") is wrong as a rural vamp; it is too round to betray. Mr. Shore, himself occasionally displays a special talent for mimicry (I thought I met Jimmy Stewart there), but never used it properly. The wording "trite fish-out-of-water" must still be given less grace. Our hero, Crawl, has a rare little joke that would account for his fast-paced charming agrarian antagonists. Finally, I had to announce that it was found: BIGGEST FILM. P.S. As another fisherman, Adam Sandler behaved better with "Mr. Deeds." It can take Shore to appreciate Sandler.
