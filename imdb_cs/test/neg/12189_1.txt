It's been a long time since I've seen this movie and it's still one of the worst I've ever seen. I like a lot of movies; science fiction, action, drama, thrillers and sometimes horror. It's not a combination of two. It could have been an amazing movie, but they all got fired. I didn't want to see this movie, but my friends insisted on watching it. I didn't know it was such a shit. I loved the first part in which Clooney and Tarantino drove across Texas and killed everyone on the road (especially the scene with the liquor filming was excellent), but at its turning point, everything changed in the titty twister bar. Stupid vampires have taken over and what might have been a perfect gangster movie has become a stupid horror movie like 'Nightmare on Elmsteet'. If you like horror, watch the real horror movie. And when you love bloody thrillers, don't look at it at all, you'll be very disappointed at the end.
