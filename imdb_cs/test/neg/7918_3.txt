If you've just watched All Dogs Go To Heaven and find out it's a sequel, don't look at it. That's horrible. It's totally awful. Rush the characters to develop. For example, Sasha begins to sing about how you can take her away from love. And at the end it looks more like a dramatic novel than a comedy-adventure film. They pull Charlie out of his character and replace him with a bright, soft but still rebellious version of himself. The humor behind Carface's character is just completely lost. He's a completely different dog. He no longer has a great voice, he's not the villain you hate anymore, he's just a chimpanzee voiced by anyone but Mermaid Man from Spongebob. Speaking of voice actors .. <br /> <br /> Charlie has a completely different voice. And while it's not terrible, I don't like it. It's terrible compared to the excellent work Burt Reynolds did for the character in the first film. Dom DeLuise is as wonderful as ever, like Itchy. This character remains true, and this film gets 3/10. Purely because Dom DeLuise still expressed Itchy. Oh, and my last complaint. I know Ann-Marie's movie was done and gone, now she has parents, etc., But did Charlie forget about her or what? No mention of her in the second movie. I think even a little mention from Itchy would be acceptable. (ex. "Charlie, we have to go back. You can't take care of every child who needs rescue.) Or something like that. I mean, he died living with her, he deserves some mention." /> <br /> Don't look at it if you're looking for a wonderful sequel.
