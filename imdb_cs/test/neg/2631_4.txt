It happened to me that I caught this "horror" movie late Friday night, I wish I went to bed! Tell me .. Is this a 3 ft tall raincoat-clad twerp bike gurly had to convey some fear? Not here, but Mi-low is still able to defeat the doorman's crap (Antonio Fargas), which is three times its size (?) Uh-huh. And the end is so pathetic ... just won't let you hang with anything that could go for whatS-so-so! I found myself asking, "Is that so?" Acting is about as good as it will be in a low budget movie. The mentioned Fargas provides decent performance; but it's my conclusion that Jennifer Jostyn may be one of the worst actresses ever to get to Tinsel Town! Sure, cute face, but bad behavior. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1
