I feel at odds with this film - it's one of the most beautiful movies I've seen and provides insight into lost culture. On the table there was an early scene of men in caps and mustaches sitting around the table, with the woman who served, and playing with the accordion that brought tears to my eyes, just because of the way he had captured the way of life that must be for many people incomprehensible. today. It presents the lives of the characters who are inextricably linked to the life of the village, another lost concept in today's world. Symbolism is always fun, but it seemed to be a little dated. The fatal mistake of the film for me was the lack of any convincing dramatic effort and complete lack of humor. I have never felt as if I have recognized some of the characters that go beyond very basic universal things, such as mourning the loss of a loved one, etc. People have been characters in directors' boards involving natural disasters, war, etc. The film was just one beautiful tragic a scene after another, without any narrative inside and no humanity. As a result, it looked very abstract, regardless of the lives of real people. Finally, I was too bored to finish it.
