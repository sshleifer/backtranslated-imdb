I am an atheist with little love for certain aspects of Christian fundamentalism. But this film is reprehensible, repulsive and transparent. He only works on the level of the contemporary fashion (and tired) hate motive of white American Christian fundamentalism. If this film were made about a fundamentalist Jewish or Muslim family, or even a black Christian family, indignation would be tangible and the film would be rounded in all circles. But as it stands, it's "OK" and "refined" because white Christian fundamentalists remain one of the last "acceptable" targets for garbage like this. And it really is. If you want to see a quality film of similar bending, find and watch or review "Badlands". Nothing good was done in "The King", which wasn't done better decades ago in this masterpiece. As other reviewers have noticed, the characters are almost completely underdeveloped in "The King," the lines are snooze, cinematography is dim. We saw a story about a sociopath who did better 100 times. This film doesn't solve it for thoughtful viewers.
