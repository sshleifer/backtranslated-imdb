I was lured into watching Shark Hunter comments posted on IMDB. The film was bad, but the shark was cool blah blah blah. So I rented it. Bad idea. This film was bad on so many levels that I was glad I had the opportunity to move forward. The shark itself is fine. His look is decent and it's the only thing that will save this movie from getting 1, (I gave it 2). The negotiations are incredibly bad and dialogue is equally regrettable. I didn't expect much, but I was constantly surprised by this suckfest. Antonio Sabato Jr. is some biologist or scientist or something, I really didn't pay attention. He goes down with the expendable crew of this submarine to find out what has happened to this submarine station that the shark has ripped. By the way, all the scenes that show that someone is working underwater are not under water. First, if they're just going down to see what happened to this station, what's with all the huge darts for sedatives and harpoons and stuff. These are the things you usually do with an accident investigation. Shark theory has been advanced by Antonio on the way, so it wasn't as if they knew what they were up against. Antonio and this young college student, terrible actresses by the way, just jumps to sub controls when there's a partial problem. What's wrong with that? If everyone does not get some kind of partial training before leaving high school, I find it a little stupid. The director seems to think that if crew members work in the background, then it's good to put someone in the background. Metal craft is very important when your on the sub I think. Anyway, I could go on, but I've said so much. Bottom Line: Go to your local video store, rent this video, and then destroy it. Then send an email asking IMDB to remove all records from this site. All memory and evidence of this film must be destroyed. We can do it if we work together.
