I don't know why IMDb presents all Ghoulies movies as theatrical versions. Just like the puppet master series. Why hasn't anyone noticed yet? Right, somehow you came across the Ghoulies IV., Probably since 1993, they have penetrated an old abandoned video store. You looked at the discount section and found it ... Look at the back and front covers. What do you expect, Redemption Shawshank? There is no need to critically evaluate this film. It's the fourth GHOULIES movie! I bought it on DVD for 6.50 because ... it was 6.50 .. I knew it wasn't Kubrick's stuff. And I was right. An unprocessed DVD, no trailer, or a trailer, boasts a film without mysteries. In fact, it contains the star of the first Ghoulies movie, Peter Liapis ... who really didn't get many "big" roles in addition to these two movies. And I don't know why ... He's not a very bad actor and it's pretty fun. But I think if you play the lead role in Ghoulies, Scorsese and Tarantino, they lose interest. Also present is his idiot sidekick Bobby Di Cocco, who, despite very little resemblance to Al Pacino (very small), retains none of his acting skills ... Complete an idiot who is just embarrassing to watch. Then there's Stacie Randall - obviously a porn star, I don't have to look at it. She looks pretty sexy, even though her costume, her character, and all she does, will make the movies credible, which is no easy task for such a movie. Then the Ghoulies are alone! Who can also leave us. Ghoulies III made them start talking, not mistake. 1, but Ghoulies IV. Instead of puppets, this time the Ghoulies are actually CHILDREN in COSTUMES !!!! The filmmakers decided to lead this extraordinary mile to offenders. Also, there are only two, and they are not the main highlight of the film because they do not appear in many cases. However, sometimes MILDLY are fun ... And they're not bad this time either. <br /> <br /> That's really funny bad things, it's amazing that I was actually able to get it. I don't know why ... Some black humor is actually funny, though the script is mostly effortless. Imagine that Satan is the only threat to you that will "kill you, slowly ... painfully ...". But at least Full Moon didn't participate this time. They? Yeah, a very bad and cheaply produced movie with 0 production value, but not as bad as being in the ranks of a puppet master 1/2, Man 2 mower, Christmas survivors or even Ghoulies III.
