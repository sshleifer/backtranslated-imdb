The video case for this film reads "a beauty story, passion and forbidden fruit". Is he talking about the same movie I just saw? They can't be, because the movie I just saw was beautiful, but there was no passion, and as for the fruit, that's what the viewer wanted to attract a potential viewer to see this movie. If it had only some passion or some life, I would really enjoy this movie. Instead, it was an extremely slow and not very interesting movie that I wouldn't want to see again. It's not that it's a bad movie (after all it's very beautifully shot), but it's boring outside the faith. I've been waiting for something exciting or interesting, but the movie's just over. There was no great sense of excitement, mystery or anything - just a somewhat ill-considered story about a young girl who would become a maid and spend the next 10 years of her life as a maid.
