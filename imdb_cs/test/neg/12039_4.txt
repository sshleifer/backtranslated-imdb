They can prove that cops, when they cannot find the perpetrators of REAL, always blame their parents and accuse them of sexual exploitation of their children. These films always show the press as a lot of animals and have parents coming from court to feed the hunger for the press. Did anyone ever hear about these court yards in these movies? Here's a psyche that tells them exactly what happened, and where the body is, but the police won't say it and no one cares about its findings. Police are portrayed as fools who don't know what they're doing, and there's always a detective out there, like Ed Asner, who's late for the case, trusting his parents and solving the mystery. Also, after the parents are wiped out, they do not spit on the faces of stupid cops who put them in jail, they took their child away and accused them of killing their own child. <br /> <br /> It seemed like I had seen this LOW before.
