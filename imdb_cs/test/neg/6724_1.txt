I really like Steven Seagal. They are usually very amusing and are rather adept of Aikido, I usually like the way Steven incorporates these martial arts techniques in combat sequences. However, this movie is a really bad movie to make an effort and it seems clear to me that the blame lies with the director and the producers, who obviously have no idea how to make an action movie, let alone someone who would direct Steve Seagal and use his knowledge and skills. I've never seen the end of this movie. I went out before the end simply because I couldn't stand to watch this bad movie anymore. I'm sure many people also share my feelings.
