Uwe Boll slipped into his film skills again to offer a scifi horror story of mercenaries and reporters who board super soldiers on a remote island. A good cast led by the excellent Udo Keir is occupied by Boll, who makes the worst scenario to work. The crazy scientist being investigated by the reporter was killed, but the scenario is so amusing that the plot was going to work, plus the effects and design of a super soldier with dead eyes without dead have some degree of scaryness, but Boll somehow films everything in his hand. It is as if he could not bother to really find out what would work, and instead stop the camera location and leave. In addition, the installation of the scenes has no spark or life, I guess Boll shot only one or two and used only what he had. She really stinks. It is clear that Boll is in one of his regular retro films where everything he has ever learned about the film is canceled. The last movie he did was so bad that Seed was a serial killer movie that is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. That's not so bad, but it's close because it should be better. Then again, Udo Keir is good enough to watch his scene for the effort and make him a bad movie. I'd make a pass if it's not late at night and grab it by the cable.
