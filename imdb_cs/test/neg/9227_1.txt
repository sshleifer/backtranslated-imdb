The jungle terror is a real find. If you've seen it, you're one of the few happy ones. It's merry! The story is about a plane crashing in the middle of a South American jungle. You need to see the crash scene. They all die in an accident, or are subsequently eaten by live crocodiles. Only a young blond will survive. The nearby tribes bring the child to their village and they (all men) worship him for his golden hair! I'm not you! In the end, there is a lot of matches between the natives and the man on the search for all survivors of the downed plane. All the time the baby is sitting on the throne and his blond hair is surrounded by a golden halo and he cries nonstop !! This is funny !!! Very obscure and contains very controversial overtones. You have to, when you're in the dark, it's so bad movies.
