"Ernest Saves Christmas" is a special Christmas film by comedian Ernest. In this movie, Ernest must find Santa Claus's successor to keep Christmas going. Along the way, she meets a young girl who is a thief and who eventually steals something very important to Santa (I won't tell you what it is, you'll just have to watch the movie for yourself). Like most Ernest movies, there's a lot of humorous humor. This film is probably one of Ernest's best films. It's funny, and it has a few important lessons to learn about friendship and family and not worry to show love. It's not the best Christmas movie around, but it's good to bring you in the spirit of Christmas. It's a bit sad that the movie is a little old now.
