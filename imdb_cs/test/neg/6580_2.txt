I think Tom Hanks is a good actor. I liked it when I read this book to my children when they were small. I was very disappointed in the movie. One character is totally uncomfortable with the voice that gives me the nail feeling on the board. There is a totally useless scene with a train / roller coaster. There are some characters and scenes that seem scary for the little kids for whom this movie was made. North Pole scenes with Santa and Elves could be cute and charming. There was absolutely no heat or magic to these scenes or characters. It usually does not work to make a short children's book into a feature film. This film is absolutely nervous.
