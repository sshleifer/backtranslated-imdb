Wait until you see most of the other movies you've ever released, wait a year and watch it when you're ready for something with such a low production value that it doesn't attack anyone's imagination. I agree that those who rate this film as a 10-member production must do it to distort the data. Anything above 8 would be odd. I'd like to see a very young Sandy Bullock in her poofy hair for a short time when she was introduced, even though she swept the New Yorker accent, but sometimes her southern (Virginia & NC accent) sneaked. Ancient history for this perfect actress who has grown so much from this film that we have borrowed it. It also had a Trivia quiz as a bonus - 3 questions. I hope you get them right!
