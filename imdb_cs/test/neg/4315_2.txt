This is a complete swing. If you take The Devil's Rejects and suck all the good out of it, add a lot of twisted, blasting parts of slavery, a few raping scenes, and one or two sincerely scary scenes, and you got this movie. People call it ripoff The Hitcher, but I don't see it at all. Even the worst hits of Hitchers are still better than this. The main problem on the display is that there is nothing here except a few director fetishes that are presented as circus exhibits. Is everything you need from the film footage of girls who are being abused and tied up, crouching in fear? Well, then rent this movie! However, I'd rather just watch a good movie, which is definitely not. The sad thing is that there are some really good excitement waiting to be revealed here, but just a few. E.g. The tension at the beginning before the nonsense slavery started was pretty damn good to ask me. And the scene where the hitchhiker kills a girl with a nymph (she can't remember the names) is freezing, very brutal, challenging even on The Devil's Rejects for unrestrained fury. How come the rest of the movie can't be that good? Huh? I really have to stop renting such stupid crap. Final report: Let this drain drain and forget it forever. Not recommended.
