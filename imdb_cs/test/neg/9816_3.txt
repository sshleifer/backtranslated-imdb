Piggy Watching Linne Quigley drinks milk, belts and kills her sister and her sister sisters after they have sex. She goes to asylum, makes the best friend of Amy (Karen Russell) and the two blackmail their way out of the psychiatric hospital by sleeping with their psychologists (one is played by "Carol Burnett's Show" regular Lyle Wagoner). On the outside, these two men-hating mafia princesses (!) Stop taking their medication and invite six slimeball ex-lovers to their big country party home, where they are systematically defeated in very cruel ways in gloves, leather-dressed mysterious killer. Ugly David Barton FX is so bloody, but unrealistic, that he is surrealistic. The same is true for film. Dialogue is so strange and stupid, the film walked and edited unnoticed, and acting so different-secular, you start doubting your own common sense. In fact, this film is trying to conspire and three-dimensional characters, but it's all so badly worked out that it's almost like what would happen if Ed Wood rewrote Ingmar Bergman's script! And like any good Bergman movie, there is a mature morality to follow - Any good party needs a good guy / girl ratio, "so there will be enough chickens to" tickle a lizard. "You see it yourself ... or not! <br /> <br /> Linnea (the only reason I started to be interested in it) is very entertaining, has more dialogue than usual and has some charming nude scenes. completely disappears from the last third of this movie and the film suffers from it. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
