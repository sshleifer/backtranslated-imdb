Okay, I'm sorry about this cast and crew, but this movie is by far the worst I've ever seen ... First, acting was fine. It could be better (especially in some parts) but it was "fine". Then it was the cheapest camcorder (which they used). Violence was pretty good. If it were faster, it would be amazing, but not (* sigh *) ... Scares. The fright was well written (in the script) but not well done. For example ... (SPOILER HERE!) In the attic there is a girl in the middle of the way and the other half in the dark, bottom of the barn house, then she gets it. The monster knocks her down and then you hear someone rip. Frightening could be better if the music was not torn from a cheap CD. Blood effects were pretty good, but blood was similar to "Kill Bill" blood. K.B. he pulled it out because it was supposed to resemble old kung fu movies, but when the crew can't tell the difference between red and pink .... it's sad. The torn bodies in the movie were good, but the scarecrow costumes were something you would see for $ 25 at a Halloween store. Don't be fooled, costumes suck! My overall grade is 3/10. If you are interested in independent movies, they are easily satisfied, or you have only 3 bucks burning a hole in your pocket, going into a stunt and seeing the horror of failure.
