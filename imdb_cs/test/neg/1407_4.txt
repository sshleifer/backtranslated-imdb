A somewhat aggressive brother of suicide discovers that he and his mother mourn in much the same way (by acting), but that dad is morose and accuses. Writer-director Dan Harris gives us a dysfunctional family torn in seams, characters with question marks hanging over them, and then puts all the stories in the most prominent terms: suicide! Secret! Gay Shame! Family disease! Finally, Harris tries to wrap things up and Harris wants to make sure we don't miss the trick, initially giving us a thoughtful material to think about, but then everything in a basic, sentimental sense. Sigourney Weaver's bemused performance as the matriarch's family is dry off and she's happy - that's until Harris gives her a make-over (complete with a sensible new haircut). It's the film equivalent of condescending pat on the head. ** of ****
