I'm not one of those people who bemoans every time a movie based on an old TV show comes out. I usually ran out and saw (if I was watching the show) trying to get nostalgia. But if somebody feels like taking old-time movies, it's A exhibit (So you can actually say more than just "McHale's Navy"). "Mod Squad" is rough, tiring and lethargic. At least the original series was horribly riddled long before anyone knew that teens could be so hot, which made it a breakthrough. That's just tiring. Claire Danes is nice when she looks at it, but does nothing but swing the mood and sneak around spying on the baddies. Giovanni Ribisi's gameplay range in this movie is that Droopy the Dog look an hour and forty-five minutes. And Omar Epps seems to want to escape from the set, but the chlostraphobia script imprisoned him. Sure, the production is nice, with the now seemingly compulsory "rave" nightclub opening action sequence and shootings galore. And the children are screaming and angry at themselves and their superiors. It's like deciding to use a Scooby Doo Mystery Machine for a family holiday in Hollywood with your teenage children you and your husband know you need heavy treatment and prescription drugs. I really wanted to like this movie and there were promising moments, but the next scene would make it a life. You can tap on another Spelling remake, "Charlie's Angels", all you want, but at least the movie knew he wanted to talk to himself. The "Mod Squad" wonders where the inspiration from the original series went.
