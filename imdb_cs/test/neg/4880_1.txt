I got this movie in the store, I hope I like it. The boy was disappointed. (except avon.) You see, the movie is really horrible, but so terrible it's not even ridiculous. Act, oh wait, there's no conspiracy. I suppose you could say that this is the main character that rises in the ranks of street fighting. At the end of the film, the directors decided that they either made no more sense, or, more likely, died and let the monkey finish directing the film. DO NOT READ THAT YOU WOULD NOT WANT TO END! though the end really does not spoil anything. The main character somehow ends up in a room filled with mirrors, la Enter the Dragon, and then gets a real rage, has a silly flashback, and hits the mirror. End. Wheeee. The only redemption factor for this film was Avon's scene. He speaks to his rival, who is fighting on the street, and says something that is in this line, completely dead: "Don't worry about him anymore, sir. I killed him in a sophisticated way. We had a lot of fun and then I killed him. at which point the boss says "good work avon. You're number 1." And avon says, "Number 1! Alliriiiiight! Alriiight!" The scene continues with avon still saying "alllrriiiight!" again and again. The next scene is the dead Avon floating in the pool. Intelligent? I think not. Finally, I have my own "Homeboy" version of this movie, which means the title on the box I own is "Homeboy". It shows a huge guy holding a giant gun and screaming. This will never happen in the movie. This man is never in the movie. High Quality. Note: I am a newcomer to this review, but hell yes, I'll keep it up.
