There seems to be a whole spectrum of cinemas. On the left are films made mainly for entertainment and / or commercial purposes. In the middle are films that are both fun and artistic. On the right, there are films that are not so commercial, but focus more on film than on film. , but when the film gets too far to the end, it's rarely good. Such is the case with Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> I had no idea what to expect when I saw him being advertised. A few friends went and asked if I wanted to come. None of us knew what to expect, and to the end, none of us were pleased. Yes, there are stunning pictures. Yes, I'm impressed by the length of time the filmmakers went looking for archive footage. Yes, the soundtrack is pleasing to hear and probably the best part of the experience. The point is that it goes so far to the right of the spectrum that I can't say anything nice about the film as a whole. It is a tangle of symbolism and obvious morality. It says nothing new or forces the viewer to explore life in a new way. It's just telling us things we already know (that is, if we can even find out what it says). This film is simply art for art. Try to say, "See how deep and provocative we can be through assembly!" When a film becomes more about how clever or intelligent its creators are than its subject, it ceases to be a film and becomes simply self-satisfied.
