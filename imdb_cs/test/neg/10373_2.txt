Being a homosexual who spent a period of time explored in this boring document, I was eager to see how the subject was treated. Unfortunately, filmmakers have wasted what might have been an energetic and imaginative opportunity to shed some light on our collective homosexual history. This film concerns only the New York period, ignoring the rest of the country. While I was spending a lot of time in New York at the time, I can assure you that there was a gay life outside of Manhattan! The conversations with the men here are the same "A-list" queens that they thought were better than anyone else in the 70s, and here they are again, waxing nostalgic and still throwing a stance. The film should at least try to cover larger topics such as race, ageism, a growing homosexual "caste system" based on wealth, body figure and the rise of "clones", discrimination of subgroups within the community, and the ability to grow a decent mustache (which was very important in the 70s!). Unfortunately, none of this has been presented, and the memories of those we have spoken to are not different from my own memories. If you were there in this decade, you will enjoy archival photos and grainy home movies from bars and discos that we are scary about. If you weren't there, this movie no doubt seems boring. It should have been a lot more, but unfortunately it is not. Two stars for jogging in my memory ... I still miss going to the anvil!
