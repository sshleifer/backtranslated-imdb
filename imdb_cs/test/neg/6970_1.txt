Given the film's reputation as the worst of the worst, I was looking forward to seeing Wood's Crappus Opus (my word); It is not necessarily any more than the other Woods I have watched - however, when I was at the REEFER MADNESS (1938) film school, GLEN OR GLENDA was not found as a genre as its genre effort. It was also a horror legend of Bela Lugosi's hopes (his first of three "collaborations" with the director): one wonders if he was really aware of what the movie was (with regard to history actor heavy medication and sheer absurdity of his portrait). Besides, Lugosi's eccentric delivery is perhaps the most unpleasant… although Wood's scenario owes it - because of the impossible dialogue (with repetitive nonsense allusions to “dog dog puppies” and “big fat snails”), a sick star! By the way, wood plays a central role (under the pseudonym of Daniel Davis) - and is equally worthless in the area, proving it to be a versatile dog! Dolores Fuller - his wife and co-founder - was similarly uninterested (she would also appear in JAIL BAIT [1954]) ... but at least a picture where the latter finally allows Glen to wear her Angora sweater made by Tim Burton loving \ t ) his famous poster! By the way, the other film is probably a fictional encounter between Wood and Orson Welles - well, for all intents and purposes, GLEN OR GLENDA introduces Ed Wood's CITIZEN KANE (1941) due to its brilliant propensity for imaginative narration Techniques: In fact, the heaviest fiber of the plot is stuffed with galore storage tracks (many of which are irrelevant, such as confused S&M cases) and the dream dream sequence (accentuated by the presence of the reckless demon sports outrageous eyebrows that would make Martin Scorsese cry with envy! however, at every step of the plea for tolerance and psychological exploration into the affliction / phenomenon of transvestism, it is sabotaged by mere amateurism of this approach at every turn. <br /> <br /> Issue I looked at the Extended Re-issue Version, which included six minutes' Spoiled 'shots (directed by W. Merle Connell) censored to the original In addition, my copy went out-of-synch each so often (which made me rewind it a bit to make the audio back on track) - though, fortunately, it was a source conversion error to DivX as opposed to the film itself.
