I've seen some terrible book adaptations in my day, but this is all! The bizarrely uninteresting cast reflects a story that is untrue in the book. Mr. Tilney is nothing like handsome; As for Catherine Morland, rats of similar appearance make this heroine difficult to sell to a likeable audience. Isabella is nothing like Aphrodite, as the original text says, and James Morland appears too little in the film to abandon the viewer by any understanding of his important role in the story. Also, as others mentioned before, this novel was intended to satirize the Gothic madness prevalent in Austen's time, but it seems that this "soft horror" film was designed and meant to be taken seriously. I'm sure Jane Austen will turn in her grave every time one of her fans is disappointed with this terrible interpretation of what was supposed to be a joke.
