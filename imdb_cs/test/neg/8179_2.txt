I think it's in the public domain as it is on DVD. First of all, it is a good feeling of a propaganda film to be shown to Aussie's war spectator, so he won't be considered a serious narrative of Tobruk. The first half to 3/4 is a very dry thing in Australia, I think that, like many American war films where they are recruited, they meet, O man its soooo long. Then we get to Africa and Tobruk. The battle scenes on the DVD copy I was watching were almost completely black. See if you have to, but be prepared to use a fast forward as I doubt you can take it after a few minutes. I enjoyed the Syrian Italian "Battle of El Alamien" much more, and also Richard Burton made an African theater war movie that was "The Desert Rats", this film is just a piece of the time and was supposed to stay at that time, not today. well (I doubt it was highly rated then). I say the same thing about my American war movie counterpart, so don't take Aussies personally (I love Australia, I'm twice!).
