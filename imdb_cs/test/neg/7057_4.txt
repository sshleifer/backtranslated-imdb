One of the most pleasant surprises of this short 3-way Technicolor was that the ballerina who appeared here was called Maria Gambarelli! I was half wondering if Blake Edwards named the character played by Elke Sommer in A Shot in the Dark after this now forgotten performer (although the spelling of Sommer's character was actually Gambrelli). I was watching it on YouTube mainly to see how soon Judy Garland appears when we look at her in profile with her two older sisters singing "La Cucaracha". That was the pinnacle for me that otherwise showed some dances (like Mrs. Gambarelli) that were nice and some lame comedies between Andy Devine as a big bull-fighter (yeah, right!) And Buster Keaton as the bull owner that provides the who is obviously a man in animal costume. The only funny part of the two is when they cry with Buster, who provides a "bull" handkerchief - after the sad part of "La Cucaracha". Also lame saw Ted Healy without his stoogs dealing with the crasher who is wrong with Healy for other movie stars. (Healy himself didn't know that Zeppo left Marx Brothers since he put "Four" between "The" and "Marx"!) Speaking of Marx, it was interesting to see Harp without his wig, even though he was wearing a hat that He has to hide his bald head. It was also interesting that Ida Lupino met the cowgirls at the beginning, even though last year I met Toby Wing from her Vanity murder (at least when she was identified by Pete Smith). Oh, and Smith himself wasn't funny with his stories. Other famous stars that you may or may not recognize are also in portraits and not all of them are M-G-M! So with what has been said, La fiesta de Santa Barbara is worth a look at anyone who is curious about Judy Garland's early film performance or the early 3-strip Technicolor.
