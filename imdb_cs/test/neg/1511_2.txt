(As a note I would like to say that I saw this film in my annual camp where the whole youth group laughed at him. I bought it when I saw it on the shelf a year later, just for humor. film.) Stand on her to meet the expectations of many film fans on several different levels. Most of the problems are impersonal. Regardless of the nice cars in the movie, or the truth in Christ's sacrifice for you, as a film and witness tool, lay it hardly brings. Most good views on movies are supported by Christians who agree with the news. Although it is easy for a Christian to agree with the points delivered, the audience hardly ever testifies to life outside the clich√©. The battle scene between Ben and his brother is terribly dubbed. And there are at least three typographical typos in the headlines. I appeal to everyone to watch the film a second time with the director's commentary. It really helps to understand why the movie was written as it was. The director's views on secular society are practically the opposite of what would fit the needs of film visitors: it shows the pedantic understanding of Nonchristians and some points of religious conflict; most cuts, admits, were rushed, but "satisfactory"; wondering that excess transitions and themes are effective; and was completely satisfied with acting. He also inserted the motives that he was rather proud of: -All (reading: most) names are significant. Ben Destin = "Intended", Gus Pelman = "Gospel Man", Nicky D = Nicodemus. - The car that makes donuts is a symbol of the circling nothingness that is a life without Christ. - When Ben leaves Pete's motorcycle, he crosses his crutches to create a "cross". I won't do any of them. He throws around things like this between the fact that street racers and the like "blowing their brains with weapons" and how "God is under control when he is born and when you die". Yes, that was not a typo. He really says that. <br /> <br /> I have a (small) forgiveness reserved for this movie. "Cool cars" and "good news" don't make jack to make this movie good. However, the film was made from a group of unprofessional individuals on a budget of less than 1 / 100th of "Fast and Furious's", and the time limit was inexorable. With that in mind, I give it a 2/10 score, instead of 1/10 I'm so dear to think it deserves.
