Sometimes you have to have patients while watching an indie horror movie. If you can only make a toe-tap your way through the slow-paced early scenes, sometimes a real gem will introduce ... This (unfortunately) was not the case with "Satan's Whip". Written by and directed by Jason Maran, "Satan's Whip" attempts to drag us along a boring snoring-film movie, with no real payoff at the end. I think black and white (and blue) cinematography must have been for some reason, but it never explains why most of the blood is blue, and it was becoming more and more unpleasant when the film continued. The story itself is not so bad and actually had some originality and decent content, but acting is simply pathetic. That, along with the slow stimulation and lack of any real (red) gore, made "Satan's Whip" so he forgot quite quickly. I'll give it a "4" rating for some funny dialogue that made me laugh, but unfortunately it couldn't save this boring loss of my time.
