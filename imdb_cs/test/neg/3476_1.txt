I just took a look at this movie. The masterpiece of documentary film was not. The film is completely absorbed by its subject and the film is unable to cope with any critical commentary with Mrs. Faye. The only redemption of film quality was his use of puppets when trying (albeit unsuccessful) to structure some narrative. But the toughest experience came when closing credits closed. The audience got up and clapped. 21st century Americans, as well as flames, are still attracted to wildness. The story of a misunderstood monster becomes tired.
