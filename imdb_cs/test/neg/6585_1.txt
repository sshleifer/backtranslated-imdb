This movie is terrible. It creates characters that are not in the book, and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes. Including an unpleasant little Jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl. Not to mention Yiddish speaking elves. The book was a simple story of faith, and this film is a dark, ugly, and unnecessarily frightening film about nothing. The animation is excellent, but the story was destroyed by Hollywood. The good thing is that this movie takes a bath at the box office and maybe manufacturers will learn to keep up with the story that doesn't require any improvement. Hanks was exaggerated and I don't know why other actors' voices couldn't be used.
