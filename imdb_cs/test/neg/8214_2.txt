My bad film guru (and the Exposed Film Society president) set off for us last week. The demented flash did not deny his eyes as he pulled him out of the brown paper bag and announced what he had in store for us: "The most dangerous game", shot in a budget of about $ 2.95. Of course, $ 2.95 went a lot more in 1962, but still ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, there's a lot that doesn't like this movie. It abounds with serious technical gaffes (my favorite was 'repeat musket' that fired twice in two minutes without the benefit of reload). A hero is the one who stands while his injured friend fights a follower and kills him. <br /> <br /> More? OK - The conspiracy is a wreck we can't talk about. The film wastes five minutes with a 'special guest star' that serves as the physical embodiment of rogue madness and paranoia, but never sees it again. The hero is irritated by an irritated supporter, but it is not mentioned when he wakes up and meets his host for the first time. The mute servant girl is captured, put on a stand ... and then the movie (and the hero who puts it in this trouble) just "forgets" about her. <br /> <br /> More? Files are cheap and special effects are cheaper (make-up is the exception). Much of the conspiracy is borne by the narrative silly, monotonous vocal review that bears less dramatic impact than the Denny menu recital. Most of the dialogue is simply absurd and stupid, as if it were translated from Japanese. ("I want our conversation to be nice !!!") And the color values ​​tended to shift sharply from shot to shot as if it were the order of the cheap movie supplies and problematic lighting equipment. (Note - this last may have been a bad press error, rather than a camera crew). But here and there were a few nice moments. Unlike the rest of the film, the effects of makeup were surprisingly good, actors were interested in interesting things, especially the silent servant and the countess. And despite everything, there was a certain horrifying atmosphere that was found, very ugly and disturbing. So what was with this movie? I thought a bit about it and realized that the director / writer Pat Boyette was basically trying to put the story of an old "EC" horror comic into a movie. That would be the answer to the dialogue, the sketched surface development (in comics, physiognomy = character even more than in the film), the logical logic of the story ("ES" horror stories came out of their way to include ugly ") shock" ending and wasn't big on psychological realism ", relying on a narrative voice (which belongs to the headlines above panels) and interesting makeup effects that mimic the horrible images that old EC artists did so well. In fact, I would be willing to bet that when Boyette saw his lead man during the casting, he immediately saw that the guy was so close to being the crazy characters who glittered and faced. artists like Johnny Craig and Jack Davis , drew as a real man, could be and still exist in the real world, use costumes and lighting to emphasize the cartographic aspect of visuals and transform everyone into a living EK Comics (See: Front Lady's Empty Beauty, Earl's Strong Bony Features, Strangely Bronze Skin and Sharp Chin, Platinum 'Doing on High, Bony Black Adherents, etc.) <br /> <br /> This would explain the film is a failure. Boyette knew how to "frame" things, but didn't know how to deal with three dimensions and moving bodies. Boyette knew how to tell a haunted story within the comic book, but the nuances of the film and the live actors escaped him. Of course, he wouldn't be the first person with this problem - look at what Joel Schumacher "Batman" did. But he didn't have a big budget to hide behind him. In any case, I think Boyette has left this train wreck and probably spent less time thinking about the "Dungeon of Harrow" than the people on these boards of this movie. He did, in some unclear ways, what he decided to do, and you had to respect him ... even if you don't care about "Harrow."
