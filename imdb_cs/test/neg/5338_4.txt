Oh gosh, I'm really full of all those generic Japanese horror movies about long-haired female ghosts and scary kids. "Ghost Train" is no exception.It is clearly influenced by "Ring", "Ju-On", "Trigger" and "Pulse." Two years ago I was in such modern ghost stories because I usually managed to give some goosebumpy, unfortunately not Nothing fresh or interesting in the "Ghost Train." In fact, the film is really boring. Missing in the subway tunnel - as well as a primary school classmate-Nana must investigate the mystery of multiple disappearances, with the help of a juvenile train conductor and another "vanished" mother of the child some slightly spooky moments, however CGI effects are ridiculous and the top is illogical.
