If you're at home for the weekend, very bored and lacking the will to move, with absolutely nothing better to do with your life for the next few hours you can enjoy making fun of this movie. Acting and the script and generating movies from this movie are not really so bad, so it really allows you to sit. It is a defitnly film that would show up in the middle class health class to teach the danger of premarital sex. Or they could also show that they teach the danger of very lame music - the rock band Brian Austin Green is really terrible, I think it is a much bigger threat to society than reluctant parents.
