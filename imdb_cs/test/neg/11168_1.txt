Stay away from this movie. The fact that you are reading reviews tells me that you have already been tainted by the fear he wears. This is a really horrible movie ... so let's go to trouble. Writing and Directing: It wouldn't surprise me if it was a group of oversized students who watched "shouting" and "I know what you did last summer" several times. GIANT GAPING hole plot; while I can't congratulate them on this movie, his pretty knowing they're finally trained. Actors (or lack of them): Only the best film for this movie ... the best of the extras that have ever enjoyed the screen now play in their debut as a speaker! As a disclaimer, I must note that I am able to watch and enjoy anything. I recognize a good movie when I see it, but I can still giggle and sneer during Bubble Boy (yes people, its true); so when I say to avoid something, I know I'm not kidding.
