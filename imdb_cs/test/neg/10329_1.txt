This movie is # 1 in the list of the worst movies I've ever seen, with "killer lessons" in place # 2. ), the music score could have come from a bad x-rated movie and the story was totally ridiculous. This had to do with a typical action film: dialogues were short and consisted mainly of syllable words. However, unlike the average action film, there was no real action in this case. Boring. The only reason I continued to observe that at one point there will be at least one interesting scene in this movie ... <br /> <br /> Thumbs down on this one.
