Or better yet, watch Fandango if you want to see really smart and funny male college aging. Rolling Kansas sounded promising (in fact, the program guide gave him 2.5 out of 4 stars, which usually means it's quite observable), but I quickly advanced. Usually, road trip movies have great music, but I don't even remember if there was music. The only high point was a small role with Rip Torn as a wise old tracker / guru. Otherwise, joking and timing missed all the way. The four main characters are unknown actors and I don't remember seeing them in another movie. (Oh, yeah, I see there was Thos. Hayden Church, but she's all good, bad or indifferent). This movie is about as fun as someone else stoned when you're not.
