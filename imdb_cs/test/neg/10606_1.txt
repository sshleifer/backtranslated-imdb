Being a fan of the series I thought how bad the movie could be? Well, I have an answer. Some movies should never be done. Why say a remake of the series when the only similarity is that there are three main characters. The Pete character in the series was not a whiney little child as pictured in the movie. The only good thing about this movie besides music and that Clare Danes is pretty was that it was short. What's with the dance scene ??? The only reason I didn't get out of this movie was that it was so bad that it was funny. Maybe it was a plan! It's really bad when a cheap television show is 60 years better than 90 million movies for $ 90 million. El Mariachi cost only $ 7,000 and is a much better film. Don't waste money when it comes to tape, it's not even for rent.
