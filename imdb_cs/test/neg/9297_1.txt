Comedy? What is so funny watching an ugly deadly alcoholic attending 6 sessions (when I turned him off) alchoholics anonymous? They embark on a pitiful scenario of grunt and mutter and drunk slings. Served with Hollywood Religious Algae "God Will Save You" Redemption Drivel Another reviewer mentioned "Sassy Dialogue" Tea Leone - I managed to watch almost an hour of this boring movie and I haven't seen any sassy yet - in fact my 80-year-old grandmother has more fun comebacks than the character of tea in this waste. Tea is more stony and faces less emotion than Keanu - actually one wonders if it is also dependent on something - maybe the botox's face is so wooden? Save yourself from the death of boredom from this movie.
