This is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. I think you could get it out of the title. Also there is a special love scene that could be the weirdest in movie history. I don't even remember why I saw the movie or when. It's just a terrible movie watching experience. On the other hand, if you are looking for the ultimate weirdest movie to waste two hours of your time, then rent it by all means. Good luck in finding a local store. I doubt that this film is in very wide distribution. And please do not show it to children in any way because it can forever distort their moving minds.
