Let me first say that I rarely review the movies, just comment on whether I am blown away or disappointed in something I thought would be good. Killshot was a great disappointment on many levels. The screenplay was terrible, acting was subpar (espically derived from heavy weights like Rourke and Lane) and editing and effects were comic, (blow cars etc. etc.) Rosario Dawson had a terrible role, I can't believe it even accepted, it was such abuse of her talent that I can't even give words. I should have known how I saw a trailer for this movie three years ago and was still in the field that their movie was a serious problem with this movie .......... B movie all the way ... ..... Don't bother if your bored ........
