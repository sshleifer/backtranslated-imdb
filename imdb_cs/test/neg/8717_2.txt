Certainly one of the lightest shows ever made on these shores and what he says. Even many of the leading actors did not stick all the time. The fact that she has been running for eight years is a sad indictment of the average intelligence and cultural interest of the viewer Aussie. It went round and round in circles, with repeated gags and badly drawn characters. Arthur MacArthur, for God. did they really pay the writers of this show? I wonder if anyone checked their qualifications. There were tired gags about rural people and second-rate farce situations, which were bad imitations of thousands of English and American sitcoms that had been before. I think that's what I hate so much about it, that none of them seem to want to be unforgettable, original or clever, instead choosing the lowest common denominator at any time.
