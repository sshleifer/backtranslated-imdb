After spending six years of previous writing and production, Luc Besson returns to the director's chair with Angel-A. I'm a huge LÃ©on fan, and I really liked the prospect of a black and white French film from the same guy. Paris. Unable to pay his debts and reach the edge of the Eiffel Tower, he decided to kill himself. He does this by being a mysterious woman who decides to save himself. Determined to thank him, he begins to help him repair his life. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a few laughs that go well. The visuals are pretty nice and work well with the sights of Paris. But that's it. That's all the movie has to do. And these mere two aspects cannot do anything to prevent the film of horrible filmmaking from disappearing. Although I cannot fundamentally cause the main character (but his discrepancies are close), the same name is terrible. Terrible screen and bitterly unpleasant. The plot itself is ridiculously inconsistent and sometimes bizarre stupid, especially the end; the end, which completely bloody emerging redemptions induced by scenes immediately before him. Perhaps the funniest scene I've had to burst the observation is stupid, indulgent, melodramatic, and very terrible to be "so bad it's funny." The overall premise of the film might present potential, but is brutally massacred by the continually severe implementation of its ideas. The movie was really a task to watch, and one that screams me on the screen all the way through. <br /> <br /> Massively and extremely wrong, Angel-A is just bad. Although his occasional entertaining dialogue manages to pull out chortles in rare intervals, it is clear that this film is nothing more than outrageous.
