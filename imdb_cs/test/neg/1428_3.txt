Strangeland is a horrible horror / technological thriller. Dee Snider plays Carleton Hendricks, a disgusting computer madman who prays for young girls through chat rooms. His ridiculous philosophies about pain and suffering are both misleading and totally unfounded. There is no link to reality with the ideas presented in this movie, it's more like Dee Snider, who has sat down and tried to figure out the weirdest things that can impress horror fans and maybe some of his old fans, but the ultimate the result is just awful. Unfortunately, for me, as a horror fan, the cover of this movie looks very good and immediately caught my eye, which is the main reason I was cheated on watching. I assure you it's not a good horror movie. It's a disturbing but boring attempt to suggest what could continue in the minds of people who behave as Carleton Hendricks did in this movie. The sad part is that no one will. Marilyn freakin's wife, 'Manson, doesn't go so much and the fact that he had a song on the soundtrack clearly shows that the movie wasn't meant to be fun with his music (it would be a Sniper Sniper), it's more like Dee Snider she tried to resurrect her career and imagine herself as a sick person. Dee, it seems time has come to die all this ...
