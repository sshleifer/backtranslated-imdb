I received this film in a package called "50 all-star Movies" for $ 18 (every 45 cents). Many are good. This one was terrible. It was a tricky repetition made 1000 times before and always better. Frozen ex-jock dared to train a team composed of juvenile delinquents. They learn from him that they can do it by playing the rules. I'm sure the kids and the locals were thrilled to be included in the "real TV movie," but I can't imagine what the people who started and built this project thought they could bring it to a loser. I waited to see that it was a "new twist" or a "new angle", but honestly, it wasn't coming. Avoid this movie. Forget 45 cents, I want 96 minutes of life.
