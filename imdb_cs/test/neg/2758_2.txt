a crazy story about the morale of a high school boy who is a pretty stereotyped nerd. He is clever, but has no friends, no social skills, and a lazy loser who borrows money from HIM. Pretty girl hits him (he should know he wants something - he should be smart, isn't he?). He manipulates a poor desperate fool to write his semester documentary on Shakespeare, which the teacher knows immediately that she couldn't write. She loses the girl (not that she really had it) the trust of her teacher and his college scholarship, all in one stroke. Marv is so stupid and desperate for the love that some heroin traders have decided to weave through the warehouse he works in. \ t Then maybe a cheesy little bitch will be stunned and wants to marry him. Sad, really sad. Marv is such a miserable dope (and quite thoughtless, for a supposedly smart guy. I mean, I'm trying to rob a drug dealer? Does the boy have a loose bolt?) To stop apologizing and get a terrible urge to kick him in the ass instead. The girl, of course, tells her boyfriend about Marv's robbery to her, and talks to him and his buddies to steal money from Marv and the company. They're trying to do it, and in the process, they can shoot a few people. The cops appear at the same time and the idiot Marv is pulled away, utter shame forever. I know that this thing was aimed at making teens behave themselves and show them the consequences of bad behavior, but all that really illustrated was the consequences of stupid behavior. Which is of course the premature end of your film career. Goodbye, Marv, we never knew you. And thank God for that.
