I was hit by a terrible act and a script for this film. All characters seem to be motionless by personal problems - rather like deer in the spotlights. When decisive action has to be taken, they swing around whining and moaning about their emotions. I found myself screaming on the TV screen trying to wake them up to their situation and TEMPORARY! The plot line is unlikely. Each time a decision on a lead character is decisive, one of the other characters has to make all the problems with the obvious decision, as if making the decision even more difficult - it's a tried and tested melodramatic trick and just wants you to moan. Obviously, importing the decision is obvious - you don't have to treat the audience like idiots. Overall, there is too much emotional melodrama throughout the movie.
