This is one funny movie. I suggest you rent it, buy a few liters of rum and invite the whole crew. My favorite parts were. shootings that were so well choreographic that John Woo himself was jealous, .2. Beautiful special effects .3. Academic Awards for Games and .4. The fact that every single gangsta in the film seemed to make a bad personification of "Scarface". Master P as Cuban Godfather! This is a breakthrough territory. And with a well-written dialogue, including lines like "the only difference between you and Rico, I'm alive and your dead," this movie is a masterpiece. Yeah, right.
