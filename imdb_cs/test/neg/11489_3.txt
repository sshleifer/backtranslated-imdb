When I saw Icon being on TV, I was surprised. I know that the first guide to where she was heading was the fact that it was on the Hallmark channel - it must be said - sorry !! I was hopeful when I saw that FF was Exec Producer, but very quickly he saw that the only real way the TV movie and book were similar was only in the name and the names of the characters. The TV conspiracy was at least a bit of a buzz, but I agree that the action itself was worth 3 stars. In my personal opinion, Mr. Swayze could portray a valid monk, but I think it would be a much longer film to do film justice, and I don't think Hollywood would go to conspiracy discredit. An example is the horrible film version of the Summary of All Fears - do I need to say more?
