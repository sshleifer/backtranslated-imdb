The Heart of Darkness is an insult to Joseph Conrad's book! To be honest, the film made me sleep. On the other hand, the book was certainly extraordinary. I feel that the film missed a few key elements and missed some of the main points of the book. In addition, the actors were boring and lacked originality and enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Although not an adventurous story or easy to understand, the book is full of hidden meaning and intriguing twists. The book, though very confusing and complicated, is overwhelming. When you finally understand it, you feel that you have learned something. Novella, or a short story, had several key ideas, such as vanity and madness that the film missed. In addition, several key scenes have been changed, which in turn affected the entire site. Many scenes seemed to be very "jerky" in the sense that they didn't fit together. In short, the film seemed to be a bad interpretation of the book. <br /> <br /> I would recommend watching this movie only if you can't imagine or understand the book, but I'd miss this movie. It was terrible and utterly confused. If you've never read a book, don't watch the movie, because you need basic information from the book to understand the movie. The film was a terrible spin-off of excellent and detailed books.
