I have to admit that this film brought me some occasional laughter in my face. OK, but that doesn't mean it's a good movie. Most characters are terrible stereotypes and truly unconvincing. Not all of them give great performances, but some really do, but they don't succeed because their characters are badly written. The perfect example is Julia Koschitz: Changing her eating habits from one call to another, she doesn't drink alcohol for another champagne allergy in one speech, she feels too beautiful for most people (she really is) she still ends up with "perfect" appearance and refuses some "more realistic" guys a chance, and so on ... The end is very cheesy, although I like one of the final scenes when everyone finally stops talking and the director gives us a chance to catch up again. Basically, Shoppen is a movie that offers some cheap laughs (mostly because it is about sex and relationships, I suppose) and maybe a little fun. But the whole picture is one big stereotype and there is nothing special about it.
