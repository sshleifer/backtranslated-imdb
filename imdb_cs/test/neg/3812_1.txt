Harry Knowles has a quote right on the front of the DVD with the inscription "Another Horror Icon" Really?!?!?!? I heard a lot of humbug about it, but I wasn't entirely convinced. However, I am a fan of the horror movie and give a chance to all horrors. Regardless of budget or rating cause ya you never know where to find another gem. Not here. Hatchet is poorly conceived, misbehaved and not funny. Just because you have actors who played Freddy Jason and Candyman and Buffy chic topless with a stack of gore doesn't mean you're a horror expert. I don't even want to describe the plot because he's so stupid. Honestly, my money is at Rob Zombie. There's a man who knows the old school. Forget this waste.
