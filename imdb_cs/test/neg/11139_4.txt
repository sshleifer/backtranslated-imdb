Since Andy Warhol's portrayal of the movies I shot Andy Warhol and Basquiat, it's the kind of movie I would predict that Andy Warhol could do - airy, illogical, snobbish, amoral. The film (almost non-existent) conspiracy, which is sometimes incredibly incredible, is offset by the film's crude cinema. The film has a way to be unreal, but to dictate reality to the viewer. The only valuable part of the film is the development of the relationship between Joe and Holly and every thing in it should be seen as a characterization device. There are several comic scenes that I admit are funny, but Trash is really just about the nature of studying unengaging people, which is slightly enjoyable if you don't mind watching nudity and i.v. drug use.
