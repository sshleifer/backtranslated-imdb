This film really shows its age. The print I saw was terrible because of the age, but it is possible that there are better prints. However, this was not a major problem with the film. The problem was that although the film was made in 1933, it was basically a silent film in which the film scattered most amateurly (just a few sentences). Sometimes the backs of the characters curled or spoke with their hands on their faces - all in a pathetic attempt to cover their lips and "skillfully" (?) Hide the fact that the film was dubbed. It is true that this Czech film would have to be dubbed into many languages, but this was really stupid and obvious. It just looked cheap. Overall, the movie looked low in budget and stupid. It's really a shame because there was a grain of good story - a young woman who marries an older man who is either gay and / or not interested in women. But in the 21st century, few people would really be willing to sit in this archaic mess. With a few glimpses of the naked (and somewhat robust) Hedy Lamarr, it is not worth it that the film he debuted does not happen. Even by the standards of 1933, this film was a poorly made bagpipe. The only interesting thing about the film is to see how Lamarr differs in 1933 compared to the glamorous image Hollywood made when it came to America - it looks like two completely different people. It's such an incomplete and technically inferior movie, I don't see how such enthusiastic reviews got. For technical problems alone, the film cannot rate 10 or something near it.
