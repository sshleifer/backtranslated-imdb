I worked in a company that originally released this film, Vestron Pictures. Vestron had the same problem as many small independent film companies had. Not that money just bought a good movie. Take a look at Kevin Costner's Waterworld. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, if you have a talented person who makes an acquisition or development, you can create your new talent. But there was no such person in Vestron, and always avoided in some important area. In this case, it was up to the director and the writer. Which means it's pretty hard to have a decent movie, even with the big cast of this movie. I think the basic prerequisite for this movie was "Let's put a lot of unpredictable characters in the room and see if something interesting happens." Most Vestron movies have ended with a very distinctive look and feel to them. My wife and I have developed the ability to recognize this quality even in non-Vestron films. We have even been able to watch this quality many times from watching only trailers or TV commercials. We would sit there, watch a trailer or an advertisement, and then we would turn to everyone and almost in sync we would say, "Now it's a Vestron movie!" This is the movie Vestron.
