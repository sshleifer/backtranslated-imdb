I give this Vampire Assassins "2" movie mainly because it had no sex or nudity. Otherwise, I wasn't sure why it was at all. It was more like training to make a movie with a very limited budget. The best actors were Derek and Slovak. They were followed by a "biker-dude" with Pleather pants and a silver belt. He was fine too. Most of the film was shot in a distribution warehouse. If you are tired of watching kung fu kick boxing pieces, you can check out Scott, Windex and other cleaning products. You'll have a lot of time to do this, believe me. I almost started making a list. Dialogue and kung-fu bits were very slow. They spoke slowly, fought slowly, etc. I don't know why. At least with the slow delivery of the actors, you can hear everything very clearly. I'm trying to find good things I could say about this movie. We followed it to the end to see if it was better but not. We could never decide whether actors really knew martial arts, or just acted as if they knew martial arts. You can watch yourself and make decisions. My favorite line was something like (talking vampire :) "what are you looking at?" another person reacts: "your bad dental work."
