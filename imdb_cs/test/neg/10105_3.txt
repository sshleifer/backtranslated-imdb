OK boxes look interesting, the opening has great music and its original original, except for everything OK. But when the movie starts ... well it's not my first videoville movie, I've been watching Ghost Lake and its very similar to this movie, except for his worse here. The story sounded interesting at first, but the whole movie looked like a movie shot by a lot of college students, with a special effect that I laughed at, blood looked like a mixture of red and white, the fire on the demon's face looked like it was a program I could buy at local computer store. The whole movie is filmed in the daytime (very good for a movie to be a horror movie) and there is no gore there (just 1 scene and it looks so at home and not trustworthy) and close to no blood (this can be considered a great thing in terms of appearance blood show) and 1 demon for the whole movie. The story goes nowhere, gives you the impression that it will never start, there's so much useless scene to do just to get the average duration of the movie (when a daemon searches a guy in dogs for about 4 minutes ...) Too many slow things. Well, let's say this movie is one of the Z series and very poor. Any great idea is lost and you get a nasty movie. It's been bored for a long time, and I'm not the one who's very bored with a horror movie, a man who's even like a dead house and alone in Uwe Boll's darkness and probably know the name of being one of the worst directors. But here it looks very much like some guys who want to make a movie for fun. Plus for us a French spokesperson (I understand English I prefer watching a movie in my native language) there is a usual videoville wrong translation. In a normal movie you can barely see his not speaking actor (you have to check on your lips, etc.), here you just have to listen and you know it. Very cheesy
