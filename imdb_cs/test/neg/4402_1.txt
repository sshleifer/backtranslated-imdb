It's like a school video project and a propaganda film that sleeps the class as well as teachers. <br /> <br /> Totally boring long silent (yes, silent) strings of unrelated video clips. Instead of watching this film dry or grow grass, it will be more interesting if you do not want Arabs to be harmful to everyone around you. Sulieman (director) should be embarrassed by this lame waste film. <br /> <br /> He deserves one for film quality, zero for ridiculous propaganda messages, and a negative script number (or lack thereof.)
