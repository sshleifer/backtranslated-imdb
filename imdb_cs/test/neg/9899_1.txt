There were some great TV movies in that past. I mean epics like "Roots" and "Lone Dove". Category 6: The Day of Destruction will not be remembered to advance the causes of films made for television. The sadly bad story, surpassed only by the terrible scenario, the Cat6DD, as I like to call it, inspires more sympathy for the actors involved than the nature terror that the film was supposed to bring. The sound you hear during the movie is supposed to be the sound of the wind, but instead it's the career of Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy and Thomas Gibson (Greg, duo Dharma & Greg) faster than the houses and trucks and cows. he can fly out of one of the 15 tornadoes we see in the first 5 minutes of the movie. The film was advertised as "The Nature of Off Amok," instead we get a lame story about how 15 different weather systems conspire to produce 150 degree days in Chicago, then a blizzard the next day from a hurricane that was in the Gulf of Mexico that combined. with a storm system from Canada, but actually had its origins in the current flow altered by global warming. No matter what the story was, the acting was terrible, the words the actors said were stupid, and 13 scientists across the country had coronaries after hearing the dribbles that came out of the movie. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters, the special effects were subpar, even for the television standards, and the story lines were useless. All in all, I really don't like this "TV event".
