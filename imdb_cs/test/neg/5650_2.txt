Well, I saw this movie based on a fairly high score (7.1) and some good reviews. Usually, the IMDb is a good guide to the score, although in this case I was very cheated. The film is a contemporary detective story where Vinnie Jones as an investigative journalist investigates the death of a construction worker. Mixed with this is formed by Dickens' novel (called Riddle, set in the 18th or 19th century), which also deals with the murder story. Both storylines are linked by the discovery of an unpublished manuscript. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting? It could have been, but this film has failed in a number of areas: 1) Acting. Best at best, but it's noticeable. It's no worse than your average British sitcom, though the film is a bit better. Especially with a score above 7. 2) Music. The music used is just awful, distracting and unpleasant. Especially pub music and music that plays in a journalistic apartment. 3) Story. That's a big joke. There are holes everywhere, and even a compulsory love story is so unrealistic that it's almost funny. In addition, without going into any detail, I can safely say that the end is absurd and one of the worst actors and events of the year. 4) Working with the camera. Sometimes the positions and views of the cameras are disturbing and do not serve the "story". I'm a little movie fanatic and on average I watch 1 to 2 movies a day, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen in months. Don't waste your time or waste on this waste.
