Technically, this film sucks ... lol. But it is also cheerful. Whether it is deliberately funny, I don't know. Terrible in all aspects, this is also the only movie I know of having 1) fat boy is played by a slim actor in a (very obvious) fat suit, 2) an attractive 30-something actress plays a character who should be in her late the 1960s, and 3) most compliments for plastic daisies of daisies ever. Don't take this movie seriously, just watch the laughter .... great party movie.
