For a series that was inspired by Kolchak, it is ironic that X Files' first attempt at an episode of vampires should land right on his ass. 3 has always confused me and - with the risk that it will sound like horrible Hans Keller - I often wondered if I miss the point. The story looks like a jigsaw puzzle that has pieces that don't match the box, and as a result you spend a cozy evening by the fire trying to balance the sky that is really the sea. This incomplete feeling does not matter how many times you return the episode and no matter what attention you pay. I know that this assessment puts me at risk of being dragged into the Whitby emergency camp by teenage vampires who drink my blood while listening to Busted, but that's the risk I'm willing to accept. I've always been a werewolf.
