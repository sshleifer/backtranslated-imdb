Watching this movie and then listening to the commentary is clear that Michael Radford doesn't understand this game. The first guideline that fails to fully understand the work is that it is trying to build a 17th-century movie in Venice. Which sounds really strange, yes, that the film's misunderstanding would mean that it was trying to make it as accurate as possible. But anyone who has studied Shakespeare knows that while most of his games are set in exotic local residents, culture and values ​​are always contemporary England. The film does not hurt, but shows a lack of knowledge. Where Radford kills the movie is that he does so dead seriously. He manages to suck every joke from the script, making the entire production apartment. Every ounce of passion is defeated from the characters. Even Shylock's speech "We do not want to bleed" is a mild, unpleasant scream of cholerics that seems to just say and do what it does because it has. Lovers are solemn and too reticent (Joseph Fiennes is delivering this year's barely audible whisper to some of the most romantic lines in the cinema), Gratiano (who has to promise to act at one point) is more sober and collected than Bassiano (who promises him that will behave), Jessica is reluctant to leave her father and spend her life with Lorenzo. the viewer laughed at Portia's 'pound of flesh, nothing more, no less' sentence; he finally came to the conclusion that he had to laugh. "The Merchant of Venice" is a comedy, and Radford is delighted with the idea that the most absurd and hysterical part of the story is something that is the most daringly provocative drama. <br /> <br /> The film does not yet have a clear focus, extracts some of the most entertaining scenes. The characters are forced into high dramatic veils, so they act as Ibsen's characters reading Victorian poetry. And the comic end where all the good guys go to bed happily is drowned in a dignified despair that feels as if it has found a stiff upper lip with an impending death, rather than accepting lovers. Even Lancelot and Antonio leave the film that holds hats as aristocratic mourners. The film is badly done because of the creative power that the script is not explaining. It's a stern where it should be hysterical. It is reserved where it should be passionate. It's Michael Radford where William Shakespeare should be.
