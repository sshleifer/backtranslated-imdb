If you want to see someone accidentally eating another man's testicles of another man, or take a look at a number of pathetically fake hard-ons at a wedding, or listen to a man talking about how good it was to have sex with a girl while she was vomiting, then it's a movie for your. Changing, in the throat of breaking fashion, between romantic and rough comedy, Tomcats is certainly interesting. The beautiful Jaime Pressly plays the wife of Horatio Sanze (tell me another), which is in many situations silhouettes with other women, but not surprisingly no nudity. Jake Busey is thoroughly revolting like a dog you wouldn't want as a friend. Shannon Elizabeth and Jerry O'Connell are both a good and compelling pair, but the movie is too busy trying to disgust it to be good.
