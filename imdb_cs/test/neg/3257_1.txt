I have vague memories that this film is fun. <br /> <br /> When I saw it again, I changed or was thinking about another movie. It seems we should have been sympathetic to the character of Jackie Mason, but nothing in the film really affects this emotion. It is remarkable that he is indeed the only person who has offered a bidding dialogue with loved ones. No one else can stand in a state that would be vaguely human. I don't like golf either, but as the movie went on, I found myself really rooted in Robart Stack and the club guys, really hoping to repel Mason and Chevy Chase.
