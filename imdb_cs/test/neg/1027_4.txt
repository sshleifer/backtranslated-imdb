Technically nasty (with audible "pop" between scenes) and amazingly amateur, "meat" requires a lot of patience to sit and probably turn off most viewers; but the dialogues that are amazingly true and Joe Dallesandro, who exhibits his body in almost every scene, also provide absolutely convincing performance. A certain curiosity, but more polished "Trash", made two years later, is a step forward. I suggest you watch it instead. (* 1/2)
