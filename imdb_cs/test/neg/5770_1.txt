And believe me, it's a stunning success. Take "Jolly Roger: Cutter's Cove Massacre," change the pirate's killer to a prospector, change his obsession from a buried treasure to old gold and its color from green to dark blue. You now have a "Miner Massacre". The problem is that at least "Jolly Roger" was fun enough - though in so bad - it's a good way - to watch you for two hours. There is no scene for belt killing or any bizarre murder. I can't tell you how many times I lost interest in the Miner massacre and started to make meals or clean the apartment. And the end is absolutely stupid. The 49er dude just randomly re-emerges out of nowhere to kill a local sheriff while the main actor and actress sits in a sheriff's cruiser, screaming. Really horrible movie.
