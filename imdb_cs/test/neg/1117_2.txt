I guess people who talked about this drive are friends of the director or something. That's bad, not in Michael Jackson's song. To compare the stimulation of this film with the progress of the snails would be to offend the snail. This film is limping after what seems like eternity, all that takes us to some scary zombie children with silly makeup and some kind of vendetta, or thirst for blood, or anything else. Believe me, you don't care. The very idea that Mommy would move her two daughters into this dilapidated and FILTHY house is absurd. Worse, I just didn't care. Backstory about zombie kids? Snoring. Threat to Mom and / or Daughters? Don't worry. <br /> <br /> In short, WOW was this boring. Don't bother.
