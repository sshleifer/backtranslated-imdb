The atmosphere and droll dialogue will not buy this overrated classic. Boyer is a French thief who hides in Casbah in Algiers while the police try to figure out how to get him out. Meanwhile, he falls on Lamarr and tries to find a way to escape. The movie is slow to start and never go anywhere. Reminiscent of Casablanca in some ways, it's completely lacking a larger topic than a person wanted to seduce a good woman. It's all talk-talk-talk, with endless scenes of Boyers spreading between his idiotic cohorts and Boyer, who looks at Lamarr in the shadows. I personally didn't care about Boyer's character for a while, so the tension was completely nonexistent. The 30's of the 20th century's compositions have thrown themselves into a mushy tale like Boyer's followers - the boys who clearly don't belong in Algiers. Sigrid Gurie is a wild jealous friend of Boyer. His insolent woman doesn't mean anything good for any future he could have with Lamarr. Especially bad is the long sequence in which a subordinate comes to tell Boyer how another follower has been captured. It sounds excited ... too bad we didn't see for ourselves. The end is completely anticlimactic and seems remarkable just because it's not a happy Hollywood ending; it does not stop it from being satisfied.
