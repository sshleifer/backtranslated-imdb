I decided to watch this movie because I didn't see Carol Lombard in any movie. I'm sorry it had to be this, because, frankly, it's a dog? and even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, both were great actors. The problem with the film is simple: trying to put too much, too quickly into the story of a young lawyer (John Manson played Stewart) who marries Jane (played Lombard) within an hour of meeting her. What is a cliche? Breathe in a hurry, repent in free time ... <br /> <br /> In short, the story is a series of episodes that show the deteriorating financial condition of couples, their problems with John's wife, their efforts to pay. bills, John's diminished office position, the arrival of their son, John Jnr (unexpected and causing further friction at home with his mother), the anxiety of couples about their marriage, the illness of a child who worsens to bring a heroic flight to a lonely storm a special serum to save the baby, and finally John was accepted as a junior partner at a law firm. How many other clichés could the writers include? Maybe my mother will die soon after? There wasn't much comedy; the drama was insignificant at best; The dialogue was painful when he heard. Only the four main players were enough to act. This was the period at the end of the Great Depression, when the US relied on a long decline? during which many people experienced all the events portrayed in the film. So, did it make sense for Selznick to confirm good ol 'home spun American values ​​of family, relationships, heroism, perseverance and initiative? ? all in the background of "average" American family. Who is better than Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard? It should be noted that the film was released in early 1939; so, was it planned in 1938 ?? Soon after the US began to get production for the upcoming World War II. Therefore, this kind of film was a big booster for the general public at the time, many of which would soon have to join England in the war. As many knew, Hollywood and Washington created an uneasy alliance before the war, during the war, and after the war. However, I'm glad I saw it? as a piece of hidden social-political propaganda. But I'll have to see more Lombard movies to get a better appreciation of my gaming range. As another reviewer remarked, just look at this because you saw all Stewart's films; otherwise don't bother.
