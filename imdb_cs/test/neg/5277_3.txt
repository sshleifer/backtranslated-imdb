This movie is terribly bad. Kevin Spacey is a really great actor, shining in LA Confidential, American Beauty, Usual Suspects, 7 etc. But this is really nonsense, he came nowhere near a decent Irish accent, maybe he should train him with Kate Hudson while she did it. he did about Adam. For Irish people, this film is ridiculous and even worse, it's quite irritating for several scenes. I think the producers made this film and hoped that the target group (outside Europe) would never see or hear about "General" or Martin Cahill and would be fascinated by an interesting and entertaining story. Total crud !!
