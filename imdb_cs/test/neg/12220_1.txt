I'm sure there is a document somewhere in the ruins of this Yawn-fest, with enough time for the producers to find it. I'm not joining any of the characters. This is a problem for the document. This disconnection will soon manifest itself in total hostility bordering on hostility. Although due to the poor flow of stories, I'm not really sure what's happening to them and what are the consequences of what they're trying to do. The story and faces jump so fast that it's very hard to fully understand what's going on. The third founder, who will take them for $ 700K, is introduced so late for the movie, Khaleil and Tom must backpaddle (to no avail) explain "oh yeah, the guy created the idea too". And just when I thought I had a light grip on who they were all tertiary figures, some crazy woman in boasting about getting a puppy? What's wrong with that? Did Tom really have to give employees all the unpleasant speeches? I can imagine how boredom feels when it really happens. Actually, I think I feel for them.
