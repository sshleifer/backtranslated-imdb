Strange Things Become Americans Will (Greg Evigan), Maura (Alexandra Paul) and their young daughter Aubrey (Briana Evigan, daughter of Greg's real life) when they move to a large, newly inherited house in Ireland. Crispy corpses are found in the basement, turkey sprays blood, furniture movements and dead child spirits, and the hairy old lady appears to scare the girl. Eventually, paranormal investigators are asked to drive out evil spirits, but Maura is equally obsessed and chasing everyone around with a meat cleaver. This movie is full of clich√©s, but Alexandra Paul has excellent performance. .. Too bad they don't belong to this movie (nor any other thing I think from hand)! She could barely keep her face straight, and her excessive and hysterical screams of excitement are a joy to see. In any case, it's more interesting to watch than anything else in this movie. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
