"Escape from Hell" is not made with enough art to mask what it is: crass exploitation. Direction and writing are both careless: for example, working with a camera while fighting between Cintia Lodetti and Ajita Wilson is so bad that you can hardly tell what's going on; If an alcoholic, but a kind doctor, didn't kill the killer, the guards would never follow him after his escape, and the girls - "false plague" plan worked well until then, but he just had to destroy it. I would give this movie 4 out of 10 (the sweaty lesbian scene is not bad and Christina Lai has an incredibly beautiful face and body), but the particularly disgusting scene of abuse forced me to cut 2 points. Of course, some patients take it as a recommendation. After all, one thing that is even more worrying than this movie is that some people have given her positive reviews!
