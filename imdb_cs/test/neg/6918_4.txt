"The scientist has developed a serum that grotesquely distorts the hands and heads of the victim. The scientist decides to use his serum on a concert pianist to make money from him for treatment, and to marry his daughter," he added. DVD Sleeve Sleeve Synopsis. J. Carrol Naish (as Dr. Igor Markoff) plays "Monster Maker" in Bela Lugosi's low budget mode. Mr Naish's serum causes a real disorder, "acromegaly", defined by the American Heritage as "a chronic adult disease that is marked by the expansion of the bones of the limbs, face and jaw, which is caused by excessive pituitary activity". Ralph Morgan (as Anthony Lawrence) plays a handicapped man with some dignity. Pretty blonde Wanda McKay (as Patricia "Pat" Lawrence) is a daughter wished by a mad scientist Naish; in the early scenes, Mrs. McKay and Naish are merrily releasing. Watch Tal Birell (as Maxine) in a surprisingly good performance; she plays somewhat of Garbo-like, and long suffering, assistant to Naish. Mrs. Birell definitely steals the film; and you have to question common sense. Markoff, if you drop her. Glenn Strange (as Steve) and the crazy gorilla (Ray Corrigan) contribute to the fun. Monster makeup (Maurice Seiderman) is very good. Monster Maker Sam Newfield Ralph Morgan Tala Birell
