I was looking forward to this on the basis of an evaluation of this and a fairly good rating. That was a great disappointment. This does not mean that the candle is for contemporary zombie flicks like Shaun Dead, Day of the Dead, Land of the Dead etc. Horror flicks sometimes take some time to go, you need to build characters, so when you snort it, you feel empathy etc. but also So, there's a full 45 minutes to sit here before you sniff a corpse, until then, its like watching a bad soap opera, nothing of any interest or relevance happens, and if you're going to watch this for the first time, you can honestly start watching after 45 minutes, nothing escapes you. When things go, it's all very inferior. Some of these killings and supplements are well done, others are done very badly, there is no consistency and there are some really shocking continuity mistakes and some of the most wooden games I've ever seen. All of this could be clear if you really believed it was happening on the plane, but firing firearms, burning fireworks, without pilots in the cockpit in a violent storm, but the plane remains in the air. It's not all that is happening. Oh, and it really takes a minute for a jet fighter to hit a plane that is a few hundred meters away. I know his zombie movie and you have to stretch things, but this movie along with other major glitches mentioned above had zero credibility. One is missing.
