This movie is likely to be a real delay if you don't understand the circumstances in which it was created. The Marx were chosen to cast in the movie version of the game that was not originally written for them. These are somehow embedded in the roles. Ironically, it might be more fun to use different actors who are not so much expecting them. Instead, it was forever anchored as part of a canon that it really does not deserve to belong to.
