This film is not one of those films so bad that it is angry and crazy because it seems to be on its own but it is not entirely funny. It's just that there's nothing interesting about this movie. There are no real jokes to entertain you, just watch 80 minutes, then turn it off. I bought it on a very budget DVD and I love it because it doesn't cost much. This is not one of those films that are so bad that you can watch friends when you get drunk / high and have a good gig. I hated it as if I hated some movies, but it's kind of boring and not worth investing. The only people who voted 10 votes for this movie had to be linked in some way, because I can't imagine that this movie liked other than small children
