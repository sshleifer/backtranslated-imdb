This is the continuation of Octopus. <br /> <br /> Pff ... OK. Lots of footage, but pretty good. I'm surprised they actually had a huge robotic octopus that didn't really look so bad! That actually kind of surprised me. Overall, the movie was just OK fun. It never explained how the octopus got so big, and it's not even connected to the first. But it was still fun. <br /> <br /> The end of me and my friend laughed. Basically, once they blew up an octopus, the two main characters launch a bomb and five explosions, most of the tracks, appear on the screen. We joked that they went to the store in dollars and bought "five rockets in one" toy! Believe me, it must be seen to believe! All in all, stupid fun. It's worth giving a chance to buy if it's cheap.
