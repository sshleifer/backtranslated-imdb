OK, so this is horror? I'm terrified - but I'm not terrible. Black and white is artistic, but too black is exaggerated ..... about lighting. Story - serial killer ....... much of them around. It was done in the past and yes, it will continue to continue ..... but I hope not. My question is, when do viewers rejoice in waking this crazy dilemma? I think the director thought he would do something else - he would kill the children. That's how it is done. So I think he had to go to shock value ..... let them kill in the darkest fashion. Okay ..... the audience was shocked ..... disgusted ... disgusted ..... disgusted. And I got up from my seat, I felt all these things. Was he a successful director? Yes! Absolutely! These are the things he wanted me to feel and do. What do I do with feelings? More importantly, what is the "message" here? With the amazing talent that Francis Xavier "gifted" with ..... could he ever think of using it to make films that he talked about, dare to say, come out of the dark? After viewing this movie, I was in the dark, my soul was attacked ... is that what this craft is about? There are many such films - they make money I said. So what is it about people who want to see all these nasty visuals? What is happening in this world that people will pay to be terribly shocked? I'd see it again ..... no.
