This is a very low budget movie, located at one point in the valley protected by the effects of radiation. Cast, elderly man and daughter, handsome visitor, couple (hard buy and gal), rogue, donkey, and man affected by radiation, are working during the aftermath of nuclear explosion. To this is added an entity that watches women bathe. Everyone has guns, some of them are shot, some of them have children, others are murdered and others just give up. , this is a movie. Harvey Cormann's first film shows some simplicity in the film. In order to avoid expensive sets, actors go through the curtains to enter the house and get out of the house (ie the Studio). The shots shot in the hills near Hollywood are a backdrop. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't say it's worth going out of your way to see, but interesting to see how films with human items were made in the '50s.
