I only praise it in one respect. It was innovative. Innovative doesn't mean it's a good movie, it means it can give you an idea of ​​what you can take and implement in your own movies. <br /> <br /> A simple chart is .. well .. simple. I got to the point where I didn't care if he destroyed the building or not. If I had once again heard that the girl was uncomfortable giggling, I swear I'd throw a DVD out of the window. And there is a protagonist. He's trying to make him nice, but he's a crazy pervert! Sniffing girls bra, sneaking peeks at her when she is naked, putting her bra over her eyes as she sleeps, putting her bra on to blow a sex doll (which takes her panties off while hes sleeping and sliding them on his doll .. Umm) br /> <br /> What bothers me and moreso, it's a lousy toning. In the photo gallery on the DVD you can see what the movie looked like before coloring it and putting it in color (also digitally). The film looked much better without it. film just to be artistic ... bah. I understand using tricks as if the film quality was crap .. I think most people who liked this movie just liked it because the cat was nude for a good 5-10 minutes. This is not compared to Delicatessen (as many of them are tryign to do). Delicacies have characters you can get to and like ... these people just grunt and giggle. old silence. One of the problems of most foreign, especially artistic, films is that you focus on creating a piece of art and forgetting the "space" of the scene. As a result, viewers have not understood what is happening because they have no sense of the surroundings. Anyway, it's a waste. The short DVD movie, Surprise, was much better.
