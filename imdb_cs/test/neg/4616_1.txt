I never got out of the movie. I enjoyed the idea a few times, but this time I did, slipped into the end of another movie, but I had to go back and see the end of Rage as I waited for my friends. They told me I wasn't missing too much when I was gone. I was generally offended by the whole film in such a way that I could not describe it. My instinct told me to get out of the theater. It was a visceral reaction to a horrible film. The plot focused on the cruel acts of some damned teenagers against vulnerable and troubled others. There was no beam of light, an incomprehensible or sympathetic person to provide contrast. I found that even "good guys" from the movie didn't do anything for me, they were stupid, stupid, whiney, or simply ineffective. disgusting. (Not in the way I easily divided it, but rather in the display of disrespect for humanity). And besides repeating this scene, in slow motion, from so many angles, they had other visual aspects (interesting work with the camera, etc.) Potential, but sometimes they became unpleasant. I am a person who loves movies and tries to find good things about them. Usually I can find some good things to balance a not-so-good movie. I'm not saying that this movie wasn't good, but I say that whatever it was, I can't remember all the other crap that annoyed me. I'm so sorry. Perhaps the best works were clips from the classic.
