When I was young, I was a big fan of Chuck Norris. I started getting all my old movies on video so I can see them through adult eyes. I remember this one I really liked, and I thought it was one of his best. Now that I am a bit older, I can say that while it is on average, I still consider it one of his better films. In his acting career, Norris plays a cop pursued by his involvement in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie. Serial Killers are rage today, and people would like to think of them as the 1990s. In contrast, it is good to see where the current infatuation has emerged, most obviously, of action movies (as well as the stopwatch n 'slashers) of the 1970s and 1980s. While Norris attempts to humor and any form of human compassion are ham and laughter, no one could kick his head like Chuck. As a big fan of Steve James, I can also recommend this movie, ditto for Billy Drago's genre legend, as well as seeing Mitch of The Blue Brothers in a supporting role. It's not great, but it's better than anything Norris did in the 1990s.
