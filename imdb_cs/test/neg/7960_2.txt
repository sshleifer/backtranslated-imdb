Water shows the situation of Indian widows in the late 1930s, says at the end that the problem still exists largely by giving statistics at the end, referring to Gandhi several times in the film before finally having the scene depicting him and doing nothing extra commonly innovative \ t new in film. Yes, cinematography is pretty impressive, but it can't be the soul of any movie for me. India had several problems like many other nations, but many of these problems got rid of. What if the film is made on racism in America in a certain year that ends with "x number of Americans still experiencing racism today". a) How would it be relevant, and b) How would it be any thing that would be extremely common in the cinema. The View From Deepa Mehta The Interview was that this film is interpreted as a voice for marginalized everyone, where. From the reviews I have read everyone, where the ordinary thing I have heard is how the director did a great job and was brave in bringing the world to a problem. The film is more about the particular problem facing society (and has been eliminated through reforms in general). I don't see any thing that would shake the movie. In addition, the film lacked a soul and moved between Chuiyya and Kalyani. Sarala, a young Sri Lankan actress, portrayed the role of Chuiyya great and that was the only thing that surprised me about the movie, unfortunately.
