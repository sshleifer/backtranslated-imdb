I couldn't help but look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because I found that this movie was totally overwhelmed. Childish humor, cheap looking sets, cheap looking effects, a plot that makes "legally blond" look like "ordinary suspects" and so many coincidences that I can officially say that Robert Rodriguez had a brain surgery somewhere after 1996. left as his protective The mark are some cool camera moves, but where it ends. Okay, so the guy decided to do something new for a change, a children's spy movie. If I had 12, I'd feel insulted. The best thing in this movie is absolutely amazing, Carla Gugino, who just stole every scene she was in. 4/10
