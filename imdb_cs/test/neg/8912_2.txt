Ah yet another Seagal movie.In not less than a few months only arrive to fill the video store shelves.As bad as Submerged? No, but it doesn't say much. Like a perfume on a pig. Seagal is a professional thief who wants to quit, but it's one last job, just to double his boss. Land in prison and is related to a gangster who helps him break free and look for return. Br /> Its good to see Seagal does not play an agent, a cop, or what he usually plays. Actually, we get a location in the US in Las Vegas. Then on Eastern European territory as usual. There is no wire-fu here either. Don Fauntleroy is doing fine work. However most of the action and combat scenes with Stevie are clearly doubled. The cost of other films, the lack of realism and logic in even the smallest situations. minute. out of his emergency days.Nick Mancuso appears in sleep mode to check.No more rappers.Please? At this point, action scenes and land are much more predictable and recycled more generically than ever. It's an outdated scene that Seagal needs to get out or hang up.
