It must be one of the most annoying, arrogant movies I've ever seen. What a waste of budget and actors. Angelopoulos has reached new levels of arrogance. It is clear that there is virtually no action, although this part of Greek history is a material for great movies. He simply had some supposedly symbolic (actually shambola) scenes in his mind and built a whole movie around them. Death is a major theme and is repeated ad nauseam, along with litany, parades, and the like, which should be just a means of film, but unfortunately it's a movie itself. A totally incoherent result that can let you say "huh?" or "oh dear" every two minutes. There is no character development at all, nada, zilch. I usually complain about some films that have two-dimensional characters, but boy, he was able to create one-dimensional characters. This is irritating for us and humiliating for some actors. He even made one of my favorite Greek actors, Giorgos Armenis. And go to the heart of Angelopoulos: No, we're not idiots. We don't want to chew food. Please tell that this symbolism must be gentle. Do you really underestimate your audience so much or are you simply incompetent? Personally, I think he tried to make the Greek "Underground". No matter how he tries, he can't reach Kusturica. Only saving grace: Photos, costumes and music.
