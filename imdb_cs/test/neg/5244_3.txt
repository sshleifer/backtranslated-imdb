Another B-movie for teenagers, based mainly on CGI-effects, an industrial soundtrack and some medieval paintings. It is a pity that the Beowulf legend is used in a way that cannot be done. I'm a fan of Christopher Lambert, but I have to admit he's getting worse as an actor and his films. Rent it out if you're a teenager.
