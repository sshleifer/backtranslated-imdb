It was (stupidly) with some pleasure that I sat down to watch what a friend had promised to be the worst / best movie experience of my life, a mighty "rollerblade 7". 2 years and I'm still in therapy. Oh yes, my dear friends it really is that BAD. Apparently they were given about 40 minutes of shots in the can and then they decided to use these shots forever and repeatedly for a brain-numbing effect. My only fear of the kind of post-apocalyptic world that occurs in this turkey is to somehow survive the press of this abomination. The living would really envy the dead.
