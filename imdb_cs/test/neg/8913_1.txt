I love watching steven sea movies not because of the action of big plot holes, but just because they laugh at me <br /> <br /> oh it makes me laugh so hard this movie absolutely makes no sense and is ridiculous compared to this movie Pearl Harbor Rocks !!! and Ben affleck doesn't need any acting school just to make the impression of how bad it is, first of all with so many wacky and bad games, just getting worse, like when the steven tries to get out of jail the helicopter lands first a safety alert and they led them to the ground when they flew at once when the shot started shooting <br /> <br /> or when you killed that guy in the car that he and they both run away, you can leave. I see no oil on the ground behind him. Note that there is oil without watching us manage to lie down and the car explodes <br /> <br /> and there are a lot of other interventions Steven uses when someone is pointing at him with a gun , grabs him and totally shoots him! like some gangster would let it happen. The acting is also much worse on the battle scene outside the jail, where you can see that the steward is clearly waiting to come back to action, and only a few times back. You will notice bad behavior <br /> <br /> It's just making me laugh, I hope one day comes to the cinema here in Holland Then I'll go there with as many friends as possible to laugh at my own death
