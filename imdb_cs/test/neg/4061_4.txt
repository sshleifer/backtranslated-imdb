As a massive fan of DM, it goes without saying that I have seen this film many times. However, I watch it purely for concert shots ... the rest of the movie is, um, pretty horrible, sad to say. The famous rock music director DA Pennebaker followed Mode around his late 80s Music For The Masses tour, which promoted an excellent album of the same name. The title 101 comes mostly from the fact that the included concert material is from the 101st and final Pasadena Bowl concert tours, but is also a reference to the film, which is a "beginner's course" for the band and how it ticks, ie. Depeche Mode 101. In the midst of a quartet playing live and exploring America, Depeche Mode 101 is the second story about a group of DM fans who have won a contest to meet the band, go on their own bus bus and take part in the final concert. . Now, as I said above, the concert shots are great. The regime is here at the top of their form as a stadium of rock gods, which was somewhat unusual success for the electrorock band back in the late 80s. Although the film captures the band before they recorded their masterpiece "Violator" in 1990, there are still countless great songs, for example, Behind the Wheel, Majestic Never Continue, Everything Counts, Just Can't Get Enough From Vince Clarke's Year, Shake the Disease and many more. <br /> <br /> When Mode is on stage, they're brilliant. When they are not, they are, very, very boring. Nothing happens when it comes to boys looking at the US in the dying days of the Reagan administration. As an example, a likely "highlight" material is a visit to a country music store where you can buy cartridges. It's not so exciting. I know all bands don't have to be wild and reckless idiots, but these guys make the Mormon Tabernacle Choir look like Rammstein. <br /> <br /> The only real excitement comes from various clips focused on the band's lead band Dave Gahane. In 101, Gahan encounters being slightly psychotic, talking about violent power within himself, unable to control, and reminiscent of a bizarre angry attack on a taxi driver and so on. There is one point in the film where prima donna tantrum throws some poor guy behind the scenes - really awkward. The man had problems at that time, which were fortunately resolved. Composer Martin Gore and keyboardist Andy Fletcher are presented as highly articulating, clearly massively talented, but also totally colorless men; while the somewhat mysterious fourth member Alan Wilder is the only one of the quartet who pulls down rock star celebrities with any kind of aplomb. And as for the "fan tour" thread, it's an unknowable slag. Do not be afraid of ourselves. Maybe it's just because everything is * very late * the 80s, but a flock of young devotees does little for me, but it provokes a sense of irritation. They are people, rarely shallow and slim, whose ants are banal when they are not hiding face to face. Let me repeat .... * Nothing happens in shots that are not on stage that is in interest. Nothing. The endless scenes of hair-blowing children argue, change clothes, get lost in cities on their way to concerts, and seek out their partners in bed with another competition winner. in '88 / 89. The love that young people have for the band is something I can certainly relate to, and is occasionally infectious, but if what we see is the most interesting of what was shot, then I'd love to hate seeing outtakes <br /> <br /> But the music is what matters, and the 101 is outstanding. Pasadena's concert, one of their best gigs in history, makes the film a pleasure. A recent DVD release of the movie comes with a bonus disc containing what's left of the unadjusted concert shot (good 80% performance), so the DVD is absolutely essential for fans. The band's audio commentary (minus Wilder, who left Mode in the mid-1990s) on the first disc is also strangely, much more interesting than the film itself. As a Basildon boys documentary during their amphitheater idiom, Depeche Mode 101 is invaluable. But if you're looking for excitement, it's better to get an accompanying double live album (now available in Super Audio CD format).
