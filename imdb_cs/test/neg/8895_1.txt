I was a fan of Buffy and I was hoping it would come to the right end when Angel got one more season. But when the end came, I was leaving to see it. And what did we get? This episode called "NOT FADE AWAY" was the last. This episode made me so disappointed. This is the worst way to this series. Why couldn't he get a happy ending? Why did several major characters die? Why didn't Angel become a man and reunite with Buffy? No. Angel must sign this bloddy paper that will never become human. How stupid. <br /> <br /> And the end is a cliffhanger. <br /> <br /> What could be worse? Buffyshow started as big as Angel, but the Universe hole ended so miserably. Someone should put a spell on the person who wrote the script for this episode, and make sure he is lost in hell. So don't bother watching it, it's so bad it hurts! Total 1 out of 10.
