This movie has more goofs than any other movie I've seen in my life. Special effects are damn horrible. For example, close to the end, when the Concorde falls after the cargo door tears, the thing turns like a toy. Special Airport Effects (1970) are much better than this crap. Also, the opening power of the Concorde at altitude and speed would basically turn the thing in. (That's if it was open at all) But the movie has its good side. Mostly when it ends. It is also ugly. E.g. Thing lands on the shores of snow-packed snow, if he did, he would fall into a million pieces. Total 2 of 10. Instant Flop. Quick laugh.
