Let's start by saying that when a Dutch film is bad, it's really BAD. Rarely something with a bit of quality comes (Lek, Karakter) here in Holland, but not often. Costa! is about 4 girls go to spain to go on vacation, party, get drunk, get laid (u know drill). It's also about the world of Clubbers or Proppers. For who are trying to lure the crowd into their club. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how long it took to write a script, but I think somewhere between 15 minutes and 20 minutes because you're watching a lot of random scenes for 90 minutes. Nothing and I think there's nothing credible in this movie. It's almost too unconscious for what's going on with the story. Suddenly the film turns into a kind of karate action. With one on one fight with 'bad guy in black' and clich√© car chase scene trough watertank-car (it can be more cheesy). Also the words character-development and casting are unknown to the creator. <br /> <br /> After seeing "Traffic" 3 days before this, I fell from sheer brilliance, from a piece of art to it. This is the filmmaking on the saddest. And don't start with a low budget. Because even with a low budget, you can write a better scenario. It almost seems that the filmmakers were too busy partying to make a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Cats in the water made it up a bit, but for the rest, Don't waste your money on such trash.
