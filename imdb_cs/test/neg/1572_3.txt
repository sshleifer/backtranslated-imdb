Such a highly anticipated remake of the esteemed music classics and the bitter pill he had to have. Very, hard to swallow ... everything. Nowhere was an ounce of credibility. And if you don't have Rose, you don't have a show. Bette Midler seemed to be born to play this role. All she could make was a cute, witty, shiny mark Bette Midler ... esteemed by all the well-known Midlerisms. Roz Russell has nothing to fear. He can rest in his grave, knowing that Mama Rose (as well as the movie) is still definitive. one of the greatest musical roles of all time ... like her in "The Rose". But no, she played it safely. She played alone. She made Rose a total dinner-theater cartoon. Even her songs were uninspired. It was crazy to watch when he knew that Midler had the talent to get over her money. She only promised once in this "gypsy" promise, and that was with Rose's Turn. But at that time it was too little, too late. in River City. <br /> <br /> Huge, huge drop.
