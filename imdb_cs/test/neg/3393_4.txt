Here's why this film fell very little out of its potential (I didn't read much, so I don't care what the novel was). 1. I think Brendan Frasier copied his Encina from Lambert's Tarzan. It was tough, and while his call to Tarzan was a bit more realistic, he had no humanity. 2. Screwed with the story. Maybe it's as it is, but as long as I remember, Tarzan's first speeches were "I tarzan, you Jane". Jane is the first human tarzan. I liked the natives a little more than the ragged pigs of the dwarves in Weismuller's version, but the bows and arrows were a little ugly. 3. Tarzan is above all a love story. I'm sorry, but interest in love enters the picture for over an hour. This at best considers it a supporting role. Supporting roles and leadership do not fall on each other, there is not enough time on the screen, sorry. Not only did Andie McDowell commit indifference to the smoothest (probably because her strong southern accent could not be masked), but the scale of chemistry between Tarzan and Jane was incredible. , frankly, stupid. When Tarzan first sees Jane in the jungle, she feels the urge to feel she has never felt before. Jane carries humanity in it and takes the untamed side out of it. His this chemistry, which forces the story of Tarzan. Not that Lord Greystoke's dying wish was to keep the whole country, and that Johnny boy would do it for him. Even a good facial lift couldn't help this film. It needs massive internal reconstruction. Oh, and maybe we could shoot more into the jungle, or at least use camera angles that don't show the soundstage as a site feature. Final judgment, 4 out of 10. Sorry Tin-man, and by the way, if you want to see real acting, release Lambert and check out Leonardo Dicaprio.
