I began to critically look at this adaptation in the first few minutes, but as a devoted fan of Jane Austen, I stayed to the end ... However, this is not a program that I would recommend to someone who is not familiar with her work as I do not think that it does a book of justice, nor does it make TV especially special. There was something about this adaptation that lacked credibility - many costumes and even the actors did not have an authentic look and I found out that it was sometimes poor. There is no doubt that the actors were very good looking, but it did not provide enough varieties to create really diverse, unforgettable characters. It was too static being deployed in the same place and lacking Fanny's return home, which is one of the most interesting parts of the story. The best actor was Blake Ritson, who very well captured the health of Edmund and Crawford were also effectively cast. I like Billie Piper as an actress, but this role did not suit her and was much better played by Frances O'Connor in a 1999 version that gave a much smoother and more convincing performance. Jane Austen's adaptations always provide a love story that lets you feel good, but unfortunately it's one of the worst things I've ever seen.
