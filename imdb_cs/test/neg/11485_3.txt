"The Shining" has the joke, visual atmosphere, and iconic performance of Jack Nicholson. However, 'Ausentes' has none of these things; even if he borrows from his classic ancestor; to wit, a man hacking through the door and a woman running screaming while clutching a huge kitchen knife. Unlike Stanley Kubrick's great psychological horror film, "Ausentes" is a work that resonates with a unique lack of genius. It's amazingly, comically horrible; It makes the Spice Girls movie look like a work of vital art. 'Ausentes' is the story of a family moving to a closed suburb community. Everything should be fine with the world. They will live in peace and quiet; they will quietly discuss their business away from those old streets of the city. But not. Ariadne Gill's character Julia begins to be frightened by the things that insist on hitting empty supermarkets and doors closing at night; and her husband Samuel, who played Jordi Molla, switches from an abandoned family man to wild eyes that are still unshaven, and injects Julia with the drug to keep her under his sudden deposition. Very respected as an actor, Molla is absolutely terrible. Comic, rather than menacing, simply cannot push away the menacing expression. He simply stumbled like a toboggan hall that had too many drinks. So is there anything that can make this movie? No. The script is clumsy, the story does not exist and the cast without merit. "Ausentes" is completely tensionless and full of fear, at the moment, is an exercise to do a psychological thriller. It's ridiculous and exaggerated, but as one of the most unintentionally cheerful movies of recent years, it's worthwhile to watch.
