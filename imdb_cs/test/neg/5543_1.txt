Well, they did a new pumpkin head movie again, the first pumpkin movie was perfect for the time, stupid, bloody and clich√©. as it goes, someone loses his beloved person, goes to the witch in the woods, gets her to pick up the pumpkin head and let her assassinate all responsible. Unfortunately, the filmmakers considered it irrelevant to try to do something other than the fourth trip films, which they consider to be much more appropriate to add some lame romeo and Juliet partial land that includes an idiotic family dispute (via car !!!! ) and surprise the surprise of some bloody pumpkin head slayings, so formulated, but it does not stop there acting talent in this movie is terrible ... oh so poor half of them can not even keep the southern accent without slipping into their native and often nasty accents. Lance henrikssen is so sure he'll bring some gravity to the film choirs ... but no hoax that just breaks on the screen doesn't allow words to fall out of their mouths completely emotionally or seemingly to go and go, honestly I think He just turned to money, then went to his trailer drunk and remember the aliens. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely duck there is no redemption feature than it ends with credits that signal its all over. Despite ph's failures: bf ... if you don't want you to laugh for all the wrong reasons, watch it. <br /> <br /> if you want something with abit to avoid more meat and originality.
