I think it was like Lizzie McGuire, except that it was much worse than the original. The only thing that is different is that she likes animals and science and all those weird things. everything else is the same. she likes a guy who's too nervous to ask him. and later find a guy who likes and has no idea. I think people have to stop doing the same show. And another thing that is the same is that it is always melt friends are two girls and one guy. people don't think that these things are getting old and tired, and these thoughts are still being used again and still using these thoughts. but I know people watching this show and know they like it.
