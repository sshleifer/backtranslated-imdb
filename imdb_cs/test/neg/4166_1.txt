This movie was released in all major cinemas in Australia. I watched the film on the weekend of August 7th, and I thought it was utter nonsense (and I use that word very litly). As it was released into every big movie theater, no idea. The storyline seemed simple enough to divide the world into subclasses and people needed identity cards, and actor Tim Robbins played an investigator who goes to Shanghai to investigate an employee who steals identity cards, proving Samantha Morton. Do you think that this summary would have the rest of the story intertyne, but it doesn't mean that it just confuses the audience even more with another story that doesn't. <br /> <br /> If you're thinking about seeing this movie let me save you from trouble DO NOT WIN THIS FILM.
