An interesting concept that simply does not. I watched the whole movie, but I had to read the IMDb comments to see what code 46 meant. If / when it was explained in the movie, I had to be in a coma or maybe a brain dead. I only saw it for Tim Robbins. The fact that I didn't know any of the other actors should be a tip. We all have to start somewhere, but this movie shouldn't be. As for the "anti-empathy virus virus" -First Utility Belt, Batman! Where were the Joker, Riddler, etc? Why are all women so damn ugly? If I want to see less than bare figures, I'm going down the street. The best part of the movie was a car accident. It was absolutely believable and not over-top-like most movie crashes.
