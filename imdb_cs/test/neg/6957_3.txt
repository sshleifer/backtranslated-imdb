First, this movie will leave you in a limbo wise mood. You don't know what you feel. So much that you don't feel bad for the character of Caines when his son is murdered (which was mainly due to bad editing). The script was too bland. None of these situations matter how you watch them. Soundtrack or lack (if not good enough to remember) will not help him. The only good surprise of this movie was the performance of Andy Serkis. It was on par, if not better than Caine. Apparently the story would be better if Serkis killed him. Because frankly, you do not feel any kind of redemption in the climax. Just a feeling of lack of feeling when you feel me. Basically, this film lacks a draw. He left the audience stolen.
