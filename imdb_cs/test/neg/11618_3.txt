Uh, oh! I just said that this "classic" movie has a storyline that STINKS! Well, it's true ... so over it! This film was a futile project for Joseph P. Kennedy, in which his mistress played and money flowed to become an even bigger star. Today there is only a partial copy - the one that was a few years back. However, even if the film was in perfect condition, it should be stunk for many reasons. And without further ado, there are some of my reasons: <br /> <br /> First, Gloria Swanson, at the age of 31, plays a girl in a monastic school - maybe at the age of 16 or 18! Come on - she looks old enough to be the mother of many children. Second, the film is based on the stupid concept of "love at first sight". While some people believe it, it is ridiculous to believe that a prince would throw everything away on a woman he didn't even know! What is a lot of hooey! Third, the film is historic and the plot is nuts! After leaving school, Kelly goes to East Africa and then becomes a "hole queen" - and later, after the evil queen in Europe dies (it is comfortable), the prince is able to get out of prison, actually finds Kelly and takes get her and she will then become the queen of true earth sincere for good! Give me a break - it's RIDIKULOUS, even in the days of silent film, this conspiracy was the creator! So, in summary, this is a bad movie with big production values ​​(mistresses have to look good), which is like a classic! There's so much BETTER quiet movies out there - look first and avoid this audacity.
