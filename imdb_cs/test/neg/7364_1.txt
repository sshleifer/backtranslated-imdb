The actors were not believable, the story was really weak, total sap, and completely predictable. Really disappointed in Depardieu. It was a pity that they did not focus more on the struggle for Canadian independence. We've seen this love story many times before, with better actors! The last 15 minutes we had to wait for a little sense of drama! The soundtrack was utterly disturbing. The underscore hit you with sentiment over your head. But really over the top. The only thing we found out was that they let the Indians speak their language. And we found Indian village cinema quite realistically.
