I saw it at the Madison Horror Film Festival and was disappointed. A few shocking, witty moments (hollow Carly fisting, Dreamland pissing) and two interesting interesting spaces (like New Nightmare with a belief that brought a mythical character to life and also Lost Highway with a man living in his but had long stretches without the movement and incoherent development of the conspiracy Just because you use a dream framework or a fugue mental state, it's not Lynchian You need convincing visual effects and a horrible performance. Positive things: Dr. Maitland had a real comic timing and all the girls were very cute, and Carla's father, Chalmers and Ingrid Pitt looked as if they were having fun, and at least Tom Savini looked like he had memorized lines, and we couldn't see if he was reading the cue cards. <br /> <br / > I got Hammer references, but the director seems to have realized that the script was a snoozer and just added some shocks to try and get t any laughter from any record they could put together, but they don't work because they are too little and far and create an inconsistent tone. Bring it to 30 minutes out of all the fun parts, and you could have a surrealistic short, but skip in length. It's not "so bad it's good" it's just "so bad it's boring".
