This movie is fine, quite stupid and has to be taken lightly. But what I can't stand is the numerous heroes, and the boy is an ILLEGALY SENTIMENTAL comment that is coming to an end: "Look, everyone looks the same". Is it far from good taste standards? I thought it was ugly, just like the heroic, selfless actions of some people in this movie. I am not saying that this will not happen, but getting closer to all the bravery that does it causes me to stomach.
