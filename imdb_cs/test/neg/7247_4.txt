Director Lesley Selander, a thoroughly routine outdoor yarn "The Yellow Tomahawk" (1954), sets Cheyenne against the US cavalry with Rory Calhoun's hard-skinned hard as a seasoned scout boy who must survive to safety. This united artists western was lent in color, but the TV press that Turner's classic films aired was inexplicably in black and white. The action will open with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of "Black Spurs") to escape several Indians and ride to taste with his old friend and Cheyenne boss, Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef of "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly ", who is thinking of his death. The Fire Knight warns Adam that his Cheyenne Braves are ready to wipe out a nearby fort under construction because he violates the treaty that the Indians made with the government. On the way to inform the commander of the camp, Major Ives (Warner Anderson of "Objective, Burma!"), About the impending Indian attack, Adam discovers a beautiful wooden nymph seductively treading water into the lake. Katherine 'Kate' Bolden (Peggy Castle "I, Jury") is another of those stupid women in westerns who bathe nude in the middle of an Indian country without care in the world. The castle seems to be really naked in its bathing scenes, too, perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable West. Major Ives naturally rejects Adam's warning from Fire Knife until the commander realizes that someone has invaded the munitions warehouse far beyond the fort. This is one of the many questions that Richard Alan Simmons' script has not answered in this report, the 82-minute oat. Why would the cavalry bury its ammunition in a secret place in the desert instead of keeping it in the fortress? Before they appeared before the Indians attacked, they left the hero and left him alone to survive. A few white prospectors go to the fortress before this attack. Sawyer (Peter Graves of "Stalag 17") brings his partner with an arrow to his chest. While Adam receives hot water to help remove the arrow, the greedy Sawyer crushes the shaft deeper and kills his helpless partner. Later we learned that Sawyer and his partner had hit gold. The question of distraction of gold is also unanswered after our heroes survive the suffering. Adam and Fire Knife have one final pow-wow and Fire Knife requires Adam to hand over Major Ives or all die. Naturally, Adam refuses and the Indians begin to choose white. James Best in the support role of the rider gets an arrow in his back for his efforts. Noah Beery, Jr., plays a targeted Mexican scout watched by a sexy Indian girl suitably named Honey Bear (Oscar actress Rita Moreno from "West Side Story") and Robert Bray of "Lassie" fame is handy shortly ill. -the officer of the cavalry, who Kate was planning to marry. The biggest surprise in this remarkable Western shot at Utah, Canada is that the criminal officer Ives, who killed Indian men, women, and children on the infamous Sand Creek massacre, is also a Native American! Ironically, the tense bow that Fire Knife makes from friendship with Adam at the beginning of hostility is what our heroic scout uses to kill a devoted Cheyenne warrior after he has run out of balls. "Yellow Tomahawk" ends on an ambiguous note. The survivors will reach another base, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives report to the Army General on this matter, but we will never know the outcome of this meeting. It is an artistic ambiguity or yet another unanswered question. Producer Howard W. Koch is no relation to "Casablanca" screenwriter Howard Koch. Eventually, "Yellow Tomahawk" is one of many pro-Indian westerns, which appeared in the aftermath of "Broken Arrow" (1950) where Native American is seen as noble savage unfairly treated by some but not all white. Selander, who has made dozens of westerns during the 1950s and 1960s, makes this smaller Western tolerable through its thin characters and familiar situation. Calhoun stands out from the above-average cast, as always a capable man, and a good-looking castle is worth watching its female spell. Peter Graves plays the skunk as usual in most of his early roles. Actually, Lesley Selander made a more satisfactory dramatic version of this film a year before called "The Color War" (1953) with Robert Stack. By the way, Noah Beery Jr. and Rita Moreno both went on to become regular on "The Rockford Files".
