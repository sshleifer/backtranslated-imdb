I saw that "The Stranger" was included in the "Bottom 100" list on IMDb, so I wasn't expecting much when I tuned him to the US channel a week later, but I had hopes. "Belly Of The Beast" (which aired a month ago) was a mess, but it had great scenery and photography and a few nice moments scattered around the world, so I thought this movie might have the same thing. Unfortunately, this film does not meet the standards of basic tracking in almost every direction. The screenplay is based on the bastard descendant of John LeCarre's novel and Richard Ludlum's film, but it is made by people who have none of the writer's talents for plotting and characterizing. Instead of what we got, there is a nest of annoying, mildly temperamental, nihilistic, mysterious mudled motifs, entangled alliances, and missiles. And shooting on the chest. And bombing. And gutting. It translates into a directorial style that relies on hackneyed 'grainy shot / slow motion' shots every 10 seconds, along with wire and hyperactive jumps. These movie devices, which were obsolete ten years ago when MTV's directors used them for Whitesnake videos, and the director works as a punch press, hoping to put some weird art-thriller techno thriller into control. Segal himself is terrible about it. The whole film speaks in a hoarse, cruel half-whisper, alternating between two expressions: it seems to suck on a lemon while someone under the nose covers a small lawn or looks like a constipation. And it's so robust (and vain about it) that it never really takes a duster on the camera. I understand it's hard to keep the circuit under control as a male actor at age (though Denzel Washington and Paul Newman never seemed to have this problem). But you deal with it by being honest with it and by growing as an actor, not by hiding it with carefully selected camera angles and floor-length robes. So I can't really say what's going on, and the film doesn't give me reason to worry about what's going on, and the protagonist is completely one-dimensional and visually unimpressive. It's not a recipe for a good movie experience. Strangely enough, most of the scenography and scenery are atmospheric and striking; in fact, if you were to freeze the film on almost any scene that was not the detail of Seagal, you would be affected by the care and professionalism of lighting, colors and composition, and how beautiful the Eastern Europe is. But dressing a rotten egg like Fabergy's eggs can't make it edible. And driving is collapsed in the heart. There are 'cool' movies (like "Versus"), and there are visually striking but emotionally cool movies (like "Underworld") and there are paranoia plot thrillers (like "The Bourne Identity") and his remake with Matt Damon). And then there's the thing that can't figure out what it wants to be, pretends to be all these things, and fails because it has no guts or souls. <br /> <br /> This is a movie made by professionals with a real budget, so you can't place it in the same class as "Manos", "Killer Shrews" or "Hobgoblins". But I'd rather watch all three of those movies several times than to see "The Foreigner" again.
