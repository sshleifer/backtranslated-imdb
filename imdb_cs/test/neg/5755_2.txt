Returning to Frogtown was a hard movie to track down. I fulfilled this mission and sat on a shelf. I wish it was so! First, Sam Hell isn't Roddy Piper, of course. He is replaced by a dude with a big face, less charisma, and this poor actor is very soft-spoken for that part! Sam Hell is supposed to be rebellious and amazing. Here it is captured three times! What kind of hero is that ?! The mushroom is also replaced by another actress. Why didn't we get different characters here? That was stupid! Lou Ferrigno plays in this movie and he's not even a hero. Common sense says Lou must be a movie hero! Bad effects, bad behavior and just a forgotten movie. Funny how to shoot Ninja Turtles 2 with the whole concert scene in this movie. At least the Ninja Turtles 2 was funny and not a bad movie! I really wanted to go back to Frogtown, but I just crouched when the battle scenes started. This movie makes the Turtles 3 look like gold! Avoid it, or you'll be singing "a more significant, greener, talking turtle TV dinner!"
