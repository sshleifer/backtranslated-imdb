At what point is the film so bad that it's good? Impressive in its horror, Darkhunters stands out as a brilliant cinematic example of c ** p and therefore deserves a price. The plot revolves around the old battle of heaven and hell for the recently spared junk souls. In the case of Darkhunters, the representatives of good and evil manifest themselves differently as a cat herd, a hooded Grim Reaper character with a flickering flame similar to an electric hearth on coal, Philip Marlowe-a-like serious bad manicure, and a psychologist who seems to be in daily relaxation from Kwik-Save. The protagonists compete for the soul of a newly dead teacher who spends most of the film around the foggy field. and bizarre, boarding stations in an effort to avoid pursuers. The storyline is thinner than a dieter sandwich that has no character, nor is it trying to build tension. Acting is ridiculous, comparable to school play - though it would be an insult to many educational establishments. And dialogue .......... oh my hips hurt! With the unconscious souls of the dead, who were described by the fire demon as "unwanted cucumbers," you wonder if hell is really McDonalds. However, bizarrely convincing, you will find yourself watching just how bad it can get - for more than 80 minutes, it's worth the time spent on unintentional giggling.
