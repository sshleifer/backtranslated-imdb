Yes, it was a horrible movie, but I think at the beginning of the movie there was a song called "I have Woody" or something like that. I'd like to find a soundtrack if available. I saw this song on MST 3K, and it was as terrible as it was that it was a moment, and that song was one of them. <br /> <br /> If you like bikini in bikini, it's a movie for you, but if not, it doesn't matter. It was a great material for MST 3K, I have to admit. I really want to know where to get a copy of the soundtrack. Not only the song, but a few others were really funny and, as far as I am concerned, they are classics.
