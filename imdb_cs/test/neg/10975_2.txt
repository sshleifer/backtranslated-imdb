I bought this video on a sliding table in a video store where I expected a good cast of what was being offered as the award winning Brit Sex comedy. I think I should have read the finer print. I rarely write a panning review, but here it goes. These gay roles really play games with their memories of many much more valuable movies. This comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of actors, theater public, and all the nice movies that contributed to their reputation. I repeat: it is a joke about how the actors get rid of. Another highly reputable personality on the screen with this shamefully gaudy movie? Can a reference to the Austrian classics "Pride and Prejudice" and "Meaning and Sensitivity" be something else? How much of that political statement was that it created these melodrama with these stars? We simply want to take it as a humble mistake that all actors are homosexuals, so letting their games on the screen affect our lifestyle is also receiving their private homosexual acts on our faces? I'm sorry, but I don't think so. I call it NO.
