Terrible movie B at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive. I appeal to anyone who is "Aliens (James Cameron 1986)" Movie fan to count how many times either the line or almost the entire sequence has been ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of waste. The cast of members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with talent and the lead of "Jack Scalia" was truly terrible. I think they threw him for his massive cleft chin. I was also angry with the stereotype of a single black man on stage John Toles-Bey, who has to look at this movie and just wonder. Look at him sometimes when he did a lot of interesting movies. But on this movie: The screenplay, as I said before, was a torn Aliens that was upgraded and turned into a submarine "thriller". It included such lines as "I Got a Bad Feeling About It" and "Kill Me" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly begins to make "foreign hop" just before it jumps out of his stomach. There is also a rip-off classic "get some!" over Bill Paxton. We also have a lot of navy grunts running through the cave with creepy reptiles popping out of the walls. Even the explosions of mutated creatures are very similar to the extraterrestrial popping that charges marines in the movie "Aliens". And the kicker is that some mutants spit acid (unlike acid on blood). There are many other important examples. So if you want to see this script did well follow the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver). You will have a more pleasant time. The storyline could have been interesting and better, if not for confusing sequences at the beginning of the movie and generally bad edits. Camera shots were quite boring and, frankly, it wasn't too hard to stop watching and going around the room so you could have a snack or check your email. Many of the interactions between the characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more than no. The entire command structure between the crew and the captain was poorly executed. I'm not even sure if there are captains in the army who have full control over nuclear submarines. In general, it only shows that little research has been done on background information to make the film a little decent and there are many other similar examples (such as dive depth, etc.). <br /> <br /> as horrible movies or are a big fan of aliens and aliens and want something to just laugh and shake their heads, then this movie can be for you. As for me, he returns to the shelf ... permanently.
