WOW, I wouldn't like to say, but anyone who has rated this movie a bit higher than me must have I.Q. it will reach unimaginably low depths that will go beyond time and space and connect to the planet "Hopper-is-a-retard-for-making-this-movie". WOW THIS Movie STANK. Fred Ward's Look SSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPIIIDDD! Actually, I was thinking of sending Fred Ward some money to compensate for this unfortunate hairstyle he had in this horrible movie. Of course, Jodie Foster didn't have much to do, but she still handles terrible performance. Joe Pesci, oh my ... Joe Pesci (who is not mysteriously cast) plays ULTIMATE stereotypical movie character Joe Pesci, complete with the murder of the crowd and the constant use of the word F. You won't believe your eyes. Dean Stockwell, when I watched him in this mess, I felt bad for him because I thought he was either drunk or temporarily retarded during the movie. Jon Turturro himself had to be drunk when he agreed to be in this, along with Vincent Price, Bob Dylan and Charlie Sheen. I know what you think, GREAT CAST! I know, and it was WORST a great cast movie I've ever seen. Dennis Hopper points and stars, and does just as badly in both areas. How the man could direct EASY RIDER and then it's FAR out of my excellent imagination. His auspicious accent of a bad hit-man is beyond the spooky and just a merrily bad end. They (Hopper and Foster) are the most interesting pair I believe I've ever met with my exposure to the world of cinematography, and you'll be cheering for them to lose and then be grandly crazy about the end. What exactly are the two who are fulfilling this action? I don't know, but I know that if I ever meet Dennis Hopper, I'm going to make him extremely funny for being responsible for this celluloid waste. Join me! IAN
