The necessary roughness (1991) was a bad comedy / drama that tried hard at every level to be a serious film about college football. Nowadays, many contemporary and former superstar athletes have appeared in this production. Other than that is a very average movie. They should just stick to make a straight comedy without realism. Instead, filmmakers try to play both fields and end up on the short end of the hole. When will someone make a decent movie about college football that is fun and realistic? <br /> <br /> Not recommended unless it's free at t.v.
