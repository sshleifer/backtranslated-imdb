This 22 minute short, short predecessor of the later much better "Rock and Rule" contains two folk singers who go nowhere. The female mouse, John, signs a deal with the devil to become a hit rock star. It's up to Daniel Mouse to save her soul. Made in the late 70s it has all the trappings of this decade (crap music, crap clothes and hairstyle, horrible folk melodies) This cartoon is featured on the second disc 2-Disk Collector's Edition "Rock and Rule", it also comes with doing that runs almost as long as the show itself. <br /> <br /> My class: D +
