Nothing about this film is great or terrible. Finally it kills. Moderation is not just good. I can't say I expected better from Will Smith, but I definitely did it from Kevin James of "The King of Queens" - but hey, I'm used to saying it says a lot lately. This film attempts to make his brand a humorous romantic comedy, but never encounters a bull's eye. In fact, it never encounters * anywhere within the goal. The allergy scene is worrying; The fact that Kevin James can't dance is something that wouldn't catch anyone, so (in a movie like this) he's not funny. This movie is constantly trying to get your heart, but always with a bad trick at the wrong time. Some parts are fine (but I am searching in the brain for examples), but I think this movie should be avoided.
