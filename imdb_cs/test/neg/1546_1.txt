I've already commented on this film (under TheLegendaryWD). But I see there are others who commented. All I can say is: WHAT IS F ** K!? "I can't believe that 16 people have commented on this movie or even seen it. Add to the fact that the couple gives him great reviews (probably filmmakers who went to one of those places in the Mall that provide internet services and wrote a good review - see how there is no way they could or would pay for their own internet provider ... just look at their movie Although i still admit i have some soft place for this movie, i thought that some of the other people who wrote about it could confuse him with another ... until I read reviews ... especially the person who identified the tag line on the front of the box: "The Ultimate in Frontal Lobotomy" ** is it supposed to mean the same? "frontal" lobotomy? "... I totally forgot it until I read it in People, we are just a few ... I say we meet once a year to get if you see this movie ... wait, has anyone else got it? please contact me ... I'm dyin 'to get drunk.
