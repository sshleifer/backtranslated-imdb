I found it to be an extremely unsatisfactory version of a charming story. I thought acting was pretty good. Reginald Owen chewed on the scenery, as others have mentioned, but in his short scenes I thought he was a little fun. TCM fan Ann Harding made me and I thought she was here as usual. Jessie Ralph had a day out in the field like an old battleax, held all around, and Frank Morgan always played Frank Morgan with a spark. - The transitions were unpleasant, the motivations were dark. The film was too damn short to tell the story! I felt completely let go, especially since I had such memories of a later version.
