This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life. If you're not in masochism, you never see it. It was an unbearably long, nonsensical, hurtful, depressing film and will forever be my list of bad movies. The one who wrote this film is a sadist. I almost cried at the end, it was so bad. I'd like to give her a zero star, but since it's not an option, I'll give it one.
