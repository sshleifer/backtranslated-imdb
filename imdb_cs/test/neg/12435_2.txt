I've never been a big Larry Clark fan, but somehow I dragged him into almost every movie. I like independent films and I grew into punk rock and I would like to say that this film is disappointing for both viewers. Not every punk song contains "Oi!" into his churches as they do in this particular movie. But the real problem with this film is that it switches moods every 15 minutes and lacks any kind of coherence. Clark made his living pretend that his fictional stories are "how children are really," and as such, you allow him ten minutes of silly dialogue scenes that goes nowhere because it is a cinema you believe feels going for. But when he shoots a ridiculous scene of death (choose one of them, except for the introductory ride), excessively stylized attempts at what I suppose to be black humor are completely out of context, ridiculously shot (mostly cases, much worse than student film) and absolutely absurd when it comes to the story. John Cassavettes and "Date Movie" make poor bedfellows as invasions into the second style put you out of any kind of reality to remind you that you're watching a movie - really, really bad at it.
