I wouldn't give this movie such a low rating (2) if its average wasn't ridiculously high, but someone had to bring it to something more reasonable. I sat in most of this movie and watched the scene after the tagging and theft scene. No dialogue, just labeling and theft. Finally, the two labels kissed. Something happened. But then back to tagging and stealing. I left the screening. I recommend this film only to those who are impressed with filmmaking. I hated the directors the previous movie (self-righteous defense of man-boy of love), but at least the movie had a story, interesting characters, dialogue. Graffiti Artist only had a scene after the tagging and theft scene. I want more from the movie than this.
