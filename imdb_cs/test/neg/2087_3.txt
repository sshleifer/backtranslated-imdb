I have to say that Desserts are one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Acting was terrible and even the storyline was ridiculous. I put it 3 out of 10 instead of 1 because I like the laughter at the excruciating corny movies. My expectations were not too high for the start, but it turned out to be a cornier than I expected. I thought it might not be so bad when it started, but as soon as the name of the contest - the Golden Whisker - came, I started changing my mind. From there it all went down. The only thing I did on this film was different from whispering at his absurd plot and dialogue. However, being a film about cooks' pastries, there were minimal scenes in which they actually baked something. I would recommend watching this channel instead of this movie. You will see that more food is being prepared and you avoid pathetic one-sided ships. However, if you like love stories, which is sometimes fun, go ahead and watch.
