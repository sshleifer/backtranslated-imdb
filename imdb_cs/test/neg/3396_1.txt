This is my opinion on this film, expressed in its dialogues. <br /> <br /> To be more serious, I can't say that this movie is a bad moment, but I didn't even lie to it. At first I was just indifferent and couldn't get into the world of monkeys. Even though makeup is very realistic, the constant screaming was irritating. May the film change the apes for cats and it is a cult film for me in relation to my hobby. The second part is more interesting, with talent and fresh offspring (Macdowell & Lambert), but I felt alienated: the whole story is in a big British mansion: no matter how luxurious it was for me as a prison. Finally, could it be a good adaptation of Burroughs' story of Tarzan? I don't know when I never read a book (or saw Disney) :. Finally, I don't have any good moments to remember, so I just need one watch. I should have guessed my boredom after an endless freeze that was called "prelude" at the beginning ... What does that mean? Only the director knows that.
