The film adaptation of Heart of Darkness is disappointing, both in film and in the representation of the classic story of Joseph Conrad. There are some minor differences between the book and the movie, but every book is expected to change. Kurtz dies elsewhere; Marlow's manager accompanies him on his way; Kurtz's mistress spends much more time with him than in the story. The real problem is the amount of shots that are embedded in the movie, but it has no basis in the real story. For some reason, the director will find it necessary to "taste" several scenes, add drama or actions that rarely make sense and are always unimportant to the story. Some examples that come to mind are Kurtz's "mistress" who beats Marlow over his head and sets him out. Nothing happens when he is unconscious and Marlow has not even provoked the attack. He walks for a few hours and he wakes up: a total waste of time. Kurtz has a monkey who kills on a whim for some reason. Also, when Marlow leaves Kurtz's station, he makes a "noble" decision to leave all the valuable ivory he has acquired without any real reason. Another mistake is Kurtz's character. John Malkovich is a horrible choice to play a man who is described as tall and inspirational: a man with a commanding presence. He practically whispers all his lines that could be very provocative in the hands of a more capable actor. I can't remove John Malkovich's picture of a mentally handicapped farm in Mice and Men watching as he manages to win Kurtz. Overall, I rated the film for 3 out of 10 stars. It's a good movie if you read the book and want to see it in film, perhaps to help you with visual scenes, but I would never recommend it as a source of fun.
