I really wish I read everyone's reviews before I see the movie ... it was one of the most unbearable movies I've ever seen. I was ready to leave the movie for 5 minutes; I should have followed my instinct. The film offered nothing new or clever, it was boring and very clich√©. I was surprised to find out that it was driven by a woman! The characters were no women I knew were boring, bitter and melodramatic. The film was unrealistic and depressing, losing time and money. And the actors looked tired, bad makeup and hairstyle. He has recently been compared with the film Sex and the City; it wasn't half that good. My suggestion, you don't see this movie!
