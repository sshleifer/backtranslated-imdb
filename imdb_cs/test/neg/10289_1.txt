This is a snuff film. I'm shocked to be even considered an IMDb library. And Bill, Julia and all the other "professional" actors should be ashamed of being part of this sick film. I thought I'd be looking at a somewhat classic horror movie with a creative ending that the writers like to think ... it usually doesn't make sense when writing horror movies, but as a viewer we try to rationalize and understand. This end wasn't creative. It was sick and had all the marks of a snuff film. I am shocked that it has been modified to this end, and more shocked that it will be on distribution by the end of June 2009. This should not be shown in the theater. This is harmful to innocent minds on many levels .... watch movie, end, and you will understand this statement. Plus, part of the land is a sweet little girl "still 9" her character says. She's not in the snuff, but she's an integral part of the movie. Why do directors feel they need to shock with a sick swing to gain recognition? The director is in the wrong field if he thinks he is an artistic film.
