When I first heard that there wouldn't be enough video game for Nintendo 64 in the world, I was so excited. When it finally came out, I was one of the first to rent it. I rented it for 7 days and I went through the whole game !!! The game was easy and made too many hints. Magnificent sequel to GoldenEye. Take my advice and DO NOT SPEAK THIS GAME. Of course, weapons and aids are fine, but a man is tired of a watch that looks like it was taken directly from GoldenEye except for the red one. color instead of blue color, bad excuse for dart gun, terrible stunning and stupid hook that can only connect to things that are yellow and black. <br /> <br /> I think RARE should be this game instead of EA, which should keep the games there good for making as well as sports games and should pull down the first person shooters and let the masters do the job.
