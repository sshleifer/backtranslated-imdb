Fortunately, a brief secret about a telephone operator who is discovered as a kidnapped daughter railroad tycoon. The discovery brings an attempt at her life, which Charlie Ruggles thwarted as a "deflector of crimes". Things change with danger when everyone ends up in the title placement and another attempt is made on girls' lives. Your enjoyment of this film will depend on your tolerance for Rugggles and its nonsense. Normally I like Ruggles, but there was something about this role that was rubbing me in the wrong way. Actually, I don't think it helped that mystery wasn't very good, so there was nothing more than characters to follow you. Yes, the final on the train was exciting, but it did not avoid everything that went before. It's not worth looking for, but if you run into it, try it.
