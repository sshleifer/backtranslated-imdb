This document was boring and quite stupid. I mean ... of course, the documentarist doesn't even know how Darwin's evolution works? It's a theory, and the name is just stupid. Reading a biology textbook at college could tell a documentary maker what Darwinism really is. Darwinism is a good theory, but evil if it happens as politics. Also in this document there was no real evidence in conversation with some people ... no expert testimony and shady management ... The documentary was also boring. I think it could have been adjusted to 35 minutes, and then it would have been much better. <br /> <br /> There are much better documentaries than this ... it's not worth it ... Get better information from Wikipedia = D DO NOT USE YOUR MONEY AND TIME!
