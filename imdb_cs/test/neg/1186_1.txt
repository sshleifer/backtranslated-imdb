very unsatisfactory and incoherent - the germ of an idea that will be knocked out in the next line - every moment that the movie was cut out and re-created to make it work - I was bored and distracted all the way, and I speak like a huge fan series. Many of the jokes were unoriginal and tired, the medieval section went on too long and the quality of the games was very bad - some in small guest venues such as Simon Peg and Liam Cunningham did more in their 30 seconds than the main cast. it was in 90 minutes. It's a shame, really. The only really interesting thing was to get inside a small shed in Soho Square - something that everyone in London is wondering about.
