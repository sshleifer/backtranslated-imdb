I was just watching the movie and I was pretty disappointed. I didn't expect a lot to start because the assumption of the film does not suggest such a size. Sadly, she can't even deliver the same stupid fun. The main problem is probably acting. Although I have seen much worse actors in much worse movies, the story would require some people to act as violent maniacs, some others as people who find themselves in a very stressful situation, and cannot achieve it. While watching the German edition, I watched with the original sound, so it's definitely not just a bad voice or something like that. Added to the fact that the German DVD release seems to be cut, killing is largely omitted, which means that, with the exception of a few semi-gory scenes closer to the end, the German edition does not give as a film for "gore". The story has foolish moments, and the beginning is just hilarious (sometimes heard about a demon visiting a psychiatrist?) Too bad that the film is taken too seriously if filmed as a horror comedy and changed a bit it might work better, the end is just a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> If you really have nothing better to do and you just can't bear the boredom you can (and it's really weak "maybe") consider this movie. available something else than to watch or do: Choose this alternative.
