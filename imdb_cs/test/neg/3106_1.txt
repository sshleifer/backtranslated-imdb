Yeah, that's right. If I asked my friends, "What's the worst movie you've ever seen?" They can answer something like "Armageddon" (can you drill a hole?!?), "Shriek", "Plan Nine From Space", "Medallion", "Scooby Doo" etc. offended by thinking you saw something what could be in the same department of naturally produced human fertilizer in which this film is. If the worst movie you can remember is, say so badly, it really sucks you; then you know nothing about my friend. Mad Six ...

This was undoubtedly the worst movie mistake in my movie that loved life. It was also the worst mistake for everyone else: film lover or not. Watching this movie is as fun as watching a glass of ice water (or iced teaâ€¦) until it reaches room temperature. Watching this movie will allow you to dream of an eternal dream of death if death is just a loss of light and nothing, and then you realize that you are watching the TV. I don't see. In fact, you pay as much attention as humanly possible. It's not a joke. This film is the perfection of making a bad movie. It's not the kind of bad thing you can watch, point out and laugh at, its kind of film that's so bad that you actually have no chance of ever getting out of memory. If you are not using electric shock therapy to remove the brain. ... ... (Hey! That could be something like I remember me and my friend who felt after watching it.) <br /> <br /> Sincerely from me to you Albert Pyun. br /> <br /> -Joergen
