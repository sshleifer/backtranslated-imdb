I love movies ... and I rarely see a movie I hate ... but this was the worst movie I've ever seen, or at least near it. Any movie that ends up with rape scene is terrible. Hands down ... I can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie. I'm really upset, I want my money back and time back. GOOD! Don't go see it, cinematography is terrible, the plot is terrible, the end is terrible. I didn't know what was happening during the middle of the movie because I didn't see it (and I was watching a very nice and big TV) Rent saw, the hills have eyes, or the house of wax ... none of them are better when you want something scary.
