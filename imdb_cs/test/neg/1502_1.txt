IN ANY CASE ! I hated grandma. First of all, he's too high - of course it's, he's Tom, who's the brother who plays her - and I hate the thing he does when he brushes his fake silver hair back, but: in this movie there are funny parts. For example, the fact that each individual actor looks like V.G. (very German), and also that they think that even if they stay alone they should pretend that the guy (Tom) is their real "grandmother" or something. I really liked - not the moment Charlotte leaves and starts to go to the nearest gas station to ask for help. Suddenly he finds himself in the middle of the woods (where before? No one dares to explain) and turns, turns, turns ar-oun-d as a ballerina, looks at the stars ... and ... ignores the fact that GRANNY IS ONE, READY !!! But anyway, the music wasn't so bad, the hairstyles were fine and the end was terribly provocative ... Mmmmm ... I wish I had the German version.
