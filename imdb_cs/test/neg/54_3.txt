1983's "Frightmare" is a weird little movie. It seems that the director is trying to combine the atmosphere of classic 1930s and 40s horror movies with the shock factor of the then exploding genre of the 1980s. It's not entirely successful (mostly due to very obvious budget constraints and less than the professional caliber of his young actors), but still has its moments, mainly due to the first-class performance (more classic than the film deserves) of late German actor Ferdinand Mayne, who plays an aging ancient horror star (ala Vincent Price) called "Conrad Ratzoff". At the beginning of the film, we encounter a star horror star as he shoots a dental advertisement and quickly learns that Conrad is a little dirty thing, prima donna jerk-off. Just when you think he can no longer be more than sympathetic, the commercial director gives Conrad a few blows, and the old goat pushed him out of the balcony to his death. Well, what? Conrad then visits some fans on the film club's horror campus campus, unfortunately, suffers from a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up at his estate waiting to die. While still alive in Death's door, he can get rid of a despised business partner by choking him with a pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself. Conrad is then laid to rest in a true Hollywood style in a high-tech neon tomb with video screens above the coffin that will play personal video messages from Conrad for visitors who enter to pay their respect. It is at this point that high school horror movie companies choose to pay Conrad's grave after an hour's visit, enter the tomb and take his body back home with them all night. (Not exactly my idea of ​​fun, but hey, these are the characters in the 80's horror movie. Logic doesn't have a place here.) College kids spend the evening having dinner with Conrad's body sitting in a place of honor, even dancing with him in the room before they parked Conrad and his coffin in the attic and were about to return to the crypt in the morning. Meanwhile, Mrs. Ratzoff, disturbed by the theft of her husband's body, urged a psychic friend to try to "reach" Conrad's session. From here you can find the rest. Since Conrad wasn't a very nice person in his life, it's not too hard to believe he won't be more mortal. The Mistress makes contact with Conrad and he wakes up again in a predictably unchained fashion, then spends the rest of the film strolling through the corridors of the students of a ridiculously huge house and gradually picking up young thieves. This is where the film breaks up. Endless scenes of adolescents wander the empty corridors and say, "Hi? Is anyone there?" they are occasional with occasional outbursts of violence (we get a pretty rough decapitation scene that is the pinnacle of the film) before the last two survivors finally find out (WAY Later than any semi-intelligent people would find the same. .. but again, we're in a horror movie) the only way to stop chaos is to get Conrad's body back to the crypt where it belongs. Slow stimulation is stuffed with a lot of weird light effects and dry ice fog effects, which are supported by the soundtrack, which consists of sound effects rather than music (thunder, moaning, howling, etc.), which are seriously annoying after a while. I can't really recommend "Frightmare" to anyone who hasn't grown up and watched cheap movies like this in the late night cable in the 1980s. "Modern Horror" fans will no doubt find "Frightmare" incredibly slow motion and goofy. If you have come to age in this magic decade, you can get "narcotic" from "Frightmare". Jeffrey Fans ("Re-Animator") Combs may also want to check it because the future of Dr. West appears in an early role as one of the unfortunate film students. I will advise the reader to avoid the EastWestDVD version of this movie (paired with Roy Ward's "Vault of Horror" and sold in dollar stores) because print quality is terrible. I said the movie got a deluxe version over fine people in Troma, which seems appropriate. If you are a three person type, then "Frightmare" will be up to your aisle.
