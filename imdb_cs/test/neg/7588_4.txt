It's that IVAN TERRIBLE, PARTS I and II both had entries in the 50 Worst Worst Worst Films. I believe that declaring to be among the worst movies ever is exaggerated, though they are still both pretty poor movies - especially the first, because it was more charming and glamorous eyes than I ever saw before !! Director Eisenstein and a lot of other people thought it made the film "artsy and profound" - and because I am legally sensible, I have to say that I hated this first movie !! The second, though still very uncomplicated view, is a tremendous improvement, as the movement of the eyes is minimal, although too long and boring scenes are present in this film as in Part 1! While Part 2 looks quite incomplete and needs at least another hour (especially because it never gets into Ivan's crazy behavior in later life - like killing his son and heir in a bout of anger). Since both Parts 1 and 2 have been entrusted to Stalin to excuse his own murderous government and celebrate it, it is no wonder that Ivan's life story is left very incomplete. Even without all the terrible behavior of Ivan, apparently the worst of Stall STILL, the film did not like to be released during his life. Maybe he didn't allow it because he was more worried people would see what a huge waste of money and means the film was instead of seeing Stalin as a crazy guy just like Ivan! By the way, there was one segment of this boring movie that was so cool that the movie deserves 4 (without it, 2) - and that's the scene with Prince Vladimir at the banquet! This is well-done and quite funny in a dark way. And the scene was made in the Russian version of the two-color Technicolor. Incidentally, this is very strange, because in the mid-1930s Technicolor has developed a substantially improved process of true colors, which no longer produced everything that looked like orange-red and green-blue. Thus, this film during color sequences looks much like a silent or early audio color film. Very special for the 1940s.
