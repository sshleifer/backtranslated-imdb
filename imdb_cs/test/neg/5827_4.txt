I saw Winnie Heffalump a few days ago. A nice story based on famous characters created by A.A.Milne. Although Winnie, Piggy, Tigger and Rabbit are present in this animated feature, Roo is the main character this time. Friends with frightening Heffalump, who turns out to be not scary at all, and shows everyone that friendship knows no bounds and everyone wants and deserves to be happy. I love this movie and would like it even more 10 or 15 years younger. Unfortunately, I would like to become a boy again to enjoy this Heffalump story much more, but all I have left is a feeling of sadness in losing some kind of childhood and innocence that is full of this film? I was glad to hear Carly Simon singing, Joel McNeely gave a great score.
