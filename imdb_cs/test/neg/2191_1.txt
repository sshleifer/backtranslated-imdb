I have read all the other comments that made this movie an excellent film. I have seen nothing of what has been said. I thought it was long and boring. I tried to watch it twice. When I first fell asleep and for the second time I did it within six minutes of the end and gave up. I suppose it was mainly my fault with great expectations, but I don't think it would completely ruin the movie for me. The film was only bland. It had nothing spectacular or unique. The plot was not a bad one, the action sequences did not exist, the dialogue was forced, and the film continued forever. I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie.
