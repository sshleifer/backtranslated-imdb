The plane carrying scientists and prototype DNA machines, a powerful and revolutionary invention, falls into the jungle of the Pacific. The insurance company sponsors a rescue expedition led by Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), the owner of a large corporation that owns the prototype, and the father of one of the scientists. There the group finds the remains of the plane five miles from the expected site and the machines and remains of the people. They also realize that Sasquatch, a Big Foot, is chasing them. This movie is so ridiculous that I don't know what I'm doing, I spend time again in this waste. The direction is terrible, actors and lines are horrible, copying the "The Predator" and even "The Blair Witch Project". To summarize how bad this movie is, his best scene is when Marla Lawson, Andrea Roth, is injured, and the expedition guide says she needs a tetanus vaccine injection. Andrea undresses her jeans and the guide says, "Nice butts, but the shot must be in your arm." Ridiculous! My voice is two. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): `Sasquatch, O Abomin√°vel '(` Sasquatch, The Abominable') <br /> <br />
