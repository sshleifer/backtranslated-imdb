The man (Gaston Modot) and The Young Girl (Lya Lys) go through a film of passion for themselves. They long to be together, but their moments are constantly interrupted. The film is dotted along with the picture and stops after an hour ......... lovers find happiness ....? .. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Scorpions shots, but you'll soon realize it's all tough nonsense. It is made as a silent movie with occasional dialogue and has a continuous soundtrack that is so unpleasant in one place that the sound changes down and you want to watch it as a silent movie. Continuous drum cylinders must have crazy viewers. There are some really funny moments, eg when a man kicks a dog and when he knocks on a blind man. Unfortunately, this humor is done in the name of art, so it's just pseudo nonsense. The movie is crap.
