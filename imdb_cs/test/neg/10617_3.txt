I watched this movie, which I thought had a promising start, but then finally made me disappointed. The problem that I think with this movie was that the director tried a little hard to make this movie weird and original. There were too many flashbacks and too many bad "effects" that made me angry over the movie. I love Debbie Harry and Isaac Hayes, but they disappointed me in this movie, they could do much better. This film looked promising at first, dragged in the middle and finally failed. The film could never defeat Stanley Kubrick's genre in terms of controversial issues, strangeness and originality in films.
