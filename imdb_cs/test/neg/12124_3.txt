I must say it's better than most SyFy trips, but it doesn't say much. The reason is that someone buys a game that is made from the bones and skin of a dead witch from the Spanish Inquisition (and no one ever expects the Spanish Inquisition!) He and his friends play the game just to be halved when a friend who went to a beer is killed in the way the game predicted. The following is a series of kills that are typical of a movie like this, or any of the Final Destination movies. At the end, she has a riddle and an interesting subplot with a cop who wants the game to bring her family back ... but it's just a mess.
