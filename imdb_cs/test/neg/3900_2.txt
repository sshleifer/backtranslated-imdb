When I started watching, I immediately noticed that I couldn't understand what anyone was saying. I turned the volume. With the background noise that is developing, I heard voices. What do the actors say? Is the movie being copied? Does he speak Spanish? After some confusion, I realize it was English. At least I think ... Amazing Jess Franco placed the microphones too far from the actors. As a result, we cannot completely hear what they are saying. He did it earlier. But maybe it is Mr. Frank's intention? By not knowing what people are saying, we are thrown into a secret about what is happening, leaving more visual tracks with them ... Maybe it's just me, but I'd like to know what's going on! What about some tips? The basic premise (I refuse to call it "conspiracy") relates to a young American exotic dancer named Paula (played by Amber Newman) who has a friend who invites her to a small island owned by some slim rich people. It's somewhere off the coast of Spain. For this visit, Paula promises a big cash payment to a friend. He then escapes from the island just to come back later. Why? Pay close attention to the scene where a friend opens Paul's American passport. Although his hand tried to cover up, you can see the actress' real name, Amber Newman, printed under the photo at the bottom of the waist! By the way, back to the "story": There are some other sleazy, rich, beautiful characters visiting the island, all with ambiguous motifs. We witness sadistic games (are they real or false?) And nasty dining scenes. But the food must be good, as the fake French chef prepared! There is a young woman servant who runs around naked and never speaks. Is he really dumb? And we don't care? Of course, all women are mostly naked in this movie ... Well, at least we can be grateful that men (50+ and overweight) are left dressed! In addition to the amazing sound quality I've always been interested in Jess Franco, his amazing ability to shoot beautiful naked women in such a way that the viewer turns off completely. This movie is no exception? I needed fresh air after his observation! Conclusion: I am glad to announce that no matter what Mr Franco may dream, I am still attracted to women.
