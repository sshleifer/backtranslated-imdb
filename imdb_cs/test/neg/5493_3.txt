Best around Wednesday when most characters get horny and go after someone they didn't have before. It's about this point when we see the majestic breasts of Susan Sarandon (though it's a veil). Surprisingly, Beverly D'Angelo, who is not ashamed of nudity, shows nothing at all while Aida Turturro? all people? does. At the other end of the spectrum, less said about Walken playing gay better. The film itself has a small plot; theatrical dialogues and "normal" dialogues often go beyond what is a good idea. Theater Life: Who cares? Something is happening occasionally in the dialogue, but the film is stretched.
