No doubt the biggest waste of the movie of the year. This film is poorly structured, sadistic, cruel and full of unlikable characters. Moreover, the worst crime is uninteresting and predictable. When Bill Pullman's character woke up in the photo, she changed the word from "proof" to "violence", so I invented the whole story. There are no surprises and there is no compelling reason to follow this waste. The only redemption feature for me is that I saw this thing for free on my HDNet cable and didn't waste money. I would really be mad if I paid for seeing it in the theater. Terrible, horrible movie in every way it matters.
