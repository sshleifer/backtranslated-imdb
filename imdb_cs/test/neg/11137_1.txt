That was probably the worst movie ever made ... ketchup was the lead in this movie and would be the only prize candidate because the storyline, actors, and anything about this farce was horrible and ridiculous. I could have done a better horror swing in my backyard within two hours with a handheld camera using grass filled dummies as actors, at least acting would be better! Don't waste your time or money on this ... it's extremely cheesy and awful !!
