I rated this movie 3 and it was generous. The scenery is cumbersome and gaudy; I think Peter O'Toole did a good job of acting (Tiberius), but he had to be scorned when he saw the latest film cut. John Gielgud, however briefly featured in the film, seemed to play a role from Hamlet. The hard core of the pornographic part was neither erotic nor too helpful. Well Malcolm McDowell had a nice ass and the one who played Macro was nice. The one who played Claudius looked more like a traditional depiction of Nero and was certainly at odds with Robert Graves Claudia's picture. Climactic (?) The assassination of Caligula, wife and child is inaccurate in that it shows him after death lying on stairs in open space, when in fact he was murdered in an underground hall on the palatine hill that ran along the front. Domus Flaviana, which still exists today. There are places in this film, where virtually something has drawn my attention from her - a merciful distraction. If you want history, read Suetonius or Tacitus, if you want pornography and sadism, watch Passolini's "Salo", but in all cases, avoid this movie.
