This movie has a few good performances that are going on - and that's all it takes. Leadership, especially Pauley Perrette, is appealing. (Although some of the bit players seem to act from a teleprompter.) Material - that's a problem. I feel like a screenwriter / director has watched Felicity's entire run in one session, then sat down and wrote the screenplay without catching sleep. It really reminded me of Felicia â€” a thoughtful young woman who found herself, found love, with access to characters and their relationships that trembled. Except that I liked watching Felicity, this movie left me cold. Writing is just awful. It's amazing that the cast could drop as well as if the dialogue was boring at best. In the worst case, it becomes trite, stilted and amateur. There is nothing original, with the elements of the fence recycled from the tricks that were not so brilliant to begin with. (Angels and Seers? Come on.) In the first half of the film, I took root for the actors and hoped to be rewarded for my patience. By the second half, I wished it was over. My sympathy for the cast who deserved a better resource for their talent.
