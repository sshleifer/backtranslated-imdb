Charles Bronson gave the audience a lot of great moments on the screen. But this movie lacks everything a thriller / action movie should have. There are several action scenes in the movie, but they are really miserable. And when the action scenes fail, does the story save the story? Not at all, it's my answer to that. The story is even worse than the action scene. It's very simple and boring, and although I'm a big movie fan, I almost fell asleep several times. I don't know how they came up with such a failure. Maybe a low budget? Regardless, all the actors seemed to have no interest in being in the film at all. When this happens, the result is really bad.
