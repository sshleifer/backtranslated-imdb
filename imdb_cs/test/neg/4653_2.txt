All but the youngest Americans are probably familiar with the cult challenge of "Laaaaaa-sie!" from Timmy's little thing, or what was happening, was that his little draft tap for his girlfriend's border college. The same Americans may or may not be familiar with the fact that Lassie made a leap from television to movies (or was it another way. It's irresistible to "this movie go to dogs!" Pun so I'm not (even if I'm technically But Lassie (playing Shep, best friend) gets a top billing account. DOG GETS TOP BILLING. Now I'm not familiar with how actors or their agents negotiate contracts, but here's how it plays in my The Mind: <br /> <br /> MOVIE MOGUL: Okay, Lassie, in credits, it will be, "as Lassie as Shep!" LASSIE: Rrrrowf! Grrrrrrr. ! LASSIE: Rrroo rrrrooo roooo. MOVIE MOGUL: Okay, I think I see. What-lead billing? LASSIE: Rawrf! Rawrrrrff rawrf! MOV MOGUL: Oh God! from my arm !!! <br /> <br /> So the dog gets the highest rush reading and with the rest of this shocked cast, I suppose it's understandable. We get a nice old grumpus Jonathan prospector, his young, angry and apparently orphaned friend Tommy, a superficial loser Lin Taylor, and a cute old religious grumpus pilot Pete. The meat of this plot could be summed up in a few sentences, so I will save you the real pain of watching the movie. Jonathan is a prospector with a dog named Shep and his partner dies when he is on his claim. He gets a new partner named Lin, who becomes obsessed with gold, and for some reason Jonathan gives Shep an adorable little Crimson Tommy. Lin kills Jonathan, Shep sees it, and Lin tries to kill Shep. Then Lin tries to kill Tommy. Then Tommy whines, it's cold, and Shep makes a complicated plan to take Lin's revenge on him (or she?). End. <br /> <br /> If you don't have a deep, disturbing need to see Lassie (Lassie's film must be better than that), avoid The Painted Hills. When it's not tugging, admire Lassie's limited ability to 'act' (alike in style, perhaps, to Keanu Reeves - always the same facial expression, just the body moves), set obvious with a few minutes of film, or offensive Native Americans everywhere with their white actress-in-facepaint "Ugh! As! Stereotypes, The Painted Hills are only suitable for Lassie fetishists or people who have a relationship with their exploration on their days, like an angry old prospector looking at the shimmering vein of glittering gold!
