What a waste of time. I got about five minutes into it and became * very * antsy, and was soon fast-forward a bit, and pretty soon the desire to take my thumb off-forward button did not exist. I think the actors Mark Redfield and Barry Murphy have worked very well, but no one else I've seen has done anything good. Again, take this review with a large grain of salt, because the film was so unbearable that I couldn't finish it. Damn, I couldn't get into MIDDLE !! <br /> <br /> I don't think I can post this review because it's not long enough. Maybe this last sentence will put it on top.
