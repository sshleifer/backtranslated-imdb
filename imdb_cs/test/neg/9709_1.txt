This film is one of the worst adaptations ever made to Pride and Prejudice, and if Jane Austen were alive, she would have her name removed from the movie. Austen's novel is just a superficial story of the development of true love between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. It is also a commentary on the class structure of Regency Britain. This film focuses solely on a love story, and is therefore a disappointment for viewers who hoped to do justice to the novel. There are many problems with the historical accuracy of the film. In the film, a dance at which Darcy's snubs Elizabeth is not a cultured dance made by the nobility, to which Bennet, Lucas, Bingley, and Darcy's families belong, but is rather a lower class dance. The nobility would not dance as if they were on a farmer's dance. There are also costumes and hair problems. The usual period required women to wear white cloth hats to cover their hair and to wear hoods for women when they were out. Regency women were not so free to give up the hood requirements in public. The worst historical inaccuracy is the morning meeting of Elizabeth (in her nightgown and coat) and Mr. Darcy (sans tie and vest) to whom they admit their love for each other. It's an unforgivable freedom with the novel. No decent young woman or gentleman would be able to get away in such a state of undress or try to meet someone from the opposite sex in such a morning hour. But the worst thing with this movie is that it is an interview with Austen and annoying modern dialogue. Austen's dialogue doesn't need any help from a writer who thinks he can write as Austen. The non-Austen writer not only lacks Austen's talent but also has no feeling for Austen's style. Juxtaposition of both styles is unpleasant. As far as acting is concerned, Judi Dench is the best one who clearly understands the subtlety of the aristocracy. Brenda Blethyn has some freedom when she makes Mrs. Bennet less terrible than Austen's portrayal. Its display is interesting and seems to work. Donald Sutherland is wrong. His influenced British accent is terrible, and he portrays Mr Bennet too much as the father of the 20th century and not the father of the late 18th century. The picture of Darcy Matthew MacFadeyn is flat. I can't imagine anyone falling in love with his Mr. Darcy. Keira Knightly is quite Elizabeth, but her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet is too modern. The Knight focuses on Elizabeth's straightforwardness, but her depiction completely lacks understanding of the social customs and conventions of that time. She would do well to actually read the novel before trying to portray Elizabeth and do research on women's behavior over the period. <br /> <br /> If a person makes a period movie, it must be true. time. This film needed a historical advisor who actually knows something about the Regency period. It also needed a writer who has a better recognition and understanding of Austen's text. I can only hope that Emma Thompson decides to do Pride and prejudice in the near future to erase this abomination from our mind. nice scene of english countryside. Chatsworth is well used as Pemberly (as it was in the 1995 BBC adaptation). But pretty scenery and pretty actors can't save this movie. True Austen fans will rush home to watch their DVDs of the much better 1995 BBC production with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth or read Austen's text in order to wipe this version out of their minds.
