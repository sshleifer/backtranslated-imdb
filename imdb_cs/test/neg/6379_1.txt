I tried to watch this show on several different occasions and every time I realized that it was totally pale humor. The reason to be mentioned is that it is based only on mocking everything that Republicans have. Done. In short, it is basically a democratic political political party that is offered as humor. All Mrs Stewart is doing wisecrack about whatever Republicans have done, and the audience has soaked in a gale of forced laughter. My guess is that the left is so devoid of any real substance that it has to define in terms of how much all the hateful Republicans are. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> _____________________________ <br /> <br /> my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
