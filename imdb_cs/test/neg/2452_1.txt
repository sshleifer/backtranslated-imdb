When I think about TV movies, I always think about this movie, I've watched it on Sky several times, it was horrible. It was a long time since I saw this movie, just walked through it and came across it here: -S. Microbiologist (Linda Flemming), on vacation, with her son (William Flemming), in this recreation center where they meet with Paul Johnson (taxi driver / own bar?) and Kathy Johnson. It's like a strange romantic thing, William is beginning to fall on Kathy and Paul falls on Linda. Some guy rides in the street, has a mark on his arm, Joseph (Joseph was a diver who on the dive, saw light, or something, and converted to religion), says he will take care of this a person in my memory is a gap, then there is a big breakup of the virus, I think Linda will offer her help, come up with a cure, infect Kathy (William notices a mark on Kathy's arm), with a virus, also Joseph. Paul says Joseph has some lines, then Joseph rebounds next time you see Joseph, heals him, how this information is used to heal the infected, then there's a beach party, over.
