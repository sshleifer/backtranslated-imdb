I loved Heavenly Creatures and made it a place to catch it whenever it was on it. <br /> <br /> Imagine I was pleased to discover Love & Suicide while browsing NetFlix. Echoing Heavenly Creations, Easy Choice, It Goes to the Top of My Queue. I watched it last, made myself comfortable and waited. What I thought was some miserable demonstration of a film project of a joke student of a stoned high school student. Terrible playing, amateur direction, weak dialogue. I usually like low-budget movies, something tangible and real about them, because they can't afford the superficial things to distract from "meat", acting, direction, conspiracy, story. I would like to compare it to a student who did not work for the exam because he knew he would not do it and just lay his head on the table and sleep. Someone else's conspiracy would have a serious potential. Don't expect magic or iconic classics like, say, Divine's Polyester or Showgirls, at least you'll learn to expect bad acting. Love & Suicide went from a bad, worse to a WORST movie I've ever seen.
