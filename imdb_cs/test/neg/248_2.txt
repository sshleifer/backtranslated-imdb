I saw it at Mystery Science Theater 3000, and even the show could not bear the film. I could make a better movie with a broken video camera and action figures. Of course, you expect horrible special effects with a movie that's old, but I saw quiet that was better. The storyline has huge gaps that allow you to find out why they are even in certain scenes. Apparently the cameraman doesn't know what a tripod is, and he had too much coffee or something harder because the camera ALWAYS shakes. I couldn't even watch the story, but it was enough to say, it's the absolute worst movie I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: I've seen "Epic Movie" and back decided to give this movie 2. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen!
