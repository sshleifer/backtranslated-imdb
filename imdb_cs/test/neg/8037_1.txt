I'll repeat - what a silly script. Is there anything new inside? I don't know who wrote it. But I believe this guy looks at all Hollywood kids - family movies he has ever made ... all the scenes and dilouges u can see everywhere. Why do people make movies in people? children as adults? Do they like gold car money ... and are they positive? they are lucky ... and of course emotions ... without it being possible. about young actors - wow :-). Do I like the camera to focus on their pretty faces? What a crap ... there is 90% better movies for kids that make this! This is not a creative or entertaining movie. That's nothing. <br /> <br /> D.
