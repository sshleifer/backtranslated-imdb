While people can get on the scene, the movie becomes deadly - or at least deadly boring. We stayed with a bunch of great actors who send out a dialogue that he wrote brilliantly but does nothing. Worse still, each character speaks with the same voice despite their background. The only attempt to distinguish them is to have a teen-waif Anna Paquin to use the word "not."
