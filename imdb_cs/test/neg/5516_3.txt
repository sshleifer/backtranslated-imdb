He barely compares the space adventures of his time. These are Star Wars and Star Trek. And while I'm not a Star Trek fan, I realize that this movie has turned white compared to Trekkies. In fact, I would put Back to the Future in a better light in terms of space and travel. The story is about a boy who is captured by space raiders (pirates). In an apparently false and unsustainable battle, the captured boy is friends with the pirates and even helps them. And slowly, one by one, the robbers die out. Finally, the boy returns home and the last remaining pirates run away badly injured. The meeting wasn't that great. But what is really obvious is the complete lack of interesting dialogues, effects, and actions. How about having 80 minutes is over. <br /> <br /> To see it because it's a space, go ahead. But be warned. "D"
