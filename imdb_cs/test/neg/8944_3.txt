Premature talkie feature based on popular theater play. The murder was committed and a bunch of people hired a media to lead a session to see who the killer was. While the lights are gone, there's another Murder ... so it's someone in the room. The mysterious, boring and creaking secret of murder follows. Most casts surpass the absurd level. He acts like on stage (where you have to exaggerate things) and on the screen it looks stupid. The most embarrassing is Bela Lugosi (two years before "Dracula"), who really exceeds him as a police inspector. Tod Brown's static instruction (which has always been overestimated) does not help. <br /> <br /> For Browning and Lugosi accomplices only. I'll give it 3.
