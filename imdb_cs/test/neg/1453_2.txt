This is a very special product from Hollywood. Apparently, it didn't test well, because the actors who have shots in the credits were completely modified from the film, which means that the work was done. It feels like he's been torn from the normally competent Demme's hands, and he was just fired. On the other hand, it is so completely absent basically that nothing could save him. It has no real center, either narratively or temporally. Although it says the running time is 92 minutes, it seems that I remember that it ended suddenly, around 80 minutes. It's over before it gets. It's pretty much a free laugh. The merits of "Matthew Modine Picture" were as elusive as Luke Wilson's picture.
