Bob Clampett's 'Hep Cat' is a distinctly average cartoon just really notable by the fact that it was the first color of Looney Tune (previously Looney tunes were all black and white while Merrie's tunes were in color). The story of singing, dancing cats attempts of a cat cat and attempting to catch a cat "Hep Cat" lacks brand energy and the pace of most Clampett shorts. To be fair, Clampett doesn't have much to do with it. Warren Foster's screenplay is embarrassingly thin and while with other cartoons he spun straw into gold, Clampett can't handle it with 'The Hep Cat'. It is often said about Clampett that you can't accidentally turn his cartoons into someone else and it's generally true, but 'Hep Cat' is an exception. There are flashes of Clampett's genius, such as the chase scene in which the cat stops asking the dog "hey, you followed me". When the dog confirms it is, the cat simply says "Oh" and the chase continues immediately. Unfortunately, there is very little such brilliance. Knowing who drove it, 'Hep Cat' is a bitter disappointment. We're all gone, and this was one of Clampett's!
