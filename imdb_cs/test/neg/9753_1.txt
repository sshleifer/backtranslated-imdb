actors cannot act. all dialoagues were plagued by bad accents and loss of character. Channing Tatum never moves his lips or changes his facial expression ... EVER. The story is nothing new at all. a street boy joins the professional world of dance and turns his life. what is associated with the whole incident with a small child is taken directly from You Got Served and Save the Last Dance (I'm not saying these movies were also good, but that means the movie didn't bring anything new to the table). <br /> <br /> and Dancing ... ONLY THROUGH 3 DANCE PROCEDURES THAT HAVE BEEN BUSINESS DIRECTED IN THE FULL FILM AND PUBLIC FILMS maybe I'm too critical because I'm a dancer, but maybe that's what needs to be heard. Channing Tatum is NOT in any way a b-boy. his little solo in the parking lot had little style, technique, or any factor that is part of the street dancer's criteria. All the jazz and ballet in the film had nothing to offer except the bad technique and some acceptable twists, but nothing more. grande finale let me think "OK, now they get serious" until the end when I realized that it would never happen. <br /> <br /> I admit that it's definitely hard to make a good dance movie, but Step Up is no exception to the rule. You served, with the exception of his street dance culture at least he had a dance aspect. Save the Last Dance was a waste, so it was just about a musical from the last 10 years (even though I was impressed by the Moulin Rouge) ... check out the Center Stage for Ballet
