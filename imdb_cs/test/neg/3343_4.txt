(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> Of course it's based on Moby Dick. Completely obsessed and destroyed. It is total folly. The movie starts pretty well, but at the end of the movie, everyone else is destroyed and the star star's mind is empty. The supposed half sister is never convincing. Some very bad lighting effects. Music is interesting. But little else. It took me a month to finally finish the damn thing. I suppose if you like Being John Malkovich, maybe you like it. But where BJM was a great movie that I didn't want to watch again, Pola X is a movie that I hate in high hell. The only possible excitement in the film is the gratuitous sex scene of incest towards the end of the film. (Hopefully you're not even thinking about Catherine.) This movie is really boring, depressing and poorly directed. Not recommended. If you like French movies. (instead watch Crimson Rivers) <br /> <br/> 4/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 5/10 Entertainment: 1/10 Replayable: 0/10
