Yes, stupid is the word for this actress. I know many have mentioned her beauty, but this viewer has found her empty head and boredom to watch her bleached hair, lip gloss and not so perfect body. Watch her go in those jeans and show a pretty big ass. Her ass spreads behind her shoulders. What does that tell you? As for the leading man who played the magnificent Mark Humphrey, he was perfectly cast. Charmer. However, they did not agree with Lancaster. She was out of place against this good-looking boy. Good work by Susan Glover as a sister. Angela Galuppo had a small role and was fine. However, the director of the film, Philippe Gagnon, has missed too many shots on Lancaster. After a while, you are tired of looking at her and watching her dull acting skills. And what the wife of the wife was. Snooping on your husband, being uncomfortable with him and just an ordinary spoiled brat. She was happy to see her hit an arrow weapon. I thought it might be the end. But unfortunately, the script tells us something else. After torturing and watching this loser I came back with the same criticism. Lancaster is boring to watch. This time around her hair, guys. Her hair was constantly on her face, constantly throwing him back, became uncomfortable. I ask the writer, the reason for Alexander Komisaruk, why a good-looking wealthy man like Philippe would bother with similar bimbo like Allison. When there were so many attractive smart women to choose from, with class. It doesn't take anything. Is it a Rochester thing / Jane Eyre? I think it's just a matter of taste. This Sarah Lancaster is not my cup of tea, people.
