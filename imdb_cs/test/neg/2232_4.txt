If this is considered an independent function, I can't say it's bad, but from where I stand this sequel and the original "Lady and Tramp" disagree with the others! These are two completely different films with a different style, different voice personalities, different stories and the only things they share with each other. have changed. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for some kind of continuity of years after the release of the original for those unforgettable songs like "Bella Notte" and "The Siamesse Cats Song," this sequel will not give you at all! Almost every song has a little pop on it and those good old characters like Jock and Trusty, Jim Dear and Darling and Aunt Sarah and her cats can be seen well, but they seem to be replaced by new characters in some way, not to mention Peg does not appear at all, whose voices are quite unpleasant. Even the Lady and the Tramp don't seem to be quite often and as far as Scamp?! He's so spoiled! And he treats his father Tramp with utter disrespect, then runs without remorse, even when he hears how much he misses at home! And they said his shameless escape adventure! I would say that Scott Wolf actually brought out a shameful evil boy in Scamp and exterminated a typical cute Disney animal. Even the old ones are angry with you; Trusts sound like Goofy sick in bed, Jock (Jeff-stupid-Bennett) - and his VOICE - neither sound nor hear it! Turn it on as far as possible to free our poor ears from his voice and as far as stupid, feathery, EXASPERATING JUNKYARD DOGS !!!!!! Someone is giving !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "Lady and Tramp 2" It's not really bad if you don't have a tough day yet, but I expect a lot more magic from sequel to real classics - Scamp's chavvy, so his girlfriend Angel and there is a weak story . Still, I think you should try it at least once, because, as I say, there are much worse films around.
