This movie, "Desperate Measures", was .... I'm not quite sure how to put it in words. Should it be a comedy? I couldn't stop laughing as it was absolutely ridiculous. I love Michael Keaton and I can't really understand he did it. They did a good job of keeping my attention, because I couldn't wait to see how much ridiculous it would be a minute. Actually, I just registered on this site to get it. I don't rate movies. I don't have time to do this, but I can't let it know that I haven't done my civil duty by letting people (those who are 85 years old and over) know it's not an action / thriller, it's honest to be funny. You people scared of it scare me. Check out a good movie like Million Dollar Baby. Clint Eastwood's playing isn't excellent, but I was the ball at the end. Practice Your Brain America!
