Oh my god! Beeb hit a new low with this bleak act of political correctness, a mixed race family living in Birmingham with a bad guy thrown on a good scale. Whoever ordered this trio should be caught and worthy of the dogs. Usually funny Jasper Carrott is about as fun as pilots in this show and don't let me start on others. They have timing and a slightly nuclear bomb. I just hope that the comedy will improve, but I seriously doubt it with similar people like Little Britain and Catherine Tate. I think you should be better off getting a box for a decent comedy from ancient times like Fawlty Towers or Bottom if you want to laugh. <br /> <br /> BAN TENTO SQUEAKY CLEAN RUBBISH!
