This could be the very worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I normally don't have movies like this, but I was forced to watch it at school. What is Torment! The story is as average and boring as it can be: A boy meets a girl on the Spanish coast, a boy and a girl fall in love, but the love between the two seems impossible and everyone is against their love. At the end of the film, the film becomes some strange kung-fu film, when white-fighting boys fight boys in black. Terrible! The action is so bad it makes you laugh. Dances in a movie that I think are supposed to be cool are so simple and ridiculous that I can do them! And Georgina Verbaan is perhaps the most irritating person I've ever seen on screen. Johan Nijenhuis is on his way to becoming Dutch Ed Wood. His films are so bad they make you laugh. Victor LÃ¶w, however, gives a surprisingly good performance and Daan Schuurmans also acts fine. t watch this movie. But if you want to watch soaps, it can be a good time. <br /> <br /> Yuk! <br /> <br /> 2/10
