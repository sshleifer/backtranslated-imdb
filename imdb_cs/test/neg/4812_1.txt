Why? Why? Why does nobody tell the truth about this terrible HORRIBLE movie on Earth? I wake up in the morning and ask God why he didn't stop me from seeing this rebellious "comedy." I can't believe I paid to see this crime on my cinematic taste. I'm starting to think that the 5 stars he has are because of Martha Higared's nudity and all the men who can't buy a porn movie and avoid seeing it ... I'll call it "cause" the cause of the call that movie is insulting Mexican film industry. Characters are huge clich√©s, acting causes involuntary laughter and the script is ... well, I can't believe it was written by a human being. And just when you thought you were enough torture ... the last half hour is so painful that I wanted to pull my eyes. The only good thing I can say about this outrage is that it only takes 90 minutes (it would feel like a century, but still). Indeed, HEAT THE GOD !!!
