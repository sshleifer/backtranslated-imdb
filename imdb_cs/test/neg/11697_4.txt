No serious spoilers, but some very small. "Acacia", a Korean contribution to the increasingly popular Asian horror wave, concerns a husband and wife who decide to get a moment and decide to take a baby. A child who has the usual obsession with a dead tree in his family's garden will eventually disappear when the couple ultimately owns their own child, and the above-mentioned tree appears to resent the family. And that's about it. The film moves at the speed of snails. It is basically a thin family drama with a haunted tree, and there is very little fright, just the shots of a tree with strange mumbling sounds playing over the top. However, the idea that a tree is the mother of a child is quite original, but it is not fully utilized. This species separates "Acacia" from the majority of the new wave to which it belongs: films like Ju-On and Ring tend to do the opposite and milk bland ideas until they are red in the face. The film begins to go to the end; nevertheless, the realization of the child's fate and the actions of the parents not only dampen the earlier curiosity of the story, but are also revealed with such a machine gun adjustment that it is difficult to attract at once. The final sequence is undoubtedly spooky, but it seems too late. Overall, the film does not feel like cash in the ring, but with the "film renaissance" that Korea has currently gone through, I couldn't help but feel that the film could have been much more .
