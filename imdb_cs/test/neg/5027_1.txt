Man! This series must be the worst possible anime I've ever seen in time. It started new, exciting and fresh. And I really liked it. Kagome was a good female pattern for the show. And Inu-Yasha was funny and hot-headed. Then it just continued to fall more and more downhill as the series progressed ... and I will tell you all the reasons why. (Warning: SPOILER ALERT !!) Well, basically destroying Inu-Yasha's relationship with Kagome soon, reviving his fifty-year-old dead girlfriend who is shabby, contented, and utterly waste of time. They represent a pervert named Miroku, who is supposed to be a religious representative of the show. (Which really dissuaded me because it was in place and stupid.) Then introduces the killer demon named Sango, whose sole purpose in life is to try (and fail) to save his thoughtful brother. The great evil of the show, Naraku, when he started out as a really good bad man, lost touch after a while. (He got pretty fast. And it bothered me that he was the only baddie in the series he did anything.) <br /> <br /> Characters became wooden and unemployed. And then the end of this terrible series was disappointing for all the anime fans out there. Nothing happened. Naraku has never been killed or defeated. Kagome and Inu-Yasha never fully fall in love (because he was still in love with a 50-year-old dead chicken). The animation deteriorated and worse as the series progressed. And nothing has changed on the land. (I mean, they pulled him out for more than 150 episodes and nothing changed in the plot ... at all.) And did they expect me (like the other fans of the show) to meet me? I was disillusioned, disgusted and annoyed like crap. At least I had great hopes that it would be a good end to the series. Instead, all I got was pulled out commercial for manga. Seriously, if you want to see a good anime about the sword and so on, I strongly recommend "Rurouni Kenshin". That the show progresses and goes somewhere, plus it has a really good animation too. But stay away from this bland apology for anime as best you can.
