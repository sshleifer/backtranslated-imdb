Even the standards of most B-movies, this film is by far the worst I've ever seen. The graphics are so poor that a man in a monster suit looks more realistic. The effects of ocean water are particularly ridiculous, including one scene where they are on a mini-sub, and "water" looks frozen in place. The problems with this movie are so numerous that I stop here with details. Needless to say, I'm a child when I say Uwe Toilet Boll could do a better job. Avoid this movie at all costs, there are other class B movies out there that even if it's terrible, they are at least a good way to pass the time.
