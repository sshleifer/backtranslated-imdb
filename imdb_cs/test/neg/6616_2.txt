"The Brink Season" is one of my favorite books of all time - a keen stare on Bob Knight and his Indiana Hoosiers. And Dennehy is one of my favorite actors of all time. So I decided to follow this adaptation. <br /> <br /> He is disappointed at every level. Dennehy's performance was less than inspired, and he seemed unprepared to play Knight - as if he had accepted the role just before filming. The rest of the cast is not much better. And it was obvious that it was ESPN's first movie. It was badly directed, badly filmed, and the lack of budget was obvious whenever games were simulated (smaller gyms, empty seats, etc.).
