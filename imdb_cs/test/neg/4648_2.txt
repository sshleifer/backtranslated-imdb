Cameron Mitchell plays an actor who walks with a young actress who used to go to film studio (she is too young for them!). At the party, when the cigarette is lit, the head of the reading room throws a high-alcohol drink into his face and he burns. In the hospital, his face is completely bandaged and still lit a cigarette! He becomes the resident sculptor of the museum and the winery museum Movieland Wax, where he also lights up cigarettes! Mitchell is recovering more or less when she has a really bad make-up on one side of her face. gray spackle and tape and eyepiece. When Mitchell doesn't smoke, she kills people. Sometimes they sometimes kill people because they prefer to give them something that brings them into a waxy coma. If they don't keep it up regularly (and never remember it), they'll start moving a little, even if they're in a hypnotic zombie. Not all his statues are people. Apparently he has talent as a sculptor. The end, which seemed to be hit by a much worse press than the rest of the movie, is really absurd. They seemed not to know what to do and returned to the title for the idea. In addition to the odd grainy final shots, the rest of the film is in fairly good condition, with the exception of the sound in some scenes that sounds as if it were going through a blown speaker. Definitely not one of the better wax museum films.
