When I first looked at this series, the impression I got was that the characters were charming and funny, especially Lorelai and Rory were funny and intelligent conversational, though a little too much spoken. After looking at it for some time, my opinion has changed. The main characters slowly turned out to be self-confident daffodils that focused on themselves, and treated their pride as the worst insults. existence. For example, Rory wouldn't have talked to her mother for months when Lorelai hadn't consulted her with her impulsive marriage, while Lorelai fired Luke for just wanting to adjust to her new living conditions. These people are shallow, they see themselves as the center of the universe where everyone else should behave exactly as their own rigid rules behave, and if not, they will have eternity against them. They don't want to see other people's problems and treat the slightest slight attacks. Most characters lack the ability to behave in an adult way. They think they should do what they want, and everyone else is damned. The series is built on the character, so when the main characters became so unlikely, the show could not be watched. I still have the rest of the show, but I doubt if I ever see them. I will also hold no one who has a great idea of ​​this show and its most terrible characters - it must be as horrible as Lorelai et al.
