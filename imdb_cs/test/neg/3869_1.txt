"You know - I was in some cities where the girls weren't so nice. In fact, I was in some cities where they were absolutely ugly. But it's the first time I'm in a city where there are no girls at all." the great classics recall this phrase that belongs to Vin ... one of those seven wonderful (from the first movie) ... <br /> <br /> Now I Want to Express Him Again. You know, I saw some movies where the storyline isn't so good. In fact, I've seen some movies where the plot is horrible, but this is the first time in my life that I've seen a movie where there's no graph at all. <br /> <br /> OK. Maybe my above statement is somewhat above the top, but honestly ... how can we say the plot of what's going on in this movie. The evil man (oh, don't ask me to give you his name because I don't remember and his or somehow near Calvery who has a name and character is unforgettable ...) is trying to build a church in the name of his late sons who were killed in some battle, and this evil man kidnapped poor villagers to make them build a church ... especially how big the church must be to force hundreds of villagers to build it ... it's some Egyptian pyramid or something like that? but OK, let's stop by the conspiracy and the totally forgotten character of the evil guy and say a few words about Seven ... Yul brynner is good old Chris, always calm, always quiet, talking less but speaking the wise is gone (unfortunately). No no ... he's just as calm as he ... but he's calm now that you're just not buying him. (Imagine meeting a good old friend, Chico, who has to save after so many years and there's only a few "Hi, Hi" and no handshake (if I remember) ... honestly, it looks more like a meeting of two strangers in some internet chat rather than a Chris and Chica meeting, which means that "new Chris" looks more like a robocop or terminator, rather than our beloved wise quickgun ... <br /> <br /> I'm not going to stop talking about other characters here They just aren't ANY there ... (imagine if a strong actor like Yul Brynner is so fake forgotten, then what other characters will look like) ... <br /> <br /> There are still several attempts to give us a story for each of them ... for example, one is a female favorite guy, the other is a man with a dark past that the wife raped and killed the Indians and since then she has been killing everyone and everything that moves ...it makes sense or not can have your heart. <br /> <br /> I remember being a little child and when O'reilly (Charles Bronson's character) died in the first movie, I was crying. Here I just didn't care about each of them ... even if the whole group died with the entire crew of the movie, it seems that I wouldn't care about it ... <br /> <br /> So, please go and see for this movie ... I recommend it because you won't have a second chance to see anything worse than that.
