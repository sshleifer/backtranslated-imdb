I found this movie to be extremely homophobic ... the main character doesn't know he's gay until he realizes he likes Barbra Streisand and has a flabby wrist !!! I was so offended that after going to the Toronto Film Festival, I went upstairs and spoke to the writer to complain about the film. This is the type of film GLAAD needs to disable.
