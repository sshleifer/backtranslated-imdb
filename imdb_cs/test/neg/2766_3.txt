The film begins with a little girl (Rita) who sees her father killed. Apparently it was a criminal who shouted at his colleagues. Later, and this part makes little sense, the girl grew into adulthood and STILL her father's past haunted her! A little later, Rita meets nothing good and dates it. During one of his days, he is a little drunk and is like a fool. The cops are chasing and leaving - while killing pedestrians. Here comes a really stupid part. She convinces her to confess to the crime because she assures her that her lawyers can deprive her of her freedom. Why, oh why, would she agree with that ?! Yet he does and spends the next few years in jail! And soon after his conviction, this friend disappears - proving that he is a total heel. What a chump! Later, after her release, her friend (Jack La Rue) informs her of the truth about her friend. Then she explains that the friend's family is loaded and she should shake them for a lot of money for all the problems he gave her by taking a rap. Frankly, it makes sense - as he certainly owes her - especially because they knew she would go to jail and intend to use it and then throw it aside. Now the idea of ​​bleeding money from rich chumps is a good idea. However, there is no way to do it in the first place, because it is hard to believe that anyone could be stupid enough to get a hit for a hit-and-run! In an interesting procedure, a silent lady decides on the life of a crime - puts on a wig and picks up a rich guy - takes him to the desert and robs him of a gun! Wow ... how she changed! Apparently he loves the idea of ​​stealing from "phonies" - that is, rich hypocrites. However, and that didn't make sense, she soon stopped doing and shaken her old friend's father - why she bothered to do some minor robberies in the meantime. And what was a little hard to believe was that instead of wanting money from an old jerk, she was keen to get him to influence the mayor for a mob-controlled man. Strange ... very, very special. Meanwhile, another conspiracy with young Alan Ladd is developing. He is a secret agent who has penetrated the crowd. He was chosen because he is just a dead bell for a real cheater - what a cliché! But what makes no sense is that this real cheater is not in jail and is in the offense while the fake is infiltrated by a crowd in another city. Finally, there is evidence that Ladd is able to reveal enough to give orders to kingpins - including Rita. This is a case of very bad timing because in the meantime she has decided to become a decent and legitimate woman because she has met a really nice guy she wants to marry! Wow, what are the chances? Overall, this is a goofy and somewhat stupid movie that suffers from "kitchen sink syndrome" - in other words, there are too many elements of fences and strange twists to make the film less believable. In addition, since the film is just over an hour, everything seems very forced and fought. It's a pretty bad B-movie from the crap-studio PRC from the musical only for Alan Ladd's performance just before the next year at Paramount he won great fame. By the way, this DVD was released by Alpha Video --- a company that sometimes publishes some beautifully obscure titles (mostly public domain) but that NEVER clears prints or adds closed captions. In other words, the DVD production values ​​are strictly the 3rd degree ... at best.
