Being a science fiction fan that I was, I was always curious about this movie. So I was excited when I saw Journey on the Far Sun finally released on an affordable DVD (the previous print was on eBay $ 100 - I'm sure those people wished they had their money back - but more on it in for second). The prerequisite for this film (as well as the Twilight Zone "The Parallel") is that on the "other side of the Sun" is an undiscovered planet resembling the Earth. Of course, this planet is just like ours except that it is reversed. This basically means that their letters are reversed and people are on the wrong side of the road. <br /> <br /> Sound interesting? This is basically all that is for this movie. The first lesson is dedicated to preparing for a trip to this other planet. They are just boring scenes of switches that are pressed, banal dialogue, etc. There is nothing at all. Gerry Anderson managed to find most of the boring British actors in the history of cinema to play most roles. I think they're so boring. I am surprised that the crew was able to stay awake to finish the film. Anyway, once the crew has finally landed on the planet (after an endless array of astronauts who were sitting and literally sleeping in the cockpit), Roy Thinnes notices that the copy is back on the bottle of cologne and hops back to another boat to tell people what he discovered. Oops it never does when it hits the ground and dies. End! Wait, there's a bonus scene of one of the executives who throw themselves in the mirror in their trolley at the end. I think he also wanted to make this movie. I'm really surprised by the movie that could get in the 1960s. Rent if you have to. NEKUPUJ.
