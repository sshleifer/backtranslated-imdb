Some slack might be a cut of this movie because it was made in 1979. So much said, it's really pretty desperate. No matter the laughter back-projection or horrible, horrible cameras- Watching foreseen objects "in flight" are the stunts that the Concorde will knock off and which will blink you in disbelief. Barrel-rolls, loop-loops and violent "evasive" maneuvers left me wondering why Air-Force in the world not only fly Concordes as their main fighters. So here are the important lessons I learned from this celluloid cheese-fest: <br /> <br /> The Concorde is at least as agile as the Phantom 4 jet fighter. <br /> <br /> 2. You can burn your gun to Mach 2 simply by opening the cockpit window and pushing your arm out. <br /> <br /> 3. If the flame gun is not discharged, do not let it fall because it may go out. 4. The Concorde can avoid two Sidewinder rockets firing at it at the same time. 5. Flares will always disperse a rocket looking for heat. 6. Turning off jet engines is certainly a fire way to throw rockets looking for heat from a track if 5 (above) fails. 7. When conducting a crash landing in Concorde, it is obviously impossible to dispose of fuel beforehand. 8. The Concorde pilots are all fighters trained in combat. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, this film is not very realistic. Effects are primitive to today's standards and, together with the acrobatics nonsense that Concorde does, makes this film deservingly small but scornful. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Not recommended at all!
