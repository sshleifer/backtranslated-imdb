I liked most of the dialogue, I liked the cast, I thought it was good. Especially I enjoyed Ellen DeGeneres' perfect performance. What didn't work for me was: (1) a younger man outstretched (too long, too seemingly a figure for Helen) (2) seemingly endless film clich√©s, mostly visual but also endless through reading the love letter itself (its content should have a secret); (3) feminist-scholar of a young woman and ironically a scene of fireworks (no wonder it reminded me of that horrible movie How to Make an American Movie Quilt); (4) kiss "gotcha" cop who smells "dope" everywhere (no cliche there!); and (5) the impossibly romantic setting of a small town. I'd rather have a more convincing exploration of the source (or even glorification) of Helen's bitterness, including much more of the DeGeneres character in order to eliminate or reduce the various intergenerational artifacts, and to be a little less uncritical for small life city. <br /> <br /> If this game was developed as a game first, this criticism could be solved before the material was committed. this movie, which unfortunately is definitely average.
