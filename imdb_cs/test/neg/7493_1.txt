After spending half an hour exploring Rumors, a gay bar located off Tupelo, Mississippi, the SMALL TOWN GAY BAR pushes the focus on Scotty Weaver's murder at Bay Minette to demonstrate the risks faced by interviewees. But there is a problem. Bay Minette is not close to Tupelo as the film suggests. It's not even in the same state. It's actually about three hundred kilometers away in coastal Alabama. Director Malcom Ingram is not exactly rushing to draw attention to this fact, nor does he bother to mention that while the Bay Minette is a little more than a wide spot on the road, it is actually about two deep breaths away from the main Metro Area Mobile, Alabama - which has a noticeable gay community, quite a few gay bars, and even a Metropolitan Community Church rally. If Ingram is idle on these points, you have to ask if he is on the others. When I speak as someone who was born, grew up and lives in Mississippi, I have to say that I find most of the SMALL TOWN GAY BAR a lot of hooey. Neither Meridian nor Tupelo, the communities that Ingram focuses on, are as rural, small or as isolated as they could imagine, and gay bars are much more common in the state than the film suggests. This means that Ingram is steadfastly ignoring the fact that the absence of a gay bar does not mean the absence of a gay community, thus demonstrating a rather profound ignorance of the southern culture, which tends to hold those who often bargain - be they gay or equal - with low respect. SMALL CITY GAY BAR is, in my opinion, an instance in which the filmmaker came to his theme with a personal program in his hand and then proceeded to the agenda. Do gays and lesbians living in rural Mississippi have big, sometimes frightening challenges? You bet they'll do it - but that's not an excuse for us to deal with reality to the point. The DVD contains a commentary track and a series of deleted scenes, but I found that the feature film was so ridiculous that I didn't waste time on it. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
