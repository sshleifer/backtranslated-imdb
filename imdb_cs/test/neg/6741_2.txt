I've been watching a lot of TV over the years. So much that when I start seeing new shows that basically look like a repetition of old shows, I'm offended. Fortunately, I'm not very sensitive, because all the "Hot Properties" are cast updates (which means they're sexier) "Designing Women" and drop them in New York instead of Georgia. Jokes are more TV-14-ish, but it's not a better show. The only thing this show has proven is that Nicole Sullivan is so good that she could make a show like "My Mother Car" classic. Her comic talents resemble modern day Lucille Ball - just fun. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is flashy and sexy, which might be good for some brainless soap, but just not funny. <br /> <br /> Fred
