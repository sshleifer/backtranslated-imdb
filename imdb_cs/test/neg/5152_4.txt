The story of the bride's fair is fun and engaging, and it is thanks to the filmmaker that he sets out to portray rural minnesotans with the same respect that is usually reserved for coastal residents. However, it is strange to find an independent film, one person's spiritual idea, which is just as ambitious and a clich√© as the Hollywood potboiler that is brewed in the committee. The portrait of rural people is meant to be loving, I think, but I do not like these characters - I had enough small meals in small towns, but I have never heard a debate about the merits of various English writers of the nineteenth century. You could say that writer / director Semans has no experience of rural culture than Coen brothers, and a much less satirical verve.
