Detective Sergent Vince De Carlo (James Luisi) and the company are on the evil Serial Killer / Rapist case. Can the psychologist Carol (Susan Sullivan) help or become the next victim of the killer? And what is the funny White Dude Afro with the killer? Inspired by the case of Ted Bundy's serial killer, "Killer's Delight" aka "The Dark Ride" is a rather boring story of the Serial Killer from 1978, which doesn't offer much. If anything, it is more of a police procedural swing than a horror movie because most of the violence takes place outside the camera. Sure, we'll get mutilated bodies, but we won't get a lot of things in the Exploitation Department - especially given that they are consequences, not during crime. Those who hope they like "The Toolbox Murders" or "Maniac" will be very disappointed. Fortunately, there is an impressive scene involving a woman trying to escape a murderer who is right and quite exciting. Also John Karlen is quite effective as a killer, although his cheerful hairstyle (white guys with Afros always worth laughing) is more than a little distracting. "The Dark Ride" is too routine and mediocre to really justify referrals because it lacks the right elements of exploitation and is even dated by the standards of that time. Those looking for a better example should turn to "Don't Go In The House" and a few more because they just don't cut it.
