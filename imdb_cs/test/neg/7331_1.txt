Simply put, these are all syndicated episodes and NO the original unmanaged / unmodified NBC episodes. This is not a complete first season, all the eps are modified to match 21:00 for syndication, which means that jokes are cut, other commercial fade are included, all intro Harvey Korman here are not ... very bad! Shame on the series I was waiting for ... booooooooooooooooooo! If you're a real hard mom fan, don't buy it and go to http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/main/help/whv/customer_service.jsp and send them comments on why we're unhappy with this butcher's classic sitcom job !
