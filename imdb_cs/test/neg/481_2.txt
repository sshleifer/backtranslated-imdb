It's so fake! The plot appears to be a general adaptation of the average blaxploitization film. Common blaxploitation themes such as racism, oppression and the struggle for the integrity of your community are outlined in a simplified manner. And the jokes aren't funny! Dolemite these build monologue comedy routines that are really painful. All the people around him bring this canned laughter. Even the soundtrack sounds like it works. For a much better blaxploitation comedy, try "Coffy" and "Friday Foster" with Pam Grier. For a more realistic blax experience try "Black Heat".
