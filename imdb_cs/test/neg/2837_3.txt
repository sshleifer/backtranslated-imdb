Brian? what the hell are you * when you did it? I saw it recently at the festival, and it was welcomed when I laughed. By the time the credits were rolling, tears ran down the faces of many viewers. The plot is clumsy by the combination of "E.R." and "Files X"; how cynically he was aiming at a television audience, how to get out without being sued. Sequences involving kidnappings are merry - as Yuzna is a 'floating out of bed' and 'Screaming Mad George's poor plastic extraterrestrials dragged a whirlwind in disbelief, derisive laughter. Limp, camp and stupid. My only hope is that it was aberration - as bad as 'The Return of the Living Dead 3' was good. <br /> <br /> Steev
