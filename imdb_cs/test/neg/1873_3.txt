It's not a good movie by standards. It's very badly written and the acting is just a little over the par (some performances are far below the par, but Swayze and Gray are doing a very good job with a little work). What was good: <br /> <br /> The dance sequences were very choreographic and, as mentioned above, Swayze and Gray were the highest points. <br /> <br /> Bad: <br /> <br /> Script. "Bad" guys were just too bad to be believable. The best villains are those who aren't so evil. These guys (the nephew of the owner, the waiter who impregnates the girl) say nothing that would make me believe they could be real people (maybe there are guys like them, but I don't want to see a movie about him). Another scene, the first one where Gray and Swayze meet when the staff at the resort dances. Swayze and Gray dance together and seem to be having fun. The next time they meet, Swayze is hostile to her. Why? What happened to not like him so they danced well? And some of those lines, I mean COME ON (at the end I crouched when Swayze muttered the line "No one makes a child How did it with a straight face.] <br /> <br /> Next thing It's bad, set up in the sixties. Everyone looked and dressed like the 1980s! Who was in charge of costumes and hairstyles? <br /> <br /> Music (original music for the movie) was ridiculous (except "I had my time life ", which was a good song). <br /> <br /> It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but DEFINITEL's most appreciated
