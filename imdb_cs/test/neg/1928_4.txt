.. that separate good, unforgettable movies from movies like this. It's not fun, touching, funny, interesting and sometimes feels a little sub-human. The principle behaves as if it were other-secular, worse ways to be in relation to each other and to the audience. It starts pretty conventional. A rich child gets a new car for graduation, but the dean says he can't have a car after the ceremony. However, he rides joyfully on horseback and stops in the dining room on the wrong side of the dormitory to argue quickly with local yokely. Wise-asses waitress / yokel head girlfriend. Shocking that they play chicken until they accidentally burn out the dinner they left three minutes earlier (aren't all guests five feet from the gas station?). They said they had to pay the price in court The only reason to get this "fish out of the water" into town is to create a scenario that both boys have to help rebuild the restaurant. Worse than that, a rich child stay in the family of an un-rich child .. in the room above the attic. The "room above the attic" has saved many people who need a bed. A rich child inexplicably handles a girlfriend who never mentioned him that he almost killed her. This, of course, does not mean anything good with your friend, and is never fully explained. You don't know why Sam (Leelee Sobieski) falls on Kelley (Chris Klein) or why Jasper (Josh Hartnett) allows it. Chris Klein is tolerable, Leelee is absolutely unbearable and Josh is not very impressed. The greatest life character is a judge who trusts Kelley and Jasper to help rebuild the restaurant. He gets at least one funny comment that is more than anyone else. Everyone is so annoying and humorless that you will feel a little sill if you even think you're smiling. The end is one way to end the piece, not the most original, but at least it was over. I don't like the movie that any little girl in the world can really love, but because I'm not one, I have to. The nicest thing I can say about this film is that it's not extraordinarily lively, and while it doesn't force it, its innocence and home-spun, the engaging dialogue comes from a nice place. 4/10.
