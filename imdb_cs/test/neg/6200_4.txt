I was really focused on watching two of the best film critics call this movie a "laughter rebellion". But the film turned out to be disappointing. You will be warned to watch this movie and keep your brain at home, but you simply cannot ignore deficiencies and flaws. 1. The rocket scene was utter stupidity. 2. Katrina Kaif and Govinda Couple looked terrible. (He is 49 and it's only 24 ... more than twice her age) 3. Salman's comedy is less gaming and more revised. 4. The songs are good, but they break the pace of the movie. 5. Some scenes were intentionally attempted by filmmakers to be funny, and 6. Bad and wrong story. However there are several pluses - 1. Govinda. Great individual performance. 2. Some scenes are actually pretty funny. 3. Kattrina Kaif. Appearances and acting are constantly improving with every film. 4. Rajpal's Yadava Don Sequence. Though under-utilized but cheerful. <br /> <br /> So 4 good points, 6 bad .. it gets 4/10.
