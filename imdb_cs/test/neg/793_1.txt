The first time I felt I needed to write a review. I've seen thousands of movies in my life and I like a wide range of movies. I am reasonably open minded, and it can be easily said that I enjoyed the movie while still saying "yeah it wasn't good but I enjoyed it". I can appreciate the mastery of great movies such as shun shank redemption, godfather and American history X. I can like good movies in the genre like horror or comedy, although the film may not be so great. I can even enjoy a bad movie that I enjoy having fun (Bloodsport). I will also try to evaluate the film fairly, even though I didn't like it. Charlie Chapin's Light City wasn't a movie I enjoyed, but I can appreciate playing games and stories over time. I think some people, when they go to this page instead of accidentally clicking on a review, take some ideas into account. Try to rate the film based on how it actually was. Do not let your personal bias influence the ratings. Also check out the other moves you've rated and compare the movie you're about to rate. This "movie" was the worst piece of waste I've ever seen. 2 hours of my life where I stole them. The whole deal was terrible. Scenes where it is choppy at best. But the story was a real shame. In fact, for the first 20 minutes we had a story that tried to make sense and take the viewer from point A to point B. But after that it was a nightmare. They tried to add new elements, but nothing was explained. Nothing really made sense, he was a dead shooter, he was alive, hit with light, it was really lighting, it was aliens, he was an alien, etc. The end didn't connect anything together and really didn't answer any questions. The only positive thing was that no one cared where we were leaving the theater. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 ??? What's wrong with any of you? I admit that 8 of us, where we are so crazy that we saw it, we thought, "what would it improve?", And we decide to tell a few of our friends that this movie was good, so they would have to suffer and see this movie. What can I say misery loves society. That's really the only reason I see a rating of 6.5. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your life!
