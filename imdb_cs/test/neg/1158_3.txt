Michael Feifer writes and conducts this fictional story based on Edward Gein's arrest in Plainfield, Wisconsin. Gein was responsible for the rash of horrific murders that sent a shock wave of horror over his rural hometown in the late 1950s. His evil mind and twisted world is suspected to be caused by his savvy zealous Lutheran mother. Ed got the nickname "Butcher Plainfield". He liquidated the corpses of the fresh graves of women who resembled his mother, and he would have sex with them before he dressed them in his garage like a deer. Separate heads with bodies hanging upside down are his personal mark. After his arrest, many human skin items were found in his house. In this film, Young Representative Bobby Mason (Shawn Hoffman) makes a search for Gein (Kane Hodder) personal when his warehouse worker mother (Priscilla Barnes) disappears. Acting is much better than the ridiculous liberal narration of documented events concerning Geina. Also in cast: Adrienne Frantz, Timothy Oman, John Burke, Michael Berryman and Amy Lyndon.
