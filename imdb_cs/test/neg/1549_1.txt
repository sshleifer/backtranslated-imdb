For a moment it seemed that this show was on 24/7. Apparently there was a second season or some other kind of sequel to this terrible show about the two most vapid and pretentious people who were ever filmed. All other comments perfectly captured the essence of these two selfish, haggish, airheads. There's nothing more to say about what everyone else said about them. I doubt these two ladies have souls, and more than likely they have made some kind of Faustian Bargain to get their lizard-like snouts TV series. May the fates protect the human race from any exposure to Gastly Girls!
