Movie Title - Tart <br /> Revision Date - 26/26/02 <br /> <br /> Movie Year - 2001 <br /> <br /> Stars - Dominique Swain, Brad Renfro, Bijou Phillips (barely), Melanie Griffith (barely) <br /> <br /> NeCRo rating - 4 skulls from 10 <br /> <br /> Can contain spoilers <br /> Plot <br / "<br "Outcast" Dominique Swain wants to be with the "in" group, so she leaves her real friends and joins them ....... a lot of annoying rich people talking. I think I got what I wanted in that Dominique was fine, but the man, the rest of the cast except maybe Brad Renfro was bad or at least not interesting or likable at all.I know some might say that others were good because they forced me to hate .... believe me .... I like unlikable chars but this group is unlikable because they can't be convincingly bad people. <br /> <Br /> It follows that the only other people I gave it were barely in That is Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips, but the little time they had was fine. Melanie spoke maybe 2 lines, but at least Bijou had a good character, though small. Violence and Gore <br /> <br /> My mind was constantly under attack from a terrifying dialogue and very unpleasant characters, that's enough violence! ok there was one bludgeoning with rock that was fine. T&A Nudity Factor hahaha couldn't even add any nudity to help try this movie, probably because no one would want to carry their body for this crap. If they are going to expose themselves, they should do it in a movie where they will be remembered as their character and not for "oh hey, I hear it gets naked in this." <br /> <br /> Overall view of the movie (review) <br /> <br /> ok ok I know I'm proud to be the person who can like most movies or not, or at least find something good in it. Well this movie is one of the few that I really tried to find something worth it in. The problem with this movie is that it's so damn unpleasant. I already have a deep hatred of the snobbish attitudes of rich people, and it didn't help. This movie is really, it's just a bunch of rich people sitting around acting and being stupid. I cannot emphasize the harassment factor enough. This film tries to rehash tried and true "in the group" conspiracy that can usually do ok with little difficulty. Why don't I have a pic from a movie or box cover? I felt that this movie didn't deserve the fame, so I decided that, because I rented it, I decided it was nothing but Dominique Swain. Yes, I was also excited about Lolita and I thought he was so good that I decided to check her in every movie she performed. At least I keep my promises and yes, I saw most of her films, minus a few hard to reach. She is a great actress herself and I would actively defend her, but one chooses some of the most beautiful movies she could join. This film and smokers are both in the same boat, but at least the smokers had a great story idea and even some real good scenes. Also, the dvd box is trying to deceive you to think that this movie also has stars in it, by Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips names on the front of the box. If there is one thing that P **** s me off is this movie that plaster the stars names on the box to make you think "wow it has ____ i wonder how good ___ is this one i saw ___ in it The film and thought was great! Just to have big names in the movie for 10 minutes between the 2nd Bijou actually had a part that meant something.Melanie on the other hand, she just has 2 lines of .... I'm sorry, Melanie, that much, But it's about ethics and not star gaming. <br /> <br /> Of all these messes, props have to go to Brad Renfro for being turned with performance along with Dominique .Brad can be one very confused kid in real The only reason this movie gets skulls is because I got what I basically wanted, which was Dominique Swain and Brad Renfro, and I was more pleased to see the underrated Bijou Phillips, to love her even more when i was upset all the time i still came up with some positive though it was pretty hard this time. <br /> <br /> I encourage you to see only if you have seen Lolita and know how good Dominique is or if you are a favored fan of Brad or Bijou. Uber Melanie fans will be very depressed. Also, if you are a fan of lousy movies like me, don't assume that this is a guilty pleasure because you will feel guilty in order for the money spent on buying or renting. Some movies are so bad they're good, as they say. What they forgot to add was "so bad they're good (go up)". NeCRo
