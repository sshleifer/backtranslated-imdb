!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> With the exception of TERMINATOR and TOTAL RECALL, I don't think Arnie's action / adventure movies are too much. They are better than his comedy, but it hardly says much. The problem I have with all of his action blockbusters is that they are exaggerated and lack any kind of morality <br /> <br /> Morale? In my review of TERMINATOR 2 I mentioned a scene where a good guy Terminator blows his knees from the SWAT team. Can we think that because the hero is defeating people who are doing their jobs instead of killing them, will we somehow admire him? This is a problem with ERASER when James Cann's character is revealed as a traitor in Arnie's US Marshal's Department John Kruger goes on the run with a witness who protects, but in several later sequences Kruger kills a fairly large number of marshals working with a villain. Are we taking all the traitors too? Many of them were certainly sincere men who tried to stop Kruger because the evil man told them that Kruger was a traitor? It's a somewhat unpleasant thought that Kruger killed several people who tried to honestly follow the law <br /> <br /> Despite the cost of a hundred million dollars, the special effects are not so impressive. Take a look at the scene where Kruger releases the wing and pulls on the parachute. It's obvious how a stunt is doing a free fall sequence while Arnie is in the studio in front of a blue screen. ERASER is also a movie that has unnecessary CGI featuring killer alligators, not just unnecessary CGI, but unconvincing CGI too. There are also several holes like in the opening scene involving a few people witness protection that the crowd has caught up. Kruger opens the trunk of the car and pulls out a few bodies and starts the fire, throwing the scent of the crowd. The kruger is then seen rearranging dental records through the computer of the couple he is stored. Would it be logical to do this, but all pairs of dental records should be kept on the computer? Most important of all, we believe that the US Marshal Department is holding a freezer full of bodies for such events? So you go, the typical Arnie thriller long for unlikely pieces and short intelligence, and it's interesting to note that ERASER didn't make a big profit at the box office because the production cost was almost equal to the potential audience. After ERASER Arnie didn't do much more at the box office than TERMINATOR 3: THE RISK OF MACHINES, which was a film of events and it would be interesting to see if he would remember politics rather than a movie star.
