Jack Bender's "The Tempest" is an adaptation of Shakespeare's play "The Tempest". Bender transports the storyline from medieval Italy to Mississippi during the American Civil War. Includes the problem of slavery and the role of revenge in wartime. Prospero, nicknamed Gideon Prosper, is not Duke of Milan but owner of land in Mississippi. She learns voodoo magic from female slave Mambo Azaleigh. He will save his son Ariel, who accompanies him to his exile. The island is not at sea, but in a swamp near the shores of Mississippi. There is an alligator hunter, the so-called "Gator-Man", who later tries to rape Prosper's daughter Miranda. During the Civil War, Ariel wants to join the Union's troops to help fight slavery. Prospero doesn't care about the war. He is only interested in his personal revenge on his brother Antony. When Antony and his accountant Willi Gonzo (Gonzalo) try to cross the river, Prospero raises a storm. Union soldier Frederick gets lost in the swamp and eventually comes to the island. He and Miranda fall in love, but Prospero won't accept it. Meanwhile, Ariel turned into a Prosper raven, and found that Antony outperformed the Union, but planned to betray them. Antony and Gonzo meet Gator Man in the swamp and conspire with him against Prosper. They kidnap Miranda and Ariel but Prospero freezes them and helps the Union defeat the southern army. Finally, Ariel is unmarried, Frederick and Miranda will have to marry, Prospero will return to the plantation and Gator Man will return to the island. Peter Fonda is powerfully and convincingly Gideon Prosper, while Antony's character remains firmly flat. It was not a bad idea to perform a Tempest against the backdrop of civil war, but perhaps the director risked too much. In some parts, the story seems to be constructed or comical. For example, the Gator Man does not appear without any explanation. Being kidnapped to bring Prosper to his mind and losing confidence in his power shows that Bender was trying to make Prosper more human, but only made him a weak old man without his magic. The original authority and wisdom of Prosper is not clear. <br /> <br /> ------------- End of Part 1 --------------- ----------- -
