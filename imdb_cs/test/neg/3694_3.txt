I like 50s sci-fi movies a lot. I like the really good ones (for example, the Day the Earth stopped when the Worlds of the World, Invasion of Body Scraps and many others) and sometimes the really bad ones because they can be really funny and great to watch with friends (eg as a plan 9 from space). However, when the science fiction film is bad, but not bad enough to be fun, it should really be avoided. This movie is just such a movie. The posters show that some beasts are attacking mankind while the real storyline is much less interesting. The woman is married to a woman. It is contaminated and begins to grow to a huge size and decides to watch this worm and dig its tail and that's about it. Also, many of the special effects really stink - especially the gigantic paper stuff that comes into the room to catch the evil husband.
