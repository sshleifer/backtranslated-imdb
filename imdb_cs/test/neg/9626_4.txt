Wow, what exciting visual effects. I also loved the costumes and works of art, the circus and the ethereal feeling of the film was noble. It only required the viewer to take care of the fate of our protagonist. As trapped in her imagination, unlike David Lynch's films that haunt every time, there is never any sense of danger. It also draws attention to which age group this film focuses on. Who would be interested? The mirror mask will probably draw a comparison with a labyrinth with the theme of teen-angst / fantasy, but unfortunately it's not as close to bringing the same essence to Henson. The theme of a sick mother is never fully explained, and certainly not something that matters to you in lapping your eye candy. - Fantasy.
