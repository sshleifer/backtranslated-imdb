I went to see "Passion of Mind" because I usually get a kick from the genre of alternative realistic novels, ie "Sliding Door", "I, Me, Me" etc. <br /> <br /> was the worst I've ever seen! I had to get myself to sit down. I didn't even stay in what I didn't experience for me. Magical realism was completely missing because Demi Moore was grim, and lovers who were two timing were boys who usually play villains, although everyone was sexy and appealing. In fact, there was a psychological explanation for dual life, with the disgusting friss of Elektra; Maybe magic shouldn't be explained to make this genre work. <br /> <br /> (originally written 28/28/2000)
