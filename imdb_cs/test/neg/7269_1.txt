This movie is terrible. At first I thought it might appeal to the children because of the cunning Ewoks, the furious anger of the Star Wars. After going through this film monstrosity, I'm sure that even the 4-year-old wouldn't consider this film interesting. Special effects are by far the best of this film and are well compared with other films from the 1980s. The script is bad, the actors, especially Aubree Miller and the incredibly bad and the movie is so predictable that I still can't believe I couldn't touch the buttons forward on my video. But I got closer to turning this mess more than once.
