Well, this movie wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I expected to give her one star. I decided to give it three. Why? Well, it's not that bad for that horrible horror / sci-fi movie. Of course, the characters are cheap (as well as their acting - including the young Leonardo DiCapria), the effects that are cheap, and the monsters ... well let's say I've seen some more effective Halloween costumes in elementary schools ... But there was something about This movie, which made me watch it to the end. He helped me a little bit of humor. And if you ever wanted to see a stranger go through the gas, this movie will allow you to live your dream. 3/10
