This is a movie about people who get a love letter. No one knows who sent and no one knows who it is. Good cast, led by Kate Capshaw, Tom Selleck and Ellen DeGeneres. But this is a lengthy conspiracy. As an example, Capshaw's character, one of the leading citizens of a small town in New England, occupies an immature college student who works in her bookstore during the summer. He chooses it instead of Tom Selleck, a city firefighter who is crazy about her. If it's not the epitome of stupidity, I don't know what it is. Just an example of how this film is dopey. Watching Yoga Kate Capshaw is a pleasure, but you immediately realize that she has never run a day in her life. Another apparently dopey part of the film dopey.
