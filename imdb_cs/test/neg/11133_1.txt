This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The film cover is better than the film itself. My girlfriend and I saw it last weekend, and we just watched it in the hope that it would be better ... it wasn't ... <br /> <br /> Image quality is bad; It looks like it was taken on video and transferred to a movie. Lighting is not great, making it difficult to read actor facial expressions. The act itself was shabby, but I think it's acceptable for "yet another" movie horror. The sound was a huge problem: sometimes you have to rewind the video because the sound is unclear and / or subdued. <br /> <br /> He has no merit of his own; trying to ride "Sleepy Hollow" coats. Don't bother with this.
