The end of the days begins pretty well, Arnie plays down and out of the cop (very similar to Riggs in a deadly weapon) and the story looks like a kind of serial thriller action thriller that will be fun. Unfortunately he can't deliver it, Arnie is as good as we expected, but as far as Gabriel Byrn is concerned, I expect him to choose his roles more carefully than this. cast as a devil; this is probably the weakest depiction of the Lord of Darkness ever. This movie gets a little too stupid for me, and the end of the sequence, except for the very weak, is visually one of the worst I 've seen in recent years, CGI is better than this since the early nineties. Quite simply, it's not good enough. 4/10 (Watch if you also have, but don't expect too much because it won't deliver)
