Just rent this movie if you're in the mood for laughter (for total stupidity) because this movie wouldn't scare a lot of kindergartners for a Halloween party! The problem is that there are too many gore for kiddies, so they definitely don't give it to the VCR for toddlers. It starts with a little promise, giving you the impression that a boxed artist could actually start watching this movie before designing the cover, but then dropping rapidly into epic stupidity. "Scarecrow killers" are clumsy oafs who are about as scary as the one in The Wizard of Oz, but not so smart. If only they had a brain ...? I have this movie for $ 1.20 at a local discount / close-out store, so I felt somewhat torn. I think with all the other comments here, if you really pay to see, you can just blame yourself.
