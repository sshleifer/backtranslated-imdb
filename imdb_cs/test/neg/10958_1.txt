New rule. No one is allowed to make other zombie movies unless they actually find an original idea. Unfortunately this movie is not. They have the assumption that Bounty hunters go out and kill the zombies and prove by cutting off their toes. Well, problems with that. Most people have ten fingers, why not just collect ten rewards for one Zombie? Why not just kill an ordinary person and pass it as a Zombie finger? <br /> <br /> Not to mention the absolute stupidity of hunting zombies with a rifle rifle.

Do you think someone goes to a drama school or school where he plays in Zombie? "I went to art school. Look at me as" Tunnel Zombie "in" Quick and the Undead. " His mother must be so proud. You must have always been the wisest zombie, because a whole group of people seemed unable to push a wooden door or even break a glass window. No, they had to wait for the bounty hunter to open the door for them.
