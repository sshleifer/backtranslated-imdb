This film was shot in my hometown and was familiar with many "actors" in smaller roles. Most of them were students at the local karate school and even when they were filmed, we all knew what it was. But it was interesting to see how it was done. Most of the places where it was filmed no longer exist, such as a nightclub, pizzeria, etc. The "World Premiere" was held at the Akron Civic Theater and we all laughed hysterically as it was. I personally believe it is the worst movie ever made, but it will bring me a lot of memories. Watch this movie with advice ... enjoy what it is .. very low budget, poorly done, karate flick.
