I didn't even watch the whole movie. Now I like 50 sci-fi movies, even though they're wildly inaccurate, but this upset me. One of the crewmembers on the spacecraft speaks and acts as if they were in tenth grade. It sounds like he should be in a bowling league, not a spacecraft. From the spacecraft's window, the crew admires on Earth, and this breast says, "See Brooklyn?" and another guy says, "Sure". And the breast says 'Gee, I wonder who's pitching?' Excuse me a minute, I think my parties are sharing. <br /> <br /> When they get into orbit for the first time, breasts say, "The moon is just a sight!" Take me back! Watching as the crew stretched their mouths and shouted from the G-forces of acceleration during takeoff is also not one of the better moments of the film. (Perhaps the best moment of the film can be identified by the big "END" on the screen.) <br /> <br /> We also found that they could not open the hatch because they had erased the "breast" before it took off. Sure, the space vehicle will be "lubricated" by a crew member who will later learn that he has never had a space suit and knows nothing about zero gravity. How Baby Huey Overgrown Fat Cartoon Duck Once said: "That sounds logical!" The effects without gravity in the universe are so bad that it is painful to watch. (Everyone knows, in the absence of gravity, everything tends to go up.) <br /> <br /> As this movie gets 6.3 stars out of 10, when other much better movies don't rate any higher, it's a mystery to me. I really like old science fiction movies, but this is not realistic, and humble attempts at character humor by throwing gas stations into the boom from a gas station do not work at all - it just destroys the film. I think in retrospect it's not the whole movie that I hate so much that the "breast" is so obviously not someone who would be on a spacecraft - nor "delete the hatch". FOR GOD. I wonder if he also checked the fan bands. Maybe if they left the trip, it might not be so unbearable. Still, it's just the average. I don't know what everyone else is scared of. <br /> <br /> Want to watch a neat 1950s movie? 'Rocketship X-M' beats it all to hell. Maybe not so much "realism," but a more serious story and less crazy characters.
