I loved blood and blood. The kind of violence is what Alien and Predator films are all about, no one is spared. This really answers the question of how it would be if they were aliens on Earth. The answer is simple. We're uploaded. The effects were beautiful. How sometimes some real problems are encountered. 1) Acting was horrible on the side of the human character that almost slept with me because it was so dry and boring that it really interrupted the flow of the film and was very annoying. Writers could make SOOOOOOO much better. The good part was Alien and Predator acting, which I thought was largely doing very well. 2) The size of the Predator was much smaller than in the first AvP movie. I scratched my head for <br /> <br /> 3) Predators have their mask while still in the boat. This upset man and I can't understand why. It's not a hole like most people to be. I tell you, people calm hell. It's no big deal. If you feel better, remember that they have a hugger on the face to get bored in the store, so it could be a good reason. 4) The Predator fired his plasma wheel inside the ship. I thought it was somewhat stupid for the Predators section. But then I started to wonder if it was the younger predator who panicked. 5) The hunter and his son almost immediately arrive at the crash site after falling a few miles away. At least they were not bored by showing them running through the forest for 30 minutes. so be happy. Why did only one predator go? I thought it was strange. But then I thought it was because he thought it was just one Predalien with whom he acted and not with a focus. 7) Why did the Predators destroy the ship nondestructively? If people were looking out for one, but he was killed before he could fully activate it. <br /> <br /> 8) Unlimited blue melting. I thought it was somewhat stupid. 9) The predator hides evidence with goo, but the skin of a cop. It was also stupid. <br /> <br /> 10) Black. Well come to the people, Alien and before they fought at the power plant. 11) Predalien is half face to face / queen. That really tore me off. I'm a Alien fanatic and Pred. I know extraterrestrials DO NOT USE THAT! Just like they do not give birth as a person doing like they showed up in Alien4! Of all comics, games, books, and movies 1,2 and 3, CLEARLY shows their behavior. They need a queen to lay eggs, eggs hatch in the face of a hugger, an infectious host face to face, a parasite jumps up and kills a host, and grows up in a drone if it infects a human, predalined with a predator and runner with any kind of quadruped animal. And then, after they lived years and years, then they plunged into the Preatorian (the mini queen who does not fold eggs) and I can go on, but I'm used to it. But the scene itself almost destroyed the film. If the directors are smart, they come back and adjust it by creating a hugger face infecting pregnant women. Any way, if you are going to see this movie, go to Aliens and Predators. And when the scene appears, where Predalin infects pregnant women ... Close your eyes so you don't have to see the insult of the universe Alien and Pred.
