After the book I was very sad when I watched the movie. I agree that sometimes the film should be different from the original novel, but in this case it was more than acceptable. Some examples: <br /> <br /> 1) Why ranks differ (eg Lt. Diestl instead of Sergeant etc.) <br /> <br /> 2) The last screen is very bad and makes Diestl a soldier he stands and wants to die. But 100% is not true. Just read the book. In the last seconds he was also a bull dog. He didn't want to die by shattering the gun and going simply to Michael and Noah. So this is a happy ending that doesn't fit this movie at all.
