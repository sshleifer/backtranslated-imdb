Ahh, nuthin 'like cheesy, exploitative, semi-porn, masquerade like horror ... This stars Jaqueline Lovell (sometimes Sara St. James), nubile starlet also seen in "Femalien", "Erotic House of Wax", and that favorite "Nude Bowling Party". He is currently part of the Surrender Cinema program, which consists of no talent who play in senseless films that use soft-porn. The "head of the family" is actually trying to be a real moovie. Husband and hiker trying to get the husband off the hiker away. They turn to the big evil genius in a wheelchair and his family of moronic misfits who use mind control to send zombies to make their shameful offers. Said-genius has a giant head, hence the clever title of the film: that is about the range of film humor. But basically it's an excuse to show enough of Lovell and Dianne Colazzo (Ernestine). Stuck with some of the nicest dialogs can be a herd (what the heck is "plowing oats", anycow ??), and simply plain stupid, this titular thriller will be as appealing to breast-cownters Drive-In Theater, but not more. MooCow says he must avoid if you are not looking for rent on cheesy T&A / horror night. : = 8P
