Although this movie had a lot of praise, I personally bore it. There are some nice brasilian sunsets and characters are believable, but the story of how they intertwine, though very unusual with our standards, is not interesting enough to keep the movie so long. The central woman takes one man after another in the tight knit path and the first interests of her children. As the tolerance of different men stretches, we see how their characters evolve. The story unfolds with dignity and promotes excellent behavior. It is a unique view of the Brasilian hinterland, far from the city, but barely exciting to keep its eyes open.
