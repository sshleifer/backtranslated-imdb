OK the end of the story is - all the murders were a joke to the main character and no one is actually dead. Yes, I know Cry Wolf did it well, but this isn't "Cry Wolf", it's "Scream Crap"! Although "characters" are not likely to die, we will see that they kill them (and other ways to kill them), even if these "killings" do not take place as seen. Director, if you want to show that people are killing, somebody has to see it if they're out of camera and the character who killed them doesn't work by itself - and I liked a couple of scenes to the end but your end destroyed the whole thing. Acting is horrible (especially the child at the beginning who really thinks he made his friends believe that they play with the brains of dead grandmothers). than half baked (though if you are half baked, you can enjoy the movie) the only reason I gave this movie is 3 because a) actually did something b) got it and c) shot the movie yes you read right, they unnecessarily (at least) $ 5,000 at the film store for this crap. Sadly, if they shot the DV, they had some money for a better cast and another writer who went through the script and did it well. I admire that the director did something (like most not) but HATWE the fact that he comes to the IMDFB talks about how "original" the movie is. <br /> <br /> Avoid the movie if it means buying it to see it if a friend has it, it can be a fun movie to borrow.
