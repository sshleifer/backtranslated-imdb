I saw this at Sundance and I can't figure out why he won the director's award. It was painfully slow and literally colorless. It is a type of film that will only be appreciated by film snobs who think there must be many people beneath them. The jury at this year's Sundance Festival seemed to be making a conscious effort. reward low budget movies. That's all right and well, but this wandering, dragging mess looks like a home movie. The mini-DV image in snowy gray winter snow results in a dull look at the drab film. Some motifs (snakes) are defeated to death despite the fact that they add nothing to the story and make no sense as symbols. Now it was nothing wrong. Vera Farmiga is phenomenal in her role as a mother with a drug problem. He will go to places and deserve it. Her star Hugh Dillon also does a great job. Frankly, there are a lot of great moments in this movie, but it doesn't fit well.
