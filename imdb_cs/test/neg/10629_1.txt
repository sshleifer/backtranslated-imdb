I rented this movie because it is supposed to take place in a jazz club - you know the modern and cool places you can come across on Saturday night. There's not an ounce of cool in this absurd movie. The score is goofy, the original songs are terrible, the singing of both leading actors is constantly off-key (being kind) and unprofessional at best, the plot is no more complicated than "boy meets girl", acting is ridiculous and the only decent movie moments are footage scenes. Jazz club scenes are characterized by sophisticated dialogue, which is overwhelmed by too busy organ music. This Joey de Francesco should keep his job (unless his daily work helps with the film's results). Is it possible not only to return my four dollars but also my therapy session? Interestingly, this movie is so bad you want to watch it. A little like riding a bad accident - just look at it at least once. Get ready for your ears!
