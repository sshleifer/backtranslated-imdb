The button box gives the couple the opportunity to be financially free, but the price is the life of someone they have never met. It's a very boring movie you're looking at. Richard Kelly, who wrote and directed it, decided to make a film without any payouts. You are taken to ride slow building ups, one by one with less revelation at best. At some point, I thought it would be of great importance at the end, but nothing was happening. The film just lets one think, "This story could have been spoken in 30 minutes, without all the nonsense loaded." I hope you avoid this divine film and keep your common sense.
