"Fat Girls" are among the worst movies in the indie gay genre. The assumption is promising: the average-looking gay teen is imprisoned in the repressive little town of TX. His only ghost relatives are the other HS misfits villages: a class 'fat girl', a naive immigrant from Cuba, and a sensitive drama teacher. Interesting yet. Theoretically, this plot line creates a decent setting for an attractive coming of age story with a built-in audience --- thousands of homosexuals who grew up in small towns across America and experienced this adolescent anxiety first hand, peppered with a dose of smug humor. Unfortunately, rather than a subtle dramatic act, Ash Christian approaches his autobiographical affair with a badly attempted irony and dark humor. The result is the casting of improbable, derivative, two-dimensional characters that the viewer cannot understand. Sabrina (Fink) is a quasi-goth bitter navel-gazer. He is such a prickly, unsympathetic person; There is no doubt why her condition is without friends. The chemistry between her and Rodney (Christian) registers zero. This could be a bad cast, but is more likely due to a scenario that is simply unmanageable. Consequently, one is wondering when there is such a non-existent bond that could justify their almost constant society throughout the story. The new-found friend of Sabrina, Rudy (de Jesus) and Rodney Judy's mother (Theaker) are among the most exaggerated cliché figures that have torn off dozens of other films. Rudy is a horny undersexed immigrant / nerd raised directly from each shot teen "comedy" ever made within the television or movie area. Judy is re-obsessed with Jesus-talking and big hair. Just when you thought Tammy Fay's thing was done to death, Christian puts a scene in which Judy's mascara runs with tears! Is there anybody in the civilized world who can think that this tired old stereotypical gag is still funny after seeing him for 20 years on the nauseum? In addition to unsuccessful attempts at sardonic humor, there are many mysteries of the mismatch of stories. Rodney considers himself a "ugly" loser. At the same time, however, he succeeds in taking part in occasional and regular improvised rehearsals with the ubiquitous school athlete (Tuner (Miller)). Although these nodes are devoid of emotional fulfillment, most gay homosexuals (filled with raging testosterone, as well as their hetero brothers) would find this to be a somewhat enviable arrangement given a more common alternative to captive celibacy. Rodney finds an object for his affection for Bobby (Bruening), an exotic transplant from England. Against all the credible chances that the boy not only happens to land in this little village of TX, but is gay-friendly. Like Sabrina, Bobby is an icy, angry clever alien, and the viewer is left scratching on his magnetic attraction. Much to his delight, Rodney is invited to his new crush on the city gay bar, where Bobby claims to be a DJ. Upon arrival, a friend-to-be quickly leaves Rodney Solo and heads to another area of ​​the bar for a quick encounter with a somewhat handsome young man. This is still one of the ridiculously inexplicable elements of the plot, because Rodney's feeling as an outcast is probably derived largely from his lonely existence in an urban city. As a small town, do they openly have gay students in high school? Secretly bisexual football captain? Lesbian Moms? Gay teacher? and has a gay bar in the city center (sponsored by attractive men, not less)? It seems that the place is not so distant. Ten years earlier, Todd Stephens "Edge of Seventeen" covered almost the same material with a much more creative, honest, moving and witty movie.
