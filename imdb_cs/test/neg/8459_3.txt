An insignificant and quite stupid movie, which is essentially a compilation of horror movies, sci-fi and thrilling movies. Viewers watching the clips and Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen are unnecessary shots between the audience who turn to the camera and explain why we love horror movies. It's not a bad idea, but all the explanations are obvious ("film horror helps us deal with real horror", "you're at the mercy of a filmmaker in the theater") and pretty banal. Also, clips appear very fast and changes are a bit uncomfortable. And shown from context, these pieces are not at all scary at all. And it's REAL short - I saw it in the theater in 1984 and I was outraged that I paid $ 5.00 for a 84 minute movie! Still, it's pretty well edited, and Allen and Pleasance seem to be having fun. For people who are interested in learning more about horror, it could be fun and interesting. But if you're a horror fan (like me), you'll probably get bored stupid. Good idea, bad performance (no pun). I'll give it 3.
