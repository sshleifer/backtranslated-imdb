Very sharp, very drab, no real drama. Why not make a document? This is not exactly the Passion of Jane of Arc. The only reason to see the Chronicles is to hear the performance. I love Bach's music and I even found it hard to sit in this film misery. Great Gustav Leonhardt plays (in two words of the word) Bach. We cannot consider him an actor because he is so little to do it dramatically. Mostly they walk intentionally or angrily from different rooms. Of course, Bach's life was not Errol Flynn. It was really pretty drab and more than a little hard. This probably means that life is not an amazing film candidate. Of course, music is another story. I recommend Bach Station. Much more information, for one thing, and some insight into music, which is, after all, why Bach is primarily interested in us.
