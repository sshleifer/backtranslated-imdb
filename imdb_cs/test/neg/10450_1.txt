I'm not sure where to start. From start to finish, bad, smelly bad, like to enter the port of a-john for 100 degrees. If you try to follow this as I did, keep Vicodin at hand. I will never understand how bad it does to get past the cutting room without the entire disc ending on the floor. The film is a cross between Gumby Pokey, meets the terminator, meets Wally Beaver to play cowboys and Indians without cowboys. I saw better animation in the original Blob style. You get more fun with watching Gone with the Wind while you have vomiting and poops. Poor play and hockey lines will push you and wish that you rent Peewee's Big Top or watch every episode of Gilligan's Back to Back. UGH .. I'm going to cut my wrist now.
