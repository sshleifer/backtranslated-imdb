Behind me is the reason why two million Danish people sit every week and watch this terrible show. Dialogue is terrible and not realistic. The characters are hollow and simplistic. There's a tough man, a hard woman, and a sensitive man. In fact, writers say they built characters after Greek mythology! Give me a break! Of course, all characters are great policemen. When I watched this show I longed for "District Hill Street" and "NYPD Blue". This is a brilliant show and "Rejseholdet" is a lousy copy. This program is a symptom of a disease Danish television currently suffers.
