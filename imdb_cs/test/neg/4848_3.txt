I saw the movie when I was in France and I must say that I was confused. It is a story of a jewel thief and a young singer who ends up in Morocco at the same time, strikes himself and creates a connection. Easy enough? The problem is that it is a film that has ambiguity in both chronologies (the film is not quite right) and in fact (what has just happened to happen, or was it just a dream?). Given these parameters, as well as a movie that is bilingual, it was really hard to watch and at the end I wasn't sure what happened. I imagine that some deep artsy types could better understand this film than I could, and it may require more than one display.
