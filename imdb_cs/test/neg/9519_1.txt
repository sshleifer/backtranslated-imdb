What can I say about this movie is really one of the worst gay movies ever released in the UK. I can only imagine that Diana Quick and Georgina Hale needed money. What's the story, it's such a distracted mess that you lose interest very quickly. It's supposed to be based on real life events. All I can say is that it's an insult to real life characters. The DVD is currently in the UK. It is available in either a split-screen format that needs to be even worse than watching a full screen. Gay cinema can be much better than this and deserve more.
