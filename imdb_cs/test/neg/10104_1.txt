This film is really pathetic in every conceivable separation. terrible, terrible, terrible. It is only about eighty minutes long, but believe me, you will feel like you are watching Andy Warhol's movie (then again twenty hours in the life of the imperial state building would certainly be more interesting). Where to start ... a nasty screenplay, disgusting cinematography, so bad its bad behavior, flashy effects, terrible music, or just a thin thin fence that basically resembles a sieve. This film is incoherent shambles <br /> <br /> The extraordinarily remarkable scene takes place outside the caf√© when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, a cue waitress watching the cafe window, commenting on the average English "Shit" accent. Fix that woman. God damn horrible monstrosity. <br /> <br /> All participants should be ashamed of themselves. Hopefully the director will never find the funds to work again.
