Don't look at this movie, go to something else ... I was very disappointed, I can't rate this movie better than 3. Acting was pretty good and I really liked William Dafoe as a villain, but I don't see why this movie did it on a big screen. The story was old and was shown in 100+ other movies and 1000+ TV series / movies. The main problem was basically: Nothing is happening. Take the kidnapping, let the villain bring the kidnapped man's money to make the police look stupid and boring and extend it to 95 minutes, you have your movie "Clearing". The only two reasons I did not evaluate it were a) Dafoe and b) "Plan-B-End". There are not many endings that you can give the film to the kidnapper ... 75% of this end-end type, 20% end-B, and 1% end in something unpredictable. Boring, boring, boring.
