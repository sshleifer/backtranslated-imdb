** SPOILERS ** With the name of a movie that has the name killer fish twice no once you would expect to see them in an action biting ripping action and eating almost everyone in cast characters. Instead, you have to wait until the movie is almost over to get to the Piranah. Even then, all you see is the bubbling of water and mixing around when a poor individual disappears under it, assuming there is one, whole and alive, with fish. "Piranha Piranha" begins with this scary-looking Piranha on the screen as credits begin to roll, but **** SPOILER **** is the only time in a movie you've ever seen a fish killer or fish that you will never see Piranha's movie again. What you see is the travelogue of Venezuela and the people and Venezuelan jungle along the Amazon basin. Along with a lot of nice and breathtaking landscape photos, but also people and wildlife, but that's all. There is some story that has to do with this great White Hunter Caribe, William Smith, who ironically means Piranha in his native language that speaks, that's what actually meant the title of the movie "Piranha Piranha"? "Caribe Caribe"! Caribe is played by the legendary Hollywood Hell's Angles biker and around the hard boy William Smith. At the beginning of the film, these three American tourists Jim Pendrake and his sister Terry, Peter Bown and Ahna Capri, and their American guide, Art Green, Tom Simcox, are on their way to the Venezuelan jungles to see Terry for photos to send home. Terry is terrified with weapons when we hear that a young girl has seen her father kick her out. Even when the art rescues her life using one when she sees the attack a six-foot long diamondback rattlesnake Terry almost describes him for having a gun; who promised her that she wouldn't pick him up with him on a trip. <br /> <br /> In a jungle or bar stop, the three run into Caribe, which we first saw hunting monkeys in the jungle. film. Caribe is more than welcomed by three of his jungle knowledge and his half-baked philosophy of life and death, as well as his ability to get them to where they get to the local diamond mines deep in the Amazon basin. Although it is a bit strange at first, the guy is so embarrassed that he doesn't notice people around him, Caribe appears to be a crazy and sympathetic man who deals with a long and friendly swamp race through the swamps and jungle with art. Caribe even shows Terry, who suddenly almost knocked his teeth in the film, the fine points of hunting and shooting wildlife that he thinks he really won't die, but becomes part of it after he kills them! A little crazy, but you have to admit that this guy has imagination. It's much later in the film that for some strange reason, maybe it was a cheap booze that drinks, Caribe suddenly went crazy and became a murderous assault and rape of Terry and then murdered his angry brother and fed him on the deadly Piranha. An attempt to escape from a furious madman and after he was forced to fight with him is so dirty with Carib that he is almost unconscious. Just as Caribe is going to finally kill Art, he is shot dead by Terry, who, after experiencing what this crazy nut job is, has finally decided that weapons are really needed and should be used to kill very rare but life saving opportunities. br /> <br /> It's worth watching if it's worth watching at all, just for scenery and nothing else. It's just a shame that a movie has to advertise as a killer fish or Piranha, a horror movie, if it was honest, it could be more or less average jungle adventure with Smith. playing Tarzan a Venezuelan, not an African, jungle
