All the critics of this film are completely valid! It's pretty boring and full of all ridiculous ridiculous things. A few exchange nods over "good grub". The middle of the table rings like a phone until someone finally arrives, sits down and answers at a fairly slow pace. Four times it takes or more when people look at things. Solitary banjo-tuning and playing, a beer break. He told a swimmer joke, a big mouth frog, trying to learn what to feed his children, supplemented by a number of big mouth expressions (which are needed for weak punching). Sharing cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal that becomes unpleasant in smudging when people are burned on fire. Lots of seemingly footage shots of animals, birds, insects and spiders in the forest. The film begins with a forest fire, then some people later in the country at least a few decades later. the same forests kill the ax. Obviously, the killer was not very happy with the ax he had stolen, killing other people with other weapons of opportunity or bare hands. <br /> <br /> If it is true that the movie in the version that is available on the z-print videotape is cut, maybe if there are plenty of shots that have been cut, it deserves another look at the DVD. Otherwise, it's just not very interesting, and probably try the patience of even the farthest wind fans.
