Dee Snider is a villain in this movie and his bad acting and exaggerated kind destroyed it for me. The whole movie seemed to be taken too seriously. He tries to achieve the dark atmosphere of "Seven" without good action. The film highlights the urban industrial rock / tattoo / body art "subculture" and expects to be amazed by the size of the guy's nose ring. I'm not an expert in movies, but the script and playing in this movie are just awful. Dee Snider looks like part of the villain, but his approach is downright horrible. I recommend not losing time on this if nothing else is available.
