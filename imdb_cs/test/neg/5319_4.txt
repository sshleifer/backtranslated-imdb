Peter Hunt started out as a very talented film editor and got his first point shot when he managed to shoot James Bond's "Majesty's Majesty's Secret Service" (which many Bond fans regard as the best of the series). Other titles in his filmography include epic scale adventure films like "Gold" and "Scream at the Devil", both adapted from Wilbur Smith novels. "Gulliver's Travels" is special on his list of films; It seems strange that the director of Hunt's style and expertise would make a film of this kind. Half-live action / half-animated retelling about Jonathan Swift's classic satire, the film looked outdated, even though it was made, and it just doesn't work honestly. And there is nothing that Hunt (with his usual eyesight for quick action) or Richard Harris's star (who can usually revive those most affected roles) could do to save this. Lemuel Gulliver (Richard Harris) is an outstanding 17th-century medical student in Bristol. His father (Norman Shelley) wants him to go to London to earn money; but Gulliver prefers to get less money, but hell more adventures than a ship surgeon aboard the ship called "Antelope." During the trip, 'Antelope' is thrown off course during a storm and hits the reef. The ship is dropping and everyone is lost except Gulliver. on the shore of Lilliput. When it comes around, Gulliver discovers that a strange country where he was washing ashore is filled with incredibly small people, not higher than his finger. They look like a giant to them, and they persuade Gulliver to help them in the war against another race of small people living on an adjacent island. But Gulliver does not like manipulation for war and devastation purposes, so he plans to escape. His first few scenes include other actors, but once he is shipwrecked in Lilliput, he spends the rest of the film striding on his knee sets, along with his animated counterparts. The idea of ​​mixing live action and animation at the time wasn't new, but it wasn't much. Several Disney movies like Song of the South and Dear To My Heart and Pete's Dragon manipulated this idea, but it was still almost in its infancy. "Gulliver's Travels" is not a particularly well-animated film, but scenes showing the interaction between Harris and his co-star cartoon are at least competitively done. Occasionally, the film tries to be faithful to its satirical origins (there is one scene where they learned that Lilliput went to war with her neighbor for eggs!?! - and the war seems to start over those ridiculous things). But in his heart it is a very children's film and satirical undertones hardly become part of it. Anyone involved has done better things during his career? "Gulliver's Travels" could fill an otherwise empty afternoon, but besides, it's an unforgettable and invaluable experience.
