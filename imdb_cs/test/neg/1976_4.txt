So after the initial disappointment of Final Fantasy's first movie, which seemed to be approaching no similarities with Final Fantasy: Advent Kids, they went on a warm welcome and now a dedicated fanbase. The reason for the success of the films is understandable because it has fresh graphics, fast-moving combat sequences and some cool characters. However, if you haven't played FF7 then it's likely that you won't like this movie because its story continues from the game without any explanation and your likelihood of losing out of the game even if you played. Secondly, there is no character development, without previous knowledge of the game, your views on characters are limited to "cool" and "not cool". Of course, for FF7 fans, the movie is almost guaranteed to have fun, at least for nostalgic reasons, and it's cool to see all the characters you grew up in love with the game created in some amazing computer animation. One last complaint, the film, at least in my opinion, tried to cram in less than two hours, so the last half-hour or so is in a hurry. If you've played and enjoyed FF7, it's a worthy watch, though nothing special. If you haven't played FF7 then it's best to play it before watching this movie.
