I love Ben Kingsley and Tea Leoni. However, it is easily the worst movie I've seen in 10 years, and I see my share of movies. Stinking. This is a bad idea for a movie, poorly done. Nothing is funny, plausible or interesting. I was looking for joke, irony and real humor. Instead, it seemed as though most of the cast members went to the set to make Leoni tea a favor. It's so bad that such a gaming talent was unnecessary for such emptiness. Don't bother. I have to wonder what opinion the creators of this film have on their audience to submit to the idea of ​​Polish gangsters in Buffalo, NY, who sent a contract killer to San Francisco to become a morgue assistant at AA meetings. Bill Pullman should start reading the scripts before agreeing to be in the movie. Sad.
