I jumped for joy to learn that this show was over. The characters of this show were very irritating. None of them had one singing redeeming quality. Damon Wayans is probably the most striking. Kisha Campbell is ... Kisha Campbell. She's just as annoying as she is in Martin. Children are also very uncomfortable. The oldest is an idiot, the oldest girl is a stuck brat and the youngest is frustrating to listen to. I think I liked a smart little boy. But that's about it. The world has done this a favor by quitting. Please pray that Wayan will never play in another show ... EVER.
