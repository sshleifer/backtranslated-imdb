This movie could have been much better. It is a beautiful story that takes place in very experienced times, yet it was so badly executed. Leaders in the past have done great jobs, and in this film they usually do the job. Although sometimes their dialogue seems to be affected and forced. The director could be more concise. Most criticism should go to writers who have taken a good story and made it tedious. In short, there are thousands of much better ways to spend 2 hours.
