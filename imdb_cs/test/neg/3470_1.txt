I'm sorry to disappoint someone about what I'm about to say to this TV movie. But I paid for the film and it turned out that this film is a disaster. Direction is really bad. After looking at the information here, I realized that there could be reasons for poor quality overhead and production. They may not have a budget, but Sense and Ang Lee's sensitivity had little money, but it hit a hit. In this film, the director did a really bad job in telling the story and the film could not even maintain a rational continuity in itself. She still pulls me out of the scene. Maybe someone needs to work hard on the story / board. The sound is also terribly bad. My God .... Normally, I would appreciate every movie because the ideas and ideas of the individual lie behind him. but this time I'm just angry, "I really want to hit something." ... Just don't do it unless someone can do it. Bad art (his "neither art, what is it?") Really hurt people.
