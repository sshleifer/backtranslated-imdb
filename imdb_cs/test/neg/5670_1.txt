I ... No words. No words can describe it. I'll try to make those few brave people holding knives on toasters ... after watching this show. This ... Cosgr's Man ... Her acting is like looking at a female gorilla dancing on a nest of highly upset insects. Maybe I was exaggerating. However, I feel that the description corresponds to the regular day of writing this show. The characters in this repulsive pile of raw wastewater are as useless as a small piece of space rock flying into the sun. on any day of the week. Although heart attacks have not been experienced while watching them behave like fools on cheaply built kits, I have no doubt that this will eventually happen. The main plot of this "voice" loudly in the face of an actor * is a foolish girl who hosts a live weekly web-cast on the creatively named iCarly.com with her mindless friends, one of her own equipment that manufacturers this show probably could not afford. Her legal guardian is some moron who is probably her older brother. I haven't seen all these shows out of fear of cancer development, or perhaps cold, but some points of plot I have seen include a brother stuck in an elevator, a porter's apartment almost dying, and the world's fatest priest comes to visit. No, really. Avoid it if you are over the age of the unborn or if you have a history of joining mysterious cults as a result of mental trauma. If you decide to watch it, laugh when you laugh-track tells you how it will drown the recurring noise that will eventually put you in a coma if you listen to it for too long. <br /> <br /> The show will receive one star rating because IMDb has not explained the use of negative numbers.
