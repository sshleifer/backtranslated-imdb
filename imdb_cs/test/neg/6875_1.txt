In this movie everything was wrong and I don't know why I bothered to watch it to the end. It would be much more fun to watch the colors dry. For a loud scream I liked D-Tox and it was much better. Here is a basic plot for you: Redneck gets bitten by snakes that hold the evil 13 murderers and becomes the undead killing machine of murdering teenagers who have zero personality. During the film, I lost hope when I was not scared when killing was bad and there was BAD CGI blood and CGI snakes. It was worse with the cardboard thin figures that killed their friend by keeping her from her feet and not letting her go, so she got under the tree and when the evil man moved underwater like a shark in his jaws. I'm still upset about why I bothered with it. I think I'm a horror movie fan.
