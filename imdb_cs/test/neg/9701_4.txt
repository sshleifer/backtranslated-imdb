Let's start by loving and loving miniseries A&E. I was hoping he loved this movie and was totally willing to allow him a slight degree of artistic license in interpreting and shortening the real story. But this film is hardly like the original book. If only "names were changed to protect the innocent," maybe I would enjoy the movie just as fun, if inaccurate, period piece. Unfortunately, putting the name "Mr. Darcy" on a character that is emotional and weak, giving the name "Elizabeth Bennett" to a reckless, sketchy, often tear-watched hoyden who cares about the rules of society, and do "Mr. Bingley" wide-eyed dimwit utterly destroyed the idea that the director ever read Jane Austen's original story. <br /> <br /> There are some really stunning moments in this movie - maybe 10 minutes are really great. Charlotte's explanation of why she accepted Mr Collins' proposal starts beautifully. She is 27 years old (at that time approaching the age of hopeless spinstera), becomes a burden for her family and is not romantic. He just wants a "comfortable home". However, a beautiful dialogue is destroyed when blubbers: "You judge me, Elizabeth. Don't you dare judge me!" and runs in tears. Later you see Charlotte Kowtow at Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who was not at all in her nature as described in the book. Another good moment is when Darcy catches Elizabeth in her home while she travels around the area with her aunt and uncle. It was well done in the A&E series, but the film version with Keira Knightley felt very acute to the audience, how much it must have been humiliating for Elizabeth. Very nice. The end also illustrates the degree of affection between Elizabeth and Darcy who was not seen in the miniseries. Actually, I appreciated this scene, simply because I like to see a happy ending rather than just knowing it happened. Overall, however, this film removed the subtlety that was an integral part of Austin's Pride and Prejudice. The characters speak in a hot combination of Austen's dialogue literally and modern phrases and colloquial expressions. The information mentioned or suggested in the original work is clearly stated in this version. Yes, time was worrying. It's just a short movie, yada yada. But to turn a complicated, beautiful book into a superficial love story is ridiculous. Some commented that they love the moment when Darcy sees Elizabeth for the first time because it's so obviously a case of "love at first." Love at first sight? Huh? One of the best aspects of the book is that Elizabeth is not supposed to be a traditional beauty, and Darcy loves her for her wit and liveliness ... literally "loves her for her mind". This version also had a moment (during Darcy's first suggestion) as the two of them screamed furiously while closer ... and closer ... and almost kissed ... but suddenly a step. Ugh! This is a sad clich√©. They are upset and disgusted with each other, but so attracted that it doesn't matter that (at that time) they don't even like each other? Ridiculous! The characterizations were all so distant from those described in the book that it really was like a different story. Mr. Bennet was dour, Elizabeth usually acted as stupid as her younger sisters, Charlotte was emotional, somewhat unintelligent and desperate for her home - unlike the intelligent, slightly shocking woman with the amount of common sense that is portrayed in the novel. The relationship between Jane and Elizabeth is only topical, instead of deep-rooted love and admiration that they should have for themselves. I could accept all this as mere misinterpretations of the novel, but I refused to accept everything that is in addition to many historical inaccuracies. Miss Bingley was barely dressed (the clothes looked like what others would wear as tight underwear). Elizabeth walked to Netherfield with her hair down and let it fly everywhere. The family of one morning lay on the wound, although the wound was to be reserved for calling to the familiar (or to be called in your home). Elizabeth walked barefoot outside her nightgown. And in a very scary scene, Bingley went into Jane's bedroom and talked to her (and it sounded like an idiot) when she was sick. Most people would think that these are small points, but I just wanted to either A.) a historically accurate film, or B.) an accurate representation of the characters in the novel. The director / writer / anyone has sacrificed precision, subtlety and a good story for a fabulous love story at a glance. I can admit that those who did not read the book or who are not familiar with the social conventions of that time could very easily have this film, and there is nothing wrong with it. I just couldn't overcome my desire to see a film that involved more than two pretty faces.
