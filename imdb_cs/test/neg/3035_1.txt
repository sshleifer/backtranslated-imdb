On most queues, this movie really lacks a brand. The accents are ridiculously weak, amateur actors and, at best, weak comedies. <br /> <br /> They have a great idea, it might be especially nice, but for the reasons mentioned above. It seems that the writer thinks of putting the word f * ck in every sentence, which makes him more fun and the main character seems to try a little hard. It's not a Brick top that's sure. Next time you get a cast that can keep the whole movie accent. It's a crime to compare it to movies like Shop, Lock Stock, and Snatch.
