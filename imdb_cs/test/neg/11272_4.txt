In this film, there is a free man plot (Bardem) who wishes to raise funds for his construction business, and marries a woman he does not love (wide-eyed Maria de Medieros) in the process. He keeps his passionate relationship with his first and true love and finally gets involved in his romantic web. He never gives up his juggling until the three main characters become face to face. The result of the film is boring, with lots of free sex (well, both girls are really good), all the reactions in the film are absurd, inconsistent and of course too stupid. None of the characters is believable, making the film a little uncomfortable. By the way, acting is surprisingly good for such a bad directorial movie that makes it a little interesting, but if you can, please watch another movie!
