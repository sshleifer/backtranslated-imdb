Jesus Christ, what the hell happened? This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, how it is possible that they have invented this nice idea. To tell you the truth, I was so excited for it, even though it was like a Blair witch, but with real alien creatures chasing a cameraman. Damn, I was reduced to a quick transfer of this sh * t stack and I never did it while watching movies. The high rating here on IMDb leads me to believe that real aliens give 10 pieces for this piece of crap. Invasion is about good, invasion. The film begins by saying that everything you want to see is real, blahblahblah. Then they go and tell me about a special camera system used in cars like I had to trust their bullsh * t to get this movie. The next thing you know, I see the most boring car drive I filmed, in the woods at night. Is it a movie or a ride at Disney theme park? The first 20 minutes is all a boring dialogue between cops looking at the grass and one straight road with a flashlight. Where the hell are the aliens ?! Of course they slept! Then they learned that bad behavior was not limited to high school games, because a policeman behind the camera comes out of the car to look for a missing man who was a "night hunt" and came across a mysterious meteorite. I wonder what happens to him? Out of nowhere we see a guy who walks like a zombie. The cop is probably too stupid to notice something wrong with this man. He seemed to be really stupid because the zombie / alien guy injects a foreign parasite into the police ear, turning him into a stranger. Then the cop / stranger returns to his car, looking for a young couple who had sex in their backs in the woods, gets to them, turns a man into a stranger, and then the girl runs to the police car and escapes. If this quick introduction to the game didn't make it into the head that this movie was wrong, then the next 40 minutes will be. Watching this movie is as painful as stabbing it repeatedly with a plastic fork. The scenario, although it may sound interesting on the back of the DVD box, is badly directed and unfortunately we have yet another boring straight for DVD atrocities. The only thing that kept me awake was constant flicker and loud sound effects (lamentably). If it is not enough to see the same forest trail for 63 minutes, we must endure the miserable blinking techniques that "scare" the viewer and the constant lamentation of a bad actress who cares and pisses quite quickly. <br /> <br /> Do you feel you have to rent it, I tell you why? There are better SciFi / Horror movies. Even the dreaded remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers is more fun than this. For the love of all good things, don't bother his crap. My eyes were bleeding and I wanted suicide for the first time. 1/10, avoid it as a disease.
