First, I hate those moronic rappers who couldn't act if they pushed a gun at their foreheads. All they do is curse and shoot each other and act like a clich√© version of the gangsters. The film takes no more than five minutes to explain what's going on before we're in stock This film is not the only likable character except the homeless, who is also the only one who has half the brain. Bill Paxton and William Sadler are both billies and Sadlers' character. as well as a villain as gangsters. I didn't like him from the beginning. The film is filled with senseless violence and the specialty of the Walter Hills: people falling through windows with glass flying everywhere. There is hardly any conspiracy and it is a big problem when root for anyone. Everyone will die, except Paxton and the homeless, and everyone will get what they deserve. The only two blacks who can act are homeless and drug addicts, but they are actors by profession, not a nasty ugly brain of dead rappers. Stay away from this crap and watch 48 hours 1 and 2 instead. They probably have characters that matter to you, a sense of humor and nothing but real casting actors.
