Terrible, waste of time. There is no value for camp or waste in this. They saw better amateur films from 10 to 12 years old in film clubs. <br /> <br /> How on earth can someone spoil a movie about vampires and lesbians? It's not a movie to put together a few vampire / sadomasochism enthusiasts in the same room and just shoot it. <br /> <br /> There was nothing good to find about the movie. There was no conspiracy, no real actors, no real special effects, no humor. A few overweight Goths touching each other cannot be called a sex scene. Nothing. Well, the cemetery was nice, but during the dark, someone should make a vampire movie. The purpose was probably good: make Ed Wood's movie. The problem is that one cannot intentionally make a bad movie. This requires talent and effort to make a "real" movie. Maybe Ed Wood lacked the money, but he certainly had an effort. These guys lacked everything. Ed Wood was a genius compared to these guys.
