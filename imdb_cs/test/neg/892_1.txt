I saw House Party 1-3 and I loved them, but this wasn't funny at all. Can't it be a House Party movie first without Kid n'Play right? This is annoying and it was more like a black version of Ferris Bueler's Day Off than House Party.Second, who the hell is John-John? These new characters can't even compare with those of the other three movies. They know why they put it right on the video.It is terrible music, weak plot, non-competitive actors, and no merry jokes at all.My advice, watch this movie at night only if you can't get to sleep. Party 3 because of Kid'n'Play separate after that one.I hate this one I'm glad my local video store doesn't have this movie and you never want to buy it or want to see it on Comedy Central either. Just because Chris Strokes has talent who leads the upcoming R&B group doesn't mean he has talent and directing and produces movies that I'm right or what? Ultimately, the female characters were dressed as cheap two dollar hookers for most of the flick.IMX separated a year after this movie came out probably due to the failure of this movie and today they are all forgotten. In simpler terms, this movie just plain old sucks !!!!
