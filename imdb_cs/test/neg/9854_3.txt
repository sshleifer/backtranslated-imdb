I thought this series would be another fun, action series with some dynamic charts and great performances. I was wrong. While I like Jamie Denton, this show is hardly worth watching at all if you like to watch some people brutalized and action agents allegedly guaranteed on the theme of "national security." The show is a great propaganda for the current government and spews joke as if we were talking this way every day. After a few episodes, it bored me and I started watching the repetition of House Invaders on BBCAmerica. Rather watch CSI and No Stop, no doubt.
