Outside Sweden, you are not expected to see this movie. Nice to meet you. The cast includes several actors who are an important part of modern Swedish film history. And still ... <br /> <br /> It seems that Peter Dalle had only an idea lasting about 20 minutes. Robert Gustafson is totally abused in this film, trying to copy younger GÃ¶st Ekman. Incidentally, Ekman is the only actor to meet expectations. <br /> <br /> The credits that can be provided are for photography, a great idea with black and white. Music is fine. But it's the loss of the gods and the time of the audience.
