It says a lot about the UK when television programs like this not only get but also run for three series. Unfunny, politically correct to the point where it is frightening and misbehaving and writing. Meera Syal was neither funny nor fulfilled in anything she would be, tell me I'm wrong, and Jasper Carrott, a funny guy like him, is good after the eighties. This is such a bad comedy that it could be made by ITV, but even stinking like The Upper Hand and the one with James Bolam as a parking lot operator look like Fawlty Towers compared to this waste. I would like to sit down with the writer / director of this show to be able to draw attention to this humor. It is true that the majority of the UK population is made up of poorly educated chases, but that would not throttle their ticklish bones. That is if they could break away from Big Brother or from their cell phones, but that's another story. Complete and utter dirt!
