Dear gods, that's terrible. Stay away, stay away. If you think you've seen bad movies, think again. Never before had my brain been as painful as I was watching. If it is allowed to do so, it is sufficient to have internal bleeding inside the head. The story is so thin that it's hardly ... no waiting, scratching. There is no complete story, but once in a while, there are a few thin lines that protrude from every size of horror and believe me, those few lines were supposed to be shot. The best way to enjoy this movie is to drop it on napalm and watch a cozy fire from a distance. Some can make me sarcastic in this review, but I'm just trying to save some of you serious headaches. However, if you were what I like, a visual masochist (like me), please go straight ahead and watch this monster.
