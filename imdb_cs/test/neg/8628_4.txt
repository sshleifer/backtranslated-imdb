The couple breaks up during the holiday. Early scenes lead us to believe that Barney, Jeff Bridges' character, has kidnapped the girl in an inexplicable but premeditated abduction. The film takes place a few years later, where Jeff (Kiefer Sutherland), despite his new love interest, is determined to address his disappearance. Making this film that culminated in a rather delicate work. OK here we go. Abduction Scene - In addition to two major continuity mistakes, there is a point where Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are ready to make a small signed pet-love-ritual that has drowned in excessive sentiment to the point of nausea. We know they are in love; Thank you for "solemnly swearing never to leave you". Another example is the robotic accent of Jeff Bridges. What is it for? Starman is back, and after ten years on the planet, he seems to be angry. The whole plot can then be solved by introducing an unnecessary figure that has a fairly happy step of destiny with the very miraculous ability of observation. The climactic sequence itself was essentially done much earlier than much, much better. It is emblazoned with further harassment and other blind continuity. I could go on, but something positive has to be said. Kiefer Sutherland is the only one who saved his face with fairly decent performance. The original 1988 original of the same name (changed from the Dutch name Spoorloos to an English-speaking audience) was recommended for me, just for the online rental company, to send me this later Hollywood version by mistake. I was surprised to find out that both of them were director George Sluizer and he was interested in his remake. I am reliably and fortunately informed that it has a much higher quality in all areas including land. Horah for that, but it doesn't really mean much.
