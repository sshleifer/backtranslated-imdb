If you like me enjoy movies with land and convincing actors then Alien Vs Predator-Requiem is probably not the way to go. In summary, a foreign country in a typical American city, Predator lands in an American city, both have a bit of a struggle, the US government throws out a city, some people disappear ..... I'm sorry, I think I may have ruined the end. It is easy to criticize someone who is critical; people are calling, I bet you couldn't do anything better! I bet I could! After filming this film, he watched him and then turned to congratulate himself with a heel on his back and a job well done; there must certainly be a specter of madness in the room.
