It's supposed to be a story about the life of a man named Wirey Spindell from the age of 8 to 36, who tells a story at every age in his life. For example, when there are eight, it is an eight-year-old voice that tells; when he's in junior high, he's the one who does the storytelling, etc. This is probably the only interesting thing about this movie. It looks like every Wirey actor is a separate character. Not only do they not look similar, their life experiences do not seem to be fine. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as a bad cold.
