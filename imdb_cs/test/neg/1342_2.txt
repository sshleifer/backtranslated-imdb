George Cukor's The Women remains one of the glittering gems of 1939, Hollywood's most famous golden years. The movie cracked and sparkled and the absence of males was a gentle touch, barely noticed because of all the subtle fun. <br /> <br /> Flash forward. We see Fifth Avenue in New York, in front of Saks. There are large crowds on Avenue ... but something's gone. The shot reveals only well-dressed (attractive and young) women. Creepier than I Am Legend, the visual concept continues, inside the store and later on at the great fashion show. What does the NYC fashion show have at least 5 homosexuals? The 'no men' rule is thrown at our throats and creates an extraterrestrial world, imbalance and distraction. Enter Meg Ryan, who saw for the first time digging in her garden and wore a senseless addition with retro curls. and upright arms. I immediately sympathized with my husband and understood why he was looking elsewhere. Later in the film she morphs into an older Jennifer Aniston look and holds hands on her sides. It seems intentional, as if I said, "I can still be relevant!" Ryan's character is loaded down with his sister's friends, who have agreed to make mistakes (insert Sex and City Comparison) who, if it were real life, would despise each other. Annette Bening plays a powerful bitch who realizes during her film that her life dream doesn't really satisfy her. Jada Pinkett Smith is the power of a lesbian, all concerned without being used by any of the men who aren't there. Debra Messing is some kind of children's factory that eats a lot. Eva Mendes is an indifferent choice at least for a bad girl. It looks fake, false, and any humor it tries to show will fall. Someone has said that it looks like trans-gender. Other different stars appear to organize the furniture on this Titanic. The only thing that would save it would be brilliant casting of Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie. They could name their price, tuck their tongue firmly in the face and pull something very smart and profitable. But no, Hollywood thinks it's too strong for this kind of exploitation. Instead, we get this thing that is uncomfortably spread out without a spark. The entire dialogue sections from the original are picked up and downloaded to the scene with terrible results. At one point Ryan says something like this: "This is not a movie from the 1930s!" No Meg, it's not.
