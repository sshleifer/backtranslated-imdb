The assembly prologue, apparently made by the blessed maniacs who decided to divide this thing, is trying to convince us that the comical impact of this tremendously incompetent piece of nothing is entirely intentional. Don't believe it: this is Lloyd Kaufman because Andy Warhol is Herschel Gordon Lewis. In his project of torturing a hypothetical audience, it is so thorough that it seems to be a misanthropic installation of negationist art, but it cannot be because it is completely deprived of self-consciousness. As unpleasant and ugly as "things" or "frozen cry", this manages up the ante by recycling itself with a madly bald urge that must be seen to be believed. Hitchcock-style shot-by-shot analysis, say, an attack on cardio girls can bring twenty adjustments and maybe three minutes of recording - only the sequence is ten minutes long! YOU WANT TO BELIEVE THAT IT HAS BEEN LIVING AS A BEAUTABLE SHORT OBJECT, except that if you take away the repetition of what's left, it would be much less fascinating: for example, when a "devil" gets into a room, it just inspires widespread, highly apathetic , absolutely blank views from his impending victims. Repeat this scenario about four times in marginally different settings; there are thirty lines of dialogue to overcome; offer actors even more hateful and lethargic than those in the above-mentioned classics; and admire us with a monster that contains gauze, ketchup, and one yellow Spock's ear, and you have a movie that's too overwhelming to refuse, a working definition of the wrong. I'm proud to have it!
