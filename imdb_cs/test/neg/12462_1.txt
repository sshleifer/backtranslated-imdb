As a rule, I try to find as many movies as I can use. I didn't make any exceptions to "Tart", I do my best to appreciate it for what it was. But effortlessly, no matter how great, he could redeem this pitiful apology for the film. <br /> <br /> It failed for several reasons. First, cinematography was boundless and inefficient. Second, the scenario has reached the depths of the "poor" that has taken it well and indeed for the category "so bad that it is good". Thirdly, the acting left-wing overwhelming amount is desirable - it was scary, it really was. Anyone who has seen Mischa Barton (seen here as a remarkably awful Grace, a character so badly invented and realized that Ja Ja Binks does not seem so bad) as Devon in "Rainbow Dog" John Duigan's wonder what was wrong between then and now. Perhaps if she were given a character that would be worth bothering, and a modic of direction, she could at least give this film ONE a redeeming function. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Eventually, the film seemed to have no meaning, nothing, nothing. Indeed, I wonder why Christina Wayne was bothered. "Tart" made a weak attempt to be something and failed. The result - the film, unfortunately so bad that it's just very, very bad. Don't bother - it's really not worth it.
