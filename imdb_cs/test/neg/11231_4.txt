A few years ago, I remember reading the essay of a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned Rosalind Russell. This theorist wrote that "the power" of "strong women" that Rozzie R. played is partly in their ability to become their own man (though not worth it). I thought of this essay after watching 'the crimes of passion'. Kathleen Turner radiates the same strength and style as Russell in her depiction of China Blue. It's a subject of affection for two men: a cloned priest, played by Anthony Perkins, and a weak boy who slowly fades the marriage. And he won't let either of them have her piece until ... <br /> <br /> I'm not going to be over - but I'll say this is Blanda Whitebread Boy's fantasy. No matter how hard Ken Russell tries, he can't hide the fact that this film is basically a 1940s melodrama for MTV. In addition to their retrograde class and gender policy, these old-fashioned black and white films seem revolutionary.
