this fourth part of the series is the last one that has a theatrical release, even though it seems right, I think, but nothing special. And like the third movie, there is not much in the way of imagination.also, the sentence "directed by Alan Smithee" is never a good thing. much more than a slight drop in quality from number three, and a huge drop from the first two to me, Hellraiser IV: Bloodline is 4.5 / 10
