I'm a big fan of the first Critters movie. The second episode is good, but it's not as good as the first Critters. The third episode is a bit boring but beautiful. AND WHAT IS IT? What crap! It's stupid and really boring. It's the worst of the series. I can't watch it again because I slept at the first hour. And Ugo's bad side ... eeewww ... that's one of the most horrible moments of the movie. In the first 50 minutes we can't see small, furry monsters, that's why viewers fell asleep at the beginning of the movie. It could have been a lot better. > <br/> 2/10
