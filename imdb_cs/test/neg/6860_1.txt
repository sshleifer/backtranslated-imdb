I liked watching Lost from scratch and endure a few bad actors in badly written episodes, because when Lost is good, it's really good! But this episode, which includes Mr. Echos's demise, had so many out-of-the-box scenes with bad shots that I found by clicking the fast forward button. This episode has so far been the worst. In fact, the variation in Lost quality was so inconsistent, I find myself often wondering how many writers they use. I will continue to watch, but I hope things are getting better and I hope to stop secretly wishing for the sub-par of the actors in the series to die.
