I'm sorry, but this really looks like a modern day Apollo 13. Absolutely unlikely (at least Armageddon FELT as a comic! It was like a bad High School movie project), the acting was about as cliché as you can get ... landing Space Shuttle on the LA Highway? Come on. Seriously. Jerry, what were you thinking about? And all the clichés: the wife of a pregnant astronaut, a curious reporter who gets in the way of everyone, a determined manager with "Go Fever". And it is one thing to shorten the laws of physics or politics, or anything that should be a fun story, but at least do it GOOD! Fact and science were totally lost for that. The shuttle does not have fuel tanks in its wings, and even if it were, it could not control the fuel shift between them (and DC-10). <br /> <br /> If you like bad play, bad narration, low realism and cheesy clichés, this can't be beaten!
