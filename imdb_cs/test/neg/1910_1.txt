I waited impatiently to see this movie, but when I finally got a chance, I was very disappointed. I had to stop halfway (or it was a quarter way) because of bad script and direction. Not to mention the bad cast! Josh Hartnett is the only one who can act and is much more appropriate to be the hero of the story. Well, basically, the story is just about a loose girl from a country who cheated on her long-long, decent friend had only senseless sex with a spoiled rich brat. I was unable to draw my sympathy for this film, even when the author intended it. I wonder where moral values ​​go? The actors are so stiff that when I restore the film (a few weeks after it was interrupted because of its boring nature), they couldn't pay attention to me. A spoiled couple can only disgust me! What is this film! I think all the people involved in this production have to sit down and check them together so they won't make the same mistakes next time. And next time, Josh Hartnett might consider himself a protagonist ...
