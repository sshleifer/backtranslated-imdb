His evident ESPN is always on when he is in a Knight report, but has he made a crazy movie about him? That was the worst attempt at a serious dramatic movie I saw. It had it all: terrible talks, horrible dialogues, ridiculous casting, cheap sets, etc. It looked like it was shot on a $ 10 budget. Cummon, what about game scenes? Were they in a high school gym? And the lighting, well, let me say it was ridiculous. And Brian Denehy as Bob Knight? Give me a break. Denehey looked like ... Denehy in a red sweater, nothing more. ESPN has lost a lot of credibility with this flop attempt. In the ad they poured millions of dollars and the prime minister was a huge grief. Bob Knight is not a subject that could be covered in a two-hour film. ESPN fired it. Even Knight himself thought it was stupid than anything else.
