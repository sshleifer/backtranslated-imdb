I can't help but be angry with this sitcom. It's as if they didn't even bother trying to write a good comedy, just rehash the third jokes and hope they stick. The worst of all is that it's all so damn uninteresting and missing in every way. To make things worse lead man Kevin James has a permanent "I'm so funny" smug smile on his face that would be tolerable if he only once delivered in a comedy department he doesn't, just lying there and doing nothing like a big unhealthy child. Which brings me to a relationship between Heffernan - easily the nastiest and weakest representation of a married couple on a TV show, really a headache that is uncomfortable, that Remini spends the whole show as if it were a violent chore that would even be around her husband. Jerry Stiller ripped off a few laughs at the show and makes 100% repetition of his role as Frank Costanza in Seinfeld just this time his advice mostly treads on the water due to the inability of the central duo to recognize the joke, even though it flew around them. . Episodes just drift in the stream of nothingness, their work doesn't add anything, and their interaction is even worse. It is not a waste of talent, there is no talent, it is nonsensical creativity desert.
