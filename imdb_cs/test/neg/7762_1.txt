Week after week, these women just sweep all the men of their feet. Remember yourself. None of these women are "Knockouts". Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) seems to have picked up the type of female men at: 45am in front of a bar closed after their vision and standards were equally damaged by ten or eleven martinis. Yet it's a queen, a super-sexy man-killer. The other three are no better. And their constant disgusting comments ..... not to mention jumping in and out of bed with strange men and never getting sick. This show is pathetic. And creepy.I don't think anybody was terribly attracted to any of these women, even though Viagra jumped as Tic Tacs on vacation.
