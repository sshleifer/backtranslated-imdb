All you have to do is listen to the Broadway album and Barbara Harris and John Cullum's wonders for the amazing Lerner and Lane scores. Then, with that beautiful record in the open air, watch the movie with Streisand as Streisand and Yves Montand read his line with such a heavy French accent that the chainsaw couldn't pass. The best part (for those who want to enjoy) is what makes Montand the introductory part of the title song. Listen to how he sings / says: Could any of us have any idea or notion what magical performances witchcraft and voodoo can do? (That one part sums up the problem of casting "star stars" in film musicals instead of a good talent for different roles.) I see how Rex Harrison entered this scene and suggested that Montand also learn to do justice to the English language. <br /> <br />
