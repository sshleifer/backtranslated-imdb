Tyra Banks must teach these girls that it's not all about being beautiful outside. The inside counts for something. Much of the past winners looked semi-finals, but they are terribly cruel and startling for other girls. I see that Tyra is less involved with girls every season. The only thing worth watching the Top Model is Mr. Jay Manuel. He recently had a Tyra competitor who was a pre-op transsexual. I felt she should do more to encourage her. It was obvious that she had uncertainty about her original anatomy, which manifests itself through her feminine appearance. Tyra was supposed to give her tips or maybe she could send a resident Trannie to Mrs. Jay to help the girl out. Instead, the contestant encountered harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism. It's a shame, because I really enjoyed the first three years. There is a reason why Project Runway has all 4 seasons on DVD and Top Model has only 1 season on DVD. It's called taste. Top Model really needs a lot of revival of some humanity.
