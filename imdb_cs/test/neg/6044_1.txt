There is so much wrong with this movie. Greico with wig girls, scientist time scientist time machine fixator, tough guy Jones who stays behind with a shotgun that has three wheels, Spider people with tentacle hands and bad teeth, etc. Make-up was so bad and they only had a few the visible spider of the people on the screen at once (Aliens Cameron technique could be used) instead decided to dress every spider as well ... wrong. The nice thing about Grec's acting is that he bangs his syllable in every syllable, as if he was counting how many words he would speak in the script. It amazes me that with all the information on the DVD comments, there are still people doing movies. This movie could have been worse than I know. And one more thing. I'm going to track down the SCI-FI movie. People who run this channel should not be allowed to further develop the nepotism that exists in film and television.
