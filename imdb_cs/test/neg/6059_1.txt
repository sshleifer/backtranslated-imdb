Eh. I watch this movie in the classroom because someone recorded it and brought it inside. I expected to be able to imitate Heracles myths, and because the ads looked serious, I was waiting for something that was halfway. Ten minutes into the movie I realized that it was total CRAP. The only things in the film that are half-true myth are the bare (and bare) minimum. Parents, half-brother and work seem to be named correctly. Otherwise, the rest of the film seemed to be one huge inaccuracy. <br /> <br /> I'd say it wasn't much better than Disney's movie. The Disney version was created for little kids, so it wasn't too serious. This film, with all sex, violence and nudity, was clearly meant for an older audience, yet the story presented in this was almost inaccurate as a Disney movie.
