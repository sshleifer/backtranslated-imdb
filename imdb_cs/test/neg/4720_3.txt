In addition to the shooting scene, I felt that the film was a waste of celluloid. Robert Duvall, Kevin Costner and Annette Bening could play these roles in sleep. The dialogue was slightly tolerable (and there was a lot - nobody sat quietly in this movie), the plot was all over the map, as if it was not possible to decide how many motives to imitate in the story, there was no subtlety at all - a harbinger intervened between your eyes and led you get to the nose through most of the story (I think they've added the entire dialogue to make sure they don't miss anything), and the adjustments they really needed to tighten (every Canvas Time was bigger than quality - too much dialogue again). The whole story took place over the course of a few days, but everything that happened took epic proportions, just like it was. everyday life was huge for you in high school, but it really wasn't important in a big system. Yes, the bad guys beat and kill Mose, beat Button, kill the dog - all the things that would help Boss and Charley get the blood up. But the meaning was diluted with all the "profound, meaningful" interviews that dominated most of the film. These guys worked together for 10 years and are talking about this thing right now? The only time when there was not much dialogue in the shootout dialogue - which is probably why I liked it. The fuzzy strands of hair around her face, which I thought to make her look a little more romantic, vanished. If she worked outside the home, it would be more meaningful. And why didn't she marry? There seemed to be some "kind" and gentle (her words) of single men in the city, aside from the Marshal and his cronies. In fact, neither of them seemed to want it (the usual plot device in other films). Most of the time she stayed in the house closed and seemed to have little connection with the people in the city. Interested in ...... <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was too long, too flimsy and too resourceful for me. It was like a star vehicle with plenty of time on the screen for big stars, but not deep enough to attract me, despite all the dialogues.
