The film starts great, with a false instructional film about the habits of Swedish housewives. Then we get a detailed reconstruction of post-war Scandinavia with lots of amazing cars, electronic devices and interior design; minimal jazz score, nice cinematography and stylish headline. There is also some funny Scandinavian rivalry like in Von Triers 'Riget'. Sadly, after setting up, "Kitchen Stories" will collapse as the Twin Towers on 9/11. gay by symbolism in vain: "I don't like white swans, I prefer bears and wolves ... ever tasted a bear?" Cheesier than Yann Tiersen in his worst case. It is a pity that the director has made every effort in this great line-up just to go after it.
