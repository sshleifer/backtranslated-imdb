For those of you who haven't heard about the film yet (which I suppose there are many people who are not lucky), I'll summarize it for you. Ryan Gosling plays the titular character of Leland, who also serves as the film's narrator (la Kevin Spacey in American beauty, but without intelligent life observations). Leland goes to jail for stabbing a retarded kid to death and the film tries to find out why he did it. He seems to be a nice boy (unless he is mentally absent) and is portrayed by Gosling with a total lack of violence, anger or agenda (and if you're waiting for him to later reveal his sinister side in the movie, you don't waste your time - it's not such a movie ). Once in a teen prison, Leland goes to classes taught by Pearl Madison, ably portrayed by Don Cheadle (who is unable to do anything but quality, even when in bad movies). Pearl is trying to unlock Leland's secrets in an attempt to find out how such a child could do this, so he could write a book about her later (Pearl is also an ambitious author along with a young prison teacher). The relationship between Leland and Pearl is the driving force behind the film because their conversations reveal Leland's past to the audience. However, stating that a central focus would mean that this meandering film had one. It is not. The United States of Leland boasts an impressive cast that seems to be at the expense of the film. It seems that writer / director Matthew Ryan Hodge (don't worry about hearing about him, has never done anything) has had to give ALL a character story arc and a personality defect so the actors can play. Most of these features and stories are cliché, and most of them are underdeveloped and unresolved. I will try to divide them: Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson are parents of the killed retarded boys (I love how the film still calls the child "retarded", never "mentally disabled". That part made me laugh inside), apparently they have a cold relationship because all suburban marriages in the current cinema must be cold. Their next two children are Michelle Williams, who is apparently an aspiring college actress, and Jena Malone, who plays the same problem teen-archetype she always plays, this time with heroin addiction. Malone was also a friend of Leland, who puts his connection with his victim. William's boyfriend, who was an orphan and came to live with his family, is a baseball player who wants to go to the same college as his girlfriend, played by Chris Klein. He ends up doing more with his character than any other bit players, driving to steal the movie at times. Lena Olin is Leland's mother, who for some reason seems to be constantly sad. Kevin Spacey (also executive producer) is Leland's cold and absent father who is a well-known writer. Finally, Sherilyn Fenn shows up to see wrinkles appearing in Leland's story - if you're interested in that place. Yeah, and there's an ex-boyfriend dealing with drugs, a pair of friends and associates of Pearl's with whom he has a long-distance relationship with his girlfriend (played by Kerry Washington). Sorry if it took so long for synopsis and character breakdown. If it seemed nonsensical and boring, then you just had a little bit of what I did in 108 minutes I spent watching the movie. But the unyielding supportive cast of overcrowded cliché is the least of this film's crimes. The biggest thing is that the whole exercise is absolutely useless. We are not a fascinating insight into the troubled mind, we do not get an effective explanation, we have not received much of anything. Since it sucks so much, I'm going to do it and spoiling the end so you never have to see it: Leland stabbed a retard because all the Leland in the world saw sadness and wanted to save Corky (or whatever the victim's name) sadness in his eyes . It's like the worst emo band in the world doing the album, and titled it "The World's Sad, So I Killed The Retard". Oh, and Leland will eventually die, in a sequence that is so dependent on incredible coincidences that it would destroy the film if it wasn't yet. Of course, he would die because it made the film so deep. I give the film 2 stars because the actors themselves did a pretty good job with the junk they got. The scenes with Cheadl and Gosling were even interesting at some levels. But to paraphrase the film itself, you have to believe that movies are more than just the sum of their parts, kiddo.
