I have to say that this movie wasn't what I expected. Although I haven't read the book the fact that plants can make one bait and then wait for killing to happen, just to pull it off the corpse for lunch is probably the worst scenario anyone has come up with. the kind of deity or ancient animal or god will be the culprit. It's like another film of prehistoric times where you think it was something special that the villagers fear the most, but not the crocodile. Either way, this film was such that it tempts you to think about the ruins of Mayan or Inca folklore, which results in awakening and an old god, or people have a different sacrifice program or something. But plants? ... come on, there's nothing else that manufacturers can come up with to thrill the crowd? As for this movie it will hit the 'b' list in no time. I must say that some of those holes were great to see. And a plant that mimics the sound of a mobile phone or people's voices is too much to believe. I'm a fan of horror movies, but I'm not a stereo fan who relies on gore or mechanical effects. I'm counting on a lot of tension and what the next scene will bring more tension. That thing had a better story than that. Even the ring gave me jumping for more, but the debris is just ..... destroyed for having used the plant to sacrifice roots to kill or have been killed by villagers. The assumption was fine for the villagers to keep her in check with salt and such, but still a simple torch blow, and a lot of napalm can easily do the trick to put an end to those annoying plants with a meat disorder.
