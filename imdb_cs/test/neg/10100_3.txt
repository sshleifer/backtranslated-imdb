When Legends Die is a powerful, moving story of a lone Indian Ute, who becomes Tom Black Bull, a bronze champion. Raised by the old ways, Tom is given the name of a white man and must accept the language and the ways a white man lives in this world. How disgusting about the role he was forced to find is doing one thing, hitting horses, driving them to death, in the rodeo. The film has Richard Widks in the role of Red, a man who befriends Tom and acts as his manager. Red is a drunk who will eventually die in a story that is about where the film ends. The real story is completely neglected, the dark side of Tom Black Bull, who is developing the reputation of killing horses in the rodeo arenas. Well, you should read the book, this film has not come close to making a story of justice.
