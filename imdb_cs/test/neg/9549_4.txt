The storyline has too many flaws and illogical sequences worth it. Jolie's acting behavior is quite flat and poor, Washington is fine, the rest of the cast are cardboard cutouts. Almost everything about this film radiates mediocrity. The story is lame. The only thing I liked more or less about this film is the relatively original methods that the offender uses to end his victims. The technical details are worse than the most widespread knowledge of "CSI" and the gizmos, and in the middle of the film one wonders whether the director cared for the credibility. (Some Spoilers Next!) I think an ECG machine with a pure sinusoidal wave reflecting a person's heart rate, a quadrilateral with a full body of muscle spasms and one working index finger. The killer killed the male intestines while keeping him alive so that he could throw the rats at him and follow the rat who was looking for FACE! What's wrong with that stupid thing? Then there are a few little continuities, but you can find those elsewhere on IMDb I honestly found it a bit of an insult even to my limited intelligence. Wasting time. Still 4 out of 10 to keep my girlfriend from digging me.
