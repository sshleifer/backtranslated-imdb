Horror comedy fans will love it. Others can quickly poison and turn off. It's a kind of comic movie, with excessive violence and gore, deliberately stereotyped characters and a lot of madness. <br /> <br /> It appears to have been created on a budget of approximately $ 100. bunch of fraternity guys after a big beer keg party. There's a leader who is a frustrated nerd, and his loud prank-pulling friend who taunts him about 30 times per second. It's a super monster truck chasing them for hundreds of miles, which is the pinnacle of the movie. Whenever this thing and its harsh mask appear, it's a great scene. There's a mysterious girl who accidentally appears in the back seat, and a lot of giant guys in overalls hanging in the red neck. A friend of a friend never closes the yap and gets them into a mess after another. Their arguments have gotten on my nerves, but other aspects of the film are making it. The visual gags, which in several "psychic troubles and attempts to film someone's", are everywhere. Take your choice, which is the most riffed: Hills Have Eyes, Saw, and Jeepers Creepers were some that I knew. It's a nice insanity if you're in the right frame of mind. Sensationally blunting brewskies with your friends can make this experience more enjoyable; it is a good bet, that is the state of the filmmakers when they put this thing together.
