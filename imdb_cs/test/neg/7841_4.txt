Although predictable and fictional, not a bad movie. It's fun, which is all that Van Damme hopes to do. The ubiquitous "twin" device is used again (as in a large number of Van Damme films), but it is not annoying except for long-term fans. Natasha is beautiful and worth watching. The event is decent, nothing spectacular but exciting for Van Damme. I recommend Van Damme fans to those who are not, but we do not mind an action movie with a good-looking lead couple. Russian Mob is a nice concept and current for this day. It's not his best movie, but the worst.
