Oh, dear, oh dear. My life was drastically wasted by this pile of stink. I'd rather chew my hand than watch this movie again. Painful story, painful characters and painful two hours. The best way to describe this movie is as follows: - I'd rather hold pins in my eyes and cut my brains out before watching another minute. this tripe. Advice is to keep it clear and let your local dusty doctor do you a favor by removing this waste. Lin, you told me it was good !!! ! Goodaleebyeload.
