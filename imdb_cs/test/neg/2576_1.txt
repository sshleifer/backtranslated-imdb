It's unlikely that Seagal would ever change the amount of freedom he did with * On Deadly Ground * (mainly because no one ever lets it go again). He's trying, isn't he? This one is usually a helpless and poorly written little fantasy about how Indian folk remedies are much more effective than western medicine. Seagal really believes this nonsense, though he never explains why life expectancy in America and Europe is so much higher than it was in 1492. Kinda as he never explains how his supposed "Water Motors" Work at * On Deadly Ground *. <br /> <br /> Even "action" in this one sucks.
