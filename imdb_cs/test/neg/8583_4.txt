It's horribly boring for horror. Some unforgettable, terrible pieces can't compensate for a really bad script. Very little coherence is achieved and the film relentlessly overlaps its one basic idea (killer cat) until it becomes repetitive - and things are even worse with the constant use of footage from the cat's point of view. (* 1/2)
