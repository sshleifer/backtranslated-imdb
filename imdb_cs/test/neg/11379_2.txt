I just got out when the movie starts (because I saw Juliette lewis name on the screen). the script seemed very complicated first, but as the film went on, it became understandably clear.i focused well on it, but the result was disappointing. the object of sex unnecessarily used the film unnecessarily, and it seemed to me that the director ignored those who tend to be on the opposite sex. something at the beginning, or just expecting too much ... and finally the end ... the end is so average that I wouldn't expect. the main character Cassandra wants to report that she has a child and how a child can change life, in my opinion, the scene is a real catastrophe for the film. All in all characters are funny and acted beautifully.But only the cast can't save the movie.
