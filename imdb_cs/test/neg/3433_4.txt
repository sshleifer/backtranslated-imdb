I found this movie to be fine. On paper, this film has everything one can want! Romance, comedy, drama. Bank robbery, unique cast, great music and storytelling! In fact, this movie ended up mostly garbage and I'll tell you why. <br /> <br /> a) That's my biggest problem: Editing. This movie is by far the worst editing I've ever seen when I saw there was no local car ad available. The cut could have been done better by a deaf Parkinson patient who broke off on iMovie with a dead cat. There are scenes where two characters are talking to each other and you can see their lips moving and the audio / video is not in sync because of its clearly dubbed. Why was it dubbed? Don't know! His English dubbing! The voices were in the studio elsewhere in certain scenes! Couldn't Find Boom-Mic?! They are not expensive; Jesus, I am one too! And I'm not making movies! b) lacked the performance of Andrew Keegan. He did not seem to want to be part of this project and his actions were equivalent to the parody of D.A.R.E. for pupils. At least John Krasinksi showed some enthusiasm. Yes, John Krasinski is the only reason I rented this movie and its only real reason to watch. He did a good, witty performance and was a three-dimensional character. Dean Edwards's character was quite skinny, as was her face. <br /> <br /> The final word? If you're a fan of John Krasinski, it's worth your time. If not, don't bother. Adjustment
