An absolutely scary adaptation of a wonderful children's book. Rude and inappropriate humor, some frightening parts, and a horrible side story about Mommy's friend who wants to send a boy to a military school to get him out of the way, it's totally unsuitable for children who most likely want to see it. books (3-8) years. Don't waste your money, your time, or your good judgment.
