I was Stan in "Dreams Come True". Stan was a friend who worked in a main character factory and ended up with his hand being broken in machinery and screaming (where was the ambulance?) T from Fox Valley, Wisconsin. I saw the movie on the big screen. She played 2 nights in 3 theaters and it was something special that you saw on the big screen. Maybe I'm biased, but overall I enjoyed it. Also the soundtrack was the band Spooner, who later became Garbage. My brother, Steve Charlton was also in the movie. He played Swenson, the man who comes to the crutch door to talk to the police.
