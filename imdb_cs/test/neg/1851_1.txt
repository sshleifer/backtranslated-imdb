If you're thinking about seeing this movie, then my advice is - dont. For me, the film failed to make a degree at all levels and was a reminder of how most British (and Irish) films are. The forgotten tripe is the best I can say. If it was on TV, I'd wander to do something more interesting five minutes after the start. I saw this movie with a group of friends, and after reading the print previews, I prepared to be critical and hopefully go through 90 minutes of fun. But, dear ..... <br /> <br /> As a comedy it wasn't funny, as the thriller that stupid story was sloppy and lazy. As a love story absolutely incredible. Most of all, as "solemnly above the whim," he lacked style and charm. Gambon and Caine did what they needed to make money ... Gambon and Caine. Is it just me, but besides playing gangsters in the east and jack boys, does Michael Caine leave cold? Some of my friends thought it was okay, but if you do, my advice is to have a few drinks (or meringues) in advance and leave your critical skills locked safely at home. <br /> <br />
