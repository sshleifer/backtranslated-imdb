OK, I've seen over 100 Troma movies and some of them are pretty bad. "Sizzle Beach U.S.A." he was horrible and "I was a teen terrorist terrorist" was unnoticeable, but that's the worst movie in TROMA! A bunch of women is held in jail and tortured when they try to escape. This is really awful. Even when movies are exploited. Doris Wishman and Hershall Gordon Lewis would probably kill the director if they saw this poor apology for a cult film. Avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br />
