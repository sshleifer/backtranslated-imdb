"Beautiful country" is a great disappointment. It won't come to my expectation. Bihn, a tall muscular guy, is the son of an American GI and a Vietnamese woman during the Vietnam War. We were told that in the early 1990s, "less than dust" was treated in Vietnam, so he flew to America to search for his American father. Sounds like a broken heart material? Maybe, but he shows in this movie. I find myself difficult to get in touch with Bihn because the movie is full of clich√©s and I just don't understand or trust him. Writing this film is a total failure. The story is full of holes. It catches some events on the necessary basis and tries to upset the audience's emotions. We're not so stupid and it doesn't work. Let's see what the film is trying to do. So you don't feel like a boat trip. Still not touching? Good! Getting a small child to suffer from heat, hunger, disease, violence with adults on the boat, hopefully will do a trick to touch the audience. Still not touching? You heartless SOB, let's ... OK, I don't want to give any movie spoiler, but you have that idea. The film is really long and slow. He never tells us why Bihn didn't come to find his mom and dad until he left the film to look for his mom and dad. What did he do for 20 years before going to Saigon to find his mom? And guess what? He is lucky and everyone tells him where to find the person he is looking for and finds no one without scratching. I really think the Department of Homeland Security should hire those Vietnamese who helped Bihn. Beautiful country? Who? Both Vietnam and America seem to be Bihn's hell.
