If you thought Herbie was trying to kill himself by leaving the bridge at 'The Love Bug', he was stupid, wait until you see him play horny in this stunning second silly sequel. Dean Jones is back as a driver competing in Paris at the Monte Carlo rally; this time his sentient VW falls in love with another car in the race, Lancia driven by Julie Sommars. Until now, the series is lacking in energy and magic more than in "Herbie Rides Again"; the film is elongated and unreal, although it is traceable due to the return of Jones' typical sympathetic performance, some humorous pieces and frantic raids.
