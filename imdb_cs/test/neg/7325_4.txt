I tried to love this movie. I really did. Kevin Bacon plays a cerebral palsy that is related to a 10-year-old girl whose fantasy of digging into China, flying in a balloon, and so on, is her way of dealing with deadlock. I admit that one of the scenes in which both of them share friendships and simple pleasures has moved forward, while soulful piano music plays in the background. Well, three or four of these scenes. Maybe nine or ten. Well, it was fourteen. But I sat and watched most of them.
