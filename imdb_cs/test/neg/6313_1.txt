This film easily falls into the category of laughter, if not beyond, to actually offend. I think in which alternative universe do filmmakers and studios think this movie will play? From start to finish, we bombed Quaids who exaggerated and ridiculously expressed facial expressions. Another selection point I had with the film was the lack of a realistic story of events that would make you join the character. I mean in one scene where Lewis is playing in the bar before he does it big, it's on top, just a totally absurd bar fight that every citizen in the city is probably part of. Then Lewis begins to play his "A lot of shaking" rendition, and everyone immediately forgets their differences and starts to dance wildly, as if it were the most common thing in the world. These kinds of scenes, many of which, along with the lack of depth in each of the characters, have led to my own laughter. All in all, this film is not worth it for someone who is not interested in taunting the filmmaker and his actors to decide it for an hour and a half.
