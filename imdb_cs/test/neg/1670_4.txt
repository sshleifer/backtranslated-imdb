This movie seems a bit clunky around the edges, as if it was quite a bit of zaniness it was thrown when it was supposed to be. But mostly I enjoyed it. The storyline is more than a little absurd, so no expectations of "something real" should be included in your viewing experience. Check your brain at the door. It will not be necessary and it could be a hindrance otherwise. I really enjoyed Clennon's performance as a real Dr. Baird. His role was in place for giving Aykroyd the character of the protagonist. What a putz a real Dr. Baird was. And Matthau was pretty good as the leading figure of the sidekick. Initially unpleasant but ultimately nice. Somehow. Species. Or at least something that would use soap and lots of water was more than useful. <br /> <br /> Is it worth watching? If you are in the mood to spoof the psychiatric profession, why not.
