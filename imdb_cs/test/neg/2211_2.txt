Meltdown opens on the scene of scientists about to make an important test on a rocket system developed to deflect asteroids if they were on a collision course with the country. Nathan (Vincent Gale) mentions some of the doubts that concern him, but the test seems to be an unqualified success. Then the asteroid disintegrates and the largest piece is inserted into a direct collision path with the ground. Fortunately, a huge rock jumps out of the Earth's outer atmosphere and bounces into space. Unfortunately, the overwhelming blow is enough to change the Earth's orbit, and the planet is starting to approach the Sun in a spiral. While it's all over their heads, Los Angeles cops Tom (Casper Van Dien) and Mick (Greg Anderson) are on the field. They should gather evidence against a suspected drug dealer, but the deal they follow will quickly split into a shooting match. Consequently, Tom takes a few minutes to talk to a local television reporter who also becomes his girlfriend, Carly (Stefanie von Pfetten). At a nearby hospital where Mick is being treated for minor injuries, Tom has a short interview with his ex-girlfriend Bonnie (Venus Terzo), who is a nurse. She tells her he's concerned about the fact that their 17-year-old daughter, Kimberly (Amanda Crew), is dating a man named CJ (Ryan McDonell). As Tom explains to Bonnie that he found out that CJ has a criminal record, he's a little worried. But it's not long before everyone has to worry. Temperature around the world is growing fast. Carly is one of the first non-scientists to know what's really going on. Nathan, who is her brother, calls her to say she can have a way to survive. Carly calls Tom; Of course he immediately contacts Bonnie. <br /> <br /> In a relatively short order, there is a diverse group on the way. But before they reach their ultimate goal, they have to get through the bands of robbers, cope with the catastrophic water shortage and handle paths that are high enough to kill. Casper Van Dien is a great looking guy and I enjoyed him at Starship Troopers. This may be because it is good in action scenes. It could also be because he didn't talk much in the movie. In Meltdown, he is unfortunately given only enough lines in situations that are only dramatic enough to show his entirely average acting abilities. Amanda's crew is also fine and Ryan McDonell isn't bad either. Vincent Gale and Stefanie von Pfetten are also reasonably good, but Venus Terzo is unfortunately at the same level as Van Dien. While the story is fine and actually has some real potential, the scenario is just terrible. The scientific part of science fiction is a non-existent beginning with an asteroid pushing the earth out of orbit and escalating with the notion that "the gravitational equilibrium of the solar system" might "drag the earth back" into its usual orbit "over time. "When the temperature in LA reaches 120 degrees, cars start to blow. <br /> <br /> You know what's even worse than bad science? Bad continuity. Well, really hot. Why not just wear long-sleeved shirts in the movie But why are people empty of taps on their taps, but they are overwhelmed with bottled water? Why are the streets completely empty, but the highways are full? And why are the highways full of unexploded? files, costumes, and production values ​​were good, especially if it only makes me say that the adjustments were not. <br /> <br /> So basically you take a pretty good idea and combine it with most average gameplay, horrible scenario, low- end special effects, totally irrational reversal plot, and bad adjustments, and what do you have? A film that is even smaller than the sum of its considerable parts. I'm sorry I can't recommend a crash: Days destroy POLITICAL REMARKS: Here is the mention that Congress has finally released wallets to fund tests that start a rolling film. While the tests here were completely irresponsible (targeting an asteroid with nuke and not recognizing the composition of a large rock is actually far beyond the irresponsible and impending madness), the fact is that such scenarios are a very real danger to the planet. Unfortunately, we weren't following almost any nearby asteroids on Earth that could sometimes be disturbing in some orbit; and our ability to recognize something on a collision course with us is at best limited. Once we find out we're hit, we have virtually no system to deal with it. There are no nuclear missiles that we could launch. the shuttle is totally incapable of going beyond Earth's orbit, and if it were, we couldn't let them out enough, or fix them fast enough to matter. I'm not big for the government to do anything beyond its constitutional mandates, but I certainly think that protecting the planet from destruction coming from space could be seen as a defense of the country, right? FAMILY FITNESS: Meltdown: Days of Doom are rated R for "some violence". Frankly, I have found no violence beyond the quite typical video game with a T rating. If your teen is interested in a breakdown and you can't speak of it, the R-rating shouldn't deter you from seeing them. It's not a good idea to leave younger children in a room with their older siblings. While shooting is not in the main graphics, some of the dead bodies are.
