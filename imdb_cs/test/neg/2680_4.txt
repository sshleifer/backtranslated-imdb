All the ambiguity about Michael Myers has faded out of the series's chronic habit of continuity and pulling relatives out of nowhere. This record introduces a neat angle that is not just a psycho killer, but is actually dominated by the runes that appear as the star constellation of every Halloween, and the cult uses it to ... erm, well, this film is far from complete and After a while I lost track of the plot. The film bleeding credibility so abundantly has no drop left to the end. Why did Michael put the victim's clothes in the washing machine? Why is the otherwise empty corridor a deadly spike protruding from the wall? Does your electricity really explode your head? And so on. It is left to Donald Pleasence, in his penultimate movie role, to produce some amazing little moments from the pile of horrible dialogue he has given.
