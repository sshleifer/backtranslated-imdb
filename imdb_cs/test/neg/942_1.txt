In this silly movie, I see absolutely nothing fun - even remotely humorous. An unrealistic, stupid, ridiculous idea - just ridiculous. It is hard to believe that the main character, who seems so articular, intelligent and imaginative, would not be admitted to any college. It is even harder to believe that no one has closed a seat. Actors portrayed characters directly from Characterville. We have seen them many times in many movies. Nothing new. I found him on late night television, and because there was nothing else I watched a boring, stupid movie. This is total waste. Maybe if you're a teenager, you might consider it fun. Movies are made for the immature mind, so teens, go for it. The rest, by no means.
