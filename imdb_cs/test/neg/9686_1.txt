Who wrote the script for this movie, Disney Studios?! This is the most accurate adaptation of any story! I wanted to laugh on several scenes and weep on others, and that was just because of how pitiful. I have to attribute it to him, it had a few fun scenes, but I could spend a better time with my evening. I rarely turn off the movie after just a quarter of the way.
