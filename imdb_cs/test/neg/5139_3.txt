I just finished watching the Disappearances at AFI FEST 2006 with about 30 other people in the mostly free 1000 auditorium. The festival programmer, after seeing a lack of audience, began his introductory comments, "Well at least a few of those attending the festival have a good taste in the film". Well, programmers, after watching this movie, I have to answer back: "No, no, and be it!" This "back-woods" periodic piece follows the young (not so) wild Bill as he and his mystical family dangerously run illegal Canadian whiskey across the border during the US ban. The ancient outlaws (Kris Kristofferson and the Society) not only need money to save their clumsy Vermont farm, but want to introduce a small wild law to the virtues of masculinity. missing what makes movies of this kind good, "tension" and credibility. Kristofferson's lackluster performance and dry monologue reminds me of the dream I once had, where Al Gore played the role of Willy Wonka. I just didn't care, and when mystical grandmother Wild Bills appears out of nowhere to advise him, it just doesn't fit. Yes, I almost slept more than once. Gary Farmer is doing a good job as Cameron Frye in Ferris Bueller; Brother-in-law Big Bill while teenage Chris McDermott uses those piercing blue eyes to benefit his acting. But overall they expect Jay Cravens Disappearances to play on Block Buster $ 2 Bin near you.
