There are so many things in this movie that only a few are difficult to pick. Let's start with silly and unpleasant songs. Just like "Ride Little Cowboy", who tended to underline the urban appearance of Klinton Spilsbury. The silly childish cowboy songs that take place in the background during the film have hurt any credibility or momentum the story has done for her. Spilsbury interviewed in various TV shows, and he had a very soft, sweet, lilting voice. His body language was not exactly what people remembered, who were fans of Clayton Moore and the television series Lone Ranger. Spilsbury did not help things by acting like a diva and talked about Clayton Moore's waste after manufacturers were banned from banning Moore from appearing at Conventions and other events like the original Lone Ranger. Clayton Moore couldn't even sign as "Clayton Moore, the Lone Ranger." He only signed "Masked Man". The incredible amount of negative publicity this film gave to the film was only complemented by Spilsbury's grumpy attitude, who very quickly told reporters that Clayton Moore would be quickly forgotten once the movie came out! Sadly, even after the movie was a total flop, the company that owned Lone Ranger refused to cancel their Injunction against Clayton Moore, and he was never again allowed to sign anything except as "Masked Man" and he couldn't put his black mask on any public appearance. "Between Spilburg's diva personality and the negative publicity of the film, it certainly didn't make a good impression on the public. Even worse, the news was released a few weeks before the movie was finally released. that Spilsbury's voice in the film was dubbed by James Keech because the producers thought Spilsbury didn't sound like a convincing cowboy. But then Merle Haggard appeared in the film, and the producers seem to have hoped that the macho image of Haggard (one of the Outlaws of Country Music) will deliver Sp ilsbury's credibility as Lone Ranger Merle Haggard's story was just another anger the audience had to deal with. Sometimes Haggard tells his story and sounds like a weird movie. Combining the rhyming narrative with "Ride Little Cowboy" and any credibility Spilsbury could have had been destroyed by Haggard and the soundtrack. Tonto played Michael Horse. The horse had much more personality than Spilsbury. In fact, perhaps because Spilsbury is reportedly a fighting attitude during filming, it seems that the horse has received much more dialogue and screen time than anyone would expect from Tonto. Tonto takes the lead and is often the leader instead of the Lone Ranger. I was expecting (or hoping) Billy Jack to make a portrait like Tonto's brother (that would make the film much better). The horse is not only more interesting than Spilsbury, but says more and has better scenes. Maybe it was the case of a horse who stole a Spilsbury show. However, because the film was so pathetic, the horse didn't get much recognition. Unlike Spilsbury, the horse had a very productive career in the film industry. Perhaps the last negative about this movie is the Powder Blue The Lone Ranger. The material that was chosen for Spilsbury was more powdery blue than what Clayton Moore normally wore on appearances. This choice of color for the outfit just made Spilsbury look more effective in his role. The comic version also showed the Lone Ranger wearing a red shirt and black trousers, and that alternative clothing would help Spilsbury look more convincing than the Lone Ranger. <br /> <br /> Support cast mostly sent in their appearances. They all seem to be working on a TV episode and no one seems to be convincing. Even the villain, Cavendish, lost the edge because of the people around him. Overall, I'm sorry about Spilsbury. Not only did he do horrible acting, but it is clear that production and publicity are terrible and sabotage any chance a poor man has. Even if he were a great replacement for Clayton Moore, I doubt it would be due to other factors. As it stands, this movie is sad.
