I can't express enough how bad this movie was. First, it is a waste of some legendary stars, although they are old and unconvincing. Fred Astaire, but I think he had to owe some big favor because it was his last movie role. The screenplay is a mess and the film seems to be terribly expensive. I imagine if I saw it when it came out (1981), maybe I thought it was decent. However, seeing so many real horrors was one of the worst. The only real convincing in this mess was the very young and beautiful scary Alice Krige. The main young character tried to do her best, but she was terrible. I wasn't sure how much it was from his lack of skills or lack of a clear script, but in any case he was just bad. Don't look if you want to see a lot of old guys who are a little scared.
