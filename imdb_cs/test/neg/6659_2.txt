Exceptionally bad! I'm not expecting much from Garcia because he's one of the most overrated actors today, but Keaton should have really known that this movie would suck and get out if he could (not that I liked him, but hey, did batman) On one scene, Keaton is transported to the hospital, strapped down and wearing Hannibal Lecter's face mask when two attacking dogs bark at him (dogs feel the evil you know). she snarled at them, turning them off and whining with their tails between their legs. Did the film overcome the comedy? Garcia makes herself a fool in the interrogation scene with a dialogue that could only find a complete retard, and the child is too uncomfortable to apologize. <br /> <br /> If you want to make a movie with such a poor plot, as you need some magic, humor, some solid action. Take Die Hard for example, which is great despite its somewhat miserable plot. Although Keatons' character was a joke, I'm for him all the way. I wanted Garcia to cry over her dead baby, and Keaton sipped a martini on some paradise island! This movie is for a good laugh. Watch it with a funny friend and you can have fun because this movie asks for almost all the scenes. Everyone in all his insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money. Greed did this movie and thank God it bites a little bit.
