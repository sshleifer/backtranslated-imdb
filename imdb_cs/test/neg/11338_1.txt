When I went to see this movie, it was a forced choice because my original intention was sold out. what followed was horrible, the film is so bad that I could barely carry it. the story is not worth mentioning, the homosexual goalie is a homosexual football team who plays against his old direct team who - when discovering his sexual orientation - gave him a hard time. loaded with unbearably old and overblown homosexual clichés, the slim plot perfectly matches the Danish dialogues ... it is absolutely astonishing that actors like dietmar bär or charly hübner lose their talent and time for such nonsense. 1/10
