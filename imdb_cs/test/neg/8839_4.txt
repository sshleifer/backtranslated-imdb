Lone Star Productions has certainly noticed them in the 1930s, and "Star Packer" has the feeling of one of those hurrying. John Wayne is the US Marshal John Travers, who examines the distorted hoodlum known only as "Shadow", which is responsible for theft of cattle, jogging and the like, and issues orders behind the false wall safe. Yakima Canutt is Travers' trusted Indian sidekick, suitably named as ... well, "Yak". Soon after, we find out that Cattlemens Union Head Matt Matlock (George pre-Gabby Hayes) is really Shadow; dead giveaway when he offers to buy his (supposed) niece Anita half of Matlock Ranch, because "this is not the place for a girl". As Anita, Verna Hillie doesn't have much to do in the movie, though in a comic moment, she gets to use six shooter to blast one of the villains in a nightly haunted raid. There are several curiosities in the film - for one, Wayne's character alternates on a white horse and on a dark horse in the first half of the film. In what might have been a neat device, there is an elevated stump of trees used by a follower right in the middle of the street. Finally, the movie really can't handle its name because Sheriff Travers never wears a badge throughout the movie, ie Star Packer without a star. Horse Chasing, Scene Escape, Cliff Stag (Another Curiosity, Horses Relaxing From the Stage) are all pretty standard. But John Wayne fans will want to see this as a charisma he has shown in his career. For the more critical, white scarves worn around the forehead a good guy posse could only mean that they all had headaches.
