When I avoided the movie in the movie, but I bought a DVD for my wife for Christmas, I had to watch it. I didn't expect much, which usually means I get more than I bargained. But 'Mamma Mia' - sheer, sheer cr **. I like ABBA, I like songs, I have an old LP. But this movie is just terrible. Theatrical show looks a bit like a musical, but these races along with songs hastily following each other, without characterization, dance numbers (which were heavily choreographic according to DVD additions) are only thrown with half the bodies of the North European dance choir the island as desired, while the ensemble and set of numbers would despise Cliff Richard's musicals in the 1960s. Even her usual mugging effective in over-the-top musical! Her big piece - "The winner takes it all" - is Meryl at Met! A director's note - it should be shot in peace with a camera gradually displaying the distance between Streep and Brosnan! Some singing is terrible karaoke on amateur night. The camera cannot stop moving as bad MTV. One can never settle down and enjoy music, enthusiasm and characters. But what's worse is how this messed up excre **** became the UK's highest movie and the best selling DVD? Blair, Campbell, and New Labor have really lowered the United Kingdom to zombies - someone's critical skills ???
