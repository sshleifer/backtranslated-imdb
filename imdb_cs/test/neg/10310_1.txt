Oh no! Oh no! On the cover worn out by VHS, Sandra Bullock and her name are written above. I think the only reason they had a chance to sell the film in the 1990s was because of Sandra Bullock's name. Bullock's fans may not disappoint. Sandra is the only thing she watches in this movie and her performance is the only way to call acting. The rest of the movie ??? It's fun to watch in the first fifteen minutes because it's bad, but then it's worse. Much worse. Direction is terrible. Negotiations are terrible. The script is terrible. Dialogue is terrible. The action is terrible. The music is actually pretty good. A typical score for action films of the 1980s. This film is so bad that it's close to what Andy Sidaris has ever made. It's so bad that it's not the right word to describe this bad attempt to be a movie. But she was still Sandra Bullock. And super cool (sarcasm) Jake LaMotta who tried to be Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> I think they can bring the movie to DVD. It could be fine!
