Comparing this film to anything Almodovar is an insult to Almodovar. The best thing I can say about this is that she is desperate to be like the Almodóvar movie and fails miserably. The scenario is scary, the characters are one-dimensional, and the performances are the quality of high school drama (except Marcia Gay Harden, who is good enough with the material he has to work with). Besides, cinematography means nothing to express the moody beauty of Gaudi's architecture or Barcelona's infectious magic. If you like graininess, pathos and the dark, unpredictable Almodóvar's comedy, you won't find any of them. Spend your money on something other than this celluloid waste.
