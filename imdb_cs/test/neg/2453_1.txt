I watched this movie for about an hour (against my will) and I couldn't finish it. I would rate it as 0. Writing was wrong, the plot was predictable and one that was done too many times. The most unpleasant part of this movie was playing Melody Thomas Scott. This part did not require someone to look like a snobbish, but managed in every single scene I saw looking like a (sour) snob, or someone who was about to spill something extremely sarcastic or cruel. Two romances that seemed to develop into something serious, almost at a paired meeting, were a bit too much. <br /> <br /> I should know better than watching TV movies. If there is nothing on TV and this is the only option, read the book.
