I was looking forward to it being in production. But it turned out to be the biggest. It's far from the whimsical world of Dr. Seusse. It was vulgar and disgusting, I don't think Dr. Seuss would approve. As Grinch stole Christmas, it was much better. I understand there were some tiny adult jokes in it, but my kids haven't caught up yet. While the Cat in the Hat screamed vulgarity, which they caught much more than I wanted. Spreading with Dr. Seuss This really bothered me when I saw this timeless classic hit the big screen. I hope this makes Dr. Seuss justice.
