I love exotic sci-fi / fantasy movies, but this was very unpleasant to watch. Suggestions and pictures of child abuse, mutilated bodies (alive or dead), other horrific scenes, hole holes, boring acts made it a regrettable experience. The basic idea of ​​entering another person's mind is neither new in films nor television. The limit episode was better at examining this idea. I gave it a 4/10 because some special effects were nice.
