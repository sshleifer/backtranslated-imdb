Let me take it straight: <br /> <br /> "A hotshot plastic surgeon loses a patient on the operating table while removing the cysts from the face and ends up in love with a recently separated bed and breakfast hostess within about 24 hours of meeting up with because of her firm advice on the bed. "Wow Go over" The Notebook ", there's a new baby in town. <br /> <br /> Where to start. I think we can safely summarize the basics of this undying love in the following steps: 1. Exchange courtesy pleasures over a piece of lettuce 2. Drink plenty of Jack Daniels, play basketball with old food 3. Provide glib, unsolicited advice on their miserable lives 4. Love yourself during a hurricane 5. Give your lives to each other through air mail. <br /> <br /> I noticed that George C Wolfe has "The Hairball" and "United Kanye West Project" in your document Would he "stick to his genre" to be too cruel? He said enough. I think most of them would agree that the best love stories are calling or laughing or even hoping. But the reason they are able to do this is that somewhere in the story we really care about the characters we watch on the screen. To take care of us, the time spent developing these characters must be their lives, their history, why we're watching them now. Wolfe didn't seem to want to "waste time" with such trivialities, and instead gave us all the 8 minutes of background information on each character before hitting us into the intense interaction between the two ACTORS my. I loved everything in everything but two CHARACTERS we could care less about. For a brief moment when Richard Gere declares that he does not expect to listen to his problems and invites him to dinner, the viewer sees a flash - a start - something special between the two characters. Instead of looking forward to the expectations and playfulness of "what happens next" in the wonderful, unpredictable joy of courtship, we are instead pushed into a love relationship between two people we barely know. Let's face it. We've all heard cheesy one liners in romantic movies. But the reason we in Bogabar in "Casablanca" or "Nicholson" in "Something to Give" is that our hearts and minds have been lifted to heaven and dragged through mud and back with these characters and we are so deeply involved in their situation, nor do we notice the cheese factor. Since Wolfe does not allow us to love us, or even as our protagonists, all we have is a sandwich sandwich and a few snicker in the audience. Wolfe takes the phrase of an old Hollywood director: "Too literally here." Since each of the inserts is supplied by our casting, the viewer is wondering if director Wolfe subconsciously tells the viewer: "c'mon. It's Richard Gere's novel. Just buy." It is because of this overwhelming lack of character - or relationship - development that the film's climax is unfortunately failing to pull the heart. When Gere's character dies, I felt I was watching news of someone I didn't know would die. Or watch the ladies' eights rowing race during the Beijing Olympics. Just. No. Care. Epic. Fail.
