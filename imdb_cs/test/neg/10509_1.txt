In fact, this film almost made me cry. <br /> <br /> To start with false teeth. Then you will notice a nice plastic or drawn set. To make things even more boring, a flash of bright light follows the action. Then speaking: sound levels are so different, sometimes too hard, then too soft, never as good as in good movies. It also reflects so much that I think they had one microphone on the whole scene. And to make matters worse, EVER heard about stereo? If the camera switches, the sound will remain in the center. The actors speak as if they were reading from a board held behind the camera. And approaching another scene as horrible childish. Music is so badly chosen that it never adds anything. It only destroys randomly generated excitement. <br /> <br /> To complete this, battle scenes ... my three-year-old niece would do a better battle scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even good for laughter, it's just so bad ...
