First, there are holes in this movie. In the beginning we see that the child dies of the game. But who was tethered in a truck that delivered the package containing the game? How did the driver place the package in the box when he was tied to the steering wheel? It's not like Mr. Fantastic. Wow that in just the first 15 minutes ... Actors are the second speed, take "Bad Guy" who plays Patrick Kilpatrick (Who?) He just appeared in one episode of everything on TV and some secondary roles in bad movies (like this). So most acting is like TV dramas, I can live with it, but graphics or special effects are terrible. The disembodied "game" voice sounds like a poor clone of Hal from "Space Oddessy 2000". What they called Zombies looked more like shadows that jumped around like apes from the Ape Planet. Foreigners had transparent bodies like shadow zombies. In most cases, the movie was only predictable as it had no hook or hidden program to go. The story was a good idea, but like most of the good ideas discussed during lunch, it never evolved beyond good ideas.
