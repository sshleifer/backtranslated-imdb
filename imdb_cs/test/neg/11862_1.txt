First, let me underline that I am not a big fan of political correctness. In fact, I like satire or dark humor, even though it makes minority jokes. The reason I am sure that this racist work is not worth it is that it does not make fun of minorities to prove their status, their social conditions or the way they are treated by society. In addition, he uses every stupid stereotype and prejudice to strengthen xenophobic feelings and reservations. It's really a shame, but no surprise that other comments didn't get that point because we all had a cheap laugh. Congratulations!
