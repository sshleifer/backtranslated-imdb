This is my first comment on the movie here. I have to say that of all the bad movies I've ever seen, including Braindead, that's really WORSE! I promise. Don't even look at it. It's boring, bad playing, bad script and plot, bad effects whole movie is one big piece of crap! If I could give 0 stars out of 10, but because the lowest is 1, which is horrible, I have to vote. However, I would say that the film is worse than terrible. Don't be alone by seeing this movie and hoping it will be better because I can tell you now, it's a habit! I was hoping that the only scene that would be worth it came. There was no good scene at all. <br /> <br /> What a great piece of crap. And Coolio as a vampire? LOL! LMAO! YARGH!
