One of my good friends said, "The monkey is funny anytime, anywhere." There is one exception: GOING BANANAS. It's just WORST MOVIE I've ever seen. It's worse than PLAN 9, worse than BEAUTIFUL YUCCA APARTMENTS. It's scary. Talking monkey gag ages after three minutes and believe me it's all. Make sure you have lots of people around you to revive after you go to TOXIC SHOCK from GOING BANANAS, the worst movie ever.
