STMD! Not a horrible movie, but it's pretty forgotten. Lighting is deliberately bad in many scenes and unintentionally poor in all others, so it is likely to emerge from observations with headaches or eye fatigue. Special effects are imaginative, but obvious. The gratuitous nudity necessary for teen slasher flicks is, of course, along with archetypic teenagers, but the whole movie just isn't a gel. What was needed was some smarter dialogue and more language-in-face humor. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend you to use your time watching this movie. I often give a nod to a movie that is based on a scene or two that demonstrate imagination or humor, but unfortunately is missing in this movie.
