I was so "stunned" by Tim Kincaid MUTANT HUNT that I tried. It is a near future, of course an apocalypse. A wandering warrior named Neo (no, not Neo!) Joins a group of similar-looking warriors who would challenge Dark and his undersea Wallachia. On the way, they meet mutants, crazy females, sewage worms, a large spider's foot, and a few clumsy robots. Oh my! Sadly, ROBOT HOLOCAUST is barely up (or down) to HUNT level. Cloping in a painful 79 minutes (box says 90), that's one cheap movie. The kits have all the sophisticated design of the carnival haunted house, and the costumes show that in the near future everyone will dress like John Travolta in the final dance number STAYING ALIVE. The Atomic Waste is a combination of old rubble and Central Park. Dark One is ominously named The Power Station, and it looks like it's a power plant. Acting is generally bad, except for Angelika Jager as the evil Valaria. Jager is a whole that is nothing wrong. Vit er sick Cherman acczent, she gives the performance so incredibly bad that she becomes the only reason to recommend this movie. She also supplies the film's only nudity in the "chamber pleasure" section of the film. Ed French adds effects to the robots again, but they're not nearly as good as his work at MUTANT HUNT.
