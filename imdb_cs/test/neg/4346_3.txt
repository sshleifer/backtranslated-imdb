Not "confusing" in the sense that "Gee, this movie is really complicated, so it's hard to watch!" But confusing in the sense that "Gee, this movie really has no idea what it does!" Dream Warrior is a collaboration in Hong Kong / South Korea, but it's nonsense. A film about parallel universes mixed with a time concept mixed with a love story mixed with stupidity. The film has a type of concept that reflects the mind. Again, it does not take into account the mind because it is so great and complex, but boggles in the sense that it is so ridiculous and one cannot imagine anyone starting to start such a terrible premise. Nothing in DREAM OF WARRIOR makes sense, because the whole movie should never be created. It's pretty awful. The only saving grace is the actress who plays the female warrior (not female leadership). <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
