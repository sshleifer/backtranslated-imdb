It looks like if you are going to send it 10 stars, no one ever likes anything, but I'm honest, some don't like it, but here we go, rachel ray show is just awful. !!!!!!, this show reminds me of the character dreamed of anything if she had cooking-anything show.i must say I liked rachel on the food network at $ 35- $ 40 a day, but i'm sorry she doesn't enough life experience to make her an interesting day and day out, give me a ham on the street, an anthony bourdain, interesting people, but most of all I find her annoying, in fact she told a studio theater member to "shut up" in fun but keep shut up, he's shut and who cares about her home stories, sorry to be canceled !!!!
