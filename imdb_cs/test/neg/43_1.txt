With this film, I was completely bored, melodramatic for no apparent reason. Every thing becomes so serious and people scold with really stupid expressions. Then there's a serial killer who can probably kill one person to earn a serial killer title. Serial Killer likes butterflies and is illustrated with sound effects that you can hear in the dream of the latest movies; why why? I have no idea. It really wants to be scary, but I think in this scary universe it equals talking a whole bunch and adding dark ambient sounds. Just for the record, it's by no means a horror, its probably a thriller (barely). Really film makers today have to do their homework than do "horror" movies or at least call the movie "horror" movie. it makes me say (too ironically) "akolyti, you take forever to say nothing."
