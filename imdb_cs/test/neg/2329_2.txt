A work colleague told me to watch this movie because he considered this film to be one of the best films ever. So I watched it. First, I have to admit that I don't like mainstream movies and I prefer to watch movies with real meaning. And that's why I don't like this movie. It has no meaning. It's just a combination of funny, silly, boring, fun, absurd and thrilling pieces. At first I thought this movie could be a real secret to a thriller (how to read German), but the movie was too mysterious to me. David Lynch may be able to create a mix of different images, but I like the composition as well as the combination of milk and beer. They're both pretty good to each other, but together?
