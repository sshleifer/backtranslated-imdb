This is one of the worst movies EVER has made. I can't believe how bad it was. I was shocked by the horror of ghoul masks. They are Halloween Masks! Mouth does not move when talking !!!!! Why did they feel the need for ghouls to be comical and punchy? Whenever they do anything, it seems to be circus music and exaggerated BONK and BOING sounds when they hit people. Virgin slavery is one of the worst actresses I've ever seen. This movie is just bad. The story does not exist. Mom from ONE TREE HILL is in it and she has obviously to wear the job because it has been done. Why did the main character of the first movie come back to this waste? BAD BAD BAD FILM.
