A boundless film about two girls and some guys they meet at the airport, on a bad night bus and end up in a world of trouble. The big twists and turns are totally, and I mean totally waste, in a movie with a conspiracy so stupid as to give up the description. What is going on in the general sense is fine, I think the idea of ​​a man who has kidnapped unmanned girls for criminal purposes is good. The problem is that the details are so out of belief that I would be shocked if you do not turn the film off in total disbelief. Gee, the guy who thinks he'll take you home won't be any of the ways you know, and you stay on the bus? From here it is even worse, I think of every wrong choice and this movie has the characters who do it, even to the point where they could just leave but never. What is uncomfortable is that some twists could work if something was intelligent, but there is hardly any intelligence in this movie. Well, maybe it's over, the end is smart. The end is the kind of thing that should scare you. it should be "oh # $ * @ !!!!" and becomes a classic of horror film. Instead, he just lies between the stupid ruins of a silly film. One of the dumbest films of the year.
