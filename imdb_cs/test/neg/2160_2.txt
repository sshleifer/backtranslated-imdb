Back in the cold and scary early nineties, she broadcast a show called "Family Affairs" and became an instant classic. The trick was to buy a manual in standard family situations and their solutions and put some sarcastic notes into it, and you had yourself. beautiful little theft-is-bad, parents-are-right-show. So it went well, so Bickley-Warren had a new ambitious plan: he did the same show again. Here is the difference: "Family matters" Urkel had. "Step by step" has a guy from those "Kickboxers" - followed by no one has seen. He says things like "dudette" and "dane-meister" and the audience still hates him. I mean, "dudette"? How can you get through your lips? The rest of the people were mostly white versions of the entire Winslow-bunch, combined with some more-one-or-zero-dimensional characters, like a stupid guy (JT. Well, Eddie), a clever girl (Laura), and a pretty girl who spends her days looking nice (theoretically). Grover and The Cookie Monster have more depth than the Lambert family. Each of them had just finished their stereotypes for what was worth it. They weren't very good. Driven by a massive laugh and a stimulating tape stolen from something funny, this show aired for an incredible 7 years, which was a humiliating competition. I must note that this is the time when family sitcoms were almost all big hits, everyone just ignored their miserable, because well, it was in the 90s, one more miserable show doesn't hurt.
