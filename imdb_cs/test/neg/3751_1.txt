Do not be afraid of ourselves, this atrocity is not Plan Nine or Cat Women. It's bad, period! The performance differs from the dramatic school of theatrics (Marla English) to the 'couldn't care less' walk through (Tom Conway). The photo (even in good print) is so dark that it's sometimes hard to see what's going on. But the real problem is aimless, useless, almost a plot of less story and lead, headless direction. With a fast 77 minutes, she still feels endless. <br /> <br /> The scenario is particularly awkward. There are two story lines that only intersect at the very end of the picture. Tom Conway is trying to create a great race using voodoo and modern science (though there is little scientific knowledge) he can telepathically control. He keeps his wife prisoner (without any reason). Meanwhile, a few small cheaters and a white hunter guide are trying to find the village he works in, in anticipation of gold and gems. When they finally arrive, Tom Conway decides that one of them, a woman, is the perfect subject of his experiments. She turned into a monster, kills Conway (natch!) And then returns to normal. He sees a golden statue drowning in a boiling pool, trying to get it and falling into the water and drowning. White hunter saves a woman. In the last shot we see that the supposedly drowned woman has reappeared as a monster; threatening sequel (now it's a really scary thought!). AIP Producer, Samuel Arkoff, in a DVD lecture, prides himself on noticing the teenage market and satisfying the low budget genius movies. However, it is difficult to understand how anyone might think that this rancid mixture would satisfy any kind of audience. What is their attraction? The monster seems so rare that it can hardly be called a horror movie. The jungle action is lukewarm and tiring. There are no teenagers in it and no characters to expect from teenagers. Producers exhibited 77 minutes of film but did not make a film. This is a scam and Arkoff should be ashamed of him.
