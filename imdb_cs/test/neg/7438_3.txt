This film is a good example of what happens when a studio wants to get a continuation of fine film from gates at any cost. Only with this movie, it's really close to miss. Everything seems to be appropriate for Robocop 2 to match the pioneering first film. The complete original cast (except for the victims, naturally) returns and gives them the best. Too bad hackney scripts and incompetent director as good as neutralizing their efforts. Irvin Kershner may have been ideal to go for a guy for George Lucas to drive the Empire Strikes Back. For a filmmaker like Kershner, there is not much in Lucas's awkward film series. A good classic successor like Robocop would need either Paul Verhoeven to come back, or a director who would have enough brass to turn on him. Kershner doesn't know how to put his own spin on anything (Lucas hired him for it) and he's certainly no Verhoeven. So what we get here is a movie that goes through all the moves to replicate the first movie, but with no freshness, humor or bold original it had. Kershner probably thought he could add another gore and gratuitous violence to Verhoeven, but instead reveal how much he was renting as a director for work as a passionate filmmaker. And that's a shame because everything was in place to be another classic. As already mentioned, the actors give him the best, but Phill Tippet brings some breakthrough effects to stop the motion and there are some great ideas in the story of Frank Miller, born to write Robocop. If only the studio hired a director who was competent enough to go through the full potential.
