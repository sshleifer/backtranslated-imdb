... please, please, because it's on the nerves. Seriously, the man behind the brilliant pieces like "My Own Private Idaho" and "To Die For" (and others not so great movies, the unnecessary remake of "Psycho" began the experimental phase with "Gerry" that reached His peak with the idea of ​​provoking "elephant." "The last days" had some interesting aspects, but they were very uneven, while "Paranoid Park", his new film, also has pretty-looking 15-year-olds who go around ... and nothing else. great references to Fellini (the soundtrack uses several beautiful pieces from Nino Rota) and the elegant cinematography of the legendary Christopher Doyle ("In the mood for love") are the main elements, but the film is just too windy and insignificant. age stories and "Paranoid Park" brings nothing new. I see nothing artistic when I see excessive footage of Gabe Nevins in his underwear or showering. evins and 13-year-old Taylor Momsen (little girl from "How Grinch Stole Christmas") who play their cheerleading girlfriend, have sex for the first time just because she felt like she had to do it and after it's done, she calls her a friend to say how awesome it was (and from Nevins's face you can tell how traumatic it was). Everyone knows that they start early and earlier, films like "Thirteen" and even "The Elephant" (which shows how lost minds are in general, not only in terms of sexuality) have better portrayed. Gus is trying to be minimalist and artistic, but the end result is just boring and uninteresting. His next project, "Milk", a biography about Harvey Milk, starring Sean Penn, will hopefully bring good old Gus, because, frankly, this obsession with underage children is almost ... spooky. 4.5 / 10.
