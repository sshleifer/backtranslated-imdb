Last night, I watched this movie on TV and hoped for a realistic description of what could happen if some highly transmissible diseases broke out. I was disappointed and I think the movie was waste. It didn't seem real to me. Some of the games were terrible, especially what the doctor had. She was about the worst I saw. The whole thing was CNN's worst case scenario. Even the obligatory catastrophe of human relationships bits did not look sincere. I have seen some catastrophic films, especially those weather that are so bad that they are fun. This one is almost as bad, but it's not fun, it's boring and boring.
