*** Possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I read Dahmer a little bit and saw a new movie Dahmer (with the same name) in the past. This film focuses on victims and murder, too little on Dahmer. The film called "Dahmer" had the opposite problem, too little and too much about his crimes. I didn't find it to satisfy myself, it had a certain amateur feel. , in particular a probation officer. It was as if Dahmer's activity had deteriorated every time he played against a probation officer. But maybe I'm wrong about it. I was a little annoyed that some scenes were pretty distracting, but that the filmmakers were trying to show a "real deal" about what he did the same. That's okay - but I don't understand why the one who escaped from the apartment while Dahmer was out was not portrayed naked because that is also what happened. It's not a big deal, but it's just gone beyond the quality of movies that such details are omitted. Dahmers' sexual obsession with the dead failed to show or even suggest. Again, I do not mind that they did not say it, but at least they could mention it or somehow put it in the film. Conclusion: I think a really good movie Dahmer is still being made, a film that includes not only Dahmers crimes but also who he was, and why he did what he did. I think 1.5 or 2 hours is not enough to understand the complexity of it all. This film was just a cutout (excuse the pun) of Dahmers' life and personality and does not give you any "good" insight into his life or personality. <br/> <br/> 4/10
