I just saw this movie recently and said, "This movie is bad!" William Shatner is a great actor but not a director! It's not just that acting is bad, it's terrible. And instead of conspiracy, we have a very bad plot called a conspiracy! What I thought was wrong was when Kirk and McCoy taught Spock how to sing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat!" Got something against William Shatner? I do not. But when he finds out he's a director, he gets angry! This movie is not one of the worst movies I've ever seen. But it's the worst of the Star Trek series! I noticed that after this Shatner he didn't return to directing another movie in the series. Apparently they didn't want him to make another film again after it happened! <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie will get angry! <br /> <br /> 2/10
