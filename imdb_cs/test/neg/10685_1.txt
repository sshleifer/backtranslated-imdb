This horrible movie was constantly scarred. <br /> <br /> The main action of the film is nothing special. It seems that there are leaders and decisive people in the remote mountain areas of northern China, where women rather than men live. I suppose it is enough among some people to make "Succubare" a horror movie ... The Chinese would sometimes roam the village, pick local girls, seduce them, and then leave them. Unfortunately, for men, women gave them under the spell, derived from the snake venom, which would make them die terribly in 100 days - their belly swollen like a pregnant woman with live worms and snakes - if they didn't return. <br /> <br /> Forget the US video cover. It has nothing to do with vampires. The title itself is only marginally appropriate: "Succubare" is a Latin verb meaning "lie under", and it is the root of the word Succubus, a female demon who would seduce a man in their sleep. Actually, these are the men who are seducers here. But this is not the main action of this ridiculous movie, which is so inappropriate. These are minor incident incidents. I will overlook the defeat and the butcher's on-screen butcher shop. Participants seem to be very experienced, as if it were an unpleasant duty they actually do; and I'm sure they really ate after the animal ... though I hated getting into a face like "fun". <br /> <br /> I wish to overlook (or overlook) numerous, totally alien footage of an unknown man who interrupts the story from time to time by eating live animals. The film starts tearing a living snake with teeth. During the film, the beetle, the lizard, the toad (I had to leave the room for this room) and the whole mouse (at this point I stopped watching and lost my desire for days). Let me emphasize that it was totally unexpected, and it had nothing to do with the film ... unless it is a cynical reference to love as shown in the film: a blind, selfish, predatory mechanism of survival that tears up the helpless ... but then again, I'm probably just rationalizing to get my anger out of my head ...
