Smart summary, isn't it? <br /> <br /> If Mad Max was something simple, straightforward, nothing special, but nothing wrong, or a movie, they made it up with the sequel, The Road Warrior. So, theoretically, with the third big movie it would be a big trilogy ... now it's not! Such a huge disappointment over Thunderdome was! It's the main premise is pretty cool with the 'underworld' (I think the mix between Metropolis and The Time Machine), but it's not all done with too much conviction. Add the unpleasant Tina Turner and nothing good story of the people waiting for the plane, and that's just one huge smelly. Maybe they can brighten things up with Part 4 again (though the one is about 1 huge budget-blast a little thing) because it's just not right. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
