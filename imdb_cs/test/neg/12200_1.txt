Complete and total loss of my precious two hours. The whole movie could be created in less than 60 seconds just by portraying the people in the cockpit, the car crash, the people who downloaded, people who have sex, the people who cry, and the people who get to work. The slogan for this film should read "Come see how our characters are back!" They're stoned! They depend on coke! It's a mess! Who are these people? Please give us your money, because we don't care for anything else! A horrible movie. It never went anywhere, you never knew characters (they never even said what these people were doing to make such a big house and so much money and cars and coke), and that was just plain boring. You may like the film a bit more if you are a stoner yourself, but for most of us who are not, this movie is a waste of film and time.
