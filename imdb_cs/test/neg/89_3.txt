An artificial melodrama with a scenario adapted by Mel Dinelli from his "The Man" game concerns a shipowner who marries a troublemaker who can be deadly. Despite the hard work of Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan (both trying their best), this boring yarn is not very resourceful in its only primary file (which is quickly becoming visually boring) and inadequate cast of characters (but the smart pooch that feels worst!). Hokey and no humor, with a swift direction from Harry Horner (perhaps Lupino should order?). Where is the tension that advertisements promise? Dinelli also served as co-producer. * 1/2 from ****
