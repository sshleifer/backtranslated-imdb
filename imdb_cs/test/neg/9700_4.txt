While the new movie Pride & Prejudice is amazing and the soundtrack is beautiful, we don't see Pride and Jane Austen's prejudices. The film is for some reason established in early 1790, rather than the Regency period where the novel is set, as scholars have long shown. Bennets' Longbourn estate is ram-shackled and looks like a cold Comfort Farm. But the Bennets in the novel are a noble class; they own a farm, but the pig does not pass through the house, nor is the farmyard of manure and chicken dung adjacent to the home. The scenes are re-set from the novel, and to remember, Jane Austen has placed scenes in certain places for some reason. For example, the film puts a great Darcy design scene outside in a storm in front of the Neoclassical Temple, as opposed to within Collins' parish: Why Jane Austen put it in the rectory? Because while Lizzy and Darcy speak utterly, if there is brutal honesty in this scene, the Collins never shared the word of honor. Why rain and outdoor design? Looks like meeting Jane Eyre with Rochester! And when Elizabeth walks on a windy field to stand on a cliff and see the skyline, she is expected to cry at any moment, "Heathcliffe!" Austen was Bronteized! Judy Dench is a great actress, but Lady Catherine is supposed to be high and imaginative. Petite Tom Hollander is a great actor, but Mr. Collins is described in the novel as tall and hard-looking, suggesting that his horrible dance with the poor Lizzy is an elephant. Matthew MacFayden is another of my favorites from MI-5 to A&E; however, at P&P he is rather a young Heathcliffe who never smiles - though Austen observes Darcy smiles a little on Lizzy, and realizes it when she sees her gorgeous funny portrait in Pemberley - a portrait that is in this movie somehow reason is replaced by a carved marble bust. And much of Austen's dialogue turns into modern speech. Mr. Bingley was transformed into such a clown that you wonder why Darcy would have him as a friend and why Jane Bennet loves him. The bottom line is that while it's a great movie to watch and hear, it departs from Jane Austen's novel so much that any student who watched it, thinking that it could replace reading for reading, would fail!
