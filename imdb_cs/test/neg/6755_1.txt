I was totally deceived by the commentary on this film, mainly because someone said they saw it at the film festival and loved it every minute. I expected it to be a nice run in the American-style movie style, I was deeply disappointed. First, working with the camera is terrible, I don't think the director knows that cameras can move around scenes rather than stay calm and have the actors move close and far apart. Second, Scenery! My God, I've seen more equipment in the bird's nest. The club was totally unconvincing when about three accessories danced in the back at one point. The flats were bare and lacking in personality. Third, Actors. Wow. The director apparently went for the typical character of the "Reaper" character, the silly main character with the gruff "I don't give a f ** k" character that takes pots to the main. Everything the main character said and did was a chore so much that made me. Overall, the plot, allegedly a major theme of revenge, took about 30 seconds and lacked any real motivation. The characters behaved irrationally and did not seem to have any real relationship with anyone else. No character has any depth to them, they can also have cardboard cutouts walk around a static camera. <br /> <br /> A really horrible piece, worse than the first year students 2 minutes short on youtube. Counseling to the Director? Change your name and deny any film association that is likely to sell one copy for sale at Ohio Shipyard.
