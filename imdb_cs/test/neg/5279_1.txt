Low budget "movies" like this just give me hope as a novice screenwriter. In other words, if there are people who are willing to finance a piece of schlock than it is much more than a glimpse of hope for someone like me who can actually write stories. This movie is there or I should say "down there" with Ed Wood of the world. The story, if you can call it, and dialogue, not to mention the sophisticated act of acting, is the passage to the genre itself. Someone should drive through this stinking horse when it was still on paper. It follows that since the literature has been largely killed, the film should follow. If you want to have a good or even pass-through movie, you must have at least decent writing. The legendary Curt Siodmak floats to mind. They used a lot of his stories for low budget movies when they came back, but they still look like good, serious entertainment, ie "Donavan's brain". Casting for this "job" should seriously consider going back to work in their respective hamburger joints or shoe stores and forgetting any future weak attempts to appear in front of the camera. Avoid this, like the plague itself !!!
