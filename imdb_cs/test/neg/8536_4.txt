After problems in Chicago, the Solomon family moves to a remote farm in North Dakota to start again, but their attempts at idyllic agricultural life are disrupted when their teenage daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart) and her 3-year-old brother Ben begin to see and be attacked by supernatural beings that will not allow them to live in peace. The messengers begin decently, even if they eventually become a general horror movie that is much more fun than scary. After reading the assumption, I thought it might be a decent movie because it sounded scary and had the potential. Unfortunately, the film did not use its potential, although I should have expected it because the trailer was terrible. The scenario was probably the worst part. It was full of silly sequences and flawless dialogue. The characters did not develop at all and most of them acted like a bunch of idiots, so it was hard for them to feel sympathy. Directors did a terrible job of building tension. Mostly they relied on cheap fears like loud sounds and random jumps. The music was really at the top and it just made it easier for the viewer to wire another "scary" moment. I also didn't like how much they used one place for the whole movie. The house was the centerpiece of the story, and that's where most of the shooting took place, so it was a bit boring after a while to see the same area. I also didn't like the close-ups of the actors. During the conversation, the camera would twitch from character to face in five seconds and be really uncomfortable. The directors have created a decent atmosphere and get some points for their film being stylish. However, since we have come a long way in terms of style and effects, it's not really that hard to make your movie look pretty, especially if you're working on a Hollywood movie. Acting was cruel and if this film was released in December, I'm sure he would have received several Razzie nominations. Kristen Stewart showed some talent in the Panic Room, but you couldn't say she has talent by watching her performance in The Messengers. She was fine when she was frightened and that's it. The rest of the time was dry and unconvincing. Penelope Anne Miller was just awful when it came to everything. It sounded like reading her lines and having some of the worst facial expressions I've ever seen. Dylan McDermott was only very wooden and showed almost no emotion. John Corbett gave the best performance and had some good scenes. The twins, who played Ben, were also decent and managed to behave many adult actors. Overall, this lame horror movie is not worth watching because it is a lack of clarity and lazy film-making. Rating 4/10
