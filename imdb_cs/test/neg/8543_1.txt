Franco movies can be divided into 4 categories - "ears" (often black and white and resourceful), "naughty" (late 1960s / early 1970s often included Soledad Miranda), "nudies" nudity as a fence fence) and "rest". This is part of the "rest". It's not a cannibal movie at all. It's definitely not gorefest. Few women in the picture do not lose their lumbar fabric and there are few frontal things. The picture quality on the German DVD I watched is bad. The film haunts (to the extent that it sometimes catches fire). As a Franca fan, I'd tell others not to bother. Do something different with your time ... read the book .... you get a copy of "Women in Cellblock 9" ... something really ...
