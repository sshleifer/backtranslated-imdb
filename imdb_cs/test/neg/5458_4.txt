I am shocked that all "hated" ratings are six and seven, still above average. It seems to me that this case "the emperor has no clothes". I understand that this film was made on a very low budget in the early 70s ... No matter that it became a fight to sit and watch. The DVD I saw had several subtitles, but about 75% of the speech is not subtitles. Some of them are hard to understand. The Jamaican patois was cold to hear him, but after a while you can't "tweak". Some shots were nice and realism was there, although some of the performances were not great (Jimmy Cliff did a good job) The plot is not bad but quite predictable. In 1:43, Jimmy Cliff (Ivan) is the highlight singing for the scene and a few shots and fighting. About 15 minutes or so. The rest is pretty boring. BTW, near the beginning of the movie, there are some strange cuts with Ivan's character that look like an editing bug that made me laugh a little. One reviewer said that the film was so many times shortened that there were only a few copies of the original theatrical version of 1972. The end was so interesting as it shows how the media from a young age affect people, it could also be a general note about the influence of white man on colonial influence in Jamaica. Other major topics are poverty, corruption, church, ambition ... At the end, the soundtrack, the film much less.
