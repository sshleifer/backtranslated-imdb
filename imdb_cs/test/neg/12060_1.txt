1st Watched 7/19/2003 - 1 of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): A ridiculously lame 3D movie that largely follows the plot of many 80s teen slasher flicks. Silly children go to a famous murder camp, they are hunted by an unknown masked man, and then we try to find out who, if anyone lives. We really don't care who's behind the mask, but it's not even hard to tell if you've seen any of these movies. What a waste of 3D viewer despite somewhat subtle 3D effects.
