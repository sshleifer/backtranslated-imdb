There is simply no quality about this film. OK, some costumes are fine, but there is nothing you can't see, let's say Conan flicks. And what about Ator's hair? I can't believe it's part of the show! I will say one thing about this movie: it was considered bad enough for a fair lampooning from the early cast of MST3K and I suggest anyone who is curious enough to see how bad this movie is to watch this version of the movie for moral support if nothing else.
