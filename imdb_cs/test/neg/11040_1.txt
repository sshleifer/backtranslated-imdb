Obviously, when one of my friends recommended it to me, about how well it was filmed, about the basic themes and the general size of the movie, I was expecting an amazing, at least funny movie. The clock I spent watching was a huge disappointment to my time. I understand that this film is supposed to be unreal, but even in surrealistic films there is something that anchors it, even if it is in the least. This film, on the other hand, felt forced and fake. Many shots were pointless and I watched as I thought the director was trying to be artistic. Acting was bad, and the relationships between the characters were almost underdeveloped. Maybe I miss something that others might see, but I didn't even realize that there was some attraction between Dae su and Mig before they were copied like rabbits. Then again, maybe this movie was just bad. I'm not against the violence in the movies, but almost everything is unnecessary in this. During all the battle scenes, I felt myself crouching as it was all painfully clich√©. And conspiracy? The word laughter comes to mind. I would be amused if I didn't lose two hours of my life after this ill-conceived and absurd conspiracy. Despite all the shortcomings of the film, I was expecting something interesting at the end of the year. I will not discuss the end because I would not want to "spoil" the film for those who have not seen it. Just that the metaphor "Either the rock or the grain of sand, in the water it sinks." Can not be used to explain everything. <br /> <br /> This film was created only for shock and shock values. I hope that sooner or later people will cease to be so demanding and recognize a bad movie for what it is. I have seen many other great Korean movies and depresses me that people have gone to Oldboy as the best.
