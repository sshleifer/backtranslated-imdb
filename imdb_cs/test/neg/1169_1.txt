I own a holiday lake near Plainfield, WI. Ten minutes from Gein's property to be precise. I saw his country, the cemetery where he was buried, and where he was digging, and I was shopping in a hardware store that used to belong to the Worden family. When visiting relatives in California, we decided to rent this movie. It was disgusting. Ed Gein's real story is so disturbing and scary, why the creators of this piece of waste decided to make their own story behind me. The actor playing Ed is a very big man, Ed was a very small, humble and shy man. This is part of what makes his story so scary. He didn't have a helper to dig up the graves, and anyone who owns land in this area knows it's mostly sand with a little dirt. You won't break a lot of sweat digging holes. They didn't have to hire an actor with a wrestler figure, just get their research. And if writing wasn't bad enough - there are no mountains in Wisconsin and I'm sure 911 wasn't available in 1957.
