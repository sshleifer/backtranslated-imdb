Due to the topic of drug addiction down to the bones almost can not help but rather a depressing film. But depression does not necessarily mean bad. Unfortunately, in this case, it's actually pretty bad. The film has some good things to suit, especially Vera Farmiga's high-quality performance in the central role of Irene, a working mum struggling with cocaine addiction. But here's not good enough to prevail bad. The shortcomings of the film lie primarily in a story that cannot be captivated and never seems to get. Irene goes to rehabilitation and returns home to a clueless husband who has no idea how to support her attempt to dig a habit. Irene is approaching another recovering drug addict, a nurse from a rehabilitation center. Following complications. But the story never says life. The movie doesn't seem to go anywhere. You can say that this is a sharp, realistic view of the daily addict's struggles. Maybe, but in this case, it doesn't make an interesting movie. The whole thing is very "blah." Minimalist cinematography does not help, adding another incredible phrase to incredibly drab management. And none of the other performances measure up to Farmiga. Hugh Dillon is fine because Irenee's girlfriend, but no one else in the cast adds anything worthwhile to driving. Overall, this film is a bleak, depressing and somewhat boring ride.
