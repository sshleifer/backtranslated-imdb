Cheesy's "B" crime thriller of the early '50, the story is droll, wooden figures, Allison Hayes and Abbe Lane are the only two sexpots that make him eye-hunter, but one short shot, just a few shots long, showing "el" a train crossing a river on the State Street Bridge, from a 6000 series Pullman-built cars painted in their original 1950s painting system as they were delivered when new in the 1950s. For traction fans like me, that one short made the picture worthy. I think movies like this, Ulmer's DETOUR, D.O.A. with Edmund O'Brien, FUITITIVE with Harrison Ford, and other genres of noir film (big city crime dramas) are interesting if I recognize most of the city's streets intimately for nothing but knowing Chicago and San Francisco. Otherwise it's a really boring movie!
