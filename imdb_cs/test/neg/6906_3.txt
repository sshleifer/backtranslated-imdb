I took 4 years old twins to see this movie today and I wouldn't recommend it to children of their age. This film has had a lot of scenes around the world that I found too violent and my kids appeared scary. The theme was over the heads of my children, and the scene of death was too frightening for a children's caricature. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed because we were all looking forward to meeting it, but just didn't cut it. If you have children under 7, I would not recommend this movie. Also, the whole thing went crazy during the movie.
