The Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst exhibitions in the last 10 years. The scenario for James 'Jimmy' Trivette, Walker's Sidekick, is about as pathetically written as part of Wesley Crusher's Star Trek TNG and is playing about that belief. <br /> <br /> do not respond to how people react to things in real life - everyone is polarized - everyone is either a very good person or a bad person (unless Walker has two minutes of talk with them and then changes immediately) ). That's not how it works. This show will not take place in this reality. Render lines are about as realistic as Ona Wrote's murder, a show where an arrogant old lady can just walk into people's homes without being angry. it may require police officers to do what they want and bend back to it. With Walker, everyone at the show, including the "bad guys," behaves like a hero from which myths and fairy tales are made, and time itself bends to his whim. The lines that sometimes come out of the mouth of the people at this show are off the ridiculous. It is as if the screenwriter for Wesley Crusher (for "serious" parts) and screenwriter for Bob Saget's most entertaining home videos (for "humor" parts) have gathered and written all the scripts for that show. This show is for people who think good always outweighs evil. It's for the elderly. It's for pious thinkers. It's for people who want to always have a happy ending. It's for people who want to drift into oblivion. It's for people whose drug choice is their television. Every time I see an ad for this show, I crouched. My opinion is that it is the worst show on television in the last 10 years. Chuck Norris I liked, but this show ruined him forever in my mind. I can't even watch his older movies without thinking about this show.
