I watched briefly for the first few episodes and felt I couldn't take it anymore. Terrible looking combat scenes are the worst I've ever experienced in my life. About one third of each episode is dedicated to Flash Gordon and its "powerful" combat movements. I know the battle choreography of that time is not exactly the level of today's standards, but that is ridiculous. She doesn't even try to make it look realistic. Flash Gordon, barely reminiscent of a warrior, uses his drunken slow movements and bare fists to knock out four or five boys with knives, weapons and other weapons. Give me a break! There is also a scene where he does some similar action while in the water. Basically every episode has similar scenes. As for the rest of the episode, I don't remember anything. Basically, I saw it out of curiosity about what science-fiction looked like 70 years ago.
