I completely forgot that I saw it in a few days, which is quite revealing in itself. The eleventh version of Gaston's Phantom from the Leroux Locked Door Secret of Leroux, I hear it's an engaging and funny update. So it looked like a nice title and a few neat shots in the opening scene, but the movie stopped very quickly and became uncertain of the boring and utterly unsatisfactory. The main problem is a secret. that it is fundamentally unsolvable by the audience: as the worst of Agatha Christies, it depends on the character that appears in the final act with the amount of background information we have not been informed about. As a movie, be it a comedy or a thriller, the key problem is that characterization almost does not exist. With the exception of the murderer, all are typical versions of typical suspects in a typical country murder story - a reporter, a threatened heiress, a suspicious fianc√©, a father with scattered scientists (surprisingly poor Michel Lonsdale), etc. depth and little interest, and often too mature or poorly estimated performances they will not help. You honestly don't care about anyone in it, so there's no danger or tension. Only Claude Rich and Pierre Arditi in the last reel will get the job done, and only in the last reel will the film get closer to a feeling of resonance that is too ephemeral to be really effective. For others, we get an endless exposure and a few inefficient comic comics (promising with a photographer trapped in grandfather's clock is too badly thought to pay off), with Dennis Podalydes reduced to Irving Explain the last third of the picture. I don't like movies in country houses or in the style of what's Agitha Christie-style, so those who might quote it are much more relaxed, but I've found it a bad show. As Rich says when a secret is revealed, "It's all more like a disappointment."
