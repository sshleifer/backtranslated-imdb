*** SPOILERS *** This movie called EATEN ALIVE here in the UK is perhaps the worst movie ever made and is great for it. A sexy rich girl joins a rough action man to seek her sister in the New Guinea jungle. What follows is an unspeakably stupid mixture of cannibalism, mad cults and religious maniacs, which must be considered believers. The cannibalism scenes are pretty scary, but they are so poorly staged and acted to prove quite amusing. The cast is terrible except Janet Agren, who is excellent. Look at the scene where she is stripped naked and covered in gold! My rating - 1 of 10.
