Big Fat Pet 'Uncle Buck', played by John (eat-a-lot-of) Candy, visits healthy members of his family for a week to give baby-sit two cute kids (Gaby Hoffman and MacCauley Culkin) and a handsome but snobber teenager ( Jean Louisa Kelly). Shenanigans begin when Buck makes breakfast, and then tries to sleep in a bed of two sizes that is too small for his body to emerge. Mostly boring, but dotted with two or three funny scenes, including Buck, trying to get on the phone with his angry girlfriend (Amy Madigan) and his meeting with a very disgusting clown. Candy looks like it weighs 600 pounds.
