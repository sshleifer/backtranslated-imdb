Now I watched it when I was one Sunday and my aunt and uncle went with my two cousins ​​one day (one was 11, the other 9). We got stuck on TV and just started a passport to Paris. My cousins ​​both said they sometimes look at Two Of A Kind and I said they can watch the movie if they like it. Because I was in no condition to get up, I stayed with them in the living room and ended up with the movie! I have to say that as a person who is not interested in these kinds of TV shows or movies, I really enjoyed it ... it had to be alcohol, but I admit that it would probably only be more attractive for girls between 6 and 13 But it was a movie to go through time. There is always a movie or a show you don't think you will like, but you enjoyed it for laughter.
