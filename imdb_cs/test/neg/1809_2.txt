Made for the TV version of Heart of Darkness, it seemed a good way to add more insight into the book, that was a bad assumption. The film got worse. I was very disappointed with almost everything in the movie. I was hoping the movie might help put together books that I didn't understand, but didn't do anything like that. It still left me confused and hung up. It's one of those movies that makes you feel like it's more fun to watch the grass grow instead of watching the movie. It's not just a cup of tea. It was a scary, boring and slow movie overall. First of all, Nicolas Roeg had to be quite desperate when he decided to want to make a boring book in the movie. . It is a guaranteed loss. It's like going to a knife fight, but forgetting a knife on the kitchen counter. The headless man loses; and in this case the headless person was Roeg. All I heard about the movie is bad stuff, and the film deserves the bad things to say about it. From watching the movie, I had the impression that the people who made the movie just went over the book to get the key points. In addition, even though the film was following the main story of the book, it missed a few details and changed the ending. I'm not a fan of it. Roeg missed when Marlow and his crew came across a Russian sailor camp and found a book in the camp. It also didn't show up when they came across a sign in the camp saying "Wood for you. Hurry up. Carefully approach" (Conrad 110). Also at the end of the book, Kurtz dies on a boat, not on an indoor station. Conversely, Nicolas Roeg did one good thing while he did his film; he managed to hire a few pretty decent actors to play in the movie. For example, he won Tim Roth and John Malkovich, both of whom would later continue to have successful careers. In doing so, he added a bit of a horrible movie. Also, even though I ripped his book into pieces, I have some respect for it because it takes a lot of courage to try and accept the Heart of Darkness. It is not the simplest novel ever made in film. A little brave effort! Finally, if for some reason someone really wants to watch this movie, I recommend first reading the Heart of Darkness. This way you will have all the scenes that have been dropped from the movie and you will not be completely lost when you look at it. But I really recommend that you not read the book and not really watch the movie; both will be a complete waste of time. Believe me. I was forced to do both my English teacher, and now I want the book and the film not to exist. If the book or movie is watched, good luck!
