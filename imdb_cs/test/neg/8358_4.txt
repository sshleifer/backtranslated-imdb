It was almost impossible for me to empathize with Ricci's character in this film. If she were to be depressed, I think that the writer and director neglected to research depressants before she did this film, because Ricci's character was more of a self-centered, worthless sh! Tbags than victims and survivors of depression. The forced attempt at introspective narration was as ridiculous as the painful interactions between her and the people around her. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I couldn't buy it. This is right on the schlock video. I'm glad I didn't pay it.
