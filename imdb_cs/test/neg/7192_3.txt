Johnnie (Bert Wheeler) is a singer-songwriter; Newton (Robert Woolsey) is an inventor. They both work in a cigar stand in the office building lobby. Johnnie wants to sell the song Winfield Lake, a song publisher who also owns a building. Lake Secretary, Mary (Betty Grable), is Johnnie's darling. When Lake appears dead, circumstances are conspiring to make Mary and Newton think Johnnie is a murderer. Again, they conspire that Mary, who goes to prison, get involved. But who really shot Lake? Who is the Black Widow, the blackmail that threatened him? Other characters in this mysterious mysterious murder are: Lake's suspicious wife, a confident private detective, a seemingly thoughtful janitor (Willie Best), Lake Auditor, a composer who thinks Lake is stealing from him and others who think everyone is stealing it. It depends on Newton and his right machine to reveal the real killer. Infant car with baby and Woolsey's smoldering cigar hit me as arbitrary pairing, but in the 1930s they made several films together. some of them were funny. Not this. George Stevens, who continued to have a distinguished career, directed this pitiful comedy with a tedious mysterious plot of murder. But two scenes are good, both the Wheeler and Betty Grable feature sing excellent "Music in My Heart," written by Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh. For the first time, they sing it up the stairs (after which they dance back down). Later, Wheeler and Woolsey are on stilts so that they can see and talk to Mary, who is in a prison cell on a high floor. Wheeler and Grable sing to each other through bars. "The Nitwits" has a few laughs, but the level of comedy is best illustrated by the Woolsey line: "Sonny, you have the brain of a six-year-old boy and I bet he was glad to get rid of him. It's diluted Groucho, who didn't use unnecessary "i" when he said it.
