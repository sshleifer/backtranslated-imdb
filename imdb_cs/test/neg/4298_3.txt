I don't see a sense of going through so many problems to make such a movie, and then I throw a history book out the window. There was no single detail in this movie than the fact that Richtofen died, which I was grateful for at the end, so I didn't have to watch. Films like this are an insult to anyone who knows something about the history of WWI air war. I will skip the fact that they flew Fokker DVII in 1916 because Blue Max did it too, or that the Squadron 209 flew to SE-5 and attacked the other parts. On the one hand, the Pfalz D-III says "the old Albatros" at the beginning. For another, they have Voss, Goring, and Wolff all in Jasta Boelcke. Only who was in it Jasta was Voss, and he joined after Boelcke died. Richtofen was not guilty of Boelcke's death ... Erwin Boehme, who collided with Boelcke, turned to avoid the British aircraft that Richtofen was chasing. When Richtofen received his head injury, it was a two-seat attack on the FE-2d, and he did not crash into the trenches and the soldiers fight over him, and no .. Werner Voss did not die that day. He died on September 28 in one of the most epic battles of the First World War. Manfred was short, not an actor who rode over everyone else. His brother Lothar had never been to Jasta Boelcke, nor had he joined the squadron when Manfred was in charge of Jasta 11. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are so many other glaring mistakes that I'll let them go except the worst , scene of death. In the movie Manfred is Brown-maneuvered and then shot down, making a perfect landing. Brown stepped out of Richtofen one morning while Richtofen chased May, and the facts gathered over the years show tremendously that Richtofen was killed by ground fire, not Brown. The only value in this movie was the chance to see the flying scenes as good as "The Blue Max", except I won't watch it again and I paid $ 30 per tape!
