Sites start at "Chicago: the current day" as four electricians, Dean (Richard Grieco), Ray (Richard Yearwood), Sheldon (Jeffrey Douglas) & Junior (Jason Jones) are about to unplug the unused building planned for demolition. When they look for the appropriate cables and things, they come across a set of doors that should not be where they should be printed by building. computers and scientific machines. When they are playing with some buttons, the parallel universe portal opens, Dean & Junior accidentally "falls" with Ray and Sheldon, who follows soon after seeking their friends. Unfortunately, they all ended up in an exact parallel Earth, which was taken over by a mutant spider that either eats people or transforms them into mutated soldiers with which it protects itself and does what it wants. Desperate to survive, he teamed up with some of the latest people, including the original inventor of the Dr. Richard Morelli (Colin Fox), who says that with the help of our electricians he could (yeah) be able to build another portal that would bring them back home ... <br /> <br /> Edited and directed by David Wu I thought That Webs is pretty crap, it's as simple and straight as it really does. Grenville Case & Robinson Young is absurd when I say the least and has holes in it that you can drive a tank, for example, is this movie really trying to suggest that several mutant spider things are not bigger than a few people in size have taken over the world? How did they do that? If this parallel Earth was the same as ours, where was hell an army? Police? All our weapons? Several fragile viewfinders against literally billions of people?! The whole flawed, stupid, and downright naff concept constantly imitated me throughout the film. Let's not forget that there is an inter-dimensional portal to the parallel Earth in the basement of most buildings that have been sitting there undisturbed for decades and remain in perfect condition, right? Then there is a case-sized nuclear reactor, the fact that one electrician can make sure that it works completely cleanly by accidentally pressing a few buttons in a room that has about 100 spaced on dozens of pieces of equipment and what an amazingly thoughtful guy who sets up an explosive a bobby trap at his base without telling anyone what if one of his friends put him up and found himself in pieces by their home bomb friends? Wouldn't you be best if you? What about food? Are they grown in small vegetable patches? I could go on and all day about how wrong, badly conceived, and poorly written Sites are, but I can't bother. The character is clich√© and unpleasant, as is the film as a whole, which obviously does not help. The only half of the decent thing I can say about Webs is that it is short and moves at a fair pace, but when everyone said and done, it's still stupid. Wu Director has to take a big blame here, the film looks cheap to start with, and editing that is credited is terrible. There are a lot of unpleasant slow motion shots coming out of the blue, the action scenes are almost identical and very quickly become incredibly boring. He uses this very annoying quick cut technique along with a bit of an old jerky camera, now I don't know of anyone else, but I hate this style of editing because it looks like a totally incoherent mess. In fact, I don't know one person doing anything like that, and I'm confused about why filmmakers think people do. Forget all the gore, just a few shots of shotgun spider zombie soldier guys & don't have red blood anyway, so it's not related to reality in my mind. <br /> <br /> Webs was made for -TV, the US channel Sci-Fi I think it looks like every cheap, low budget and rushed as you would expect. It's all so bland, forgetful, flat and boring. Special effects are far from strange, and the spider's thing lacks imagination when it is finally revealed. Acting was fine because everything else was so bad and I still can't believe the Grieco sweater was wearing this. Webs is crap, I can't say anything good about it other than I was sitting in worse movies & that's the only reason I didn't give it 1 star and a quick look at IMDb user ratings for Webs confirms what I already knew she had more '1' voices than any other & there is a very good reason why ...
