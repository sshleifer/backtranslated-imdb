Holy cow, what piece of film is. I didn't do how these filmmakers could take a 250 word book and turn it into a film. I think they didn't even know! I don't remember any fucking or moaning in the book, right? They took the child's classics all the time, added some fucking, clanking, and sexual inuindo and prostituted them into KAKA's joke. This should give you a good idea of ​​what these Hollywood manufacturers think. I have to say, visually it was interesting, but the brilliant visual story is destroyed by toiletry humor (if you even think such a thing is funny) I don't want kids I know it is. > <br /> Don't let your kids see, don't rent a DVD. I hope Dr. Suess' spirit spirit will come and haunt the people who made this movie.
