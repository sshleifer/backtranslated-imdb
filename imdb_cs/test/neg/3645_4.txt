I was looking forward to watching this film and it contains very interesting perspectives from Iraqis all over the country, not only in large areas. However, as the film continued, and seemingly more and more unilaterally, I began to wonder who modified the film. Of course, to get a few hundred hours to just 80 minutes, it had to be decided. I'd really enjoy the movie that showed how everyday Iraqis felt on every side of the problem, but with newspaper headlines as opposed to what people said, and everyone in the movie who has the end Same opinion, I thought it was obvious that the adjustments were made with a pre-conceived bias. <br /> <br /> could be such a great movie.
