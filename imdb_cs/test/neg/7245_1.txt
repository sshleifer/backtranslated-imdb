This was by far the worst movie I've ever seen. And this is compared to Alexander, Fortress 2 and New World. <br /> <br /> I should go back to the blockbuster and ask for my money back with the replacement because it was a truly traumatic experience. For the first ten minutes I changed my zoom on my widescreen TV because the actors seemed to be off screen. I didn't think it was possible to make such a bad movie on this day and age, I was wrong. When writing this report, I was thinking about a good reason to buy this movie. Joke present for Christmas. I blame the lady for this when she chose her, thanks babe. <br /> <br /> Be warned ....... Real shock all round !!!!!!
