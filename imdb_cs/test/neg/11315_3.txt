Give director Stanley Tong of Jackie Chan's Super Cop and Rumble in the Bronx and what do you get? You get a series of kung fu fights and a lack of madness similar to magoo. The limited land has Magoo (Leslie Nielsen) embedded in international land, where it steals the world famous jewel. Of course he has no idea what he's doing. In fact, he has no idea he has a gem. You can be very bored in thirty minutes when you watch it. There are some very funny moments, though like when cooking chicken. You'll want you to be as close as Magoo is. It's a fun movie to watch but its quite a disaster! You have to love Leslie Nielson because a very funny movie was made. This is not his best, but he has a good job playing Magoo. I thought it was a funny movie and it should be recommended to young children because they will probably think it's very funny.
