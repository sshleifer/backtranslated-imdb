I'm obviously disappointed, so I'll be brief and I won't waste my time. First, the plot was uninspired ... at least. The animation was even worse, we were in 2008 for God and it looked like a shinier version of G.I.Joe. Nor do I bother to characterize the performance of actors and dialogues. Or maybe I'll just because I saw that you need 10 lines (?! ??! ??!) To write a comment. Where were we? Oh yeah, it was completely flat, lacking passion and talent when I was excused. Just like dialogues, as well as acting, no commemorative quotes, nothing anyone would expect. Hopefully the movie will be decent ... at least.
