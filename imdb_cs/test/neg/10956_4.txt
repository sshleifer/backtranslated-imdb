This is a wonderfully bad b-movie. In fact, it's much better quality than many b movies. He had a consistent scenario, decent direction, cinematogrpahy, and I saw worse acting. The zombies were great, clearly these were Romero zombies, and was a really interesting zombie story. Of course not Oscar material, and if your not into zombie movies, or b-movies you probably won't enjoy it, but if you like this movie. He's pretty good, though they never clearly explain how he can heal from shots and zombie bites. But if he has more than just a line of dialogue where his bad behavior is really evident. It was a good end, at least I thought so. Romero should be flattered if he saw it.
