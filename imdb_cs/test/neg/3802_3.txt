Perhaps here in Sydney we are all side by side and as a result we get into carousels like this s-eek! -Uel in elegant theaters. Released here in the 1980s this cheerful all-tar drama was greeted with a howling pleasure at a meeting I attended. In fact, viewers were so sad antics on the screen it played as a Rocky Horror session. Within 5 minutes we all knew it was a real catastrophe: a tugboat scene where you see the buckets of water thrown from the off-set. after that, each patron was behind him, and the cinema rang with advice, cheering for bad behavior and overwhelming reactions. Shooting in the space between the boxes is especially stupid and allows drunk viewers to watch friends in the changed states to contribute appropriately. I call these films with Michael Caine his holiday home movies because I always expect them to agree with them because he saw a house he likes and doesn't want to spend his savings. Like Jaws 3 or 4 or whatever was called.
