Rodrigo Garcia's "Nine Lives" scene comes when Sissy Spacek, hidden in a hotel room, where she and Aiden Quinn play with Aiden Quinn, finds a TV documentary about nature. -disparate shots are edited into one scene, predators and prey are thrown together in order to capture the moment - all make the connection where none actually exist. The characters in the nine shorts that make up this movie sometimes get into stories, but none of them seem to really come together. A woman preparing for a violent confrontation with her violent father is later seen working in a hospital room where another woman prepares for mastectomy. A man who encounters an old girlfriend in the supermarket and sees how his life would later be hosted, with his current wife, a party for an unhappy couple. Garcia arranges some of his characters in front of him, but none of the following stories ever really build on what came earlier. Garcia is the first movie, wonderful, overlooked "Things You Can Say, Just Looking At Her," also had a short story structure and overlapping characters, but there were fewer of them and they had much more The humble assumption of "Nine Lives" that each of his nine stories is narrated in a single, uninterrupted real-time reception will never allow the film to create any real dramatic tension or momentum. The shots are often muddy and hard to trace, while other scenes - especially where the girl goes back and forth between rooms to talk to her noncommunicative parents - are uncomfortable with camera work. and that he has a serious history of directing for television, this film is somewhat surprisingly amateur in this film. Lega-filmmaker-child-of-great-writer Rebecca Miller, Garcia (son of Gabriel Garcia Marquez) focuses on writing and character aspects of his films often at the expense of film-making ones. <br /> <br /> The individual scenes touch and even affect. I liked Jason Issacs kissing the pregnant belly of Robin Wright Penn. And Joe Mantegna whispered lovingly to his wife as he slips into preoperative sedation. And Sissy Spacek stole some happy moments away from her life with Aiden Quinn before she came back to him with a call from her daughter. The film (as opposed to "the things you can only say by looking at it") feels more like an exercise than a real drama. We're just watching people behave.
