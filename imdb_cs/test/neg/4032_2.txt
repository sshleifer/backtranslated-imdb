I can say, according to other comments, that NOBODY can sometimes really enjoy this tiny piece of crap, that's the same way I felt. <br /> <br /> All the while I was watching I was horrified that someone could make the movie that stupid! What's the world? I think it's my fault I was sitting in the whole movie (ugh!), But it was like a bad car wreck, I couldn't turn away. <br /> <br /> If you are a child under 8, you may like this movie. Otherwise keep away from it at any cost. It's the stupidest movie I've ever seen. Everything is stupid - story, script and most of all acting, everything! When watching a movie, you either turn off the TV and think "how can the film be so stupid" or watch curiosity to see if things can be stupid than this (they can't). Br /> <br /> These filmmakers (if you can tell them that they) need to seriously return to their daily job, neither of them has talent talent, and I very much doubt that you can live in such a way that you renounce this way. terrible useless garbage that no one in their right mind would ever want to see! Don't waste your time.
