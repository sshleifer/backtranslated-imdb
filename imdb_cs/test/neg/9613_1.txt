The "Frenzy", which has recently appeared, with the greetings of most critics, recently made British TV bikes. I remember seeing it in my original release, and then when I thought that if Hitchcock wanted to show some sort of screen confession about his ingrained misogynism, he couldn't bump into the more outrageous vehicles. But time is changing perspective, and so what was naive in 1972 might be worth rethinking in the years to come. <br /> <br /> Maybe. . . but not. 'Frenzy' is a slag. The wreckage of an aging director who desperately wanted to use the artistic freedom of filming in the 1970s without realizing that freedom imposes its own duties - especially the need to bring integrity to its work. none here. And not much evidence of the former director's brilliance â€” nor the transition from the backbone armor, which is implicit to the explicit one, is neither shocking nor for a stylish stylist: it's just trivial (a long-standing murder scene is exactly that: extended, no pace, for no reason, without the purpose of being the cheapest director's desire to appear as a contemporary artist, he said, the other acclaimed cheap sleaze practitioner, Michael Winner). And that goes from bad to worse, with a dialogue that defies any human provenance (not least in the ridiculous distraction to the Home of Life of our dear inspector and his wife's cooking). Maybe the scene that best describes 'Frenzy' (and Hitchcock's most obvious indictment) is clunking an exchange between two lawyers at the bar to discuss serial killings and then agree that at least women have a good time first by raping. I remember my resistance that scene came back in '72, and it's still intact because it wasn't Hitchcock smart, or sardonic, or was trying to make some universal point (big topics, great truths, not Hitchcock's forte , nor personal preference). Just Hitchcock, allowing the reflection of his own distorted mirror to life shine through the texture of the film. Calling 'Frenzy' Hitchcock's last great masterpiece is betraying little if any understanding of what Hitchcock actually accomplished in the movie trick, film excitement and dazzling movie mastery. "Frenzy" is now what it has always been: a cheap, ugly and ham video that was useless to any of those involved, or to the filmmaker who was in his Hollywood days really one of the greatest ever.
