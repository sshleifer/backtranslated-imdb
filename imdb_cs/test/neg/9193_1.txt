Wow - Thank God I was on the plane and I could look out the window. Bad Hollywood fire scenes, predictable, terribly behaving (who the hell was that terrible woman who played wife?), Badly thrown, terribly written. Apparently, this film was designed to appeal to the kind of person who is willing to kneel at either alternate firefighters specifically, "Heroes" or gods in general, I think. I don't have enough bad things to say about the movie. It couldn't be cheap with all the stars in it, and with all the special effects and fire scenes. It must have cost wealth, but it was still worse than any movie I even remember. Funeral scene? Surprisingly bad. Courtship between a fireman and the aforementioned terrible woman? Corny, fancy, trite. Firehouse pranks? Not everyone wants us to be both masculine and elegant at the same time.
