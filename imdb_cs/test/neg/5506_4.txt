I can't help thinking that this is Frank's "anger" to the Marquis de Sade "One thousand days of Sodom." People (in this case women) kidnapped to serve as slaves to the privileged elite? Control. Kinky sex? Control. Torture including whipping? Control. Random Victims to Be Killed? Control. Thank goodness that Franco did not go all the pig and introduced the audience to the cinema delicacies (and actually coprophagy), another perversion that has repeatedly emerged in de Sade for a lengthy and disgusting saga. <br /> <br /> I was hoping this movie was in the "bad way, it's good" category. But even acres of naked body and numerous sexual encounters have not replaced the dismal dialogue, the terrifying act, the elusive plot, and - just to give it a pewter hat - dubbing and English subtitles (strip and braces missing) from female costumes). However, Alsation performed very professionally. Of course I was wrong at de Sade's angle. After all, I didn't realize that the actor playing in the prison was trans-sexual. In the future, I have to pay more attention to the size of people's hands. According to another reviewer, the movie was banned in the UK. Well, it's not any more, although I like the nipple needle scene cut out to satisfy the censors. On the DVD I watched, it was clearly visible only on a Spanish trailer (which, if you were wondering, I watched it to compare it with the English one). with Jess Franco, even if you need better Spanish than mine to understand. If I'm not mistaken, it's neither dubbed nor subtitled. And he points out that the person who disgraced the character played by Franco is Ajita Wilson's mustache mask. A kind of irony because he had surgically removed the needed trailer.
