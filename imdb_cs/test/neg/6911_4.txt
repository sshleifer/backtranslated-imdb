There seems to be an entire sub genre of cheap, tired old sexual "comedies" that say the same old things about middle class pairs. A bit like Friends, but with more soft porn and no joke. This film is no exception - the situation was so familiar that I died from deja vu. People sat on the couches, inventing clich√©s about sex and relationships? Control. Monogamy versus cheating with a woman / man who would never know twice in fact with any other woman / man? Control. PORN BADDIES !!!! Control. Some guy / girl in him who becomes the only reason you're looking at this waste? Control. It seems that the lesson is when he doubts that a tired old sexual "comedy" about people that no one cares to make a statement that everyone has heard three times. It will be your movie. It will even attract some sitcom nobody in bad wig!
