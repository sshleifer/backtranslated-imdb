An object lesson on how to make a bad movie that masks like Horror. Without getting close, I would imagine that these are the results of a lot of all film school students who add pieces to the story and then really go! It's like a film workshop of some sort and her film needs an editor - in which case it would take 10 minutes! The director of this waste probably had more money than sense. Consider the number of submitted scenarios or even unreleased movies that would benefit from it. The so-called grandmother who killed people in some pretty stupid ways looked like Christopher Lloyd in Back to the Future - or maybe musicians Johnny Winter / Edgar Winter. It starts with 20 minutes of boring nonsense that students have burned - something about paranoia. Giving this waste 1 is because it can't get less. He has no redeeming function - and when one of the girls thinks the body on the floor covered with blood is the one who's crazy about having to TASTE red things before he knows his ketchup! It's an insult to idiot intelligence
