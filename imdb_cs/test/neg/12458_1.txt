Why do people make bad movies? Didn't anyone know who in the picture knew what they were doing didn't make sense? There is something about this picture that threw me away, except that I found that this "movie" is unrealistic, pathetic and POORLY ACTED. I admire them as an attempt, but the "actors" in the film sometimes try hard and no single character has the essence or say something slightly intelligent. This film deserves zero stars. But I didn't have the chance to get 1.
