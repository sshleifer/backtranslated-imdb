This movie was horrible in one word. It was boring, predictable and downright scary. I waited for it to end, and when he did, I was horrified. The end left a bad taste in his mouth, at least. My advice to all those interested in films about starting female sexuality: stay away from this movie. Such films give classics like Lolita a bad name.
