The times I look back at high school and amazes me that I never went lower than Marvin in this BAD movie. Poor Marv is the main character who has bad luck and worse. Despite his intelligence, he manages to bully, exploit, support his miserable dead dad, and many other tricks, including brave robbery. Of course, the viewer does not feel any empathy in this film, so all these catastrophic senses are reflected as harmless zeta rays. Recommended for those days when you feel down, pop film and smile and say, "I'm so glad I'm not Marv!"
