I love documentaries. Andy Goldsworthy doc was great. I was looking forward to this one - but I was very disappointed. I knew about Kahn and I was fascinated by the idea of ​​his lonely death in Penn Station's male room. There must be a story, I mistakenly believed. The only story is a sadly deceived woman who has had problems with an ugly, well-known married man. In the absence of something like an explanation for this horrible behavior, we received infinitely repeated clips of Kahn walking and painfully long - allegedly contemplative - shots of his mindless buildings. The redesigned soundtrack refers to an emotional tug that is missing in the film. Kahn's obvious gifts do not justify his behavior or the torture of his mistresses. It seems that this film wants to give Kahn a great free passage of the artist, so the director and his mother become sympathetic figures - I don't buy it.
