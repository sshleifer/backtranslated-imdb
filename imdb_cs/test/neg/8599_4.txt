Now I like Johnny Vegas, which is a good start, I also like toilet humor <br /> <br /> Like Young Ones and Bottom, etc. But this couldn't bring a little smile at <br /> <br /> my face. The story follows Johnny after his wife <br /> <br /> chucks him out (getting his good-looking wife and baby dont know) <br /> <br /> as he tries to avoid anything that moves. Normally. I was looking forward to it, but I found it totally boring and waste my time completely. If you haven't caught anything to do for 90 minutes, except car wash, then don't bother ..... <br /> <br />
