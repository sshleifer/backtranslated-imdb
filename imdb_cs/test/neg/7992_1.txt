This film is only recommended for insomniacs: it makes it easier for them to sleep. Five-year-olds can also enjoy it. But for anyone else (including genre fans), what a boring thing! "Ancient" conspiracy resembles "Return of the Dragon", and this film is just as clumsy, but Nero is not Bruce Lee, so "Enter the Ninja" is an even worse movie. Until now, this is the second (offensive "comedy" "Bachelor Party" was the first) movie I gave 1/10.
