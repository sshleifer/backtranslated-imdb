A day in the life of a subdued cab driver sometime around Christmas: A taxi driver picks up the fare ... they have a "really smart" passage ... he gets rid of the fare ... he takes another fare. ... next interde ... so it's 90 minutes ... nothing of that convincing (or interesting) one minute ... SKIP IT!
