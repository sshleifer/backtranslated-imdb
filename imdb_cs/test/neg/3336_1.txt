French cinema sucks! With all those psychiatric visions with their different attitudes cultivated in my god-am-I! Pestilence to conceived symbolic film language and impenetrable ciphers!

Forty Years of Existentialist Sartras and Wives - What's New, Exciting? My God, is this woman here and she loves you and admires what would be more natural to be happy with her life? And if not, please explain much better why! The birth of French means you have to live extravaganza life, no escape, is that the thing?
