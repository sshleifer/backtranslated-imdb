And the only one, in my opinion. The reason is Margaret Leighton. She is a beautiful actress, on stage and on screen. However, we have few chances to see it. I think this is especially true in the United States. Here he plays a nice role. Not only that, but it is also very nice and should be like a bomb. Walter Pigeon does not keep the tradition of Drummond artists. It's always reliable, but it's not much fun. He's not a villain or a knight. As a result, it seemed to me like talky with little action or tension. But look at Leighton.
