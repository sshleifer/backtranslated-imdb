... You'll get that stupid excuse to tear the children's game! Man, what did they think? First it goes wrong with the horror movie Rumpelstiltskin. Fariy Tale haters! To be honest, I saw it as a kid, and it scared me a bit, just because I was aged with the assumption that Pinocchio wouldn't do it, wah wah wah. But I grew up and think about it as a rip of a children's game, a fairy tale about nonsense, and a lame Tales from the Crypt episode, or trying to be at least one, with a lame end that was stupid, and that was a lot of conspiracy holes, and I still can't understand how it came to life. Was it the work of the evil Geppett? Then, what happens after a few bad deeds to a real boy who becomes the most wanted American? Personally, I think the concept of evil Geppett sounds better, builds an army of wooden killers and starts a crime wave, funny. But this is terrible, terrible, terrible, awful, awesome! GOOD! Smelly like a shoe and terrible! IT SUCKED SUCKED! If you want killer puppets, settle for a killer doll, specifically a children's game, instead of strings. Or if you want a fairy tale character turned upside down, watch Leprechaun, or if you want Pinocchio, watch an animated Disnet version or live version with Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Martin Landau instead. >>>>> -10/10 (negative 10)
