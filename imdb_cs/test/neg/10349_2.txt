I tried to observe it twice, even though I was unable to make any episode. For me it's basically just funny. I can tell you where to laugh, but I can't. I've never seen an original, so I'm not comparing it. I also like comedies, including comedies like Married ... With Kids and Family Guy, but this show won't do it for me. Jokes are lame and flat, and acting is usually uncomfortable. The ads looked interesting but not. They are trying too hard to be different, and they are bound to make humor. This style usually doesn't work too well. I don't think this show ends the season. Of course I'm wrong.
