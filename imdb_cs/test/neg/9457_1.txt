Nothing, just the director's youthful fantasies come to life. This "movie" is nothing more than an excuse for a director / actor to play a kiss on a face with an attractive young woman who would otherwise never give him time of day. The storyline is simple, the direction is non-existent, and the film pulls while the actor / director / writer / narrator tells the story. Don't be fooled by 'X' ratings, not nudity and minimal gore.
