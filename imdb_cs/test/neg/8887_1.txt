According to this mockumentary, Chupacabra is a mysterious creature that has killed and consumed Hispanic goats in Latin America and Mexico for years. One has crossed the border to South Texas, and a cute, fearless cryptozoologist (no, I'm not <br /> <br /> make that word) go on an isolated ranch to find one. Her uncle <br /> <br /> was killed by the creature, and some grainy video footage of the monster <br /> <br /> exists. She takes a black black man with a gun and two <br /> <br /> cameramen (for easy editing coverage), and they go ahuntin 'for <br /> <br /> chupacabras. Ten minutes to the movie, they'll find it. The rest of the film has a team of documentary filmmakers who are attacked by a bloodthirsty monster and angry dialogue. At one point <br /> <br />, the team runs into a couple of hottie witches that lead them <br /> <br /> into the chupacabra's nest for $ 100. If only the FBI knew how Tex-Mex witches could be bought as informants. The entire <br /> <br /> decade of mythical news about the beast could be removed with an empty check <br /> <br />. Finally, after the bloody death of the characters, the goat's patoot does not give off, Chupacabra is captured, killed, and autopsied by <br /> <br />. The only point of the autopsy scene is to draw attention to the efforts of <br /> <br /> make-up department in such a cheap film. The movie is filmed on video, as is "BWP". cameraman <br /> <br /> Characters never reload their tapes or charge batteries. <br /> <br /> battery. The main actress is terrible here. The beauty of the average "BWP" <br /> <br /> was his use of improvisation during production. <br /> <br /> All lines are written here and shipped wrong. > <br /> Christmas event. The film is also tinged with racism. The only African-American <br /> <br /> here is a loud pistol matrix. In one place, when the crew breaks into an abandoned house <br /> <br /> they will find three illegal immigrants who ask them if they are from INS. Chortle, chortle. The monster itself is a guy in a rubber suit and nothing more. Such a disgusting and unpleasant beast is able to sneak at <br /> <br /> cast quite quietly, regardless of whether they have idiotically locked <br /> <br /> themselves in A giant cage like bait, or it doesn't seem to get just <br /> <br /> only the vehicle started. Gore is horrible, but when he is surrounded by this kind of stupidity, he loses all his effectiveness. I don't know if it was <br /> <br /> shot before or after "BWP" but I can honestly say it's the worst <br /> <br /> movie ever made in South Texas about the mythical beast . Pray <br /> <br /> There are no sequels, I'll start writing a letter campaign at <br /> <br /> Troma. It is rated (R) for strong physical violence, gun violence, strong <br /> <br /> gore and profanity. <br /> <br />
