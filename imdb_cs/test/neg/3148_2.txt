Being a child of the eighties, I grew up with numerous educational and diverse programs (or both) and I still learn so much from them that I admire the wisdom of those who worked on them. After learning that Sesame Street, to name the best example, was not only responsible for being able to read adultly before I could walk, it only increased the level of disgust that I felt not only against Lyons and its product . but also those who advocate them. As if I had confidence in those whom we are in charge of protecting us or our children to get started, the fact that Barney & Friends is still polluting our waves after more than a decade is discrediting not only the FCC, the US store and its creator. it is discredit for all mankind. In a world where I can be harassed without penalty by the police, social services, and child protection agencies simply because they were born differently from those in power, but broadcasters can pump this drive without any fault, ask what's wrong with people. You see, in a world where we are expected to behave like adults and take care of ourselves, what we say to our sons and daughters is important because it will often have consequences long after we are gone. Not only are our attempts to make our children more normal, more similar, more conceivable, potentially devastating, what we ultimately teach is normal. So the question becomes one of what Barney teaches our children to be normal. In addition to lessons such as not being good if we don't have good feelings, or that someone changes the rules to make us happy when we come for a short while, other shocking things we've shown at Barney include Barney's annoying children. The problem of child abduction and child molestation is great in our society and since then we have started to pretend it was not, but that would qualify as one of the most appropriate ways to present the subject. So far, I have only mentioned the unsuitable and emotionally harmful lessons Barney himself presents. Adding to the problem are children listed at the show. I use the word children here freely because the age range is up to three years and up to fourteen. However, no difference in emotional response is demonstrated at either extreme. Fourteen-year-olds respond exactly to Barney and his proposed situations just as they did to five-year-olds. Experts in childhood and adolescence autism, especially for this incredibly foul thing to reveal children. Adults on the autistic spectrum who have faced growing problems because their needs have not only been met, but also ignored, tend to follow and feel the urge to do things that Barney, who did 14-year-olds, was crying. As irreverent and ill as the shows aimed at the older-child market such as you can't do it on television were, they mint all over Barney by demonstrating that not only different age groups react to the same thing in different ways, so too do. different people. So in response to mdmireles1295 I have to say that I hope they don't have children. Every time I see a parent that this child has a child, it gives me a great urge to report it to the police for child abuse. And I speak like a man whose abuse is the dominant one. They could sing about ways, love, care, or sharing, but the examples they show are not just fragile, they are the opposite of education, but they are so devoid of realism that they become dangerous as Light Triton has already pointed out. The lessons that children learn from Barney show that people are different, feelings must be suppressed at any cost, and the rules are completely arbitrary. Compared to the lesson that what the world is doing around and even the worst feelings are meant to teach me television as a boy, it is still thinking that the authorities still have to go and discard this waste. air. If a parent made his child what Barney does around the world, they would face criminal charges. That's why I gave Barney his favorite two out of ten points that I give all the wastes with absolutely no redemption value. He has no place in the world of adults who know how to respond to their children properly.
