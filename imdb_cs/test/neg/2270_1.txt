A comparison between the 1995 version and that is inevitable. Sadly, this version is much shorter. Casting is uninspired and acting wooden. One gets the impression that the director did not read the book, so he did not understand the characters. Sir Walter Elliot is depicted as pompous, but his unintentional stupidity, which Redgrave captured brilliantly (in the 1995 version) is nowhere to be found. Musgr's sisters are so relentless, you don't understand why Wentworth or someone else gives them a second look. The relationship between Wentworth and Anne is without feeling. In the 1995 version, Hinds and Root managed to convey the depth of emotion that two of them felt to each other, with their body language and facial expressions. In this case, it is difficult to understand that Anne spent years mired in regret if she did not read the book. <br /> <br /> This production does not capture the emotional complexity of the main characters' relationship. In the scene in which Wentworth goes after Anna and Mary after breakfast, the viewer seems to think Mary is just a little known. <br /> <br /> In 1995, when Wentworth walks (for the first time he sees it in years), the tension is strong. The concern comes from Wentworth in the waves, while Anne is almost overcome. <br /> <br /> In this version, while Wentworth is kind to Lousia, it's as if he was actually invested, lacking undercurrents. In 1995 the viewer sees Wentworth's wrath at Anne. He boasts of his courtship before Anne, as if wanting to say, "See what you gave up, I don't need or want you no longer". Yet he cares if she suffers as a scene where she asks her sister and admiral to illustrate Anne. In the 1995 version, the viewer feels that Anne is a shock that he doesn't care if she is tired, we also feel Wentworth's discomfort he still cares about. In this version he just walks with Lousia, as if nothing happened. The life's scene where Anne talks to Harville about who loves the longest, man or woman is utterly corrupt. The actors just show the lines without emotional investment. When Anne reads a letter from Wentworth, it's like reading a food list. In contrast, the 1995 version, where the viewer feels Anna's second chance. We're there with her as she reads the letter. The director read both letters and hear their voices. Wentworth is full of frustration, passion and hope, while Anne is at first disbelieving and then evolving to joy. This production has more scenes after the revelation, probably because the viewer needed to explain what just happened. The 1995 version did not need to be explained, we knew and rejoiced for the characters The only thing that this production has is that it did not touch Mrs. Smith while the 1995 version did not. The 1995 version however included part of Austen's original ending. A scene where Wentworth is entrusted to the admiral to see if Anne and Mr. Elliot will want to return to their house (which they rent with Mrs. Croft) after marrying. <br /> <br /> This is a production that is to be avoided at all costs.
