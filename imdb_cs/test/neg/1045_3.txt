Twilight Zone has achieved a certain mythology - similar to Star Trek. That's because there are many dedicated show lovers that no matter what they think each episode was the winner. They are the ones who score each individual 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the show. For this reason, I have reviewed the original Star Trek episodes (good and bad) for a while because the overall rating and reviews were too positive. Now is the time to do the same for The Twilight Zone. Now I was very surprised to see reviews for this insignificant episode that described it as "among the best" and gave it a score of 10 if that's why, why is it that everyone I know who has seen this episode hates him like me? It is possible that my family and friends are all handles, but it is also possible that this is yet another case of angry fans who angrily inflate ratings in an average or below average episode. The episode itself by William Windom and others as various archetypes - soldier, dancer, etc. They are all stuck in a cylindrical room without escape and only at the end do you realize the "shocking truth" - which is not at all shocking and in mostly lame. No, this is a badly written episode. Yes, there were a lot of episodes of the series that deserved 10, but few as undeserved as this one due to the shallow scenario and the unpleasant decision.
