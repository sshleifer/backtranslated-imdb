But I still enjoyed it, so I gave her 3 place 1. Her expressions are invaluable. Some other cast members (eg Michael McKean) are also very slumming. The cat itself is somewhat fun. In addition, the film is all clich√©s, culminating in an over-too-long chase car. (It is also at this point that the film becomes unnecessarily brutal, having been very "family" until then.) \ T
