I rented this DVD because I am a big fan of science fiction, but this thing (I won't call it a movie because it was obviously very fast on the video) seemed to do it when they went together. I'm still not sure what's going on. These guys are dressed in some strange S&M outfits, and I think they're from a different planet, but this low, low, low, budget movie doesn't make sense. If it were their first movie, I'd shorten them, but I think it's like their 5th movie and it's really bad. Very poor performance is not one good actor. This director had to be out of his mind to even work on such a horrible movie. Don't waste your time or money on this DVD, please make people not. It's not even the value of 0.99 cents I paid for renting a DVD. In fact, I'll tell them that the DVD is broken to give me back the money. I don't believe I did anything wrong, but I have to be here. My advice to anyone involved in this sinking ship - find another profession to get to. How could you make such a rotten movie? If possible, I'd give this negative star, it's so horrible.
