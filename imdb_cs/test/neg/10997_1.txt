I saw it on the cable. Someone had to lose his job for flying this air. Just because the film is made doesn't mean it has to be displayed! Savage Instinct should be displayed in all movie classes. It's a perfect template for not making a movie. The cut itself is so messy that you think it was assembled by a team of trained (bad) monkeys, traveling along the unpaved canyon road at the back of the jeep, blindfolded and drunk. Sound is often not readable. Acting? I can't say anything I saw here when I played. Reciting? Hmmm. I can't even call it. Otherwise? It works. All that has been said ... IT IS HILARIOUS! I cannot stress enough that there is not one redeemable factor in this "film" than the one derived from its own incredible incompetence. Fun, strictly masochistic. Watch ... if you dare.
