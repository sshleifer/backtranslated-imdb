A friend and I went to see this movie when it came out in 1980. He played in a huge theater and we were the only two people on the site. It took two days in the theater to stop showing him. It was so bad that we all laughed at him. Since then, we have been rating Kill or Be Killed-based movies as the worst movie ever. Like the other reviewers, they mentioned, it's so bad that it's funny. It's not worth the second look, which is certain. I can't bring myself to give her more than 1 because I don't think filmmakers should be so bad and can't give credit for an accident. Excuse me.
