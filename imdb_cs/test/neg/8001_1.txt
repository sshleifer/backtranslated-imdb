This film simply has no redemption features. The story is incomprehensible and the script is rude, sadistic and stupid. Sex scenes are a joke as well as the inevitable chase of a car. Music is terrible. The action is largely limited to growling and grinning. Half star. Shame on DirecTV for putting on pay-per-view. In the theater, people might well throw soda on the screen.
