Fellow Giallo-fanatics: Beware and / or proceed with caution ?? For this movie it is not exactly what it seems to be. It certainly looks like Giallo, with his juicy VHS cover (showing busts of a naked girl and a big bloody knife), the rhythm title and the names of two veteran Italian cast actors (John Phillip & Fernando Rey), but it's basically just an erotic thriller without a big one conspiracy. The version I watched is probably cruelly censored? with running time barely 77 minutes? but then there is still a serious lack of tension, character development and most of the sadistic (and typically Giallo) bloodshed. "Eyes behind the wall" can be briefly summarized as gathering lots of perverted characters and expanding their sexuality issues. Regardless, this is an interesting effort, because the writer / director Giuliano Petrelli (his only film) has clearly tried to do something special, but the overall result is unsatisfactory and unfortunately tame. Inspired by Hitchcock's "back window", the main character is a frustrated elder and a scorer. He and his much younger lover get their sex kicks from espionage to a single male tenant living across the road. The tenant, respectively, likes to exercise gym exercises around the house while being naked and clearly having bisexual desires. The wheelchair is sending his wife and having sex. Then there is an Ottavio servant who repeatedly rapes schoolgirls. Are there any normal characters in the story? Well, of course not! The film benefits from a continually ominous atmosphere, with a moody soundtrack and a handy photo, but none of it leads anywhere, so it's just sleaze and sex without meaning. At the end of the story is really bizarre twist / revelation, but it's too late and too random to increase overall quality. It is not recommended to fans of Italian horror / cult cinema, but maybe it's great for psychology students to analyze the characters of Freud's style.
