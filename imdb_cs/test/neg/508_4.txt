The recent death of Stephen Bach, one of HEAVEN GATE's producers, has woken up the specter of at least a partial resurrection of the cursed film's reputation. In addition, the original version, the "long version", was recently shown on the TCM, when the film, most likely, was revealed to its largest audience. I saw the film when it first appeared at a third-class cinema screening across the street from Bloomingdales. I think it was released on Friday and downloaded the following Wednesday. Maybe it wasn't a fair release, but it was a horrible movie. When I saw the whole version, which recently confirmed this judgment, and about thirty years more experience of watching and writing about movies, I can better formulate why. First, there is a feared phrase "mise-en-scene" whose definition is at the same time so simple but so amorphous that it riddles even after being defined. Basically, it's all happening in front of the camera. For example, the crowd will be given action, let's just walk on the pavement and the place where it starts. Moreover, when the director's assistant shouts, he will go through their action. If there's another to take the extra back to the starting point and go again to the "action". All this is done by all the accessories. Then say that the taxi goes on the sidewalk and the star gets out and hugs the other main, while all the crowds do their thing. This is a mission-en-scene. In the theater they call blocking, but cinema is much more dimensional. The importance of defining a mise-en-scene is that when French critics developed their authors theory, the opposite of the authors was the mettier-en-scene, even more viciously referred to as the "traffic policeman." The author was intimately involved in the meaning of the film and a theme or topics appeared through the director's work. The Metier-en-scene was basically a man in the company who gave it on paper. It's the difference between what John Ford and Sam Wood say. The second point is how director Michael Cimino got into the position of directing films. Cimino first won a prominent directing of the first million television series. This depicted Chevrolet floating down the Grand Canal in Venice. This commercial never appears on any list of the biggest TV commercials of all time and is notable only because of how expensive it was and how utterly exaggerated it was. The effect is the same as for a three-year-old girl who was brought out to entertain a company that gets her biggest response when she goes over her dress. Cute for three years old, embarrassing for thirty years old. So Cimino was soon appreciated for spending a huge amount of money on some top-the-top picture, and so he learned. His first film, THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT (1974), has a scene where Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges are passengers in a foolish car that goes back and forth until it escapes from the road and the driver opens a suitcase full of rabbits, one by one. I had the feeling that if producer, Eastwood, didn't enter, the scene would last until every rabbit was killed. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to HEAVEN'S GATE. I think if one watches a DVD movie in stubs like a mini-series, it can be impressive. It's because the scenes are directed with such a dense mise-en-scene that every scene is like an encyclopedia, it's just exhausting when you can miss it for nearly four hours. It's like sex, at some point it just becomes whipping. There is a 40 minute opening that takes place at Harvard. Brilliantly photographed at Oxford is something that is not. I personally prefer an artistic way to develop a story unlike more commercials "Now I'll tell you what I tell you" most movies. But the whole preface only adds one line - Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt went to Harvard together. Now twenty years later? All this, money and effort, regardless of the attention and energy of all viewers, just to add this almost useless information. Then there is a street scene between Kristofferson and Masur, going on and on with a populated city of background accessories and background-driven cars in continuous motion to add a little bit of exposure information. It's just so exhausting. This is one scene after another. It's like trying to eat a pound of pizza. Then there are these long talks of insignificant details and incomprehensible, reckless dialogue that continue and are exhausting and boring. Of course any excerpted scene looks brilliant. Overall, it's a rich piece to make laudable articles about. Seen in snippets with the ability to quickly move boring bits or turn off when you feel mise-en-scene whipped, it's basically painless. But don't let anyone say it's a good movie. When I saw it in 1980, the guy who commented on the scene on which Kris Kristofferson is on his horse and turns in one direction and then the other is doing it about six times before me. "That's symbolic," he said, "about whom he doesn't know where to go." This is basically the core of the heavenly gate criticism. Watch it if you have to, but you have to be warned beforehand, it's not a movie whose time has come, it's a stinker that will feel all the time. HEAVEN'S GATE is historically inaccurate. I recommend the book BANDITTI OF PLAINS by Asa Mercer at Johnson County War.
