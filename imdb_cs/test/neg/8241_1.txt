I'm sorry I couldn't agree more with the latest comments. Frankly, I thought it was worse than Carry on Columbus, enough. The last movie for the usually brilliant Karl Hartrey, who looked from where humor moved to Highly witty on buses whose films were created at the same time, was sincerely fun. Barbara Windsor was embarrassing, a character as one of your moms flirtatious friends who still think she is eighteen, on vacation with some Scotsman, Rab c Nesbit he is not. The series miraculously unleashed duffers like Carry on Behind and Carry on England. Carry on Dick wasn't bad, but really the end of the series ended with this movie, pity, because until this movie I can't think of a bad movie before that?
