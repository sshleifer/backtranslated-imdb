What can I say? This was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life (and believe me that some of my favorite movies are undoubtedly terrible). The behavior was amateur, the sets were boring and the cameraman was weak and sophomoric. This whole film looked like the final project of the university. I had to make sure that it makes the teenager look a little good. The most disturbing factor of the "movie" is that it's not even a movie at all - it's a video shot. That was very disturbing. In addition, the dialogue is simply disastrous and the plot line is so basic that it takes my eyes to water. Not to mention that they stole at least four other horror movies in the first 20 minutes. If it were such a thing as zero stars, this movie would get it. The only thing scary about this movie is how bad it is.
