The film's mercy, actually begins as a somewhat decent movie, and ellen barkin does a powerful performance. But if you read the book and actually get to know the characters and care who did it, it just doesn't compare the movie. It is always hard to make a book for a movie and it will unfortunately end in failure ... 3 out of 10
