The script seems to have been a wholesale (ahem ahem, cough cough) "borrowed" from a certain other film involving the use of a self-propelled crew drill. Scene by scene, two movies were almost identical. Sufficient number of serial numbers denied in this case to prevent copyright infringement.

It's a bit of a silly side in terms of science, but if a person is willing to narrow his eyes really hard and pretend not to notice the scientific gaffe and everywhere, this film is almost bearable. Much better than "Supernova", which was another movie Luke Perry had in this role, was so stupid, stupid, stupid that nothing could save him.

The New Idea for Disaster Movies: Instead of having a happy ending, where the world will save itself once again, how about where things are going somewhat more realistic, sometimes even the best efforts still ends in failure. Especially when the problem to be solved was mainly due to utter stupidity. Stupidity-caused disaster movies with glowing, gratifying ends kind of backhandedly justify stupidity by saying, "No matter how terrible the problem is caused by braindead stupidity, it can be fixed." Which is definitely not. The catastrophic film itself, with an unfortunate ending, would serve better as a warning story, "Don't be so damn stupid in the first place." Should You Watch This Movie? If you're bored and see everything else in the scifi section of your local video store, why not. But avoid "Supernova" as I can assure you that you're not so boring. That was certainly not one of Luke Perry's better films. This one's better. It doesn't say much, but it's better. One Dead Hoof For Being a Deep-Underground Genre Movie.
