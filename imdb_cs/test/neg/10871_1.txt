Larry Bishop directs, writes, and leads this soft core porn, plotting a less biker movie nothing to do with anything. To call one of the worst films of 2008 is kind to the garbage I spent for a while in theaters. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I am especially sorry for the girls who think they are in the movie when they actually do porn. They walk around the set for four days, saying some sexual lines to disgusting old men - thirty years older than them - then taking off their clothes and running naked for four days on the scene. I can only assume it was Larry Bishopy just to get on the road. You see the shot after the shot directly on the girls. He shot after the bishop's shot, who went up to some random chick and grabbed her most intimate part, as if shaking hands. How crap is funded is over. Why Tarantino has his name is behind me, but he has been slowly disappearing since 1994, so I can't say I was surprised. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes you get into a horrible feeling that just horrible (and I mean horrible) movies. When you see it in theaters, the pain you feel is intensified. After 15 minutes I wanted to cry for being so stupid, and wasting, not just my time, but my hard earned ten dollars. There is no redeeming quality, not a single moment in a film that creates any kind of reaction or shows any kind of inclination that these people have had an idea of ​​what they are doing. If you don't see naked women so often, then I think this movie will be for you. If you are eleven, you will probably like it. You can't even laugh at it because every idiot who did it laughed at the stupid thing they were doing. Acting is terrible, writing is terrible, production is terrible and directing is terrible. It's not even worth your time to rent it to see a car crash. Stay away, stay away. You shouldn't even read these reviews. I shouldn't even write.
