It's really a pity that the film's script had more holes than you could shake your wand (intentionally mixed metaphor) because Kinski and Coyote - both talented talented artists who are capable of great subtlety and nuance - have amazing chemistry and always provocative Fairuza Balk didn't hurt the mix. Jeremy Piven would also be great here if his character (and all the other supporting characters) were not written as a plot device. As far as the main proceedings are concerned, writers simply did not know how to create the appropriate guilty or innocent tensions for Kinski's character - instead they gave us confusion, contradiction, and downright interpreted hopes. - I do not know what's happening.
