next eli roth. self promoting, wrong apology scenario for horror director. The winner is so far from the new horror icon as Mary Poppins (a reference to the Disney score). what's going on here? You have Marilyn Manson opening and closing this piece of crap and chitty chitty bang bang over it all. can it even be called horror? horrible, yes, but horror is a stretch. David Lynch should sue them for stealing the elephant prosthetics. please stop these fans i want to be directors now. film directors already have enough competition to penetrate the film industry. Get online and talk about how big your movie is not true. Stop Madness. I work in the industry and yes these movies are fun to work with, but rarely ever entertaining to actually watch.
