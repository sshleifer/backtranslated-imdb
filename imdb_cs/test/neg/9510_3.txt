Franco Zeffirelli ("The Taming of the Shrew", "Romeo and Juliet", "Jesus of Nazareth", "Othello") The third sting in Shakespeare's transfer to the screen works very well, with the casting of Mel Gibson ("Mad Max," Deadly Weapon) and - "The Passion of Christ" Renown) in the role once owned by Sir Laurence Olivier (and rightly, see my rating on his "Hamlet", probably the best interpretation of one of Bard's timeless (and most quoted) tragedies) and reworked 5 years later by Kenneth Branagh as a full-bloodied treatment, explaining its 3 hour 22 minute run of time, combined with dreaming (and a lot of small additions that were well-chosen and professionally performed by contemporary master William Shakespeare, Kenneth Branagh, director "Henry V" and " Dead Again ". Glenn Close (" The Big Chill "), Paul Scofield (" Man For All Seasons "), Alan Bates, Ian Holm, Michael Maloney (who would be cast as Roderi go across Kenneth Branag ha Laurence Fishburne in Oliver Parker's "Othello" (see my review of Olivier's "stage" version of the tragedy, even if he was playing in it) and who would cast Branagh as Laertes in his three-hour version of "Hamlet" Olivier and his classic version of the game; see my rating on it one too) 5 years later), Nathaniel Parker (who would be cast as Cassio in his brother's version of "Othello" 4 years later) and Helena Bonham-Carter, who would be cast in "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" t "Four years later." Zeffirelli intended this film as a tribute to Sir Laurence Olivier (who died 2 years before the film) and works largely well. I was a little uncomfortable when I mistakenly put a lot of lines on Zeffirelli and gave him one of the Hamlet lines on one scene. Also Helena Bonham-Carter didn't convince me like Ophelia. She was too boring and unreal as Jean Simmons (who immortalized the role in Olivier's version) and Kate Winslet (who did acceptable work in Kenneth Branagh's unabridged, epic revisionist rework "Hamlet") was good at the role, with Jean Simmons' BEST Ophelia at all, that's why she was nominated for Best Actress in 1948 (she didn't win - what a shame). Ian Holm said his lines too quickly, not as slowly as I expected, in the scene with him, Laertes and Ophelia. But then I'm more used to interpreting Felix Aylmer and Richard Briers, and I think they did a better job than Holm in their respective versions of "Hamlet" (both made by great directors, actors, text editors). , producers and stars of all their versions of Bard's work) as Polonius. However, the rest of the cast was excellent. The scene where Hamlet faces his mother was very good, but Olivier and Branagh raised the scene to better lengths to create even more emotional intensity and tension the scene required. <br /> <br /> I recommend this version just to expire, but it is ideal as a teaching aid for English teachers in year 12 (I recommend first showing Olivier's version, then Branagh, and finally this version). Despite the film's "PG" rating, there was really nothing inappropriate in the movie. Only what the game called. The best versions of "Hamlet" are: # 1 Sir Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh. Both were so good that I can't decide which one is the best. For more information, see reviews of these versions. <br /> <br /> Franco Zeffirelli. This one was fine. It started fine with a scene that is not in the game, but it should then proceed to the actual beginning of the game, where the policeman shouts, "Who's there?" "No, answer me. Stand up and unfold!" That scene scares you hell because you sit quietly and then-bum !! In short, this scene sets the tone for the rest of the game. Huge mistake on Zeffirelli's part to skip the scene. It also put a lot of lines wrong (and cut out others I think should be put in), like the line where Hamlet tells Ophelia: "Get you to the monastery, why would you be a sinner?"; this line was supposed to exist in the THAT scene, not where it was placed in the movie (after "To Be Or Not Be" soliloquy. This version struggles between cutting too much or too little from an excellent piece of literature. Kenneth Branagh would remedy that by 5 years later with his unabridged version of the tragedy, so his version is a more appropriate tribute to Sir Laurence Olivier, because several actors (except him) played "Hamlet" on stage / or many Zeffirelli but on various occasions participates in "Hamlet" IS faithful game and this is what I was looking for: setting the final duel was the same as for the Olivier and Branagh versions, just that the denomination in the Branagh version was more violent than the denouement of the previous two faithful versions (more in line with the game; and it worked just as well) and clung to the game more closely when Branagh threw his own ... very good effect in a few harmless touches. <br /> <br /> T this version is not rated.
