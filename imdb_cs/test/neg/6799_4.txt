Bizarre. This film is supposed to be based on a well-known photographer, but everything that happens in this film is fiction. I think he's trying to explain why Diane Arbus was fascinated by the peculiarities and made her the main focus. In the movie, Wolfman moves to the apartment above her. He seems to be obsessed with him and falls on him. She put her children and her husband on a werewolf and even tries to integrate him into her family reunions. Some of the werewolves of crazy shows came to see them, and she mixes with them. The whole thing is very bizarre. FINAL VERDICT: Nothing unforgettable. There's just something special about a woman to get rid of a werewolf. I think you can find better movies there.
