The most hardcore bad movie enthusiast will be surprised by the overall insensitivity of this grade-of "movie". Mary Woronov, a clever actress who is best known for her roles as Mary Bland in Eating Raoul and Miss Togar at Rock 'N' Roll High School, is by far the best thing on this tripe. This movie is too bad for MST3K - honestly!
