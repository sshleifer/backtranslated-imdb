Quoting one critic's movie review, "It started slowly and stopped." The story was credible enough (although some of the character's actions looked very, very RANDOM), the script was pretty well written (in that dialogue didn't seem to be forced), but everything went too slowly. There were too many pauses between the lines, and the way the lines were delivered wasn't that big. This film had the potential, but fired him as a teenager who turns to drugs. My advice? Wait for it to appear on TV before you see it.
