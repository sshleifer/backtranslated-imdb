Grandmother, director Boris Pavlovsky (who?), Sees eight friends who are experiencing a night of horror when a psycho-killer dressed in an old rubber mask and nightgown interrupts their party. It is said that you can "Judge a book by its cover, but it does not seem to be the case for DVD: Last night I was in the mood for a really bad horror movie, and because the Granny cover was a delicate one photo shop titular killer swinging with ax, horrible typography (even using Sand system font, definitive design no-no!), and the credits I never heard of, I figured it was pretty bad. It was! <br /> <br /> When a film is shot just over an hour, it shouldn't waste too much time getting to action; But her grandmother spends the first 20 minutes with her unrelenting group of friends, who play nonsensical games and extremely banal conversation. Anyone who actually stays with the film long enough to start killing (and I doubt most of them will bother) will be dealing with some terrible deadly scenes with amateur gore, a lot of terrible acting and a surprising end that isn't surprise. (If you saw April Fool's Day, then you guess what a twist is before it is revealed). Grandma is missing, ill-advised and almost unnoticeable. Avoid.
