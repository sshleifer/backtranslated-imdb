This film is almost a complete waste of time. I study a book for my English A level and the film contributes only one way, and it happens that the whole scenario takes place in a rural idyll. The game is wooden, filmography is ridiculous, and so-called dramatic scenes in the movie had most of my class (including me) jerking into their lyrics. The book, though not my favorite literary choice, is much better than the film and the soundtrack is simply irritated. Don't watch this movie if you're looking for a timeless, quality story turned into mindless media waste.
