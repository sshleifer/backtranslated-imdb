This remake is called "It Donate a Cat", but D.C. the cat is more lateral than the main character. Patti Randall was not at all likeable in this remake. She reminded me of one of those high school gangs you read about, which you were angry with when they were born, so one day they open fire to the rest of the school. Federal police officer Kelso was fine, but not as good as the one in the original. I think Disney was trying to make Christina Ricci and Doug Doug (or anything goofy name she has) into the stars, but in the original she doesn't hold the candle Hayley Mills and Dean Jones. I am an animal lover and a cat lover and I do not blame D.C. that the remake is much less worse than the original movie. After all, they almost tore him out of the film. All in all, a very bad remake.
