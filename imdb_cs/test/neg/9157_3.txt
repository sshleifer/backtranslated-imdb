Real yawning and bad movie for Chan. I like Charlie Chan's good movie, or even a pretty good movie, but this one is approaching the brand. Charlie is asked to help determine the murder of a scientist working for our government when someone in the house stole plans for more power. The secret is very pedestrian and acting is not much better. The only austerity in the film was the presence of Mantana Moreland as Birmingham Brown. It gives the film a bit of comedy and has some good spooky faces, but then the collections are somewhat slim. Benson Fong is here as Tommy Chan and mates with Chan's daughter of all things. What about Sidney Toler? He's pretty decent, but he seems to be trying to carry a movie. I most noticed how the film was shot. Director Chan Phil Rosen, who likes most of his contributions, uses a lot of long shots without action (like Charlie's initial outside house walk). Why? The film is only 64 minutes long to shout out loud! Such shots tell me that the director had to fill the time because the script was even weaker than he was used to. That's probably not the worst movie Chan ever made, but until now it's the worst thing I've been through.
