It is a pleasure for fans of Z-class movies. Here you will find writing and acting bad enough to compete with anything that Ed Wood has ever produced. Evil film actor Cameron Mitchell is a former makeup artist from "Paragon Studios", who becomes angry Mad Scientist (tm) with a rubber scar on his face after an ugly acid in the face of the incident, revenge by kidnapping actor Paragon and turned them into living sculptures in his secret lab, located in the local wax museum. Or are they zombies who make his offer? Not sure. Fortunately, there are many of your favorite movie clich√©s. Look at the thief lab! Are those mysterious smoking liquid cannulas? Colored water tubes without explanation of purpose? Yay! And what about him, we see spare weapons and legs arranged a little like a wooden stand? You are betcha! Surprise how the evil detectives with the Nine! Enjoy silly tame chase cars and hear more giddy bimbo screams than you might want. Raise your eyebrows on an oblique plot that is still totally opaque with a totally insignificant end that seems to be unconnected with the rest of the film. Cheesy garbage and a lot of fun for the evil movie connoisseurs.
