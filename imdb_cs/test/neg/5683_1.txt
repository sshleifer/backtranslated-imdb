I've never heard of a zero budget "Neut Johnson" auteur before seeing "Battlespace" on DVD on Hollywood Video. A few minutes into the movie I realize it's not a bad thing. Like many video-related science fiction films, it is a film dominated by mostly overused bad special effects and a continual showcase of challenging sci-fi concepts that don't create a story. Spectators are tortured by a religious sounding introduction, then a spoken introduction followed by the narration of the main character's daughter. This seemed like a smoke screen that masked the film with militantly ugly visual effects and zero emphasis on character. Some people seem too prepared to take this film seriously and swallow it is a seemingly new age of hook and dive news. These favorable reviews must come from the same kind of people who can delve into the idea that things like "Battlefield Earth" are a great movie, or that Shasta is as good as coke. Those who have been tempted by the art cheesecloth can look forward to miserable talks (in small batches, with long blocks of people who don't speak), rotten computer animated effects (in extra large doses), and irritating talking computers. What you don't get is excitement, emotional stimulation, unforgettable dialogue or a good story. "Battlespace" is an impenetrable bull and a constant irritating narrative proves it. Real science fiction, hell, real movie creation, is about characters and their dialogue, not about special effects and boring predictions. This is down there with a similar direct to sci-fi video like "Cl.One" and "Recon 2022". If boredom "Strange Horizons" and "Alien Visitor" is something you are looking for, by all means, watch what crap is. If you like good storytelling and hate fake lens flares, you're better off with a real movie.
