I saw it as a child before he was pulled out of rotation and even left a bad taste in my mouth. There were some competent gags, but making grotesque villains from American citizens who were interned in camps strictly because of their race was incredibly tasty. Moe himself might have wanted this buried. He was a liberal guy. In his autobiography he said about visiting the city in a segregated south, where he saw a black man getting out of the sidewalk to avoid walking too close. Moe entered the street to show that this was not a problem, and then he returned to the sidewalk. Then gone again. Finally, the man nervously told him that if Moe hadn't tried to share the pavement with him, he could both lynch them. Another thing: ostrich eggs explode, but no oxen in the movie, so the title should be (if anyone is interested) "Yolk is up to me."
