Where we start, there were many possibilities for this movie to play the role of a big star. But the whole story was destroyed by a terrible plot. This film did not show me to be what I would expect, a good guy makes it alive, I think what mon doesn't want a good person to be successful. The end was cruel and very clich√©, which he didn't even think of, what you actually got by getting a FOOT ALL THAT ARE THAT TESTED TOYS THAT YOU CAN EXCEED SUCCESSFUL. <br /> <br /> If you want to waste 1 hour and 2 minutes time doing something else this movie was the epitome of CRAP. I really think actors made this movie for some fast Vegas money no doubt about it. KEEP YOUR MONEY AND Watch a Better Movie.
