As a Danish Khan "fan" I was looking forward to this movie. After absorbing Conn Igguldens' epic novels about Genghis Khan and reading many historical records, I think I know something about this and I was thrilled to share my knowledge with friends through this movie ... fraud. This film is practically formed from start to finish. There are several things that seem right, but mostly it's clean to believe writers. This may not be a problem, I like good fun just like anyone else, unfortunately it's usually boring. None of this size stems from this movie. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend this movie if you know something about the subject.
