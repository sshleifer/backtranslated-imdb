I'm not sure if this movie could ever match the first movie, even though it was the original seven (no matter that four were killed). It just doesn't have sparkle and chemistry. All actors seem tired and look like they're just going through the movements to get their paychecks. Interesting how Yul Brynner is "magnificent" in this film, but in this sequel it is tough and unconvincing. But when he plays in Westworld and Futureworld in the 1970s, his character (in the same black trousers, shirt and hat) evokes the same secret and presence of the 1960 Adams movie. <br /> <br /> 1966 Swipe to watch it, even on the cable.
