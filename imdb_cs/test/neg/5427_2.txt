Ughh this movie is terrible. The screenplay is stupid and of course it doesn't sing that it doesn't love it !!! Like any episode ... I never understand zoey 101 badly (show) Also, why the hell does Logan's dad do as he came back. And just about zoey and chase what other characters. His always the same in every episode Quinn does and the invention of something goes terribly wrong with the invention and the zoeys brother always gets involved in it. If you haven't seen it, it's not a waste of hours watching this cuz you're wasting your time !! SMaybe it can be interesting for eight-year wells 8-10, but I imagine any1 older watching this movie. But what can you expect from anything ???
