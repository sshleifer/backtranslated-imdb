I tried this show, really, but I can't find a reason why someone would want it. Stories are weak, acting is weak and incredible. It seems that every cast member was picked up from the street randomly. And it seems to me that the whole show is just a means for Jamie Lynn Spears to go to movies. Each episode shows Zoey as a girl that every girl wants to be her best friend and that every boy wants to date. It is always perfect and no one is in real life. How do people relate to a character who is just a Barbie doll? Jamie Lynn's acting is fair, but she's not a strong enough actress to have a leading role in the show. All the fans of the show are just young girls who know nothing better. I'm sorry if you think my comments are too cruel, but if you can find a meaningful and profound moment in this series that isn't quickly directed to a beach party - please accept my opinions and find something worth watching.
