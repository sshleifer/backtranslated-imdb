I can't give it less than a star, I tried. At the moment, I'm not sure if I am halfway or not, but I stopped actively paying attention around the time when the part was revealed as a dream. Or not. Or maybe it was. I think viewers who posted a comment that didn't include "horrible" or "horrible" or "want to swallow me" descriptions are probably nice because it's an independent movie. Don't listen to them, listen to me - there's no nudity in the movie, skip it. I needed ten lines to give this warning, so I will also say that the goth girl that some users have described as "hot" is fat. She has thick elephant legs.
