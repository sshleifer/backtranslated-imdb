Eugene O'Neill is acclaimed by some as America's chief playwright, but for things like The Iceman Cometh, Long Day is a journey into the night, Emperor Jones. Strange Interlude was an experiment that invented where the characters on the stage, looking away from the audience and saying what they really thought, and then continuing the conversation. It was a nine-hour production with a Broadway dinner break, so you can safely assume that many things have been sacrificed here. It is probably a more suitable technique for the screen. Sir Laurence Olivier did very well with him in his Hamlet version. But Bill Shakespeare gave Olivier a much better story than O'Neill gave his players in this case. <br /> <br /> Players like Clark Gable, Norma Shearer, Ralph Morgan, May Robson etc. They are much more animated most of their movies than they are in Strange Interlude. The story takes place over 20 years. Norma Shearer is a young woman whose intention is to be killed in World War I. She starts playing quite a bit, even though this part is not shown in this version. She meets Alexander Kirkland and his friend Clark Gable. She also has as a perennial suitor, Ralph Morgan, a friend of her father Henry B. Walthall. She marries Kirkland, but is then warned by his mother May Robson and showed that the craze madness in that family quotes another literary work. Since Kirkland wants kids and Shearer and Robson think Kirkland's train will slip onto the track, unless one gets, Gable is recruited for breeding purposes. Of course, you can see all the complications this can cause, and O'Neill will examine them all. he did what they told him. Shearer does his best to raise a very rough story, but it seems to have been defeated at the start. Perhaps the best in the film is Robson, who puts some real bite into his dialogue. Strange Interlude ran for 426 Broadway shows between 1928-1929 and starred Glenn Anders and Lynn Fontanne in Gable and Shearer. Maybe no one could really save the movie, because two years earlier, Groucho Marx poured out the stuffing from the animal cookies. After seeing what he did, I don't think the public takes it too seriously with the film.
