Bloody birthdays open to the Meadowvale General Hospital shot. There are three children born exactly at the same time during a total eclipse. The headline tells us it is now 'Meadowvale, California June 1, 1980'. Two young lovers, Duke Benson (Ben Marley) and Annie Smith (Erica Hope) are doing business in an open grave. He hears the sounds and Duke is investigating. Both the Duke and Annie are murdered. Sheriff Jim Brody (Bert Kramer) is confused and only has the handle of the skipping rope that Annie held as a guide. Unfortunately, the youngest daughter of Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) and two of her friends Curtis Taylor (Billy Jayne as Billy Jacoby) and Steven Seton (Andy Freeman) have murdered him before Sheriff Brody. Just as they finish Sheriff Brody, another young boy from his class appears, Timmy Russel (K.C. Martel), three assassins unaware of how much he saw. Soon after the incident, Timmy plays Steven and Curtis in the yard. Curtis locks Timmy in the old locker. Timmy manages to escape and tell his sister Joyce (Lori Lethin), but he doesn't trust him first. Three children continue their murder. Their victims include their strict teacher Miss Davis (Susan Strasberg), a loving couple (John Avery and Sylvia Wright) in a van, and older sister Debbie's Beverly (Julie Brown). Joyce suspects Debbie, Curtis and Steven, making her and Timmy's target for the evil trio. Will they be able to convince the authorities that these three innocent-looking decades are really mindless murderers? Co-author and director Ed Hunt has intense opposition to this film. I think it's absolutely awful and doesn't have a single nice aspect that it's 83 minutes of running. Hunt and Barry Pearson's scenario does not provide any explanation for the motives of the killer children out of the solar eclipse that block Saturn, and therefore for some bizarre astrological reasons, these three children have no conscience, so are the only children ever born during a total eclipse? If this is true, why are they waiting until just before tenth birthday before they start their deadly spree? I think it just suddenly crashes, right? Her appreciation is reasonably well paced, but I still thought it was incredibly boring and tiring to sit. The film as a whole is very unspeakable and predictable, children are revealed as murderers during the first 10 minutes and as I mentioned next to any motive. Sometimes it's stupid too. Look at the scene where Debbie stops Steven by throwing a bowl of water at him! The sheriff's death is given to him to fall from a few steps, yeah, the injuries that this type of accident has suffered will not be the same as your defeated death with a baseball bat as a matter of fact, every competent physician Pathologist would notice it within 5 seconds . There is no blood drop in the whole movie and all the lame murders are boring and unimaginable. There is some out-of-place looking nudity as Debbie charges 25c to give the boys a peek into the hole while her sister Beverly strips. There is an early scene just after 5 minutes when Joyce walks from the kitchen to the living room and a mike boom is clearly visible at the top of the screen, not a bit of what a damn thing is. General incompetence continues throughout the film. The whole production is bland and immediately forgotten. The whole deal is bad, these three kids are very uncomfortable and got on the nerves right from the start, making this movie even more difficult, especially Curtis in his strange glasses. I really hate the movie really, simply. I can't remember one good thing I would say about it. Definitely avoid it.
