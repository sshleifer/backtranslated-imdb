Italian filmmakers love to tear American movies. All our movies, and how often it is possible. I am not saying that he as a whole was acting against Italy as a whole, but I would also like to point out that the Italian film industry is very harmful by allowing travelers to go abroad all over the world . That's all I say. And no more serious injuries are made by the Italian people than by keeping the cruel punishment on those who made the world watch "Shark rosso nell'oceano" - which is undoubtedly a ripoff of a far better "jaw" ( as if you did not know). Get it? Haw-haw ...: a huge huge swimming thing that looks like a cross between an octopus, a shark and Steven Tyler attacks many innocent Americans (ie Italians) ) off the coast of Florida (ie Italy) and brave beer swimming Peter (Sopkiwa) swims with his anorexic girlfriend who drinks in beer and other people full of beer whose main goal is to eat a creature killed by mysterious forces who want the creature it was left alone, or just so, and it would be useless (and a draft beer). or be a physician in this movie who repeatedly defibrillate dying patients (20, maybe 30 times in a row) without waiting to recharge their paddles (there must be one hell of a good battery there, doc). Then there's a monster ... brother, if you thought the "Jaws" shark was fake, look here and let your mind change immediately. This is a movie that was directed as an idea (Bava!), edited by an onion helicopter, controlled by ambulatory pieces of driftwood and written by people (PRESUMABLY beer-swilling) who never should ever be in close to a typewriter, film studio or city in the world. If this is how people who did this movie think that real people are acting in such a situation, apparently too many of them are zombie movies. Or too much beer. <br /> <br /> Do I need to say that this movie is bad? It's: bad as green curd; bad as a Hawaiian shirt at a formal wedding; bad as "Bad Theater" parody Dan Aykroyd hosted on "Saturday Night Live"; bad as Calista Flockhart Weight Gain Tablets? Good. Mike and SOL gang repeatedly slap in this beer - drunken beauty upside down and reveal this "horror" movie as what it is: terrible. Though, with some European charm: it is charming when viewed by the European - preferably one of those who drink in beer. No stars for waterlogged, dead fish known as "Shark rosso nell'oceano"; six stars for MST3K. ... and now, someone for beer? <br /> <br />
