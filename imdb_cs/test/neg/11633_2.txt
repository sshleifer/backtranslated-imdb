What a terrible sequel. The reason I give this movie two stars instead of zero, because it's a film that has violence and gore and animals, yet it's badly planned. And this divine frightening continuation was done by no one but BUM-BUM-BUM-BUM !!!!!!!!! Mick Garris! A bone head that brought you a remake of The Shining, which almost got Kubrick almost in his grave when he realized it was. Garris is also a man who brought you a sad sequel to FLY, FLY, which was a wonderful movie, but Garris's film almost destroyed John Getz's career. By the way, if you really want to see a lousy trilogy okay, no. This is the mistake I made, leased the first or third, or even better, NO STOOP TO ALSO LEVEL! This movie is so bad that I can't believe it, avoid this bullshit. Pity, Mick!
