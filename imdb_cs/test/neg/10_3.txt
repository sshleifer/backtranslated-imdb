Years ago when DARLING LILI played on TV, it was always a pan and scan version that I hated and decided to wait and see the movie in its proper widescreen format. So when I saw the cheap DVD of this opera Julie Andrews / Blake Edwards, I decided to buy it and watch it once and for all. Boy, this is a horrible movie. It's so bad and on so many levels that I don't really know where to start describing where and when it goes so bad. Looking at this, it is obvious to all movie fans that Blake Edwards has created this star vehicle for his wife simply because many other directors have struck gold with Andrews in musicals (MARY POPPINS, SOUND OF MUSIC, THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE etc) because Andrews was determined to play in projects that made Julie herself famous (CAMELOT, MY FAIR LADY, etc.) because she thought Hollywood was not sexy or charming. Blake thus created this unborn effort to show his wife in a bizarre devise of a spy story / war movie / romance / slapstick comedy / musical. DARLING LILI suffers from many personalities, never knows who or what it is. Some particular scenes are good or effective, but as a whole it just doesn't work at all because it's very embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Note that the DVD version is "director's cut", or in this case, "let's save what we can" from this notorious box office flop. By releasing a DVD, Edwards cut 19 scenes ( 19 !!!!!!!!) from the original inflated theater version to this more efficient yet inefficient version, the movie moves along with no idea of ​​what it is. What spy is Lili? How strong is she? Has she ever been responsible for someone's death? Instead, we're watching a thoroughly bored looking Rock Hudson trying to get a thoroughly bored look at Julie Andrews. Things didn't help with the unexplained reason why Why did Julie fall into Hudson? Why with him and not with the other men she dealt with? There was to be one of them around her, trying to get her back or try to decipher her secret. it gave us a little needed contrast with the confused action, and it would also give us some impetus for slow management. There is no catalyst in this story. Just look at the cut scenes to see that Edwards and the writer have just come up with ideas inspired by previous successes by Andrews (and Edwards). The best (or worst) example is the scene where Andrews and Hudson follow a group of children singing in the middle of the forest. Edwards Channel SOUND OF MUSIC. No wonder he removed it from the DVD. In 1970, the scene could have been at a certain level, but today, the moment is desperate. There are other plot elements directly inspired by Andrews / Edwards other films. Endless scenes of combat are inspired by much better MODERN MILLIE. The musical moment "I'll give you three estimates" was created just to be funny from Julie's MARY POPPINS persona who turned to "raunchy" with Julie doing a striptease in the act. The end, bird's eye view of Julie on Hudson's plane, is another "wink" on SOUND OF MUSIC. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is confusing. Julie plays a singer, born from a German father and a British mother who lives in England, but sings her (English) songs in Paris. You never know exactly where the story takes place. Some moments are poorly edited. Like Julie and her "uncle" are riding. They talk and talk, and then Julie runs suddenly in the middle of the sentence. I'm like "what happened here?" The comedy pieces are rude and cringe-worthy. Every scene with the French police is pathetic. Where is Peter Sellers when you really need him. The action is stupid for faith. When Julie and her "uncle" are on their way to Germany on that train, the Hudson Squadron shoots bullet bullets on the train, almost killing Lili in the process. Brilliant. What is also funny about this scene are two vacations on the train in the middle of the night, but Hudson and his squadron will get on the train even if they leave in the morning. That's one slow train out there. <br /> <br /> Musical moments. The beginning is the best part of the whole movie (and the reason I gave this movie 3 stars), but its effect is greatly reduced as it repeats at the end. Speaking of superfluous, we really had to see can-can dance, crepe Suzette stripping scene and Julie stripping too? "Girl in no man's land" is fine, even though the bleeding is obvious, but that moment makes no sense at all, because Lili is singing a group of wounded soldiers in a French hospital, so I was wondering: how many soldiers were there indirectly injured by her espionage ? <br /> <br /> The project is fruitless and energy-free. Romance is 100% incredible. Rock Hudson is too old and tired (check out the museum scene). Julie looks dazed as if she were on Valium. But what really kills this badly conceived project is Julie playing a German spy. Edwards desperately wanted to dispel Mary Poppins syndrome to afflict his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision. Like I love Julie, it's not Greta Garbo, who took him so beautifully in MATA HARI. It's funny, even though Julie plays a German spy, she still feels cloning and cute. <br /> <br /> How bad is DARLING LILI? Even after 37 years of its release, Blake Edwards felt he still needed to work on it for his DVD release.
