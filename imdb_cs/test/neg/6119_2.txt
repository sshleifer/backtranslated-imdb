I liked it all that was set up with Ceasar's Palace, Roman Guardians and togas announcers. The event also marked a "torch passage" as far as the WWF voice is concerned. Gorilla Monsoon, who has played the game in every WWF PPV up to this point, is opening and giving a typical introduction, so he seems to be there to announce another PPV. But then introduces Jim Ross, who makes his WWF debut and JR continues to make WWF commentary on this day. In addition, this event is pure garbage. Good ok science match was kicked out of the window and enter the birth of tricks. That was an event for me that WWF started to walk around the toilet and didn't recover until the era of the late 1990s. Here is an overview of the event. <br /> <br /> IC title: Tatanka (Challenger) vs. Shawn Michaels (champion): Okay opener, but given what Shawn is capable of, it was very disappointing. I have no idea why WWF was trying to put Tatance in order. They should realize that Shawn is the future and Tatanka was just some hyper wrestler in Gimick, India. The very end of the match was very lame. Shawn grabs the ball and pulls it out. While it was fun to watch Sherri get beaten afterwords, this match was simply forgotten. Shawn had to carry this match and had trouble making it. Stenier Brothers The Headshrinkers: Steiners wins over the Franknsteiner. This match had moments, but the crowd did not seem to be in it. There was no heat behind him, I think it was a match just to throw two teams. Crush vs. Crush Doink the Clown: TERRIBLE! GRAPES! GRAPES! This match was completely sucked. Two very lame tricks. Clown and Hawaiian dressed in bizarre colors. The end caught everyone in surprise. In the coming months, Crush turned and Doink turned, but none of the fans cared. Unfortunately, it wasn't the worst match on the card. Razor Ramon Bob Backland: You've got a brand new heel that's very close to the wrestler who was forgotten about 10 years ago. Fans sniff and laugh when Backlund comes out. And like Hogan / Rock in WM18 and HHH / Owen in WM14, the heel wrestler gets louder in the face. Fortunately, this match was short. The right guy won, but I wish Razor would totally defeat the bullshit and squash Backlund, rather than win a small package out of nowhere. Team match: Ted Dibiase and IRS (Champs) vs. Hulk Hogan & Brutus Beefcake w / Jimmy Hart I still want to know the whole story of what happened to Hogan's eye. Oh, good. The crowd was really in this match, but there was no flow to it. Apparently, Hogan and Beefcake suffered from a ring rust because both wrestlers were on the shelf for at least a year. Dibias, who was a great technical wrestler who was, helped to keep the match from falling into full waste. The end was a surprise when Dibias and the IRS won the DQ win. But Hogan and Beefcake were pleased with the crowd when they won the match at the end. Lex Luger Mr. Perfect: The best part of this match was the four hot chicks that accompanied the Lex Luger to the ring. Otherwise it was completely forgotten. Mr. Perfect was born for the perfect heel. And Luger is just a waste of time, no matter what trick he is. Luger wins through the slip, though the legs are perfect. Then Perfect spends a post match getting his ass kicked. The first Luger sets him off with a running elbow. Then when Perfect regains consciousness, he returns to the locker room to find Luger just to get the bullshit that Shawn Michaels defeated him, creating the HBK / Perfect feud that had the potential to be a classic, but the WWF was abused. Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzales: ABSOLUTE CRAP !! What was WWF thinking bringing such a terrible wrestler as Giant Gonzales. Sure he was, but I'd rather watch a Brooklyn riot in a match than he did. This is not even worth commenting on. WWF Champions Championship: Bret Hart vs. Champion Yokozuna (challenger) You have one of the biggest technical wrestlers of all time against a man who is the only advantage of being a huge lard. Bret managed to wrestle the match, but a rather predictable ending with Mr. Fujie, who threw salt into Bret's face. POST MATCH: Yokozuna v. Hulk Hogan Pure crap here. Hogan comes to the ring for no apparent reason, and Mr. Fuji calls him to play after Yoko has just won the title. Even the hard Hulkamaniacs found it a total BS.
