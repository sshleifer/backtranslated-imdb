I am surprised that a comparison between Mind of Mencia and The Awful Truth, which took place a few years ago, has not yet been done. The show, led by controversial director Michael Moore, will start in exactly the same manor as this show, where Moore communicates with viewers and presents segments, namely short documentaries and parodies that have been compiled to provoke thoughts. current issues. Difference? Mencia rarely delves into superficial and reactionary. What he says and does is often panding and rude, and offends the ability of his viewer to decide for himself. There is a difference between being "nervous" with which I have no problem, but Mencia is trying too hard to achieve it and ends up being arrogant and with little support. But he does this occasionally, but often to get to them, one has to sit in some nice mind numbing the shock humor.
