My 15-year-old daughter asked me to watch her on this TV. As someone who has seen Revenge of the Nerds at the cinema, I found this movie to be a very predictable remake of it. The Nerds were simply replaced by Dorks. I was driving her madness by accurately predicting what would happen in every scene. The cast was cute, especially Amanda Bynes. Chad Creasey should be ashamed of having written such an obvious remake in the early 1980s. The title should simply be "Revenge of the Daughters". Maybe the sequel will be Revenge of the Dorks 2.
