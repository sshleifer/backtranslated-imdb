and nothing else. One of my friends bought a Problem Child Tantrum Pack (includes the first two "Problem Child" on one disc) and decided to follow the sequel because it was a "funnier". There were a lot of fun moments in the movie (a scene of vomit, that's all I have to say.), Nippy dog ​​after CHOW DOWN meal and many more. The film is nothing but humor, but it's fun. Other than funny moments, though, this movie has little to offer. John Ritter annoys the crap out of me because it sounds like it's reading from a book. This man can't act, sorry. Although I can't say if I found the movie funny now ... (when we watched it), it's a perfect movie on a rainy day ... but nothing else. Don't expect Oscar material on this, guys.
