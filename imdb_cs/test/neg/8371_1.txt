When I watched him, I was preparing to create a ripping critique of this "movie" (this is actually a video), but then I saw that someone had already done it. I quite agree with him. But then again it looks like a lot of effort and millions of lira have entered it, so I think you have to give them some appreciation for the attempt. However, as already mentioned, anyone who does not yet know the Lovecraft world and that is what they were trying to communicate will probably think, well, I think that not only is it really bad, but it makes no sense at all . Thank God I read a part of that second review ("was it a little stupid, maybe?) That revealed that this guy was also doing" The Shunned House ", which looked pretty bad, judging by the DVD box, so now I can avoid and save my mind from any further exposure to such profanity by HP Lovecraft.
