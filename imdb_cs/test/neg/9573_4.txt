When I wrote it in November 2005, I realized that the big British boom of cinema was over, and while people would say that much of it was up to the British government, which doesn't give filmmakers tax relief, I think it's much easier - Lack of diversity from manufacturers over the past few years. Let's take a look at what the British produced in 1995-2005: Funky gangster thrillers. LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRALES was a really cool and thoroughly entertaining movie, and people walked out of the way to the Guy Ritchie monkey style with usually unsatisfactory results <br /> <br /> Romantic Comedy. Yeah, yeah. I realize that FOUR WEDDINGS, KNOW HILL, etc., have been made by American studios, but they are still vaguely "British movies". Unfortunately, because they are guaranteed to benefit from studies, there must be a winning formula that usually includes Hugh Grant playing Hugh Grant for the tenth time <br /> Black Comedies. Can anyone explain what a black comedy really is? In the British context, it is usually a turbulent film with often contemporary political statements that often resemble Mike Leigh's NAKED <br /> Jasmin Disdar BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE is a good example of a third type of British film. Filmed in 1999, but in 1993, they open with two men fighting on the bus, and later it turned out to be a Serb and a man is Croatian, so we get what's happening in the Balkans at the time. the chance that two former enemies in the Balkans will hit a London bus? This summarizes one of the major shortcomings of the film - Irony takes precedence over probable situations, you can appreciate the ultimate irony of the subplots, but is the result likely? Perhaps the greatest irony is the name of the film. His name is BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, but surely this viewer has found it a clich√© of stereotypical people whom I could not believe as three-dimensional characters.
