First, I wouldn't be able to use my imagination in this movie, or the director was trying to save money or cut his budget! Here we go .... Basically there were so many years and gaps that I do not understand, just as the film was jumping from 9 years to 20 years to 30 and so many gaps that cause you asking how to the hell happened? and why? I think it's a big flow. Forget about reviews that are still whining about history, this film has not only historical facts problems, but also has so many mistakes. So most people still say you're watching it in the cinema, you lose all the cinematography like rivers, deserts, and so on. That's true they're beautiful, that's why I was waiting for the release of BluRay 1080p. OK! beautiful scenes, but what's the point? I turned off the movie after 1 hour and a half, lost interest. The movie kept doing exactly the same jumping things in years (at least Mr. Director gave, for example, after 2 years after 10 years!) I think I couldn't watch the movie I lost understanding of what was happening! Anyway, I wish I could include spoilers, but when you decide to watch this movie, ask yourself how it happened? you'll know what I mean! Do not watch this movie for its waste of time.
