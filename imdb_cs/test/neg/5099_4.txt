As mentioned above, I was ultimately disinterested in this film. It is beautiful to watch, the scenery is fresh, but the detail of the story, especially the characters, is absolutely incredible. Films may not be believable, but such films, with political edge and social commentary. Likewise, I have no problem with commercialization as such, but movies like this should not only make casting decisions on a cash basis. This is absolutely the case with Sutherland, who is frankly absurd as Doyle. His accent was far from authentic, but fell into the greatest trap of all, his accent is his performance, and we end up with a cartoon of Ireland without a personality outside its nationality. I find it totally unlikely that anyone who cares for it would be the best man for the job. All in all, it's a clear case of commercial interest in quality, and when you're trying to be a mission, this kind of thing will ruin your chances of success. Speaking of accents, a few other problems, one is the remarkable modernity of Boy's accent, which was supposed to dispel the feeling of being transported to another time. More surprising was Samantha Morton, who was highly praised by an Irish accent that was at least changeable. Her voice swayed between the strong North and the soft south, even in voice calls, where I expected all such discrepancies to be picked up. <br /> <br /> But compared to motivation and motivation, this is a small grip. Events Sarah. She never seems to be at home with an Englishman and almost immediately at home with her son and his tribe, the dilemma between the life she knew and the life she offered her seems unproven. Maybe a lot of editing has been lost, maybe it was supposed to be a three-hour movie or a mini series where these things could be added, but I can only judge what I've seen. Now is the biggest problem, Sarahin (Morton) relationship with Doyle (Sutherland) incomprehensible. The fact is that her affection for him is not transmitted in any way until he has to choose between him and his son, the conflict he goes through at this point was frankly ridiculous and the film killed me. <br /> <br /> As you may have guessed. this movie didn't work for me at all, but it's upstairs you are watching, you really won't see anything more overwhelming in terms of scenery, there are a few good performances and my wife liked it.
