Three stars are for Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Nothing else and no one else in this movie deserves a little smidgen star. Okay, OK, Amy Adams deserves a little smidgen, but the smidgenometer doesn't seem to work, so I stick to 3. Tom Hanks ... nothing. Julia Roberts ... nothing. Mike Nichols ... do you see the trend? Aaron Sorkin ... OMG, no chance. I could rely on a few paragraphs about the way Charlie Wilson's war overlooks history, morality, legitimacy, and so on, but I don't think such a rant could outweigh Aaron Sorkin's fan blasting. The rest of you, be careful. Make your money from the movie elsewhere. Still, if you're looking for a pithy comment, here's mine. You can put a hot fudge sauce on a pile of rubbish, but nothing changes. Dustbin is waste and so is Charlie Wilson's War.
