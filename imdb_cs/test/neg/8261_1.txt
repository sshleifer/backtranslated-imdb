Ru Paul plays a secret agent named Starrbooty. He associates with another agent who fights the evil Annak Manners (Candis Cayne) and gets her kidnapped niece ... or something like that. Seriously-- I had trouble concentrating on the plot! The film is seemingly directed by someone who has a heavy ADD - a camera cut that prevents them from focusing on anything. Dialogue is sometimes incomprehensible and if you can hear it, it will remain incomprehensible! Acting is actually quite fine, with the exception of Ru Paul, who overcomes embarrassment. The film is also full of disgusting bathroom humor, which is just rebellious and not remotely entertaining. After 30 minutes I had to leave because I was bored, I was sick and I just couldn't stand it. I am proud to be sitting in something else, but this was beyond my borders! People compare it to the early work of John Waters. I disagree. Water work is sick, but good - it's just sick. Avoid.
