Before you reject my post as "you won't get it", let me say ... I'm one of Richard Kelly's biggest fans and "The Twilight Zone". Donnie Darko is one of my favorite favorites. I'm a huge science fiction fan. I was very excited to see "The Box", I couldn't wait until it came out. When I said that ... "Box" is terrible. For "Drag Me To Hell" it was the worst movie I saw in 2009. And it just won't end! Whenever you think you've reached the end, another change in the land and you're gone to further torture. At the end of the movie, I was actually moaning in the theater ... I could barely take it. The biggest problem with "The Box", no matter how you cut it or try to justify it, is that it just doesn't make sense. Believe me, "I got it," I understood what was happening. But that doesn't mean it does a lot of senses when we look at it. Take the basics, for example. Major pair ... Cameron Diaz and James Marsden playing Norma and Arthur Lewis. Diaz loses his finances during his work, then bemoans to his husband that they are "living paycheck to paycheck". Well, sell that Porsche that your husband is driving! They live in a beautiful two-storey house in a nice structure. Marsden is working on what seems to be a highly paid job at NASA and Diaz is a perfect teacher. And yes, Marsden drives too expensive a car. But are they somehow a paycheck?!? No need to press a button, just a little shorten your lifestyle! The film would work better if they showed a few unemployed and in serious debt. Instead, they are seemingly desperate for money ... throughout their lives, what I would call a luxury lifestyle. As I said ... you can understand what's going on, but it still doesn't make sense! This is a rare combination. There was a terrible scene in the library, which I think will go as one of the worst segments in film history (by the way, it was). It was stupid, illogical and out of place. I can't even fully describe it, so I get a subplot that includes nose bleeding and alien posture. (Yes, unfortunately I'm serious). The child is in Diaz's class with an ungodly and smile on his face (a sinister smile that is seemingly totally unnoticed by everyone at school). He begins to ask Diaz's personal questions and literally worries her in front of the classroom. No punishment is given to the boy at all ... nor has he been asked to stay in conversation for an hour! Then Diaz is at the party ... and the same child is one of the hired helpers ... ironed shirts, aprons and everything! I don't know many extraterrestrial children (who seem to be in Junior High) that also moonlight as bus-boy at parties sponsored by teachers and school officials ... but we found it here! (See what I mean ... you can understand it completely, but it still doesn't make sense ... a rare combo!) Like many things in the movie, the baby comes and goes ... no real explanation about him, not his character. She goes on ... The lady then approaches Diaz at the grocery store and tells her that the experiments are underway and her family is one of the subjects tested. Well ... hmmm ... if the aliens have power where they can take over the body ... and the aliens don't want to help Diaz ... then who took over the lady's body and gave Diaz advice? ! Again ... Mistress tried to help Diaz ... and the aliens were not interested in helping Diaz ... so who the hell was controlling her body ?! I never explained it. I haven't talked about it yet. No nothing!! It goes on and on, and like what I thought, 2 weeks. That wouldn't end! I wonder if this movie went through a massive re-shoot at some point. It was poorly edited. Diaz's accent was one minute, another. Sub-lands began, but never ended. Numerous shifts in the release date seem to show the problems manufacturers had with the finished product. It's really a train wreck. <br /> <br /> Go to this ... there is no redemption value. 3 out of 10, just because I like Diaz and science fiction! But it probably deserves 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading! <br /> <br /> JD
