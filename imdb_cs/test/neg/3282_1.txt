Robert Montgomery-Myrna Loy's farce about Loy (Irene) and her fiance, played by Reginald Owen, got stuck in Labrador when their plane crashes. (This is really what was supposed to happen with this highly predictable movie.) Montgomery lives there while he's waiting for his fianc√©. <br /> <br /> Surprise! Montgomery and Loy are soon attracted to each other. The bear scene is so fancy. We knew it was a tamed bear. Complications arise when Clara appears. Loy wants Montgomery to tell Clara that she should split up, if she refuses, she wants to leave immediately. Outside with all the snow, it's too cold for whom!
