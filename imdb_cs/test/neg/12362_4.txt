Eight Legged Freaks is a modern monster movie, as a remake of one of the old 'Attack of the Giant [INSERT ANIMAL HERE]' - films from the 50s, 60s and 70s. Or rather, it should be a remake rather than what it was. So how is the monster finished in 2002? Well, from a typical opening with chemical production, spiders grow to enormous proportions, mixing movies like Gremlins, Jurassic Park, Starship Troopers and tasting it as a Scary Movie parody. Gremlins is probably the best comparison, but eight Legged Freaks were so full of parodies and stupid jokes that it was sometimes more like a Scary Movie. It was too much, at least if you're looking for a monster movie and not just another jerky parody. <br /> <br /> Don't expect much of acting for this kind of movie, and that's exactly how it was. But the story was extremely thin, with just a lot of loose events to show some action mixed with all the jokes, which led to an easily visible ending. I rate Eight Legged Freaks and 4/10, and this includes the fact that special effects where pretty good and that the spiders sounds where they cheerfully.
