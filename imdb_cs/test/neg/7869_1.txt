Dear film director: <br /> <br /> In the future, when you are trying to create a sense of urgency, it may be best to have your hero * run * instead of a jog / shuffle. Especially if you're trying to strengthen the timeline. For example, if you're trying to persuade an audience that a bad guy really kills a hostage, if the hero doesn't find it, it's probably a good idea to tell you that your hero believes it can really happen ... Let's face it. Of course, making a good movie wasn't your goal. Your goal was to run out of garbage that earn more money than it costs. Otherwise, you could hire some actors. Sincerely, bored browser. This is the worst movie I've ever seen in a long time. I can't say it's the worst because I could finish it. It was bad, bad, bad. Dude, where's my replacement?
