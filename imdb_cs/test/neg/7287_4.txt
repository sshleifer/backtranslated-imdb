I found myself less and less excited about the Disney sequels of the movies. Yes, I understand that the direct video budget is not the same, but it doesn't even try to make these movies. Some examples are Hunchback II and Tarzan and Jane. If someone has seen Stitch-The Movie previews, you will see my opinion. But I turn away, this film reaffirms my opinion. The animation is sloppy, the story lines resemble the Saturday morning cartoons and not all the original voices are there. I was very disappointed not to hear Michael J. Fox's voice. It was so obvious that the one who was making Milo's voice was trying to sound like Fox, but he didn't. <br /> <br /> If they say anything, my 10 and 6 year olds didn't even hear the whole movie.
