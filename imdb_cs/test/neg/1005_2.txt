Three businessmen are involved in a bar fight with three mysterious men. Three businessmen take revenge, which escalates to murder after another. The story is about violence that could become ordinary people. The story has too many holes. Details have been ignored to move the story forward. The negotiations were uneven. The color balance was terrible, even though I was watching this movie on DVD. The small budget and tight schedule were obvious. The whole thing seems to be an excuse to shoot the final fight and the end is incredible.
