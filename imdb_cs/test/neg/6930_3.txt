This film is about the frustration of filmmaking. It certainly frustrated me with his endless boredom. This environment is an attractive Spanish resort with its usual large cast. The script is very poorly written or maybe there is no script. Just all ad-lib. A far better film about the frustration of filmmaking is Francois Truffaut's "Day for the Night" made in 1973. It shows all the delays and the way cast can behave in an interesting way. It is not a viewer, and you will gain sympathy for the director, who must somehow complete the film.
