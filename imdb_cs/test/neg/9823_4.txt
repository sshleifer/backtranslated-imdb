Hellboy revolves around classic comics / action / superhero genre stories. Hellboy is basically a kind of demon that has found its way to Earth. He is brought up from a child by a priest and within a government company and has decided to protect the people on Earth from a supernatural rather than a threat (a normal career path for a demon). The story of the story involves the creative use of history, combining Nazi experiments with occult. It is meaningless, but so is the whole idea of ​​a demon wandering the streets. I find an explanation of the characters who are and how they were treated very well. The sequences are in place and very fun. In fact, opening is the best part of the movie, there is a problem. Basically Del Toro, who writes and manages this piece of bottles. The film lacks any tension or any major conflict. Essentially, Hellboy is based on the first act of the invasion and the rest of the film consists of scenes in which any conflict is automatically foul because we know Hellboy will be fine and the evil man dies. I have heard that you are shouting that this is the case with any movie / hero. Well, yes, but once we're drawn into a well-executed action movie, we can't help but feel that the hero can die. Die Hard works because John McLane seems to die in all places. He escapes death by the thinnest edge. Deposits are raised because his wife is also in danger, etc. Etc? Terminator and Terminator two work because in both cases the villain is much better than the hero. The threat and tension is constant. Some of the other major weaknesses are: Del Toro is also guilty of employing deus ex machina. Characters generally disappear and reappear because their skills are needed in the story. The villain is featured in three scenes. He has no motives. Unexpectedly and inexplicably. In one scene Hellboy appears to be against the real threat (monster groups), the character relaxes her abilities - the screen disappears into white and inexplicably the monsters are dead, but everyone else lives. The key to the film's conclusion is a tiny figure who appears in an irritated and underdeveloped love story. Her character is so thin, the relationship so undeveloped. It is clear that it is nothing more than a stimulus to shift the conspiracy and make it all sense. I do not want to destroy the end of the film, but basically the character who is dead is miraculously and incredibly brought back to life. It's not smart or funny. After a while, it all starts to grind. <br /> <br /> What's More Del Toro blows action scenes with some uninspired visuals. And who would make a creative decision to make a weapon's primary weapon instead of his rough arm, he should be fired. Basically, the use of a weapon weakens the concept of a film, degrades the struggles to nothing more than a one-sided shooting from the filming. Several positives include: Cinematography is very good. At all times, the mood is based on dark lighting and a darker palette of colors. As well as the use of interesting places. But maybe it's also the same. The use of cgi and fx is well done. We'll never get overloaded. Using effects, they are well used and a sense of realism is maintained. Rather similar to Nolan used FX in batman. I very much prefer this method to the overtop effects we often see. All this is a pretty bad movie. The real shame is that (although I don't read comics), I found the film wasted a lot of potential. Hellboy as a character has a lot of immediately obvious fascinating dimensions that are completely unexplored. The film has a tracking ability in the sense that if it comes to television and nothing else stands on it, it's worth a look. But in no other situation would I bother.
