I went to see this movie because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go. We both tried to look at our watch before the movie was over. she had to endure. Two hours and six minutes, that's it. It is divided roughly equally between battle scenes (about a dozen of them, all more or less interchangeable), and the development of the twist. You would think that with a subject who is the son of a minor tribal chief who conquers half the world, rendering would be relatively easy. There is a fair bit of raw materials to make a good story. However, the writers did it completely. We have no real history. Instead, we get a Hollywood version of history. What keeps the young Temudyin in his long, almost infinite, actually, or so, viewer - torment? Why, the love of a good woman, of course. How does he get out of jail? An old monk, aware of his innate goodness and greatness, sets off across the continent to take this good woman to a talisman that symbolizes Temudyin's love for her. , talisman in hand. And then of course it goes and has (inexplicably) wealth and power, saving it. How does he escape from the shackles? Well, he goes to the sanctuary of the great wolf-god Tengri (or some kind of name) and the Tengri frees him with magic. Yeah, right. Why does he want to be the ruler of the Mongols? Apparently he's a wolf god. Off goes Temudjin ask for advice, and - surprise! surprise! - He gets it. "Laws," he says to himself. "What the Mongols need are laws. Good, simple." Golly, that was impressive. Finally, how will he win a decisive battle against his opponent's stronger forces? Better tactics, sure, but also with the help of a good old wolf-god who sends a storm to the top of the battle. All soldiers crouch as thunder accumulates and lightning flashes (Mongols are afraid of thunder, you see) - but not our Temudjin. The soldiers, completely impressed by his bravery, recognize him as king! I don't know what makes people create this kind of waste. The funny thing is that it is scattered with all kinds of bold realism: plenty of slurping milk, dirt and violence. It is as if the producers of this film wanted to get trivial things right so that the viewers would not notice any of the great things infantile. In graphic detail, there are piles of violence: slashes, impalings, blood spills, blood sprays, blood clouds - blood boys have had a great time. Despite realism, it is impossible to take it seriously. I have to mention the sad CGI final battle scene. How anyone can think that these things look realistic is beyond me. No. Oh, and all this is done in standard Hollywood style - breathtaking panoramas for spectacular scenery and super-close-up stuff Stedicam for battle scenes. And the standard super-sound effects of Dolby, which manifest bumps and bumps, and a constant low frequency drone to maintain tension. <br /> <br /> Lengthy. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
