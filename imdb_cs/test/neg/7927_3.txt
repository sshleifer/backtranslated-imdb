Where should I start? The film's story, which is about love between two high school students during the war, while one is a live weapon, and their effort to maintain that love is a very good storyline. It is based on the manga Shin Takahashi which was also changed to anime in 2002, both of which I still have to read or see. This review is about this live action adaptation however. Sad that this honest to good was a horrible movie. It is not as if one could identify certain aspects and say, for example, that the budget is to blame or is to blame. Unfortunately, this is a series of unpredictable and ineffective elements that bring this film down. Negotiations are bad. Not to mention that Aki Maeda and Shunsuke Kubozuka are bad actors, but they didn't have much to do with them and they seemed wrong. He did not seem to have a physical range that would draw the viewer into the story, as if he were too old to be distracting. The movie also plays for the heart, but in the end it is predictable, not all the time convincing, and under-development characters. There are also problems with stimulation. <br /> <br /> It's unprecedented visually. The movie uses too many scenes on the green screen unnecessarily. Other special effects also have a low-cost appearance, especially where minimalist, practical special effects could be used. There is also no visual atmosphere, as if there were no cameraman or artist to make the scenes look consistent and encouraging. <br /> <br /> The music and sound effects were fine, but extraordinary. Overall, the film is not pleased and the fans of the show should not be discouraged to see it at least once for completion. People who aren't familiar with Saikan is probably not a place to jump because it's not a very good movie or melodrama. It's not a movie or cast and crew guilt, it just isn't inspired, and that's what kills him.
