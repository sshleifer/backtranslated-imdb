"It's supposed to have good reviews," says g / f. If so, I can't find them. He goes to sleep and I can stand. Michael Douglas as a good boy - now he is new. Matt Dillon broke up. John Goodman lost his cold. Paul Reiser runs around in BDSM skin. Oh it's a riot all right. Hitch is probably soon going to lose interest. Liv Tyler plays the femme fatale and critics complain that he doesn't have to have a registry for her. But it is irrelevant: this film is not about character development. In fact, I would go so far as to say there is no character at all. What you should appreciate here is a conspiracy. Some people wonder why all these "stars" - Reba is here and here - for good - sign up for such a project. Courses think it would be fun. Maybe they were having fun. Who knows? Hey - maybe they paid off well. However, you must visibly overturn money one way or another to see this turkey. And that's probably not a good idea.
