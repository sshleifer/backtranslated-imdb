Ed Gein: The Plainfield Butcher is located in the small American town of Plainfield, Wisconsin in 1957, where Ed Gein himself (Kane Hodder) lives alone on the farm after death if his mother and brother. Local police had the pretext of heavy robberies to deal with when the local bartender Sue Layton (Ceia Coley) suspects that something ugly is happening. Ed is a violent sexual deviant man who kidnaps girls and murders them, the police will find out in time the truth to save Eric (Adrienne Frantz) sheriff's daughter (Timothy Oman) ... <br /> <br /> Written by Michael Produced and directed Feifer was an attempt to start a horror movie around the actual events around the notorious serial killer Ed Gein & turns out to be pretty stupid. Real Life Ed Gein was only sometimes convicted of two murders and died in 1984, but several films were inspired by him including the Texas Chainsaw Massacres (1974), Deranged (1974) and Ed Gein (2000) with this quite recent addition of possibly being the worst Gein movie ever. Although Ed Gein was real besides nothing in this film based on reality, Gein never had an accomplice, none of his victims were related to any investigating officer, there was no car accident victim, though Gein holds his name to other people \ t and the murder of the two women depicted here actually happened four years apart in reality, but in this movie it happens over a few days & while here Gein is portrayed as a large, powerful muscular man in fact was thin, skinny, old and quite short . As a drama of Ed Gein: The Butcher of Plainfield is worthless and as pure fun, it's no better with a deadly dark pace and a feeling that the characters are boring and not killing anyone. around & it's very boring. There is no tension because we know who the murderer is and it's just a tedious wait to get caught at the end. There is no real attempt to get into Gein's mind with the creators who give him no more motivation than the occasional hallucinations of his native mother. Here's not a lot of gore, there's a scene with a woman hanging on a meat hook, there is a really poorly groomed scene of Gein's feet off, there are the usual glasses of body organs and skulls that lie around, just like a little bit blood, but there really isn't much here to be excited. Obviously, the film was designed to bleach a lot of color from the picture, because sometimes it is not black and white, I personally think that the lack of color is even duller to sit. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of around $ 150000, I can't really see where money went in a very forgotten production. Although set in Wisconsin this was filmed in California. Kane Hodder is bad for Ed Gein's role, just from a physical point of view Hodder doesn't look remotely like Gein & he gives a pretty bad performance because he's just staring at the camera doing a lot of silly faces. Br /> <br /> Ed Gein: BUCHER Plainfield is stupid and so simple and simple. Like either a dramatic drama or pure exploitative fun, it is total audacity from start to finish with nothing to recommend.
