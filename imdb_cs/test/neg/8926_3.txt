Harlan Banks is a thief at the top of his game, but after a successful career he decided to settle with his wife and retire. However, he decides to take one last routine job in Las Vegas. All he has to do is drive a car and it seems simple. Unfortunately, someone is guessing the police and, after hectic pursuit of the car, plunges into the straw to escape and take revenge on those who betrayed him and put him in the first place. A typical action-fest follows. Steven Seagal plays himself (surprise!) Wearing a trench coat and sports his beloved Colt 1911 along with his usual aikide that breaks bones. Colt and Aikido were always with him, but the first thing I reminded him of being in a trench is in a Stranger. It's not particularly impressive, but Seagal's arsenal of bad cruelty adds a small notch. Or it covers the cakes he wraps. Look at how you choose. His chief comrade throughout the movie plays Treach (another new thing, a rapper in action film) and they both reveal a small plot of criminals, on both sides of the law, and grants every evil that does. The main problem with the movie is that it is painful, and I really think painfully, unoriginally. Seagal follows the film chart throughout the film and even gets more and more bored of how the film progresses. Then it goes from boring to totally ridiculous in the final scene, because people who seemed dead when they suddenly killed each other, for no reason, began to talk. Groan evokes words in every sense. The only real positive thing is a decent opening - a Las Vegas chase car with lousy police cars and generally fun chaos, but after this brief highlight, you've seen it all before. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: constant violence and profanity
