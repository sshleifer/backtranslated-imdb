This movie spends most of its time preaching that this is a script that makes a movie, but apparently there was no scenario when they shot this waste of time! The trailer makes it a comedy, but the film cannot decide whether it wants to be a comedy, drama, romance or action movie. Press releases indicate that Shatner and Hamlin made this film because they liked the script (what did they think?). If you like William Shatner (I) see instead of "Free Enterprise".
