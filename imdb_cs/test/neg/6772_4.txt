Danny apologizes. <br /> <br /> It's always the same mistakes and it's not interesting to watch. At first I felt him addicted to him. His heart came out at the beginning and somewhere along the line he went over the line. It is almost as if he has continued to do this to keep the show going and at the same time seriously risking his life and the welfare of his family, especially his children. It's hard, even if it is a pity to a poor boy. I think he needs to watch this show, maybe he would have a chance to save this marriage. I don't understand how Gretchen stays with him, and I wonder how much it is just for the show and how much love is. Danny, get your life - the new one! ... and don't get me on Dr. Gary. What's wrong with him and his face? His skin seems to be stretched to its maximum. Besides, the look doesn't mean anything, but it doesn't seem to be particularly impartial. I think he, too, keeps it for his own monetary gain and is often not in the best interests of Gretchen or Danny. These people are little confused and everyone reminds me of a dog chasing a tail. sad, very sad. Download together.
