Hope Floats with Sandra Bullock is a real disappointment. The story starts fine. Her husband cheats her and she finds out on national television. So he has to rebuild his life. Here it could be interesting or built in a storyline, but you're so bored with it. He returns with his parents and Harry Connick Jr, who plays Justin, starts to beat her. The two have no real chemistry, but your supposed impression that Justin is in love with her. The film ends the way you imagine it, but you want it to not end up like any other kind. They had a good start with this movie and could turn it into something traceable but instead its a movie that you definitely want to miss.
