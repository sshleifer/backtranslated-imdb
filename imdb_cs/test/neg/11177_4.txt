Tremendously beautiful Charlotte Lewis stars as a woman who is terrorized by spirits who bother her on the phone. Crushed to the edge in horror Charlotte is forced to face this chilling secret to save her common sense and her life. "Ultimo Mondo Cannibale", "Cannibal Holocaust" and "House on the Edge of Park" directed this absurd piece of basket. It is true that the music of Goblin frontman Claudio Simonetti is pretty good, but the story is painfully stupid. Franco Ferrini's script is ridiculous and doesn't make sense, it's a bad deal and there's absolutely no tension. The scene in which the potential bully of Lewis Lewis is killed by coins ejected from the subway is more than a laugh. Don't waste your time with this piece of crap. There are much better Italian horrors out there!
