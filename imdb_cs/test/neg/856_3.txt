Okay, now I'm pretty sure my summary got your attention and my comment that Zazu Pitts is Satan is not without any foundation. Let me explain. The film first appears to be a dandy B-film about an evil organization called "Crooked Circle" and their vow of revenge in the form of murder on a rival organization dedicated to solving crimes. Although it is very strange (especially the idea of ​​a club of private citizens dealing with crimes) and it could be interesting, this film fell apart despite a rather impressive list of well-known supporting actors. Why? Well, because Zazu Pitts (never one of my favorite actresses) spends most of the whining movie just like Olive Oyl with a bad tooth! While murders are committed, people are abducted or whatever, you can always rely on Zazu whining in full volume - almost like an unpleasant 3-year-old who wants everyone to pay attention to the party! At the same time, it is NOT an integral part of the film, but has received top billing. Why is she behind me - I suppose it's just whining and screaming. As a result, I practically didn't recognize the film and was completely destroyed. Now you probably know why I called this actress of dubious talent "Satan"! I'm sure that when the actors in this film saw the final product, they also felt pretty much the same as I did about my terrible excessive and amateur performance. This movie is in public domain and can be downloaded for free on the internet. I see why.
