I finished this unofficial adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft is a "lurking fear" that was shot in Louisiana. Beyond a few changes (names, settings), this follows a short story point by point for the first 70 minutes, but then tries to inject your own "twist" end that you might see coming from a mile away. Either way, it's much better than Full Moon's LURKING FEAR. Too bad it's a horrible movie. Director David McCormick shoots a thing with everything industrial short. I swear I counted two camera moves. Creation is cheap (we are talking about buying the masks bought here), but they shot in a dark way (deliberately or not) where they are somewhat scary. The most impressive thing in the picture is an abandoned lock, but McCormick won't use it either. File this under good adaptation, bad execution.
