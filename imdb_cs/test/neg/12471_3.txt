"Tart" is a good example of old Yogi Berra saying, "If you don't know where you're going, you'll probably end up somewhere else". Writer / director Christina Waye (in her first feature film) was able to make a $ 3 million movie that ends up somewhere else. "Tart" is one story of an aging, devoid of character, with which a rational person can unite, a black comedy without humor, or a sexploitation movie without anything that is particularly sexy. Unlike Film Swain, "Tart", he actually employed a competent and experienced production designer. Good enough to provide two very nice shots: the Swain and Barton scene, who, together with the bubble bath and Swain's scene in the park, presented a nice assembly of "Alice in Wonderland" sculpture. The symbolism incorporated into these elements supports the possibility that Waye (despite the absence of linear logic or unity of tones) actually has some visionary talent and desire for quality film. It is even possible that Waye tried to merge the somewhat expressionist "Metropolitana" and the classic camp "Cruel Intentions", which also deals with the upper class of Manhattan. There are many camera shots that are framed by windows and doors, but few tight shots of faces and eyes. The former technique points to symbolism and the second to deliberate distancing from characters and their motivations. "Tart" seemed to be on the verge of turning into camp territory at least twice, and it would be well recommended to continue this direction. At first there was a scene in which they tried to throw out the seemingly deceased Swain into the trash slip. Then there is the whole bitta about her father who is Jewish (played to the same extreme as Joel Gray dances with a Jewish guerrilla in "Cabaret"). In his other films, Swain's acting technique is to overwhelm every scene in which he appears (to put in a scene of chewing), but in the movie "Tart" he actually shows the ability to limit himself. This is the best performance of her career. It also provides some clues about her physical deterioration from willow super cute in "Girl" to a massive lumpy-faced in "pumpkin". This transformation was about half the time it was "Tart"; So go on devastating time. Mischa Barton ("The sixth sense is" I feel better girl ") and Lacey Chabet is excellent in supporting roles. The rest of the cast is just terrible, though some of the blame for it should go to Waye's script and direction.
