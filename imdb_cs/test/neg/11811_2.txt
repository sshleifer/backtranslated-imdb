Well, that's what it should be called. Especially because of the absurd, ham use of what a director can hardly call symbolism. I wouldn't be surprised if I found out that it was A) One of Lea Pool's earliest endeavors and B) at least partially autobiographical. It turns out that A is bad, even though I don't know about B. I'll bet she attended boarding school, and had a rather horrible relationship of the same sex of SOME kind. This is the message that was defeated by this film with our throats and the short film that preceded it, whose name I no longer remember. In any case, the development of the characters was clumsy (Who Nobodyâ€¦) introduced himself by saying what her name means? Nobody.) The symbols were as gentle as a glass elevator full of teenage girls who had lost the cable and had eighty stories. All over the speaker. Frankly, the falcon shouting when Perabo said he was a predator and jumped out of the table? It was ridiculous to the point of parody. And it was just one of too many symbols to show even the dumbest viewers. And that was that she had a miserable childhood and felt the need to make films about him, Vincent Gallo, instead of seeing a therapist, all of us coming into our lives. There was nothing tender about the movie, nothing sweet and nothing happened. It was a badly corrected garbage, and the actors couldn't save Brett Ratneresque over the top of "HEY THIS IS MY POINT IN THIS FILM" using film techniques, writing and playing. Sorry, but it was terrible.
