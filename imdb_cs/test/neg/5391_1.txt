I, like many others at this site, I bought this movie on my local WM in "two for $ 11.00" cheap-bin. I like cheesy B horror and sci-fi movies, and this definitely fits in this category. Almost what everyone else in this place said is dead. Yes, it was wrong, but that was to be expected. The "main" problem I had with this movie is that it was essentially BORING. I mean serious yawning-o-rama. The behavior was bad, the costumes (K Mart Skeletor outfit circa 1982) were worse and the cut was terrible. No continuity. Mr. Skeletor eventually dies in an explosion ... uh, even though he encountered multiple blasts during this movement. I think the last one took his tax on him. Earlier encounters with this "military" group (cough) seem to have chosen their horse tax. Even for movie B, do yourself a favor and skip it. All I can do is add a DVD to my collection. Hopefully no one will know when they look at my movie collection. Thumbs down, great time.
