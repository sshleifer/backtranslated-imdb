Although I am a big fan of John Turturro's work as an actor and director, ILLUMINATA is a big disappointment. Although the film has charming moments, it will fall. Worst of all, the movie is confusing. Where's the movie? Italy or Italian set in New York? Why bother making a historical movie if he fails to communicate the settings? If you want to see a well done, inspiring historical film also about the theater, check out Tim Robbins THE CRADLE WILL ROCK. This film has many pluses, including the subtle performance of John Turturro.
