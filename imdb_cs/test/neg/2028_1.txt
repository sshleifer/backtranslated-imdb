Wind. Easily one of the worst movies ever. The only good that comes from this kind of senseless propulsion is the fact that seeing movies like this will get a distribution to indy horror filmmakers like I believe my upcoming feature will cut too. I mean, if it were a horrible horror market, I could buy a piece of property that took my garbage out for 83 minutes. The full list of what this movie lacks will take too long to be possible. But highlites are: no story, horrible acting, terrible cinematography and virtually no adjustments. The last one worried me the most. This film, as an editor, has completely gone crazy because it has almost no modifications. Each scene was shot in the master. They had no coverage at all. For anyone who doesn't know ... "coverage" is shooting a scene from multiple angles to make editing adjustments to achieve the desired viewing experience. Yeah, this movie had none of it. I'm talking about the simplest scenes. Example: An ordinary scene of conversation between two people sitting at a table would usually start with a master who determines who is in the scene and where they are. After the conversation continues, you can move forward and backward as you continue the conversation. You can even throw in a notch shot or two of something on your desk or in someone's hand. Anything. This is "movie 101". These people seem to have no idea that the films are working. Every shot was blocked by the camera. No movement, no cutting, nothing. If I taught a course in filmmaking, it would be a visual aid to my lesson "What not to do". <br /> <br /> Don't waste time with people closing. The only thing that is amazing about this movie is that it ever reached a split. <br /> <br /> <br />
