Where to start? This movie is very entertaining if you're in an awesome rugby game, but if you live outside the US and watch the game, it's ridiculous. Various rugby traditions such as "Haka" which is preformed by New Zealand "all blacks" and only all blacks. The Haka leader is usually a team member with the best Maori pedigree. This is one of the most important conventions of modern play and has been abused and represented by the writer. The film itself is very well directed, but it is a bad script and everywhere executed performance that makes it difficult. Considering it is based on a true story, it has a lot of clich√©s in the story. I strongly recommend that every American interested in rugby watch this movie and watch what is actually rugby on Youtube because the rugby shown in this movie has been distorted and distorted so far from what it really is.
