We found this movie almost impossible to watch. With such a super cast it is a pity that writing and direction were so terrible. The unbearable pace at which the story was told was crazy. The flashes were clumsy. The characters were one-dimensional. Heavy metaphors - river, cat - have been repeated too often. Nobody's Crazy, based on another Russo novel, was infinitely better, probably because he was more firmly written and directed. The photos in Empire Falls were beautiful. Too bad it wasn't a travelogue. I read the novel and enjoyed writing style, but I had a few words with the novel itself. I would give the novel 4 out of 5 stars. Perhaps the writers and director were so encouraged by the novel's reputation that they felt they had to include every damn thing in their film. It was supposed to be a TV movie, guys, not Books on Tape.
