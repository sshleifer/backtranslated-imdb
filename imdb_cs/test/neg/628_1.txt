L'Auberge Espagnole is less fun and less interesting than any Dobie Gillis episode. Where is their Bob Denver? Do they even have Dwayne Hickman? The Frenchman moves to Barcelona to attend classes. She moves with other students who are no more interesting than herself and do and say uninteresting things. This film is incredibly bland. The only bright spot was a pretty French girl who played a Belgian lesbian. She puts her hands behind her head and reveals shaved armpits, not the usual tufts of dark, smelling hair. But bare armpits are not a good movie. L'Emmerdeur was funny as well as La Cage aux Folles. L'Auberge Espagnole and Le Placard are interested in what's going on with the French comedy.
