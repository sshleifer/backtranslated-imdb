Boy, this movie is bad. And not in a good, kitschy, fun way. Even MST3K couldn't stop it from getting bored, and it's also confusing when everyone gets out. The most unpleasant part of this dull mess, however, is Ireland's ugly high voice. Not to mention how truly unpleasant her nature is. Even her dad ran away and left her! I see why, honestly. If he had had to listen to her whining in her little voice for more than a few minutes, he would have been tempted to do her much harm. As I was, till the end of the movie. Moreover, it is useless and unpleasant. When it falls after a long hole in the country, Alice in Wonderland, in the first ten minutes, she would have done it if this inexplicable Australian accented miner had rescued her from all sorts of folds she still fell into. . He was supposed to tie her up with the Atlantic version of the train tracks and do with her. And this Atlantis underground with a strange, confusing obsession with bone density, I have to ask - where was the light down there? Do they have generators that mimic the sun? It doesn't matter. Nor is there any real conspiracy, just a bunch of peculiar costume Gothic wannabes trying to catch Kathy (probably by holding a gag in their mouths). Stupid, meaningless film. I thank Golan Globus for this film outrage. May you burn in the seventh circle of hell for all eternity.
