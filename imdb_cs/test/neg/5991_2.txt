Sometimes Full Moon makes fun movies. This is not one of them. The full moon is like Troma. Their films are not so violent outside the wall, but they are usually just as talentless. Playing in this movie is not terrible, but the script is pretty bad, and overall it is quite boring and does not contain any nudity (like many full moon movies) to redeem it. Skip this, and go rent "Family Head".
