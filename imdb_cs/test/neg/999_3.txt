The basic genre is an intercut thriller with an uncomfortable menage-a-trois. Fellowes tried to get more out of it, using the lies of the title to bring all kinds of small twists that were always designed to surprise the characters more than the audience. It's really a bit messy. It seems that Fellowes is not interested in presenting the thriller elements in fashion that would save us. Rather, it focuses on moral difficulty. The dialogue here is contradictory, it is here, folk language and the constant surprise of realism, which is sometimes an occasional clich√©. Although there is no disturbance in places to allow actors to cope with existing ones in their space, the terrible score cannot create another dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of the pieces. He's also very prosaic, I dare say the British feel about filming. I did not want to see the documentary of two successful Central European people who were in an emergency, I wanted to see some artistic description of the story. Finally, it's actually a story that allows the rest. Just as the tension elements are rather flat, the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes, woven as a means of exploring character. Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-essay with good performances, and John Warnaby's ebullient fellow Simon to Wilkinson is a welcome film for most of the eyebrows that are looming. I'm disappointed; Not that it's bad, but it could have been much better. 3/10
