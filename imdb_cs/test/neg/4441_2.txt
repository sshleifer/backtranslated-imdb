The previous review is largely based on the goal that Altman was not with this film. I haven't seen it since its original release, but I rarely spent two hours in the theatrical feeling of being pathetic and disappointed with how I was with this movie. If a humble community theater had tried a sci-fi version of Ingmar Bergman's movie, it might look like this. I can't bring myself something Altman did "1", but it's probably a nadir career that had some notable heights and lows. I would go out, but as a paid film critic I couldn't. (Think about it the next time you envy film critics.)
