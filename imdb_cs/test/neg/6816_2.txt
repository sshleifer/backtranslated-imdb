"Dogmatic," as another reviewer has described, is a good word. The director's intention was to introduce Bach without plot, acting, entertainment, theatrical, dialogue, narrative or drama. Mission accomplished, Monsieur Straub. "Conceited?" Yes. "Movie?" In any case. It's against the cinema. Nobody moves. Hardly anyone is talking. The camera keeps static shots for 10-12 minutes at a time: the camera sometimes runs inside. You can glimpse Gustav Leonhardt's finger-moving fingers. That is all. <br /> <br /> If you like the idea of ​​staring at the back of a (confused) harpsichordist for 7 minutes while pulling while listening to Bach, it's a movie for you. I'd rather listen to Bach on my stereo with my eyes closed.
