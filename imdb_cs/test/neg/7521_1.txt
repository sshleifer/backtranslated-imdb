I was one of the many fools who were knocked out for paying for it in the theater, even though I paid 4 bucks at matin√©e prices (sixteen hours ago). The story of the remake was hum, CGI Morlocks were lame, Eloi were Rastafarians to emulate today's fads (no, I didn't think the cat was hot at all), the re-killing of a modern hero's girlfriend was somewhat cruel Overall, only a sad, bad remake. I'll take Rod Taylor, Ween and the fat shining surfer Morlocks every time. My guess is that many reviewers who like this terrible remake are little children who don't take into account the good taste or the real value of the old classics that today's confused and increasingly desirable young people have not much appreciated. <br /> <br /> When the 60's was released (the first time I saw it in the 1970s for summer fun), it was pretty damn impressive and still sticking. You don't have to have excess CGI in the movie to make it better. Too much of it looks fake. I can't say enough about how unbelievably bad Morlocks looked and ran and jumped out as if they were in a children's video game. 3 Stars out of 10.
