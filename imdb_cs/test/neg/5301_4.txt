I really liked Get Shorty, but this movie was totally disappointing as a sequel. Travolta is by no means like Chili Palmer from Get Shorty. He only half-assed this showing as he did in all his more recent films. He absolutely is not smooth or have a gangster presence about him who makes you a bit root for him throughout the movie. It looks as if Travolta rolled out of bed and decided he was good at this movie. The storyline wasn't just exciting or clever, in fact, it wasn't any event that happened, the only thing that was like entertainment was watching Christina Millian and The Rock was fun. But anyway, a long story, this film was a waste and I had to get myself through it.
