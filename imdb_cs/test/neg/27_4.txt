"Cover Girl" is a bland musical of World War II with absolutely unforgettable, besides its signature song "Long Ago and Far Away". This movie came out before Gene Kelly really hit his artistic move, and while there is evidence of his growing talent here, mostly played by Riddle Hayworth. And there's a problem. Rita Hayworth is beautiful, no doubt about that. But it's not just a convincing presence on the screen. I always felt like I liked her more than I did, and this film is no exception. She's just not a very good actress and she's not a very good dancer. Good looking, as she is, is something awkward about her and this film suffers because of it. <br /> <br /> Level: C-
