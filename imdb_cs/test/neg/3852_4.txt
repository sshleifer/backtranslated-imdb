The only reason anyone would like to see this movie would be John Leguizamo. I remember the previews and it looked like another second speed comedy. But the fact that Mr. Leguizamo was playing tried to redeem him. His name, as it was known or not at the time, tried to sell him. <br /> <br /> I was quite disappointed with Leguizamo's performance. His days at "House of Buggin" (clone "In Living Color") were his tip-top. There is a subtle line between stupidity and idiocy, and we just say that Leguizamo crossed it ten times. He looked like he was trying to be too shameful and crazy about the camera. In fact, I'll say he was trying too hard. Madcap humor spilled into stupidity and the film was spoiled. I can't say I blamed him if you got this opportunity, would you try it if you could, right? Your eagerness is dear to you, even though Mr. Leguizamo ... <br /> <br /> Pest follows the tradition of any comedy movie and plays the "racing card" and more. No group is left out of the fact that there is no fun at it. Blacks, Latins, whites, Jews, Koreans, Germans, homosexuals and blinds are among those who are chosen. Again here, things get too overboard, and too much tries to get spoofed in too little time. Film resolution takes up to five minutes to clear and return to normal. <br /> <br /> When you have a movie and you bypass the plot and the reality of comic interest, make sure it's funny or all you have is 90 minutes of meaningless film. Which would pretty much sum up Leguizam's "Pest" ...
