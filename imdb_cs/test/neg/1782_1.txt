There's so much bad to say about this movie and so little that it's good! The storyline has enough holes to sink the Titanic, the characters are absolutely incredible, the monsters are so unrealistic, and I'm sick and tired to see movies that include ex-husband and ex-wife being thrown together in some bizarre emergency state - it happens too often in movies and it becomes another bad clich√©. <br /> <br /> I found it hard to believe that anyone who invested $ 1 in making this waste doesn't mind $ 100 or so it must be worth it. <br /> <br /> You could make a better movie with more compelling special effects on your home computer! I didn't think movies could be so bad! Avoid it at all costs - do something that is fun and fun, such as pulling teeth or enema!
