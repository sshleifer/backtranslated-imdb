Terrible is really all you need to know. First imagine all the things that might be bad about the movie. And then try to make a movie that's bad in all these ways. You make "Vacationland". Maine State should feel offended: it is too nice a place to serve as a backdrop for such a senseless, mindless, boring schlock. I'm romantic and I always want two people to succeed each other, and I tried to find the best in this. It was hard; very hard. I couldn't find a glimpse of the emotional connection between any figure in this exercise in the grim roughness. Except maybe in one or two bad guys. Maine is a good holiday landscape; this movie is not.
