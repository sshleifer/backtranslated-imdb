Just above the box I am writing now, I had to choose a number between 1 and 10 and rate this feature film. Unfortunately, there is no option for a number less than zero and I have to give something. If I had a choice, I wouldn't read anything, no number, because there are no numbers that express the worthlessness of this movie. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch this movie after reading all these horrible reviews, make sure there are no sharp or blunt objects in this area to help prevent attempts to kill yourself in the middle of the movie. I don't know how this movie was released to the public, it should be locked and guarded 24/7 somewhere in Fort Knox. I'm upset that this movie was even available for me to watch. I feel cheated by mankind, I had no idea that people could be so cruel. Stalin, Saddam, and Hitler didn't get anything on this Cowell bag. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the film cover. 1) There are no scarecrows, no one knows why a legitimate looking scarecrow is on the front. 2) None of the characters on the back of the case is in a stinking movie! 3) The line says something about "new moon, more sacrifices", there were no frigging victims that nobody even died. We don't know if the dam officer died, and I assume the killer didn't die because it sounded like he was hit over his head with a frigging whiffle ball bat. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie, unnecessarily about 4 hours of my life. That's true four, it took me an hour to look at it (even fast forward over 4 minutes of approaching scenes that reveal nothing to conspiracy), watching TV about an hour after it was over, thinking about my life and The direction it was after watching this crap, and then I started crying for the next two hours because I know someone there will unfortunately see this movie and there is nothing I can do to stop it.
