There are many reasons why I am not a fan of fact-based movies, but more than any other is the way in which creators grant a creative license to the story. If they have such great ideas, then why not use this talent to make something original? Otherwise stick to the facts. That might be okay if only they did it. Ed Gein was an insane scary human being. It was said that if you were to take Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, and Leatherfacus, wrap them up in one person, Ed Gein would still be more sick / frightening. So why can't anyone shoot a movie about it that could tell? When will he realize that reality is finally more frightening than fiction? I have read books and watched news shows about him and now I'm not a screenwriter or anything, but I believe there is enough documentation on Gein that shouldn't take a lot of work a story about all these atrocities he committed, without creating murders that have never been documented. I am aware that he was found guilty of only two murders, but with all the evidence he found in his house and in the barn, there should be a lot of other ways to put this film together than to use a Member's relationship with his mother and girlfriend as a filler, and too much of it. I think what I was thinking is ... why at the end of the movie did I know more about support characters than I was about Ed Gein? Why didn't we recognize his Mother, Father and brother and the relationship between them ... what made him a psychopath who was ... what abuse did he endure as a child that could have contributed to the man he had become? All we got from his childhood were flashes like a little boy ... running. Finally, I gave him 4/10 stars. That's 2 for gore and 2 for Kane Hodder. Although it was, in my opinion, something bad, because Gein was a small man and maybe effeminate, and Hodder is something other than small and nowhere near what I would consider a woman. Maybe I was just excited because he was Jason Voorhees.
