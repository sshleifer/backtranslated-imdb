At first I thought it was bad because I had a great response to this movie but after I thought it was bad. I was almost caught up in hk promoting bad stars in bad movies. Hk is a new generation of actors and actresses not to mention bad writers bringing industry down. at the moment, they're still trying to figure out how high it is. normally you can't lose in a movie with donnie yen and ekin (forget about jackie, he's behind his top). But then I had to figure it out when the twins were on the cover. it's cheesy, camped, very scaly, I try to laugh at some jokes, but not only is the effect very minimal, but the jokes are very recycled and not funny. I'm sorry I bought the movie. The only reason some people think it's so good is that they are brainwashed by the brain, that the twins are cute, and everyone likes them and that everything they do is good and funny. And that if you like twins, then you are up to date ... <br /> <br /> sigh ... I miss good hk movie days when you go li and stephen chow movies dominated by box office ... movies from mainland China are much better, and are shot for lower budgets.
