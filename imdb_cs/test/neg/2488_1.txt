I was expecting a documentary film covering the Sci-Fi era from 1950 to 1965, and received a large commercial ad with a leftist political allusion to James Cameron and a movie mogul boom that pushes its own works. "Watch the Sky" in the past referred to the films "Giant Bug" and "Space Exploration" of the 1950s, including such favorites as "Earth vs.". flying saucers, "thing from another world" and "forbidden planet". "Them", "Deadly Mantis" and "Tarantula". There are examples of lower budgets that are rarely mentioned as "Space Monster", "12 to the Moon" and "Cosmic Man". It would be a much better documentary in which several remaining actors, directors, stuntmen and collectors and non-Hollywood boomers from the era were approached. I just wish there was a "0" rating because "1" is very generous.
