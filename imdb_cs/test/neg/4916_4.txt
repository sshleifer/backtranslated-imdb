It is not good. - Not at all. This payment revolves around the descent of the original killer at Amityville's house, who has to face her past to get rid of the terrifying terror of Amityville itself. Basically nothing. I bet this movie was made for some extra fast money to buy a boat or something ... because this is just ridiculous ... Fortunately, the series won't kill or spoil it, but it has no effect on the show at all. I must say that the fact that she is constantly referring to an old, infamous house is probably the only thing that makes this more bearable than "The Amityville." Curse".
