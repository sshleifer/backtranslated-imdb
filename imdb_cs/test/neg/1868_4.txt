Some things just don't stay dead. They just have to keep coming back, whether we like it or not. I think some people like to beat a dead horse. The first 'Ghoulies' was a surprising hit and it's the first sequel to an even better film. The third film took a more comic approach and at this point the small buggers began to exaggerate. I think someone out there in Hollywood thought it was a good idea to resurrect the franchise, but the result will probably be disappointed by the fans of previous records. Pros: Acting is actually pretty good for a movie like this. Stupid but fun score. It's moving fine. Some cheese for those who love him. Some pretty good action-packed sequences. He has a little more conspiracy than others, and unlike II & III, at least he tries to connect with the original. Disadvantages: It's not nearly as fun as its predecessors. Although it has more conspiracies than before, it's pretty ridiculous. Bad effects. The original Ghoulies appear only in flashbacks, and here they are replaced by two trolls that do not serve a purpose other than being comic reliefs. Speaking of comedy, all humor attempts are poor. It is a direct continuation of the first film, but there are so many free ends. For example, I thought Jonathan was done with black magic after what happened in the original? Not that it was spectacular in the others, but the direction of this film is particularly bland. Final Thoughts: The first three "Ghoulies" are a bad dream for movie lovers. This fourth and final (Hopefully) is a little disappointing. Certainly there is some fun to be, but it's just not the same. Others also have a low budget, but the people involved in it have invested much more. See if you're full or you want to see beautiful women in modest clothes. Otherwise just stick with the other three. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
