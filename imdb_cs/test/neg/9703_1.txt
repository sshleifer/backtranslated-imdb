From the first footage of the film - Keira Knightley, when Elizabeth Bennet wandered through the field reading at dawn, evoking all the cinema clich√©s that evolved to deal with the phenomenon of a heavily rebellious female character in period drama - I knew I was something for me he wanted to kill himself. Not only did Joe Wright not read the book, but he was regrettably misunderstood that what he was shooting was not really a savage Jane Austen comedy in the way it was done through the sparkling, subtle social interactions of the eighteenth century English drawing room, but some kind of U-certificate Wuthering Heights. So we were treated with every scene between Elizabeth and Darcy, which took place outside for no apparent reason, in an unevenly rugged landscape and often in a downpour. Not to mention that Jane Austen, and especially P & P, is not about passion, sexual tension or love. It's about different strategies for negotiating the fate of an eighteenth century society. Which was totally ignored, so Bennets' house was an incredible, chaotic place where all of them suddenly screamed, ran around, left their underwear on their chairs, and the pigs walked merrily through the house; party balls become a cheerful country dance one step away from the dance orgy Matrix Reloaded; and they all say exactly what they think, with no respect for accuracy. Jane Austen's genius consists in exploring the emptiness created by a society in which no one says what they think or think because of the overwhelming view of decency and the tragic ills of their characters resulting from misunderstandings and poor communications that this speech gap allows. So both Jane Austen's brilliance and the factor that makes her charts - especially in this movie - work, have been completely erased. Subtlety generally was nowhere in his film, sacrificed in favor of an overloaded drama that thrashed entirely with material and performances. It was so obviously trying to be a * serious * movie. Humor - which is Pride & Prejudice, both Austen's methodology and her appeal - was almost completely suppressed in favor of this ubiquitous melodrama, and when allowed, he was treated so clumsily. Pride & Prejudice is a serious story that does serious points, yes, but those serious points and more serious themes are not just intertwined with humor but are embedded in it. You can't lose Jane Austen's technique, leave only the bare bones of the story and expect them to stay. Even if you replace her own techniques, the hard-to-control mystic-numinous fauxbrow cinematography. Elizabeth Bennett is to be a woman, an adult, a mature and a sensible and clearly visible. Keira Knightley played the first half of the film as a giggling, empty-headed schoolgirl, and the other half as an empty-headed schoolgirl who thinks she's a tragic heroine. Elizabeth is a joke, her verbal exchange of words, her quintessential character, that she is able to see and laugh at everyone, including her own strength, her strength and serenity, and her fantastic vision was completely lost and replaced ... ? Lots of giggling and staring into the distance? Instead of being able to keep her head when everyone was losing her, she started crying and screaming at the slightest provocation - and she didn't even sound like that; No, these were grumpy hissy sitting. And where the great power of Austen's Elizabeth (at least in Austen's eyes) was her ability to maintain integrity and adherence, while remaining within society and maintaining unmanageable justice, Knightley's Elizabeth had no respect for the convention. In addition, he seemed to think that wandering in the eighteenth-century version of the mud in the mud undoubtedly questioned her as witty and strong-minded, and therefore had nothing to do in her nature, as it was written or in her performance. Incredibly indecent and bland performance. In which search for weakness and weakness, Matthew Macfayden inspired her. Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet seemed to be weak, inefficient and permanently confused without the evil sense of humor and ironic detachment at the expense of man. the relationships that make Mr. Bennet so fascinating and tragic. His strange bond with Lizzie, as the only two sensible people in the world of fools, was completely lost, not least because they were both fools in the world of fools, and that completely rid the end of the film's emotional impact. Mr. Bingley was no longer friendly and well-meaningful to the point of insanity, but he played as a complete retard for cheap laughs, and the woman who played Jane was so wildly contradictory that she couldn't even try to do anything with the sign at all. The scenario alternated wildly between Jane Austen's literal pieces - adding with remarkable clumsiness - and a totally contemporary language that wouldn't be in a modern day romantic comedy on the spot. save your grief.
