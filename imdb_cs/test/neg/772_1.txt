Sideshow is a good example of an interesting idea that was very, very bad. As for horror movies, and especially with the influx of teen movies at the moment, a film based on a lot of teenagers visiting a mysterious magical show is something you can have fun with. However, the writer decided to make a very straightforward, very boring, very simple story about five adolescents who become part of the show as the enraged dwarf Abbot Graves turns them into a madman using some pathetic machine that mutates them for animals. Five teenagers pick up one by one until the last guy stays, his 'punishment' is that he can't join his friends, so 'be alone'. What kind of waste! 'Actors' are really poor, this movie has no comedy (and it could have been so funny!), no gore (and it could have been so cruel!), no action and no horror (and could it has so much of both!) <br /> <br /> The director has failed in his obligation to even try to make it a little interesting to watch. His soft core experience seems to have made it impossible for any creativity he could ever have, because all the shots are the same, with very little adjustment and little movement. Overall quality is poor. I'm not usually swaying nudity in movies, but believe me, the only highlight of this movie was a couple of breasts.
