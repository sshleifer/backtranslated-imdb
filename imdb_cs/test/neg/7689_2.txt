I'm a big MD fan. But I say it as I see it. This film was limping. The chart was pointless. Gaining access to heads of state in this movie is easier than gaining access to a local grocery store. Come on! Tone Loc has a wooden plank emotion. Relax! The adjustment is choppy. Actors, and I use the term freely, sounds like they read their lines on valium. This movie could be better. Dudikoff has the potential, but chooses scripts that just scream, "Stinker". <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good Dudikoff movie, I can suggest Crash Dive or Avenging Force. If you have never seen one of his films, it is not the one who will introduce you to his work. You leave with a bad taste in your mouth and think all his projects are bad.
