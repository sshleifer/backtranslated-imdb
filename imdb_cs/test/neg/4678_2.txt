Bad Company's biggest hits name is "10 From 6". You could just upload this album and lower the sound on this movie. Most of the songs played in the movie were from this album. I think the oldsters during the 1970s were probably tired of all the period pieces made about the 1930s and 1940s. So I feel about the 70's movies. The characters in the film seemed to compete with Danny Terrio. Why is it that movies have to exaggerate the 1970s. The only good period song I liked was "Freaks and Geeks". They were cutting the TV show. It was just like high school when I was back there in 1980. I was old enough to remember the 1970s and no small town like that. It was absolutely youthful. There were no reactions to the hippies and the inner city of Philly. It was more than 70 years that I remember as a child. This film was very boring and cheesy. Sometimes I fell asleep. I don't know why the actor who worked in the 1970s appeared in this. He probably tried to lend him some credibility. Walken didn't even show up until the second half. I think the only real thing about the movie was "baby boomers" were / are spoiled a lot. All the children in the movie were spoiled brat. I don't know what they had against their father.
