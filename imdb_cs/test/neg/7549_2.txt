Being a big fan of the show I was really looking forward to releasing this movie. I waited impatiently for a laugh of a roller coaster ride ...... unfortunately. I think its a good start to say that its barely richie and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one inserts that usually deliver so well are funny. I was still waiting for the first laugh after a good 20 minutes of viewing. Many aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film was full of the bad moments they had rehearsed and decided to leave the final cut. The overall Sets and Atmosphere surrounding the movie is dark and dirty, which I think is good if they want to portray the "horrible" inns that 2 buffoons are trying to run, but it's just a little higher a silencer for excused filming should never be created. Negotiations, sometimes, are pathetic. Fenella Fielding is wasted as Mrs. F. oxfur and I saw Simon Pegg have much better trips. <br /> <br /> I would recommend Guest House Paradiso to anyone who is a blind drunk because they could appreciate the terrible puns much more. he has not seen this movie and is waiting for a real richie and eddie action that you have been warned about
