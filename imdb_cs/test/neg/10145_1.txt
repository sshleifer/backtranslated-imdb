While it is easy and accurate to go to why "Reba" in his heart bears witness to many "family-oriented sitcoms" as reflected by other better sitcoms, the truth is that the show is repeated. Stereotypes from the funnier and more pioneering shows, and the leading star is completely out of its element. While I'm sure Mrs. McIntire can sing and have a fan base that supports that being in a sitcom shooting zingers and calling her another Lucille Ball is far, far from reality. Reba herself does not have any presence that would be needed to prove that she is occupied as a traveling woman, to which her entire family is concentrated. However, after watching several episodes, there is no real connection with the character. I couldn't care about her adventure because her nature seems to be MIA. Reba McIntire has no screen presence and, to show her around, it seems very short-sighted and testifies to most "family-oriented" programming: pushing a sitcom full of men - silly / female accompaniment stereotypes that appeal to anyone but those who allow the cable. The show is a waste of time. The only good thing is that it has at least better production values ​​than the standard PAX ripoff.
