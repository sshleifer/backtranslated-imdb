I enjoyed it for the first time at the age of nine and enjoyed the wonderful scenery of this movie. Dunderklumpen is a little cute for kiddies in an oblique way. It reminded me of HRPUFFINSTUFF in the morning, its Swedish backdrops make eyes easier. Don't expect older children to be interested because live action / animation is over and most older children are bored. This is definitely a film under 10 years old and a nice piece of memories for those of us who were young children in 1974.
