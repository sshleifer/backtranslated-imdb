Nestled in the Philippines, the deadly Panther 2 is a hopeless beginning of martial arts martial arts from the early 1990s, seeing a ruthless cop hunting ugly criminals who killed his wife. This film, which is rather inexpensive and has almost no artistic value, relies on the quality and quantity of its activity. But even if there is no lack of fistuffs, weapons and explosions, the quality is not there. Endless battles desperately lack originality or excitement, with poor editing and secular direction, making this movie a real chore to sit down. Usually impressive Yukari Oshima is totally unnecessary and her natural athletic ability is overshadowed. some unbearably bad wire. Ballistic action scenes are an unimaginable combination of the heroism of "slow motion flying air-shooting", crazy pieces of vehicles and endless villains who will shoot. so many better examples of "girls and weapons" genres now available on DVD, I suggest that you leave this option yourself (if, like me, you can endure almost all the old rubbish to be complete ).
