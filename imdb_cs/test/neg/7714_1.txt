When one of the movie's stars is called Sticky Fingaz, you should know that you will stay on. Keep away. HOUSE 2 is just a little bit more, this time with zombies who cross the college campus (the man who had to save money). As usual, "zombies" are given no direction so talk about, and provided very little makeup or costumes. They look like zombies in one of those endless Italian zombie delicacies years ago. Which means they don't look like the kind of zombies we know and love from George Romero and Dan O'Bannon. People fighting with zombies are all idle who get to shoot weapons and do little else. Some who have written here feel that the continuation is a little more focused than the original. All I have to say is that I am glad that the director of the sequel played 360 degree shots that helped destroy the first movie. HOUSE 2 is still the same, which means nothing happens 80 or 90 minutes. There is one set piece, involving tussling soldiers with a football team of zombies, it could at least be funny. It is not.
