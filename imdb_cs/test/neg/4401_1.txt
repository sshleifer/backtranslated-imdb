<br /> <br /> It won't be long for this movie. The first half hour was one of the most boring that I had to face because I started watching movies. The story didn't work out, nothing could be explained about any character. It was like a film. (At this point, a lot of people have left the audience). Many scenes were totally unfounded and inexplicable. The director should have studied the film a little more knowing that every succession, every scene, must make the story forward. He never did. Allegedly funny moments were invented, and only a few people laughed (people with a strange sense of humor, I think). The Cannes Jury Award 2002 ..... I don't know what the jury was thinking about ... probably a "politically correct effect". I'd love it if I did it. therefore even greater. <br /> <br /> You have to see it to believe it. But wait for the video.
