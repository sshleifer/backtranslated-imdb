"New hope of Romanian cinema" ... if it is a new hope, I would not really want to see the messianic hero of such a fertile cinema (Romanian cinema, that is). Seriously, where do I start? 1. Bad Scenario: You're kidding me, it's not even believable, not to mention the high degree of stupidity 2. Direction: what direction? This film was supposed to have at least psychological tension because they decided it would look as much as possible. Eyes, I confess, Council Muntean is not Polanski, Hitchcock, Fincher or Lynch (the list could go on), but at least the effort would be appreciated. 3. Language: Eye, I do not understand why (almost) every Romanian director believes that if you make a film as successful and unclear as possible, then you have art. I do not mind the explicit language or poor image quality until the result is worth it. This is not the case here. There is nothing to comment on, because everything that this film wants to say has been said a thousand times, characters are too sparsely depicted to become unforgettable, "shocking events" that are also poorly illustrated and unimportant. This film relies solely on the emotions induced by itself, the "we have to" hype. Someone was found murdered, so we "MUST" feel sadness, fear or panic, someone has gone through it and "MUST" feel it in a certain way. It's a balloon. Because film is a piece of fiction, there is nothing real about it. The only real emotions are the ones you discover when you roam deep into the world (film, that is) <br /> <br /> * / * * * * *
