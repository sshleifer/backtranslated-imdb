When I first saw previews for this movie on TV, I thought it could be a fun movie. I was wrong. Although I'm not completely against movies that make fun of others. Some are actually funny, such as the first scary movie. It was one of many that were made late, which are not. The humor in this film was something other than funny and was somewhat boring. <br /> <br /> I feel that one of the biggest problems is having fun on many movies like Varsity Blues, Light Night Lights, Stick it And if you're like me, try to choose each movie instead to pay attention to what is happening in this. Even the adult humor in this film was dry. Do yourself a favor and save money and time and rent this movie
