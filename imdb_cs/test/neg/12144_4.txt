It is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not an action film. Billy Dee plays a young man who is full of racism who decides to take things into his own hands. It is quite bold and realistic, without the exploitation of the characters, but it is still not so interesting, and even the character of Billy Dee, although poorly processed by white authorities, does not seem likeable. It is also hurting it is a very low budget. Yet it is interesting to look at how good it is to display the 70s social issues.
