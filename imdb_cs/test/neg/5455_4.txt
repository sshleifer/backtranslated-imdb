"A bored TV director is introduced by his black and astral projection to his girlfriend. He learns the ability to separate his spirit from his body; and his uncontrolled body roams the streets with murderous fury, "according to the synopsis of the DVD sleeve. The synopsis isn't exactly right, as it turns out. Anyway, the film opens with a dizzying example of "handsome director Winston Rekert" (the newly discovered "astral body"). it also marks the upcoming duel. Young Andrew Bednarski (as Matthew Sharpe), being a child, draws pictures of "Blue Man", as his spree murder murders. Handsome Detective John Smith (as Stewart Kaufman) discovers that the victims are linked to Mr. Rekert. Mr. Novak's investigation leads to a supernatural; a prime example of this is Karen Black (as Janus) with whom Rekert fears he has fallen in love. Several in the cast perform well; but, "Blue Man" rises to tie itself in a knot. Aka "Eternal Evil", his unsatisfactory story tries to be too smart for his own good.
