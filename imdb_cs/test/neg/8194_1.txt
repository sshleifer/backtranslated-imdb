When I walked through the canal I came to Channel 124. It's a city canal. I saw this movie and decided to try it. I almost became a mass murderer for this film. I made home movies and they are compared to this huge Dookie mass. Lighting was terrible, and acting was absolutely inexorable. I'd rather watch Star Crystal ....... Holy cow might not be a good example. The main question I have about this movie is ... Was it a movie of morality? The reason I ask is that there was one line where this lady in the wheelchair says, "I would be another gang statistics" Oh my head starts to hurt. After I heard the line, I went to the kitchen and pulled out a knife that is ready to let everyone who dared to watch this movie. But some sense kicked and I changed the channel to watch an Afro man. That's all I have to say about this movie. If you want to endure this pain, continue, but we do not recommend it for those with short fuses or a bad touret case
