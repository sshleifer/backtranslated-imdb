I have read other user comments and I am glad that someone compared them to the original film Kamal called Perumarzhakalam, which was released in 2004. <br /> <br /> The original had a tense story and no gaps as described above on the Indian gov they don't have proper records or even bad shoots and bloopers. The story is great and one touched and well described by others. But unfortunately Nagesh, who ascribes his own story to it, is a sad thing and it means nothing but plagiarism. I think he was hit by Bollywood's "Inspired" syndrome. <br /> <br /> He must at least give credit where it is due. I liked several of his older movies, but now I think some of them were originals. <br /> <br /> Here is a link to IMDb for the original masterpiece. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425350/#comment I encourage everyone to see the original, even if needed with subtitles, to know what the direction of classes and class acting is.
