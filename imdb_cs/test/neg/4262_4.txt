Amitabh and Jiah Khan, their press conferences, have raised great expectations, although it was very easy for critics and fans to do so, that it is a very publicized product of Ram Gopal Verma Factory. , in all probabilities! Why, because Jiah was so immature and childish, and Bacchan was guilty, and insecure. They themselves didn't know what the hell they were talking about, the press, kept up with the tag line, that some love stories didn't need to be understood, or some such garbage! Why is the name Nishabd? Ramu needs to refresh his knowledge of Sanskrit because Vidhu Vinod needs to study Mahabharata, mark in a row, another famous flop of the year, Eklavya! A comparison with Sweet and Lolita's hearts is inevitable because the so-called Conspiracy Line should inspire them. Unfortunately, Ramu has hardly made any serious effort to deeply immerse himself in the aging psyche and young people. Is Lolly Pop Sucking The Ultimate Indicator Of Innocence? and unlike that childhood, the foot at the table at the table shows up with Vijay, is this Bacchan in this role that is constantly bumping into shameless laughter at wards? This girl is actually a seductive game that attracts poor Vijay to think she is in love with him. The legs are also thin enough, and the act of getting the tubing over the legs is obscene at the bottom right. is it beyond the understanding of every person, how can a girl who comes as a guest to some house in the body be so harsh, brash and powerful? and why the hell is that stupid wife Revathi playing, remarkably well, though poorly written and unrealistically characterized, encouraging her husband to dance with a sexy girl who says? The part of Vijay that is trying to get some refreshing into his humdrum of life is absolute crap. because, he seems to be happy as he is, with a well-established life and a hobby to renew. It reminds Blame of it on Rio, his older father and his young love, played great by Michael Caine. Bacchan looks terrible in close-ups, and all over where kevin spacey and Jeremy Irons looked bleak and pretty, which is why young chicks sometimes attract older men to their charming personality compared to the vulnerability of young boys. their age. The only good thing about this film is green, vast land, arched paths, and cinematography. No substance, or even no sparkling show of emotions, drama, or even interesting, tumultuous sex like Lolita, this shallow movie has no wonder, fell on the face and had to be removed from the first screens! next time, before going to Hollywood to unthinkingly copy such a theme, Ramu should do his homework and Bacchan should think twice! you can't deceive all people all the time, Mr. Bacchan!
