I see the pattern. If you see a movie at Mystery Science Theater 3000, it's likely that if you go to IMDb.com there will be hordes of movie lovers, but that was chosen to be on that TV show because it was so bad. I'm sorry, but I read a lot about Rocketship X-M as some landmark sci fi movie that emphasized realism. If that were the case, I could write a few paragraphs about how this 1950s film is completely wrong. Gravity could be the first obvious observation, or how MST3K did as a parody of "selective gravity", also what if they plunged into their death and they just stood there looking out the window, um, if the ship wasn't up to affect this scene? I would like to think that they started with good intentions and that it went beyond budget or something, but I think this movie was just plain cheese like in the subconscious. Compare it to "When the Worlds Collide", which was released in 1951, to see the real place where this film ranks is not a comparison. The film gets 2 or maybe 3 on its own, it's not even funny to watch on your own. It gets about 5 or 6 as an MST3K episode as there is no action or much to make fun, just bad, bad, bad, oh I mentioned, that's wrong.
