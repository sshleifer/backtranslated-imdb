This film earns its 3 for crappy writing, bad technical merit and continuity issues. Some people have given this movie 10 - and maybe it's okay if you're just scoring for its fun factor. But technically it is an indispensable film series from beginning to end - produced by writers, actors and third-degree crews. This really was true of almost all the shows because they were meant to be fun, especially for kids. And there is nothing wrong with it, but "high art" is not !! Spy Smasher earns less than average scores compared to other series because it has even lower quality and has continuity problems - even for the show. It was common for the series to have a "reef hanger" - ie, A Moment at the End of an Episode that appeared as if a good guy dies but miraculously survives when the next episode began. But in this movie, it is much fainter and ridiculous. You would literally SEE the hero to die in the last episode, but in the next, they re-shot the scene and showed that they actually died (though clearly showed him to buy the farm at last)! Again and again, it seems that in SPY SMASHER is dying, but in the next episode they show it from a different angle and somehow avoided death - even when he fell 1500 meters into the river, he fell into a buzzing saw or anything else. > <br /> Watch this movie not for its quality, but either for a good laugh or for what it was to go to movies on Saturday morning decades ago.
