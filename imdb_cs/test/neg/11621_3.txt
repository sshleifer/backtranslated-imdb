I really enjoyed BG Seasons 1-3 and I really couldn't understand who didn't like it. But I can't defend this nonsense. Spoilers follow. The first problem is that the characters now regularly perform inexplicably stupid things: <br /> <br /> If Starbuck thinks he knows where the Earth is, why not send it in the Raptor? Would the admiral accept the resignation of his third experienced officer? Would he choose Quorum his newest member, the unelected Adam Junior? He has had three weeks of political experience and is the son of a man they do not trust. Would he send Adam Gaet and Halo along with Starbuck and be missed by senior officers? Did Adam want to put the man in sexual contact with the Cylon prisoners in charge of the fleet? <br /> <br /> I'm not buying any of this. Secondly, when I accept it, there were miracles and references to God until the end of Season 3, it's completely upstairs now. I started watching BG because I thought it was Sci Fi, not a biblical epic. I expected that the characters would continue to behave reasonably sensibly, and wanted some satisfactory explanation regarding some of the series' hits. Baltar was the best character on the show, but now he seems completely crazy. Not illogical thinking about what went through, but very unsatisfactory. All characters seem to be just puppets dancing to an unknown third party behavior (some divine entity). It's not a good drama, it's annoying and writing policeman. OK, so what are the good points? Nice battle at the beginning 4.1. Some good dramatic scenes (behave well) when viewed in isolation. Good final scene, nice crystal ball of development. But this is not Sci Fi, it has changed into Fantasy. I can't imagine how the authors could restore it.
