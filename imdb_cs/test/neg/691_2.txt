It was Wrestlemania's worst in history. The only good matches were Ricky Steamboat vs. Hercules Hernandez and the title-title match between British Bulldogs and Dream Team (this bordering on the classic). Everything else was either bad or terrible. The idea of ​​having three host cities was unnecessary, confusing, and confused with the flow of the show. Celebrity guests were terrible to comment on, especially Susan Saint James. <br /> <br /> If you're interested in the mid-1980s WWF, you're better off renting or buying Wrestlemania 3, or just about any other PPV for it mass.
