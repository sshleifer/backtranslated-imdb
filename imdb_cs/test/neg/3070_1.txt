Every movie should have an idea; Simple or more complicated, it needs one ... The problem with Fragata, it's once again that when it decides to make a movie, it tries to do "anything" that it forgets this main detail and as a result the characters do anything without any justification, behaving without justification ... they are simple puppets that follow the film about the taste of the wind. It's boring and sad to see them appear and disappear like cards that are out of the game. Fragata always seems to have a talent in advertising, it's his own job ... and that leads you to see what he did ... but in the end he is always very disappointed. It is not enough to have a movie full of "hot Portuguese stars of the star magazine" ... especially when half of them can't act ... just pretending to be funny. My only good point is actor Helder Mendes ... one of the few stellar stars: He is trying to create some credibility and in such chaotic film without any direction (of any kind) I give him credit for trying. But this film is worth looking at as a manual "how to make a movie" ... and if Fragata's previous work, where bad ... this is a "masterpiece" in achieving the AWFUL title. A few words .. Just look at it! It will be good ... and if you make your family movies at home ... and you always feel bad about your work ... so spend 30 minutes looking at this so-called "professional" job ... things will look like as a powerful Hollywood Flicks compared to Sorte Zero.
