William Petersen (the C.S.I guy) has a small uncredited role, but it's the best part of the movie. His character encounters clever ass and hard, and it's a fun surprise to see him in this. It has a range that allows him to play anything. After its 5 minutes, it goes from the cool point of view not much. He lets you hope his character appears in the movie, but after 20 minutes you give up hope. The film itself is pretty poor. It's worth watching at TMN or picking up at the library, but not much more. Too much of it reminds you of L.A confidential, except that where the film begins to complicate itself, this film is so free it drives everywhere but where it should. 2 out of 5 stars
