I thought I saw something good, but ... I'm tired of seeing this movie, I don't know what I hated most: script, acting, FX or music. Try to imagine the worst episode of the Power Rangers and still be kind. I have seen better FX in FPS games (touch with a sword or his breath that makes people disappear in green smoke is a touch of genius) and the music seems to come from western spaghetti. I liked the way women in the car screamed when a "monster" was passing by the car (though looking bad). So give your break and don't look at this, at least call someone to see a horror movie with you, believe me you're going to have a monopoly on some kicks.
