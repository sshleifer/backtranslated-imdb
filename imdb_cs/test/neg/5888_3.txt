I'm lost. The whole movie doesn't make sense. It was like watching Soderburg for football. Cutting camera, pace, all copies. I thought the topic was too serious for them to treat her like it was. Yes, we all know the south as football and beauty. Do we have to be flooded as spectators? I was looking for Lee and Jay. I waited for young talents in the style of the Society of Dead Poets or similar to the Titans. The film was completely postponed. You didn't get these characters. It was a character driven, but you didn't understand anyone's motivation or activity for the most part. The boy who's mom is obsessed with being a football player. Why is it so quiet? What's his business? Did we really need the scene to "prove" his heterosexuality? Why should we care? The film gave us a look at these kids lives, and offered no pay-off for care. It didn't make sense. And why show a movie about a team they lost? I know it's real life, but who makes movies about losers? Give us something that these guys work as hard as they did with all their "conceivable" problems, darling. We have nothing. At the end of the film, we got a small fluctuation that told us that next year Mojo won with 3rd Uncle (Lee). Why didn't you follow the story? What did we get out of this? The film has led you, but has not led you anywhere. I felt something was missing. It was like a bad genetic cross between Varsity Blues and Remember the Titans. At least those two movies led you somewhere. Friday Night Lights was about a loser who lost his star player in the movie. The actor who played him was great. You were angry with him, which was the reason, but at least you understood why. They made sure you understood him but couldn't play, so why make sure we get his problems? And another team in the playoffs ... are we sure they're high school students? These men looked like college seniors or professional players in their 30s. Who tried the baby? I know the other team was supposed to look intimidating, but it crossed the line a little. I liked the bold element of dealing with the black team, but again how it fit into the overall theme of the film. Nothing together. The characters knew more about each other than we did, and that recedes with me. Jay's characters had absolutely nothing to add, but he was exposed. It was just a mess. Not worth a movie ticket or a rental.
