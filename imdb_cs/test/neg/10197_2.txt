Calling this movie "Sunday School" could be generous because even as a Christian I found a religious message so one-dimensional that I wouldn't want to see it in the church. The message is: "Read your Bible, go to church and sign up for fire insurance so you won't be left behind in ecstasy." No love was. I think when you get to it, I don't believe in the god portrayed in this movie. The one who was to have all the spiritual answers came across as Count Dracula. In addition to the spiritual / religious element, the script was tedious - he said the same thing over and over again. It could have been to replace one of the actors who was unable to deliver a convincing line for the first time, so they just said the same thing over and over again. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the last scenes. I thought it made a point without crossing anyone's head or leaning on a Sunday school formula. The film wasn't quite bad, just most of it. I'm for more pure movies that are well done and that are right in an unpretentious way. It wasn't one of those, sorry to say that. I took my family to this movie, I wanted to support this kind of movie. Now, I'd like to return the money.
