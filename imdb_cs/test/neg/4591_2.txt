I should know better. I saw too much of Rob Lowe's early work to expect something good from this film, even if it's about hockey. Here's another tired sport. A child has the potential for size, it is obvious that going far if his courtesy attitude does not burden things. And the boom is based on being a great player who is great. Is it all that can be said about sports movies? Certainly, there must be other performances that athletes will take. However, this film must be one of the biggest cheeseballs. Each person's interactions are simply downright stupid and not so stupid. And I can't think of any side features that could revive my position. Not actors (certainly not Swayze, who plays Lowe's reluctant mentor), not story, not music, and very few of the skating sequences. Normally, I'm a binge for 80's movies, though they tend to be a little fishy (like North Shore, Karate Kid), but that doesn't mean it's good for 80's. years. . For a good 80s sports movie, look elsewhere. There are plenty.
