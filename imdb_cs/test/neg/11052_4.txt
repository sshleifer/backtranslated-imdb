Fortunately, I didn't see this movie in the movie, on the big screen, just on the small video screen. I doubt being able to go through a movie in the cinema and watch all the violence in the movie. After watching the first 30 minutes, I became both disappointed and curious. Disappointed at the fact that it is hard to follow the story, barely understandable screens, a huge amount of aggression - I still don't know why I was shown that Daesu (the main character) drew another person's raw teeth, his beast on women, he carved his tongue. And also curious to see what the film will say as a conclusion, what is the ultimate summary of this brutality. Unfortunately, although the film was not boring, I did not get any answer to all these atrocities that I had to follow from start to finish. In my opinion, if you want blood and you want to laugh, there is a Kill Bill 1-2, if you want blood with greater importance, you can take some recent war movie, and if you want an east movie, there are much better titles out there. I will then take the Cannes Film Festival more cautiously, because while Oldboy received a lot of praise from the jury, she had little to say and had only 4/10 on my scale. I'm hungry to see something beautiful, harmonious, with real feelings and a clear message.
