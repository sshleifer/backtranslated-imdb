Peter Yates' film by Steve Tesich is a relatively low key "thriller" that cannot actually get out of the country. The story relates to the mysterious murder of an influential Asian businessman and the ensuing consequences of a pathetic Vietnamese veteran (James Woods) who, as the police believe, could avenge his former employer. William Hurt as an "Eyewitness" never believes his friend is able to accomplish such an act. James Woods and Christopher Plummer do a little better in their supporting roles. Noteworthy is the appearance of Morgan Freeman as Detective Black. In the retrospective Steve Tesich's story is just an unlikely romance dressed as a mysterious film. The story is too proficient.
