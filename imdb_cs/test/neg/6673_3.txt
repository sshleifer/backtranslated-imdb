Czech cinema travels through the dark ... this film is a tangible proof. Slama apparently wanted to make an average documentary about the fictitious people characteristic of their stupidity. A young and healthy boy who does not want to work and rather live in a dilapidated shack with a flawless alcoholic aunt. Because of Tonika's stupidity, who is only able to announce "dad, I won't work at the factory" (I'd like to know why); I understand the condition of his "house" but I really can't spend a terrible mess around. Sentiment everywhere. Why did Monika not add her boy abroad? Young Czech couples do it very often. And take someone else's children to live in a ruined barn ... that's too much. Irresponsible mother (poorly bred Geisler), naive and stupid boy (Tonik), stupid and confused girl (Monika) ... Yes, someone already said it - wrongly directed and acted as a soap opera. Actors such as Martin Huba, Bolek Polivka, Tatiana Wilhelmova and Simona Stasov tried, but unfortunately they couldn't save it.
