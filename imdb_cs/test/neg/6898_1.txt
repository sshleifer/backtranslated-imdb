BARNYARD s√°lala! I saw this movie last week and it's horrible. What does the udder have? My 2 years asked me if all the cows are udder and trying to explain to her that it's just not true and that the movie just confused her more! In addition, the violent theme of fear my 2 year old. They gave the coyotes a ferocious look, and it instilled my daughter's fear of coyotes. I know that coyotes are not really wild and are natural predators. Mother and son sitting in front of us, shouting, "Kill him, kill him, yes" in a scene in a movie where there is good vs evil on every word <br /> <br /> It's the left king off and should stop using big name actors for lame movie. Steve Oederek, who also made Thumb movies, such as Thumb Wars, Thumbelina and many more, is so bad! <br /> <br /> If Steve Oederek's good movie always appears in my life, I will move naked and swallow my diarrhea and post it on Youtube.com ... enough!
