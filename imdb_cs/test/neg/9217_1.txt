I went to this movie and I was hoping that an imaginary intervention would appear on the second coming. Boy, I was sometimes wrong. The BBC are dullards to stimulate the film, total idiots in creating tension, fools in building intensity. And this movie is no exception to the rule of how much the BBC sucks. Ugh, the pace and waste of time through the laborious dialogue was just painful to sit. For the first 30 minutes she felt like 2 hours. I kept looking down at my watch and wondering when the senseless, monotonous drive would end. They wasted a good actor in the lead role because the material is so lazy and sloppy, written. All that happens is just to kill time. Of the 155 minutes, only 15 minutes is interesting (controversial ending). What a shame. Reading a summary is more interesting than watching a movie. Sermon, "I am God" endless blah blah bla-ing, stupid as doornails boring miracles ... UGH. <br /> <br /> THIS CRAP IS NOT AVAILABLE.
