*** SPOILER ALERT *** Dissatisfied and confusing arson drama that has to do with a sinister plan to burn a major recreation center before New Year. If he is insured for $ 10 million, a man behind the Valley View Estates in the Blue Mountains of Australia, Julian Fane, Guy Doleman, is determined to bring his own project to the flames to collect. This must happen by 1 January, ie two weeks before the insurance policy contract expires. With his mind totally on his builder and architect Howard Anderson, Tom Skerritt, he has no idea that his boss, Julian Fane, is planning to burn a resort he builds and maybe build him as a bad guy. Anderson gets a bit of a suspicion when insurance investigator Sophie McCann, Wendy Hughes, informs him about some very controversial journeys between Fane and the Proud Alliance. It turns out that Proud Allience is the owner, or 60%, of Fane alone! This explains that Fane Whey has all these arson fires to collect a $ 10 million insurance that is at least twice as much as the entire Valley View Estates cost! Later on, Sophie McCann was murdered in a fake swimming accident to prevent her from seeing what was happening with the suspicious fries around and in Valley View Estates. That is, when Lloyd's from London, who is the underwriting Proud Alliance, insurance investigator George Engles, James Mason, shows that Fane will take the powder leaving his ace arsonist on his own and out of control to blow up all Fane's plan. Meanwhile, Anderson wisely turned to Fane and Engles, who, unlike Fane, want Valley View Estates to get reasons that have never been clear, just watch the last few seconds of the movie to get it realized he is a writer and director. An arsonist is exposed when he is about to do his rescue with Anderson in his girlfriend. Then we have this wild scene with an arsonist lost in the Valley View site just to light it up, with the help of Howard Anderson, where he ends up burning on chips when firefighters came to the hose. Suddenly and inexplicably the end never showed what had happened to the Great Cheese throughout this system of things that ominously and ominously minded Julian Fane. It is as if Fane had disappeared without Scott, and only his unstable and insane supporter, an arsonist who was just a tool of Fane's crimes, ended up as the only person to pay for them.
