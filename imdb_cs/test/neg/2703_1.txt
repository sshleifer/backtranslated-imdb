Spytroops was bad enough as a cartoon. It's only 44 minutes, but several battles will culminate with the destruction of the COBRA headquarters. One downer was the very beginning of the film. An animated battle that was better than the rest of the movie turned out to be some sort of battle simulation. That right there was a big turn-off and made the rest of the movie lack credibility. Then the Shipwreck problem tied up with a parrot appeared and tossed into a room where no one had learned for days. What happened to the cameras? The COBRA base had only a few characters, and the rest were BAT robots. In addition to many corridors, the COBRA base seemed to have no weapons, tanks, trucks, or other equipment. Then there was a stupid idea that 100 complex androids could be created overnight. The story was stupid, though it was intended for small children. Spongebob, Powerpuff Girls, and even Barney Dinosaur give more attention to their conspiracy. The characters were not bad, except that I could never understand anything Destro said, and Cobra Commander was stupid and not much of a villain. In fact, with the exception of Storm Shadow and Xartan, the rest of the COBRA characters were comical and barely impressive. GI Joe's characters were pretty good. Scarlett, Agent Faces, Road Block and Snake Eyes were my favorites. Shipwreck and beach head were the worst. Shipwreck is written as a goofy ball and the beach head sounded like a surfer in the nineties. I think the writer, Larry Hama, tried to make a character that would like teenagers, but he was off the mark for decades. I was just listening to Spicoli Beach Head surfer (Fast Times on Ridgemont High) I wonder if the new GI Joes will smoke a dube before a big mission. CGI was pretty good, except the Cobra commander had a jerky spastic walk and the vehicles didn't look realistic at all. The flying tank and the explosions were not very impressive. Old animation would be much better. Since Hasbro likes to make things cheap, they got what they paid for. I had trouble watching the whole thing, it was just boring and lacking the soul or spirit of GI Joe. Even old GI Joe ads would be better. In fact, the DVD included accessories such as four or five current commercials for GI Joe Spy troops, and those commercials were much more fun than the movie. Ads had more fun and a child-oriented spirit. The ads were alive while the movie was boring.
