Several scenes that actually attempt to portray a revolutionary struggle resemble a furry scout scout who hesitates between the openings. When Sharif, or, God, Palance tries his hand on the fiery oratorio, it sounds like Kurtz swallows a mistake. Examples of strategic brilliance include a map of Cuba filled with smiling fish in the ocean and a positively Vaudeville hypothesis about how Bay of Pigs came. What does that allow us to do? One scene of comic dentistry; an abundance of Hollywood peasants who approach the camera as if it were a moving train; and, just for kicks, passel homoeroticism, which is not limited to Castro's manic and constant cigarette-fellatio. Never trust Medved, but even busted hours are right twice a day: this is a HISTORIC horrible movie.
