At Sweet Water, ambitious businessman Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) builds a resort in the middle of the desert under Katonahs protest. When three workers find some Indian relics and bones in the ditch in place, they accidentally release a giant skeleton as a creature known as Bone Eater, and their bones are swallowed by a monster. Half Breed Sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) a.k.a. Running Wolf is in charge of investigating the disappearance of the workers Krantz has arrested to arrest the protesters. But the Bone Eater is attacking and killing other locals, while Chief Storm Cloud (Michael Horse) is looking for an ancient Tomahawk capable of destroying the evil creature. "Bone Eater" is a lame and stupid movie, with one of the most ridiculous scenarios I've ever seen. Characters and situations are not well developed and things happen without any further consequences. The conclusion is probably the worst part of this film, with the typical white North American Bruce Boxleitner dressed as an Indian (in the story, his grandfather was an Indian), cutting his own wrist (why? And where is blood later?) And clumsily throwing an ax into the bone of a fir-tree, destroying monster and my last hope for improvement in the story. My last question: if she eats bones with her bone, what happens to her victim's body and clothing? My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "O Devorador de Ossos" ("The Bone Eater")
