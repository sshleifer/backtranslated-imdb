If you have enough time to kill and DVD gave you your boyfriend for free, but it may still require a lot of courage to watch this movie that doesn't have a good script or humor for the matter. At the acting front imran is frozen in time / acting, Tushar Kapoor was slightly better than Imran in this movie Paresh Rawal was good at comedy was usual. The story revolves around the university campus, where Imran's bad boy n Tushar is good, pretending to be the opposite of the nature, and the story goes on ..... <br /> <br /> Watch it only if you have nothing to do and the movie runs on local cable TV.
