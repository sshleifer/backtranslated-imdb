Last night I saw an early preview of the screener Prozac nation. Because I love everything I was very excited about by Christina Ricci, but as the film went on, I started to wonder where she was going. Based on a true story, it's just about the character of Christina Ricci and her struggle with depression, drugs, friends and family, as you might read from the title. In my opinion, this movie was moving too fast and it was too dramatic. I would say that every five minutes there was a dramatic moment, and the film was moving very fast in her life, and that did not lose space for us to connect with Christina Ricci. The performance of Christina Ricci was fantastic as ever, but Jessica Lange performed throughout the film and I believe that the success of this film will be thanks to her and Christina Ricci. I'd like this 4 out of 10 and I'd suggest you to rent this or read Elizabeth Wurtzel's books are good and definitely worth checking out.
