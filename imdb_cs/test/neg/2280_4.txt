This is the first recorded effort to give sound to film and the oldest, which is of course still in existence. This historical film is the opening work on the DVD "Other Treasures of the Natural Archive". It's just a 15-second clip of a man playing a violin in front of a huge recording cylinder. Two men dance beside him. There's another man in the end. William Dickson, director of this experiment, is a violin player. This "movie" had several titles over the years, but the sound experiment wasn't really a success. It took more than 30 years from this moment to synchronize sight and sound to the point where something could be released to the public for entertainment. However, it was the beginning, no matter how primitive it came out. <br /> <br /> For more technical information and a history of this film process, read another review here "Bob Fett1138".
