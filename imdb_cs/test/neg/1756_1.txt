Two leaders, the English and Aussie filming the story of the American Civil War in Romania, have no spark between them, they are absolutely incredible as lovers and completely unsympathetic. There is no story, no characterization, virtually nothing that could keep the eyelids apart during this endless holiday. Renee Zelwegger, also hopelessly mistaken, practically chews the fence posts, but at least observes her embarrassment herself. Nicole Kidman is too old for this role and has no idea what's going on. Jude Law's moron role could be played equally well by any of the Romanian extras. The only requirement is to wander around the forest and look silly while watching the show of guest stars. Not that it mattered because all the roles of the guest were totally useless because they did not advance the so-called conspiracy of one iota. And as if it wasn't enough, the authors felt it necessary to throw some spinning, swirling, kung fu jumping out of the horses. What was it about?
