One day, the creators of this film had to sit down and say, "Let's make fun of the Russians and show people how advanced they are (Americans)". The film depicts Russians as inferior people who are unable to understand the great ideas put forward by the Americans. It is true that US campaigns are likely to be more professional and more cost-intensive than campaigns in other countries. However, this film goes far and exaggerates the differences between East and West. For me it looked like a propaganda film made during the Cold War.
