I had great hopes when I went to the theater - when I saw a trailer that I was so excited as another person who sees great talent, she is involved in creating a story with a beautiful premise. However, it is disappointing to see that this talent is hampered by the poor composition of the songs - the words are rugged and cheesy, probably because it consisted of a more western theme. It would not be difficult to imagine the same melodies with French or English lyrics. It just sounds weird in Mandarin. The musical items were also badly cut off - too fast to be enjoyable, and the footage of the actors looking for anxiety took too long. <br /> <br /> Special effects are another disappointment. Suffice it to say that it is very clear where special effects start and stop. It's not a Moulin Rouge, and it's not in the mood, despite the occasional (and very similar) slow waltz. . Overall, and the hour too long to tell a simple story.
