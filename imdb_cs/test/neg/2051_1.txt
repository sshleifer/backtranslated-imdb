Bled begins as a young artist, Sai (Sarah Ferooqui) meets a mysterious but charming man named Renfield (Jonathan Oldham) & ends up in his studio where he gives her a bark of a tree that is used as a hallucinogenic fusion drug. Sai quickly hooks up when he gets into an alternative fantasy reality that includes the Vampire creature. Sai's friend Royce (Chris Ivan Cevic) is worried about her when she moves away from reality when she becomes addicted to drugs, Royce can kick a drug or destroy her life, and why mysterious Renfield left her addicted to things first and do complicated fantasy dream as trips have any meaning? Co-produced and directed by Christopher Hutson this anemic arty vampire flick is nearly 95 minutes tedium & is largely worthy of all bad comments. Sxv'leithan Essex has written an interestingly named script (how the hell do you even say that?) Who is also credited as a production designer and his unusual name is more interesting than anything that happens in Bled, I guess the creators decided to create a very serious horror movie with a fantasy with a strong moral message about the dangers of drugs, drug addiction, and drug rape at its core. Most of the film is devoted to the drug problem of Sai by introducing drugs, how great she was for the first time, and how she became hopelessly addicted to eventually destroying her, her life and her friends living. It never explains where this medicine is getting, because Renfield gives her just a little during her first meeting, but hey, who cares? Bled's first twenty odd minutes are really boring and boring, the next hour or so is not much better than the last ten minutes of confusion that include Vampiric monster & Renfield, which reappears. Moral elements are sponsorship, elements of fantasy look like an idea, and horror does not exist. There is also a dialogue that is horrible, every sentence trying to be profound, having a lot of hidden depths & just trying to have so much sense that it becomes tedious to listen. <br /> <br /> The concept of the movie is terrible and so is the performance because there is absolutely no gore or violence to talk about & the whole thing is set inside the apartment, which doesn't seem to be any lights. The fantasy setting looks a little better, but it is sparsely visible and underused. There are no dread, here the atmosphere and do things even worse creators have decided to use muted very faded colors, which I just hate and find uncomfortable, what is wrong with nice color image? It seems to me that this is a fad for contemporary filmmakers who seem to think that the film automatically cools or adds an atmosphere that certainly does not mean more often than your film, which looks like dull Bled. Probably had a low budget and was shot in Los Angeles and has reasonable production values, but it's all so boring. Playing did not impress me, I was not even interested in anyone who is never a good sign. parallels with real life dug dependencies and what it can do for little or no effect, because the whole thing is so boring. There might be an audience for a movie like this, but considering other comments not so great one.
