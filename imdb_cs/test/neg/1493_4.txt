I was very disappointed with this series. She had a lot of cool graphics and that's about it. The level of detail was minimal and I always felt that the audience was sponsored - it was a lot of what seemed like "This is very cool, but we won't explain it in more detail. The host would drop interesting sounding words like "sparticles" and "super-symmetry" without any attempt to explain what it was. We had to look for it on Wikipedia. Besides, I know I know quite a few about superstrings (for the layman), and I have found that their explanations were intricate and could have been much better. They could have chosen much better examples to explain concepts, but instead the examples they used were confusing and further obscured the subject. In addition, I was so bad of repetition. They could easily have a condensed series into one episode if they cut out all the reps. They had to show the Quantum Café clips about 8 times. The host kept repeating the same things over and over again. I can't remember how many times he said, "The universe is made of small vibrating strings." It is as if they were trying to wash their brains out just to accept "superstrings are the best of sliced ​​bread." Finally, the show ended with an unpleasant sense of "competition" between Fermilab and CERN, clearly heading for Fermilab. It's supposed to be a quantum physics education program, not whether the US is better than Europe or vice versa! I also felt that it was part of the sponsorship - "The audience needs to see some conflict to keep it interested." Please. Give me a little more credit than that. <br /> <br /> 2 inch down :-(
