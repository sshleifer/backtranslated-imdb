as I'm sure other people have said that this person is not a very valuable subject. our society has a morbid fascination with death and it's funny to hear him talk about how much he smokes and how much coffee he drinks, but he gives himself a staunch mystic. After all, he's a moronist who uses weak methods to try to disprove the mountain of Holocaust evidence and should therefore be forgotten over time. but Morris is in love with some kind of curiosity I wouldn't normally cause him.
