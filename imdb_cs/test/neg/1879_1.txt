Cronica de un desayuno combines the worst defects of Mexican cinema, which is a rare achievement today. It is pretentious: it wants us to believe that it is deep, just because some scene is in focus, the other is pseudo-surrealistic, other games with the tradition of laughing-crying faces , the edition is fragmented and it's so serious. It has a weak script: the main story is barely developing, so it has three smaller, useless stories. They're just good for the movie to last longer. <br /> <br /> Most games are bad. Real performance, considering that many of Mexico's most famous actors were busy. There is abuse of an unnecessary foul language. To the extent that the character of Paloma, which symbolizes dreams of child freedom, uses it in principle. It's homophobic. The character played by Eduardo Palomo is the worst and most punished, representation of the transexual I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's very boring. I ended up envious people who left the theater before the end of the film. Whatever it is, it was better in Mexico and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> In other words: "Para partirte la madre, nada como una mala pel√≠cula"
