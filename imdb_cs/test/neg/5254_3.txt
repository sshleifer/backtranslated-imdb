We screened this film at the club as an example of how classical literature can become twisted into the worst films of all time. The fact that the back of the box proudly declared the action to be set in the future "techno-futile" should be enough to hint. I think this word describes the film itself, because no matter how much technology they tried to save the film, the effort was totally useless. Not to mention that our club advisor told us that he was reportedly unable to get a distributor for two years. Beowulf's character changes in a way that is by no means trustworthy in the middle, and whenever he is in the action scene, he changes constantly as a hyper gymnast. Even as they say, it's a "token" whose humor attempts are absolutely in place. And, of course, the daughter of Grendel base leader is terrorizing, he's a total vixen. A fox whose breasts are exposed throughout the film. A fox who wants to fight this creature, but never drags on armor. And her gun is a small carving knife. And despite their desperate situation, she still dresses for dinner, in a dress with a transparent skirt that reveals shorts underwear. There are a few scenes that might pass like a soft core of pornography, and in the second scene they even use shots from the first. I thought the Grendel display was bad enough, but then came the end of the movie, which featured a CGI display that could be decent for the 80s, but is absolutely ridiculous for the late 90s. I could go on, but you should all watch this movie for the full laugh effect yourself. Other club members and I managed to have fun watching it by choosing MST 3K and mocking all the way. I was still recovering from the extra gun: a constantly rolling pizza on the pole.
