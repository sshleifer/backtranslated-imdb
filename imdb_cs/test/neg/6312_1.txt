This movie has some of the worst games I've ever seen. The performance of Dennis Quaid was college. While it is difficult to display a character that is off the wall, like Jerry Lee Lewis, it can be done. Just ask Jamie Foxx (though Ray Charles had a greater depth of personality and musicianship than Lewis had ever dreamed of. The Phillips brothers were part of The Dukes of Hazzard and Alec Baldwin playing Jimmy Swaggart is a bit like Donald Duck playing Shakespeare. Robert Duvall played a preacher of the country, I bought it, Baldwin never trusted me with a single word, and the part of Wynon Ryder was the best and averaged (and can anyone figure out 13 when Lewis met her and 13 more than a year later?) Some internet checks have revealed that the basic facts put forward by the film are true, at least not more polluted than most Hollywood bio photos.
