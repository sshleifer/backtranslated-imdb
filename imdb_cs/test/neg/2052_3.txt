Are you kidding? Just like watching an episode of Neighbors After Drinking Two Bottles of Cough Medicine - Scary and Not Making Sense. I waited for the smart part where everything fits and saves the film. Maybe it was there and I just missed it or got lost. My strongest suspicion is that it's a thin, cloaked attempt to launch a new drug on the market that is about to hit the streets. I wouldn't say it "don't look at it", but I'll say its pretty poor at every level - like I'm a high def dram. Wound. If you do not drink two bottles of cough syrup. Then it's just dandy.
