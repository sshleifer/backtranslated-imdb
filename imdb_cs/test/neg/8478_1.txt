- So a weak apology for a story in general waste of time involves a guy who wants to be an animator but can't get into a career in the country. His super hot woman is more successful and does not seem to care for being defeated, but man is not satisfied with it and wants to make more of his life. One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life. Unfortunately, for him, Loki god is looking for his magic mask and as soon as he finds a man with a mask, he tries to get him back and that's the whole story. If it sounded exciting, then someone must throw you to wake you up. <br /> <br /> -This movie is terrible. There is no other way to say it and I just can't stretch it. The only good thing about the whole thing was a woman who played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot, but unlike her, there's nothing about this movie that is worth watching. I know it's intended for children and that's why it's so stupid, but what about adults who have to take their children to watch this waste. Why we have to suffer through this nasty bag of creepy crap. The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great storytelling. This one is a humble attempt by the hacking filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and, judging by the laughter of BO gross, I guess the franchise will no longer go on. <br /> <br /> - The camera must be defeated because the sweet colors of the film will make you feel sick. If there was music, I didn't pay attention to her because I had already pierced the eardrums to prevent me from hearing the horrible dialogue. Then there's playing, or at least what's going through today. you could look at the infomercial and see much better playing than the one in this movie, but I can't really blame the actor because he's a director who deserves the blame for not having obviously realized that the actors need to make another king. take. If a new line is trying to launch a franchise with this then you need to make their game by hiring writers who can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch all the crap that comes out <br /> <br /> - Bottom line, if you're sadomasochistic and you like torturing yourself, then please by all means, take a look at it because it's painful to watch, but if you're not and really want to watch movies that are good then avoid them at all costs
