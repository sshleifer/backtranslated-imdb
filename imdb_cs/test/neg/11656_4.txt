This was included on the disc "Shorts: Volume 2" - a rather boring collection of short films. Shorts are my favorite movie styles, but people who compose this second collection have had a hard time finding good content - and it wasn't as good as the first volume or other shorts collection. This short movie looks woefully incomplete. There is a story, but so much in the unanswered that the viewer, like me, feels a little omitted and unfulfilled. The film begins with a woman, her boyfriend and her Westie (that's the dog, by the way) going to a lonely beach. The lady speaks with an accent, which is sometimes a little hard to follow. Since I am deaf, I would definitely like it to be closed captions. Anyway, a friend goes to swim while she sleeps. When she wakes up, her dog is gone. Panic and makes a guy who watches her all he is looking for a dog. He spends most of his time arguing and inconvenience. Then, from blue, they stop having sex. Later they find the dog - the end of the story. As for the characters, both seemed to be dysfunctional and incomprehensible. She was a cuddly and demanding lady, and she seemed to despise her. When you were wondering why they were together, their little sex break showed what kept their bond together. Some would like to characterize. could meet or know. Also, the reward for it all just isn't worth waiting for (unless you see a guy naked).
