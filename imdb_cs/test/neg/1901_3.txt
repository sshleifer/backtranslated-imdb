I'm sorry it was a pitiful excuse for the movie. The storyline so tight that it resembled a block of Swiss cheeses and ass figures that seemed totally free of interpersonal relationships. Lee-Miller, whom I could swear, should have been in love. Unlike Tyler and Miller, who, for the most part, as well as the rest of the film, were totally unconvincing. ... what was everyone thinking ...? they should definitely wrap up at the beginning of this.
