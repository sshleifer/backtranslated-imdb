I couldn't wait for the end. That's the worst movie I've ever seen. If you thought that only someone could be a traceable movie, these people prove that a minimum set of skills is required. It is a film without any elements. It reaches zero in each department. This is more than just "amateur" because viewers have no consideration or consideration at all. There is no serious attempt to act or entertain. The plot is aimless, meaningless and absurd. The cast looks very uncomfortable and completely devoid of direction. The technical aspects of the film are bad. As a DVD, it's a good drink track.
