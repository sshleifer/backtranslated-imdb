I put these two stars out of 10. I went to not realize what it was - and found it to be some sort of African musical - because people would break into the song every few minutes . None of the songs will be done, most of them don't really say anything wise, and they all have the same nonexistent melody - if you could call it "melody". Karmen is a tall, magnificently built young woman with the longest braids I've ever seen. [The actress seems to have probably done some modeling.] <br /> <br /> The film opens in a women's prison, though not like any prison I have ever seen or heard - prisoners wear anything - and it seems he's having a party. Karmen is doing some frantic dances, and a woman prison guard, Angelique, is a pretty erotic girl. He and Karmen are dancing. Later, Karmen visits the supervisor's room and loves - unfortunately, the scene is not detailed and very short, although there is some nudity. Karmen then escapes from prison and then we see her dance In front of another group, where a man named Lamine, perhaps a colonel - it has never been clear who he is, watching her. She's with a young woman who doesn't like Karmen's seductive dance and is dancing-off between the two women. Then the story [as it is] becomes even more confused. With Lamine in jail, out of jail, and who knows where. Karmen can be involved with a group of smugglers or thieves. <br /> <br /> It's more singing. Angelique's next dance and scene apparently suffers from a heartbreak. <br /> <br /> The film fogs the way to the goal and I sighed with relief that it was over. <br /> <br /> <br />
