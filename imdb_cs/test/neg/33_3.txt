Sorry, Jacqueline Hyde (to get it - Jack L and Hyde - Jekyll & Hyde) has some of the worst performers on this side of hardcore porn, not to mention the script that apparently wrote a first-class with undiagnosed learning disorders. Jackie Hyde inherits an old mansion from his grandfather, which she never knew she had. Guess who? Yes, the inventor of a special formula that slowly takes over body and mind - yes, Mr. Hyde! Despite some pretty skin scenes, this film doesn't record any other feeling or emotion than uncontrollable laughter. Just like poor Jackie is trying to stay away from a special recipe for a granddaughter and the result is an hour and a half wasted time.
