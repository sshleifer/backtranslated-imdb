A group of seven people are afraid that they are the only ones who have survived near the world that ends in a bomb explosion. Not only do they fear radiation, but also mutants in the surrounding slope. One of the groups is already contaminated, but strangely there is no threat to others. It is precisely the survival of the friction of various personalities in the near range that is a partial plot. Richard Denning plays the hero. Mike Connors is near the edge of a tough guy playing. Lori Nelson is a girl who is about to start a brave new world. He is not the best of director Roger Corman. This is a predictable black and white science fiction.
