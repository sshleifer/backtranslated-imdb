The perfect double bill for the terribly sinister "Beverly Hillbillies" is just as cruel, lame "comedy", "Son in law". Country Girl Rebecca goes to wild California to attend college just to be attacked by lifestyle. "Resident Adviser" "Crawl" helps her settle down, and soon two are good friends. Bec decides to bring the crazy "Crawl" home for Thanksgiving, with obvious "fish from water" results. The only other comical angle Steve Rash (aptly named) reaches here is sexual. This will bring us down, but to no avail. Both comic aspects fail dismally, and you know the movie is fumbling when "Crawl" kidnaps a harvester and writes its name in a cornfield. The film also lags dramatically, with several family attempts and personal advice from "skipping". Among them, Paula Shore and Carla Gugino managed to wake up a few smiles, but little else, while the rest of the cast is just food. The problem is that it's almost impossible to actually be like "Crawl", and you'll find yourself spending the whole movie thinking about why Rebecca would like to spend some time with him. However, if you are a fan of unintelligent comedy, "Son in Law" is right on the mark. Sunday, November 10, 1996 - T.V.
