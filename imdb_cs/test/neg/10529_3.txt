I really tried to love this movie about a doctor who has a new life with a young woman if she can cope with the death of her wife. I suppose it was to play like an unpredictable light romantic comedy, but the topic is a little uncomfortable for me. But when I took it aside, I found out that dialogue is too much like a scenic game, although it is based on a novel and also the average performance was embarrassing to look especially at the young leader Vincent Span. I've been trying to catch up on all the 80's movies I've missed this decade. It was my pet that the nostalgic enthusiasts of the 1980s focus on the same basic canon of films that are usually featured by the actors and actresses of the brother and neglect other films like the Creator who fell through cracks. But in the case of this function, I must say that I understand it. Not all of these eighties were magical, and the Creator is proof of that.
