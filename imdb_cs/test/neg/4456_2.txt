Of all the adaptations of Alistair MacLean's books, I think this is considered the worst, but not the MacLean! Everything that this film shares with the novel seems to be the same name. We have no tension, no sense of foreboding, no chance to really empathize with the main characters. We spend the whole time (or at least I did) waiting for Charlotte Rampling to throw her clothes off (for Charlotte it looks like it takes a remarkably long time!). But a glimpse of Charlotte Rampling's breasts cannot really save this disastrous film. MacLean was kicked back into the trough to endure the bombardment of those bitter hacks and drug addicts who would probably blame him for all the illnesses he'd tried to shoot his books. Poor old Alistair had to throw himself into the corner and whimper when this one came out. At least "Bear Island" - which also uses the name Maclean, but apparently none of his novel - was LITTLE exciting. Excitement awaits final credits.
