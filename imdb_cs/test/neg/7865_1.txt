* The ELITE sniper team that put in 24h or so earlier, instead of digging in and making it invisible to them, decided to take the cap for one of the first scenes for a big rock. When the hero "runs" to save his wife he actually runs. * When inside a building and aiming for a goal only about 20-30 meters from the hero USES ITS RANGE. Aside from the fact that most non-elite soldiers would fire from the hip and still hit, there is also the fact that the range could not concentrate so close. * There is a satellite that can actually look horizontal to buildings. <br /> <br /> The list is endless ... and the movie is the biggest heap of crap I've ever put into my DVD player.
