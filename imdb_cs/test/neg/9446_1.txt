I've never commented on the movie, but I have to say it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I feel that this has made the film student a beginner and has not awarded talented film students, but that was horrible! I didn't buy a leading actress, and I felt like I played with her in a movie class. Her decisions were very safe and I feel she was imitating other actresses in movies and not making and making her own decisions. The direction was very confusing and the sound was louder than the actors themselves. The end can make a little more sense if someone told events and not a song. I like Patsy Cline, but her songs appear quite often in movies. Maybe the selection of songs could have been a little more original. The song "insane" was such a clich√©. As I said before, I have never commented on movies and I have seen my share of good and bad, but this was the worst. Excuse me.
