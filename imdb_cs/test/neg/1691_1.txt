Classical author C.S. Lewis once wrote an essay that no children's story is worth reading, browsing, etc. If only children can enjoy it. I would say this movie is easy to keep as a defense of its argument. At the age of five or six, I loved him, watched him only three or four years later and found himself wet, poorly animated, dim and dull, and with desperate repetition songs (i am looking for you, hi-cockalorum) showing production focused on joyful stupidity and whim but with ugly, twee, frustrating mess. In any case, show it to your child, but I highly recommend that you not buy a copy or try to sit on it. If you want to set up something at the same time, but with real charm and wit, go for 'Oliver Twist' or the brilliant BBC adaptation 'The Box of Delights'.
