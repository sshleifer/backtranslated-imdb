I found code 46 very disappointing. I thought the concept was good and therefore had great potential as a movie, but he found it didn't deliver. Code 46 lacked the idea and structure, and the story did not go well. I thought Tim Robbins character was not well developed, for example. I thought there should be more information and thoughts in his family life, and not having completely ignored how I felt it was. When they were first against Code 46, it was suggested not to know that they could be genetically linked, but all the technology was available to them, took her fingerprint and thus the genetic details when investigating the fraud. I was always waiting for something to happen and the story would evolve, and never did it. I felt that the film had a great potential to be intellectually encouraging, but it turned out to be the opposite. Code 46 tried to be too clever, and at the end he just ended up without imagination. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, the only good thing about the movie was that it was relatively short.
