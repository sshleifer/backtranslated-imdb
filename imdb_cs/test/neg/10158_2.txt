This is a doozy. Coming from 1949, the Crime Scene often plays more like the Coen Bros. movie, which takes place in the 1940s and is filmed in black and white, except that the author's ear for pastiche is not so well-tuned - maybe it may be seen instead as the forerunner of the Oscar-lure schlock as Road to Perdition. Frankly, it is surprising that this film is not regarded as a classic of film professors and critics everywhere, considering how much it offers in the sense of too articulated mannerist excitement covered by false meaning (similar to the grandson of all such "false" films), Citizen Kane, or whatever Murnau.) <br /> <br /> MGM is usually a studio that can't do anything wrong with my eyes, and I think any story, atmosphere, even "brave realism" can have benefit only from grotesque overesthetization. You could say I'm a Minnelli school pupil. But it requires a slight touch to write a polite dialogue with Dashiell Hammett, perhaps letting one or two scenes go through a line like "Watch out, Mr. Wiggly, or you'll have thirteen fish fry and no little worm to catch them. "I did most of it -" Mr. Wiggly, "unfortunately, made a cut - but believe me that dialogue is just that loonely inflated and riddled with non sequiturs. Even the cop's wife, played by Arlene Dahl, speaks as if she has moon scar under one eye and Rocco's Christian name When Van Johnson turns in his line badge: "I'm sick of death and murder," you'll wonder how a writer's fixation with ornate literary means could be this case zeugma - whenever it was misunderstood as "street". <br /> <br /> For those who have outgrown the Naked Gun series, this is the funniest movie of cops-n-robbers.
