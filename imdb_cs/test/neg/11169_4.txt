At present, Asian horror films are among the best in the world, characterized by the atmosphere and reflection of contemporary society. This isn't one of those movies! Instead, "record" is the average slasher film of a highly derivative of American films like "I know what you did last summer" and "shout". The story is known - 5 teenagers commit a terrible crime by mistake, but cover it with an oath of secrecy. A year later, they are watched by a maniac who controls a knife (with a totally uninteresting disguise of the hospital's sterile mask and orange overalls). It doesn't help teenagers to be a generally relentless group (that's one of those movies where the killer's motives seem quite reasonable) and there are a number of stupid installations to keep the story going. The film's direction is rude, more influenced by MTV than current Asian horror movies (like "The Ring"). However, the last third of the film is not too bad, but it brings some pretty thrilling scenes, though there are probably too many "twists" in the end. 4/10
