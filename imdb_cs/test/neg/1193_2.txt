I'm a huge LoG fan. I thought the first two series, assuming some of the country's best comedies had ever seen, and the third series, though different, was beautifully dark and imaginative. The idea of ​​seeing Tubbs, Edward and Brissa on the big screen did something to wait on July 3rd. But somewhere it was all very bad. The writers had no story or real thoughts. The part in old England showed glimpses of genius we know the league was capable of, but these scenes didn't fit the film. Geoff provided the best of too little, much of the bad jokes, and the performances of Lipp and Brissa were big falls. If you love the League, you'll save time and money and watch episodes from the TV series again. And again. Massive disappointment.
