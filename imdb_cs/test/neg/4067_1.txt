My suggestion ... This movie was really meant to be a "comedy", right? If not, producers, directors, actors and "hairdressers" should choose a different career! Instructions for my submission require at least 10 lines. How can I add more in this world? Hmm ... Look. Oh yes, the beginning of the movie was pretty hilarious with the "crash landing" scene. It is a pity that the plane did not hit the tanker and the "martians" bunch out of the rubble (apparently hiding) and decided to take over the "planet of the world" and make a better film. That would be a great start! <br /> <br /> T
