This is definitely one of the weaker ones in the Carry On series. This lacks the usual fun and sparkle and even casting seems to be embarrassed by the bad dialogue. By the time it came out, the series was in terminal drop and the boy's show! If you come to this series freshly, avoid this until the end.
