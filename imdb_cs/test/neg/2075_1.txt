Promoting this film everywhere in Spain with a great promotional campaign, once you see it, you realize that someone has stolen your money. Paz Vega is horrible like Carmen, he's not natural at all, and looks like he's making a fashion magazine cover in all shots ("best" is when she as an Andalusian woman ... can speak Basque and fluently, Leonardo Sbaraglia is much better than her but the story is very slow, the plot doesn't work and the script is really very bad ... I think Penelope Cruz (the movie was written for her) would be much more credible and sexy Carmen. <br /> <br /> What is a waste of time and money
