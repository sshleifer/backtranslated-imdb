I just watched this movie just because Sarah & I also give these 4 stars just because of it, on the other hand This movie was easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Theacting was terrible. The script was uninspired. That was a movie he contradicted himself. The film was sloppy and unoriginal. it's not like I expect a good movie. Just something that gives me a jump or two. It didn't even do it. The worst thing is that the more I think about the overall plot, the less senses it actually does and the more holes we have. Real shame really, as I'm pretty sure there was a good idea lurking there somewhere ... <br /> <br /> I'm maybe a little rough giving a 4/10 movie, but due to the actors involved and again SARA's obvious talent writing , this movie should actually bring much more. <br /> <br /> This movie is just stupid, I can't give it another way. From the very beginning, one knows it will be stupid. Story, dialogue, gaming, special effects, makeup, pretty much everything. I like vampire movies and I know they will never be Oscar movies, but this is not even visible, I can't believe how someone made it. It's not even about vampires, it's more about dream / reality. The film's development is incoherent, the character's motivation is ... It doesn't exist, everything looks like a big joke. Maybe they wanted to do it, but I honestly doubt it. I wish I knew what they were trying to pull out, but it just failed, it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life (and I've seen many bad movies but nothing compared to this) Please do do yourself a favor and DO NOT USE THIS. PS It's also full of clich√©s! P.S. 2 Bad script, bad direction, bad cinematography. P.S. 3 I bothered to comment on it as a kindness to everyone.
