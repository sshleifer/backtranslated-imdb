When I think Bollywood. I think of lite feeling good musical dance numbers, with wonderful clothes for men and women. And catchy melodies. Horror, Thrillers, Mystery and Suspense, though they won't. And this, for my western eyes, is like an abstract comedy. I think it would be a better film, shorter if the writer and the director were sure to choose. Whether it's for Thriller-Horror, Comedy-Mystery, Supernatural-Suspense or Musical-Romance. I'll have to say more than once when I thought the director had to see "I know what you did last summer" and try to do it with Bollywood Twist. My first film was bride and prejudice. What I thought he was doing well. It seemed that what the Western audience would consider a straight film festival. Acting was at the top, sometimes it seemed to be deliberately trying to parody Western thrillers, but when you saw them, they tried to inject dramatic crying, screaming or fear, that was in place. The spectator was wondering when one of the actors winks at the camera. More than a few times, when viewers were to be horrified, we could just be absurd. I'm watching a lot of foreign movies, and although I don't know Hindi, I have to say they did a bad job with the movie's headlines. Sometimes it was hard to read the white lettering on a light background. The thief was particularly entertaining, at least for me, because he came up with his own moody music. Supposedly a surprising twist, actually felt like a cop. <br /> <br /> The leading couples were nice / pretty nice and the music numbers it was worth paying for the rental. I'd suggest it to somebody as a musical-comedy, but I'd tell them to advance to the rest of the film because it's not worth reading. If you're determined to read the entire Hindi movie subtitle, then check out the outstanding romantic Drama 'Namasteay, London'. But I wasn't afraid .. no matter what she thought was scary in India. 1 out of 10 for what is offered as. 6 out of 10 it's unintentional speed and the ability not to let a lot of laughter, and it's music / dance numbers. Enjoy :)
