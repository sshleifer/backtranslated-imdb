I've always found Man Ray Ray's dilettante and his artistic efforts to be deeply conceited, and I never understood why his work attracted so much attention. In addition to his Rayographs (which he invented by accident, and which are only direct-contact photographic prints), his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a way that was adopted as art rather than porn . But it must have happened in the end, and there is no real reason Ray deserves credit. The critical response to Man Ray reminds me of the story of the Emperor's new outfit. "L'Ã‰toile de merde" ... shouting, "de mer" ... has a lot of blurry photos and a repeating visual starfish theme that is never explained. Starfishes have a fascinating ability to regenerate lost limbs - and even regenerate entire duplicate bodies - but if it has to do with the theme of this movie, Ray doesn't care. I was much more impressed with the title cards of this film, which (in French) can include rhymes, pun ('Si belle, Cybele') and some portraits. So often in Ray's work, this film is a really beautiful young woman. Unfortunately, the photo is (for the most part) so blurry that we can't appreciate it. One point out of 10 I evaluate this mess.
