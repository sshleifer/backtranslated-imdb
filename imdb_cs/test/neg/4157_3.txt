I like the fact that I can appreciate a movie that is a bit unusual and I definitely love a good movie that makes me think. <br /> <br /> If you like ordinary movies that make you think, then look elsewhere. This movie is so bad and so disjointed that the only thing you will think about after the end is how you might have watched the 90 minutes of your life unnecessarily. A movie of this kind needs a driver to buy from the viewer. Why are we interested in the main characters? What motivates these characters by their existence? Why are they making decisions that they make? This film is a very weak attempt to implement and fail in this process. There is no chemistry between the two actors, both of whom are excellent in their ability to be comfortable in every role. So why did they fail here? I very much believe they didn't know what their motivations were, and when an actor doesn't know, their audience can't follow. In summary, I saw macromedia flash videos that offered more in the way of provoking thoughts, at least I'm more interested in a morphed hamster who likes the moon than why this married man would risk everything for being Code Violation 46.
