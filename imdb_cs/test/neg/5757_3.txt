Director and FX Man John Carl Buechler doesn't have to do much to scare me; looking at his name in the credits themselves is enough to get fear into my heart. His lamentation at the bottom of the 1980s was at the bottom of the horror section at my local rent. shop; twenty years later, and his DVD take up the same space. It seems that the more things change, the more they stay the same. You can count on the old JCB to serve dreck, regardless of format and regardless of advances in film making. In this despicable offer, a lot of friends travel to a distant city where they discover a secret treasure pile of Jeremiah Stone, AKA forty-nine years of evil, claim-jumping, a cannibalist miner who caused confusion in the mid 1800s. Before his death, Jeremiah cursed anyone who should find his gold, and it is not long before the killer who controls the pick-ax returns and bounces the unfortunate treasure hunters. effects and Scooby-Doo style villain, 'Curse of Forties' is a par for the course for Buechler. Only the genre stalwarts Keren Black, Richard Lynch and John Phillip Law lend this film any credibility at all, with the rest of the cast giving performances ranging from bad to terrible (though I forgive Alexandra Ford, who is a complete hottie). Even fans of bad schlock horror will be disappointed because most women wear clothes and lots of deaths take place off-screen (which is not so bad a thing from death on screen are poor). 'The Curse of Forty Niner' is another in the long list of duds for John Carl.
