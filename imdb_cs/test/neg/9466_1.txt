My friends and I have watched it so many times that I lost count. It is worth seeing for those who are in the true spirit, which means that it is not as good a horror film as it should fit for its funny quotes and bad effects. This movie is best viewed with other, like-minded individuals, so you have someone to laugh with. left on back. "Greg, stop clowning!" Dr. Brandon scolds. You'll laugh like J.G. Patterson hands his hand to direct Greg to the other side of the operating table while his hand is in focus. And you'll probably laugh when you realize that the last woman doesn't have any of the qualities he built with her.
