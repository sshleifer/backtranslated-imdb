Definitely not a good movie, but nowhere as bad as some might paint. The nightmare in Wax tells the story of a man who had his face disfigured in a typical flashback scene, his revenge on those who are directly responsible, and those who indirectly cause losses in his life - especially the love and friendship of a beautiful young actress. Cameron Mitchell plays the artist with his typical taste, though limited taste. Actually, I thought he gave one of his better performances. What exactly does that mean? Mitchell wears a patch, smokes cigarettes forever, wears a colorful tunic, and talks to his wax creations. They are not your ordinary wax figurines, but people who are still alive under the control of some serum, which makes them lose control of all neurological functions. They become zombies. I thought the assumption was resourceful if nothing else. He has some ridiculous explanation but serves a conspiracy. It is a 1960s movie that is confident with some psychedelic cameras from Bud Townsend and the company. Acting is mediocre, but Mitchell, Scott Brady and Barry Kroeger give interesting turns. Wax characters from the past Hollywood era are being performed very efficiently, and most of the filming location was very trustworthy. The end of the film will dissipate into something not entirely real - whether it's another example of a 60's cultural film, or the end of the writer's creative work. I'm on banking. Despite many shortcomings, I enjoyed the movie. The opening scene showing the actor being needled was effectively made as was a police chase on the waterfront.
