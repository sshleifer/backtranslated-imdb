SKIN CORRIDORS <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.66: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Black & White) <br /> <br /> London , 1840: When trying to formulate an anesthetic solution, a specialized surgeon (Boris Karloff) becomes addicted to narcotics and is blackmailed by local hunters. Riding a coat about the Gothic revival caused by the recent success of Hammer's Cross FRANKENSTEIN (1957), THE CORRIDOR OF CHRIST Robert Day, is a strange blend of the historical drama and theatrics of Grand Guignol. Producer Richard Gordon has lured Karloff away from Hollywood - where his film career has stopped at the B-Film Rut (VOODOO ISLAND, FRANKENSTEIN 1970, etc.) - for a few shocking shocks in which good men are thwarted by circumstances beyond their control . . In GRIP OF STRANGLER (1958) he played a novelist who encounters a frightening secret while examining a series of recent history murders, while in the Blood Blood Corridor he is a drug addict who becomes a victim of a gang of criminals. East End pub owner Francis de Wolff. Less horror movie than melodrama with ghoulish trimmings, the film provides its commercial stakes by including a series of cruel excitement (leg open, face destroyed by acid, etc.), but the story is mainly motivated by Karloff's altruistic persecution anesthetic formula that relieves the terrible suffering of patients during operation. Manufactured under the name 'Doctor from Seven Dials', the finished film went unreleased until 1962 due to the indifference of MGM distributors, which co-star Christopher Lee earned a prominent loan screen, despite playing small - but significant - roles like 'Resurrection Joe', the sinister Cockney Robber, who murdered carefully the patron saint de Wolff is a poor pub and sells remains to local doctors. Lee filmed this magnificent portrait in front of the Frankenstein Cross, which catapulted him to international fame that contributes to his limited projection time, although his intense performance is one of the highlights of the film. Adrienne Corri (VAMPIRE CIRCUS) differs as de Wolff's partner in crimes and there is a feast of famous faces in supporting roles, including Francis Matthews (DRACULA: PRINCE OF DARKNESS), Betta St. John (CITY DEAD), Finlay Currie and Nigel Green. Excellent artistic direction (Anthony Masters) and cinematography (Geoffrey Faithful).
