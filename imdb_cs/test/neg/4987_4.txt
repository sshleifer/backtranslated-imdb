The story of Underdog and Simon Bar Sinister's adventure in live action format. First we have Showshine, who got up from the street and brought to the lab experimental experiment where Simon Bar Sinister works. He fights when Sinister tries to inject the chemical and crashes, gets the superpower, and the lab throws out the sinister. Shoeshine is in conflict with Riff Raff, another dog to be taken by Jim Belushi, who was a guard in the lab. Belushi's son discovers that Shoeshine has all these powers and finally Shoeshine becomes Underdog, who will again fight Sinister. Whether the movie will work or not. For me, half the work and half are not. The part that is not is everything you see Shoeshine, the dog, as a dog with your master. Some of the repartee is funny, but it just pulls on and on as we become familiar with Sweet Polly and her mistress and we go through all the typical lets you see what you can do things. Its deadly 20 or 25 minutes and effectively kills the movie. His painfully boring and feels like it takes forever to get through it, which due to the film says 75 minutes sans loans, is something you don't want to do. The parts that are good are anything with Simon Bar Sinister (Peter Dinklage is a blast) and anything where Underdog goes into action. Some, how somewhere they have found a way to be faithful to the spirit of the cartoon and update it. Of course, I could be wrong because the middle part is so boring, but I don't think so because I'm looking forward to getting caught on the cable again. Some people have said, but if you can wait for a cable where you can come across good parts, it's a fine cartoon to adapt the movie. (But wait for the cable-really)
