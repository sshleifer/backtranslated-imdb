The Heart of Darkness Movie Review Could a book that is well known for its eloquent formulations and complicated concepts ever be made good enough in the film to portray the profound meaning of the book? So far, this goal has not been achieved. The Heart of Darkness was tried to be made into film in 1993, but it was a failure in comparison to the book. It is hard enough to make a book for a movie. There is always a fear that it will not be as descriptive or will have the same meaning. So why is the novel Heart of Darkness made into film, I'm clueless. There is so much description and hidden meaning throughout the book. When he simply reads words clearly, I think one would think that it is quite boring and does not get symbolism. I think it happened in the movie; the film just trimmed the story on the surface. The movie did not even follow the entire story of the book, the major changes were made that I thought the film was worse. For example, the manager did not go along with the ship with Marlow and the rest of the crew, the spy did instead. I think some of the main parcels have been knocked out and took the big manager's deception in relation to Kurtz. Also, Kurtz wasn't on the steamer when he died, which made the whole trip even more vain, which was just annoying after a while. And when Marlow told Kurtz's fiancé about his final moments and words, it wasn't where it was so descriptive or important, the fiancé didn't even want it. As far as acting is concerned, no actors did a very good job except the actor who played Mfum. In my opinion, Kurtz wasn't too bad, and that was something so important in the book. Other characters like Marlow, manager and fiancé did not make the figure of justice they deserved from the book. Their actions were neither exciting nor unforgettable. More specifically, I don't think this book should even try to make a movie. I think it's good to use some of the themes in another story like Apocalypse Now. But when it comes to following the same exact story of a book, it's just a shame.
