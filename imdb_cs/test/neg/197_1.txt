I was a hippie at the age of 22 in 1965, I saw the game 5 times, I got 2 versions of the music and I read the script many times. Maybe it's a separate thing, the movie is fine, but as the acceptance of the game it's terrible. <br /> <br /> Good first. Songs are well sung and production values ​​are pretty good. Homosexual consequences in Black Boys, White Boys are cute. The switch Claude / Berger was interesting. Hair is a liquid product, and constant changes are essential, provided that the basic spirit is preserved. It seemed that all the producers wanted to sing certain songs and adapt their story to whatever happened to the original intent of the game. Claude, Sheila and Hud were introduced as selfish brats who don't care about anyone. Claude destroyed Sheila's parents' side (it's hard to believe she was smiling while her parents were injured) and repeatedly stole the cars. Sheila stole clothes and a car from a soldier. Then she left him in the middle of the desert, where she would be seriously burned, probably arrested in rank, and could die on this lonely Nevada road. Good entertainment. And Hud thought it good to break his son's heart while shouting at his ex. This is not what hippies were, not what the game described, and is directly opposite the generation of love. I've never seen a hippie beg for money. The aim was to be self-sufficient outside the capitalist system, not to beg him. After Berger is thrown into jail for the destruction of Sheila's party and Claude offers bail, Berger insists he be jailed instead. , with no better plan to save the rest that hits Sheila's parents, and then hitting her own mother. <br /> <br /> "Being in" has always been a very spiritual point, but here it is wasted on silly brides floating around. Although it is part of his journey, it will destroy the beautiful song. I know that the military is contrasting "floating in space". But again, it completely destroys a beautiful song. While Sheila and Claude are skinny soaking, Berger steals their clothes, laughing "it was a fun man", even though they saw both were very upset. A little later, Berger does one thing that no hippie will ever do. He hits Claude. Grapes. Then they have a great opportunity to sing "Starshine" at night in some beautiful SF spot with stars flashing down, maybe working in an inventive duet. Instead, the whole tribe sings him in the blazing sun accelerating on the road in a convertible (of course stolen). In 1979, I was extremely disappointed with the film and now I like it even less. I think it would be possible to make a reasonably close adoption of the show, but that's not it.
