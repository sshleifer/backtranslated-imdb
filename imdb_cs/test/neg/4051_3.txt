The film is about a day in the life of a crazy woman. To show she is mentally ill, she gets a lot of trouble and the narrator tells us he's "crazy". On the way, she goes out with a fat guy who seems to be Orson Welles' brother, and later takes a head from the building at one of the interesting moments in the movie. <br /> <br /> is a weird little movie that is very cheap - and it certainly shows. The film was filmed without sound (probably using 8mm or some other cheap type of movie) and later had some sound effects and revolutionary narration. In fact, the narration was the most intrusive and unintentionally hilarious I have ever heard, and it is said in such a stupid and over-the-top way you would simply have to hear to believe it. As a result of these austerity actions, it is no wonder that the film is bad, though the idea of ​​trying to make this kind of movie was quite original. Plus, it's very hard to make it through the entire movie.
