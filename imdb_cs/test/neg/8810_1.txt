Apparently Danny Glover and Carey Elwes have forgotten how to act when they made this film, acting is absolutely cruel. The payoff is even worse. I'm sorry about Danny Glover, I hope it paid off well for him because it makes him totally stupid, the same goes for Mr. Elwes. Contemptible. This is probably the worst show of veteran actors I've ever seen. I wonder if they bothered to look at the script, or if they did, they had to say "forget everything you know about acting" because it makes them two ridiculous. For the two experienced veterans to do this, it is frightening, I hope the check was very big, I thought it was first a spoof. If you can find satisfaction in this movie then more energy for you.
