<br /> <br /> Make this short and sweet: I hope this movie will not be considered a key work for the "gener-Asian" American film making. Acting was the second time, relying on stereotypes, raised voices, and exaggerated eyes to convey their message. Chris Chan Park cannot be immersed in the depths of its characters, allowing them to stay caricatures of angry / frustrated / distant / noncommunicative Asians. these images do not cause the mysterious attraction of the characters; it makes them confusing and unsympathetic. I like that the Asians are more complicated than that. <br /> <br /> I wasn't convinced of the movie. They did not convince them that these characters have a life, a blood-brother as a link with each other to go to lengths they did to help their friend out. he was not convinced that the main character had a girlfriend over her superficial attraction. they did not convince them that hard-working immigrant parents would not pay for their son's college education. she was not convinced that all the characters were even necessary, ie: janet, which is placed in the bed at the back of the car and quickly forgotten. The story that I think had the potential was not allowed to come into his own for two reasons: 1) Flat characters for whom I had no sympathy / affinity, 2) The plot is overshadowed by meaningless non- sequitur scenes, such as seance / donut store succession with amy hill which was simply ridiculous and useless. I praise the park for his efforts, because I'm sure it took a lot of hard work to even make a movie, and I even give him the benefit of doubts. time around as a newbie director / screenwriter, but sincerely hope the next time will be a little deeper. Just because the film is one of the first of its kind about American Korean experience doesn't mean it's automatically good.
