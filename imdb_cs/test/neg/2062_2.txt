I bought this DVD as part of a set of 50 "historical classics". It is hardly a classic, and since the plot was updated until its release, it is not even historical. The real title on the DVD is "Indecent," plus the subtitle "Private Life of Becky Sharp." Myrna Loy is not very convincing, though in her defense she is saddled with a terrible script and conversation. As with many early interviews, and especially those made by smaller studios, the cast and crew are few skills. Loy wears several dresses that are pretty stylish, but her costumes and makeup in later scenes are exaggerated. The only saving grace is the tolerable performance of Billy Bevan, who plays one of her many suitors
