"Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver" is a very bad one-year trial. The first movie was cute, cuddly and charming. The idea of ​​a dog playing a basketball team is far enough, but he defiantly drew enough stunts to save the concept. Even the human story had some explanation. Josh's father was killed in a plane crash, so he's sad. And the audience also becomes emotionally involved. <br /> <br /> Now for a badly done sequel. It's scary. This is the worst kind of bad sequel, a kind that changes good ideas and turns them into bad ones. The kind that changes the main plot in one direction, this time, K-9 plays football instead of basketball. No madman, how much time you spend in mind over matter, benefit from doubt, enter into an open mind attitude that you have with a movie like this, there is no positive thinking when it comes to down the bad making of a movie. Br /> <br /> Starring Kevin Zegers as Josh, who is in the eighth year. He lives with his mother and little sister in the suburbs of Seattle. In the first film, the human story involved the loss of his father in an aircraft accident that viewers may be concerned with, most people know how it feels to lose a loved one. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the emotional plot is a little more complicated. Josh's mother walks again. He and Buddy, his dog who can play basketball, don't like it at all. Why? If I were in his shoes, I'd like to have another parent in my life, especially the one who's nice. The man's name is Patrick Sullivan, and Josh's mother, Jackie, met him when he was a local vet for Buddy. The animal story is too simple. Josh is influenced by his best friend to try for the school football team, Wood Wolves. The team itself looks like some of America's most entertaining home videos, it can even catch the ball without tripping or falling into itself. So when Bud appears one day, he proves that he can play as a receiver for them and is undoubtedly the best player in the team. Buddy is very cute in his costume. It's enough to melt your heart. The dog is also the best in this movie. Too bad he wasn't enough to draw attention to the fact that no one ever asks a dog to play in a school football team. There is a very bad sub- plot about Russian circus workers who like stealing amazing animals, of course trying to catch Buddy. But their dim mind is dominated by animals and ends up looking like a "Home Alone" scenario. <br /> <br /> "Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver" is much more crazy than the first one. . Russian kidnappers will add a lot of lamebrain slapstick that I have to admit, I laughed, for all the stupidity. There are lots of sequences that detail the screwdriver nature and too few scenes that show the real reason people see this movie - to see a dog playing football. I liked the presentation of Gregory Harrison and Robert Costanza, but the performance would be equivalent to D +. Kevin Zegers and Cynthia Stevenson were completely pathetic. At the end of a few minutes a couple of cheerful moments were a few football players, but it is not worth mentioning. Will the kids enjoy this movie? Maybe, but they too will be tired when the heart feels a discussion too long and deep. Certainly they will complain that the dog did not get enough time on the screen and hated the rapidly changing scenario and protested against boring performances and argued that this film is a waste compared to origami al "Air Bud". I am. I suppose they'll think the dog is cute.
