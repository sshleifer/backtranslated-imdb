This must be one of the worst films of MGM and FRANK SINATRAS. A strange musical comedy that fails in almost every aspect. Silly Conspiracy SINATRA is trying to keep fathers' reputation as KISSING BANDIT. Not a bandit and not a kiss! He plays a "nerdy" character as much as one might expect due to the dialogue he has to talk to. Stealing scenes are J. CARROLL NASH and MILDRED NATWICK. Too bad they don't have more scenes together. I gave the film to two stars because the sets and costumes are superior and one of the songs sung by KATHTREN GRAYSON "Love is where you find it" is sensational. He could have a repirse of one. Also, comic dance number RIDCARDO MANTALBAN, CYD CHARISSE and ANN MILLER if fun. For these reasons, and for these reasons alone, this is observable. KISSING BANDIT is part of Frank Sinatra's collection.
