Murli Mohan Rao has done a much better BANDHAN in 1998 This film is a terrible remake of WEDDING SINGER <br /> <br /> Basically, this film is made up of: Salman Khan, who at that time had a depressed lover who loses his girlfriend and he also had his comic scene, where even today he was playing badly, doing well, doing it here and also losing his shirt in the scenes Jackie Shroff- wastes, bored and tired, his role is so stupid He is shown as the lover of Pooja Bhatra and then in the 1 scene he is portrayed as a groom? Inder Kumar - once again a confusing character <br /> <br /> Rani Mukherjering, overweight and nothing special Pooja Bhattrall, fair and good, but lacking talent <br /> <br /> Kashmira Shah- says it is like poetry <br /> <br /> Mohinish Behl - poor fellow soldiers 2 children were also very powerful <br /> <br /> The story is the same and has terrible comic scenes, a sudden story Love and Boring Drunk Scenes and Forced Comic Track by Shakti Kapoo r <br /> <br /> Direction is Bad Music is decent <br /> <br /> Salman Khan is just moving, Jackie is bad, Rani is as usual, Pooja is bad, Mohinish and Kashmira are nothing big Inder is terrible
