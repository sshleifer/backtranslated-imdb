We apologize for any spoilers it contains. But if you want to read on: I really wonder why so many people on Kevin Williamson are so high. Let's look quickly at his work as a screenwriter, right? There's Scream 1 and 2 (plus a story for the next), which I think is quite funny, but very overrated. In addition, by entering the series, Scream ceased to be a parody of horror movies and simply became another. Then there's I know what you did last summer, which is basically the same movie. He co-wrote Halloween: H20, but he didn't even make sense to imagine what he did on this monstrosity. Then comes the Faculty, which I can only say was divine. (Lots of fun making fun, though). Don't even understand me on the absurd, soap opera Dawson's creek, I could think of how bad it was for hours. So we get to Mrs. Tingle's lessons. First, there are a lot of tiny probabilities in this tunnel. For example: in most of the high schools I know, Valedictorian is not the only one to get to college! The idea that Katie Holmes would never go if she wasn't a valedictorian was absurd. Have you ever heard of financial aid, damn it! Also, I don't think you're excluded from high school or getting to college to cheat on one test. There are many others, but now I am going to the big one. The end really worried me: they committed a crime, but it was fine because the teacher was a bitch. Great. Do you know how many of my teachers I could bear on this logic? I'm sure the police never accepted any statement to find out the whole story. That would certainly not be necessary. Helen Mirren was good, she added something of a character that (as the previous commentator noted) had a reason for nothing she did. And did anyone else notice that Katie Holmes couldn't act? Her own justice became incredibly unpleasant. "You wanted me to fail. Blah blah blah." Her last two scenes with Mrs. Tingle were the worst. The only reason I don't regret losing $ 8.25 in this disaster is because she was a bit defeated. No, wait, I'm sorry I lost my money: it wasn't real and survived. Mr. Williamson, if you read it, you did the same movie (some violence and / or scary things that compensate wise-ass children who make sarcastic jokes and links to other movies) just a few times (I count 6 for, not including Scream 3 and what's next), and I'd really appreciate it if you stopped. Otherwise, I might have to kidnap you and threaten you crossbow. OK? :-)
