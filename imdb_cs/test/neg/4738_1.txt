AVP2 is a horrible movie. The dialogue was unnecessary, the acting was pathetic, it had virtually no story line, and you can't tell what the hell is going on half the time because of continuity and conspiracy errors. <br /> <br /> BUT! You'll love it anyway. Because it pushes borders to gore, violence, death, destruction and chaos. In this film, they kill children, newborns and unborn children. You'll be sitting there thinking "Oh my God, that is disgusting" And they will surprise you by killing a "sexy chick who always does it alive" when predators and aliens fight in the hospital. It's like the movie industry said, "We know what we did in the first movie Alien Vs. Predator was bad, so we're doing it again, but this time we get help from psychopaths with live ideas" It's predictable, moronic and real useless .... but you will think about it for a while when you see it.
