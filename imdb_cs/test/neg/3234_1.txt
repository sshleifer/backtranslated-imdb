Dean Koontz's book "The Rangers" is one of the best books I've read. Sadly, the film is a sad cartoon book. A disillusioned middle-aged hero and a lonely spinster with whom he discovers his sense of life are transformed into a few stupid teenagers in the film, a Stoic security agent and a conscientious sheriff are united in a farcical villain - get a picture? Moviemakers took a moving story about love, horror, and adventure and turned it into a horror movie Z-Grade focused - very badly - on the teen market. Buy a book and enjoy many hours of reading - it will be far, much more rewarding than watching a movie. <br /> <br />
