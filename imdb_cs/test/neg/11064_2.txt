when I sat down and watched this movie, I thought it might be a little good. but not. It was OK movie, not good, but not bad for most of it, but then you get to the end and lose all credibility. they should just leave. they didn't leave the last bit that made no sense. if they had something that began to crash the plane, but we didn't. The first bit is fine and I give them credit for it, but the rest is just a bad and unnecessary plane if you're thinking about going and watching this DON movie. 2/10
