So why did they have to try to make a sequel to one of the biggest Christmas movies ever. The movie is a wreck of a train at each level and should never be executed. Randy Quaid's depiction of cousin Eddie is over the top cartoon of his previous trips as Eddie's cousin. Eddie's character is also not interesting enough to carry the film. Even the "eye candy" Sung Hi Lee couldn't redeem this piece of crap. Please don't waste your time on this move, just watch the original again.
