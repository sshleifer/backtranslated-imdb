I have seen this piece of pseudo-intellectual crap a few years ago, and it is now making a comeback at a local film club. He uses every clich√© in the Guide to Intellectual Film Makers (Edition for Beginners) to seem intellectual as the director probably imagines. You get your slow pace, brown color range, slow pans through bombarded environments, empty expressions, facial expressions, too symbolic imagery, and the necessary unfortunate ending. It's a total failure, an unintentional perfect cartoon of a typical Russian art film. Director Aleksandr Sokurov has an excellent technique but lacks an eye. He cannot see when he crosses the line to the pathetic realm. This film is a wet dream for film lovers. He lives up to every stereotypical view of the genre that exists. <br /> <br /> If it was fun, it would be turkey. But for a film that is so bad that you leave afterwards, you need a new term. This film is Sokurov.
