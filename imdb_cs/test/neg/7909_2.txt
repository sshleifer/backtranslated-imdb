I wholeheartedly agree with Greg in Ontario. I saw this movie today with a friend who went to the theater manager and told him: "That was perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen." I've seen a lot of movies with this person and it's pretty forgiving, so I was actually shocked. (The manager gave him a free pass!) <br /> <br /> I was offended by a lot of humor in the movie (yes, the baked potato scene was on top of the list!). My friend and I are white and we've seen a movie with a mostly black audience. I thought for a moment, maybe I didn't get the movie because I'm white. Then I realized that ON ONE was laughing. Writing was wrong; the direction was wrong; The timing was almost non-existent. There were a few funny moments, among them there was too much time. Even the Airplane Two was more fun than this, and it says a lot. I was so brilliant Snoop Dogg in Starsky and Hutch (as Huggy Bear) that I felt I was sure to get this movie. No. DL Hughley was, as usual, funny, but his role was relatively small. Tom Arnold had some funny moments as a "white boy," but most of the other humor attempts weren't far enough on the mark. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to appreciate this movie with a negative star rating. .
