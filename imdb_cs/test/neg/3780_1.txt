This is the result of the city of Milpitas of California making a home movie and submitting the rest of the world to it. Legendary in some circles as the biggest film turkey this film is rightly considered a bad film. Part of the comedy, part of the giant horror monster this movie is full of not actors not playing. The plot has something to do with a giant monster that is made up of garbage and pollution in the area and goes on rampage. The monster we haven't seen in the last 20 minutes is quite cool, but it's not cool enough to watch the previous hour of boredom. Frankly, the hard-core lovers of bad movies will have a hard time getting to the end. This is smelly.
