when this show first came to Disney, I love watching it all the time. He quickly became one of my favorite Disney shows, but this show has somehow turned into something that is worrying and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Now I find some second and third season of fun, they look like re-watching some teen shows. I got a dumpster here. The first season was very unique because it showed Sadie who loved science and animals and animals. The first season was very fun. I usually don't like the second season because of Ben. It bothers me and makes me crazy. The story in the second season is also annoying and is just terrible
