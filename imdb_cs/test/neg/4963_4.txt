Think of this movie as a fan service, a wet dream for genre admirers. We start with a cruel prologue, which does not cover much of the rest of the movie. Flash Forward Nine Months And Real Meat From The Venue Begins: Our Lady Mandy Lane is coveted by every athlete and nerd in her school, and gets an invitation to spend a weekend at three boys who think they can get lucky and two bimbos obsessed with their weight and breast size. So ... you have a lot of young students in your house in the middle of nowhere who want to do nothing but have sex, do drugs and drink booze. The only other company is a cheap ranch that may or may not suffer from the Gulf War Syndrome. Hmm ... potential future suspect maybe? So as you have probably learned now, all house-guests will end up killed in various bloody ways, and for a change of black man you are not the first to die. There are some conventions that are still held, though, just as a terribly clad baby is chasing a car in the field. Or the lights mysteriously look like our 'heroes' in the evening to solve this problem. Even with the so-called shocking twist at the end, the movie is like an old 80 horror movie updated for noughties, and on this score it succeeds. Unfortunately, it also inherits a lot of movie issues of that time, namely the paper characters and the predictability of the entire business. People get shorter, shoot, bludgeoned, etc. But because their innate hatred for the audience and the stupidity of getting in these situations, it's hard to worry about how bodies accumulate. Someone is murdered, one of their friends goes looking alone, the BANG are brown bread. Rinse, then repeat. Maybe someday we'll get a script with credible, intelligent, sympathetic characters who make rational decisions, but are still pretending to be brilliant killer. Until then, we have to tolerate teenagers with the fact that I.Q Pond-Life is picked up by a derailed sweatshirt. All right .. 4/10
