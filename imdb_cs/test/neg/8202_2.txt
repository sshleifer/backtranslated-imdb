1957 Roger Corman non epic in which various bunch of characters end up in a lead-lined valley (sic) just as the stock of thermo-nuclear hell is unleashed. It's the end of the world. Four men with guns, two women (one unmarried virgin, the other from Las Vegas, who drinks and smokes - guess which one is at the end of the movie?) Time goes by, tension develops (or is assumed). Something is in the forest to eat radioactive rabbits. Mutant monster! Seven weeks of radioactive dust have done "a million years of evolution" (on an already living man), resulting in a ridiculously bad zip on the back, a rubber monster that is strangely afraid of their only source of fresh water. It rains. The monster dissolves. The remaining two characters, Hunk and Virgo. they set out to re-populate the world because the headline "Beginning" fills the screen after it turns out that the short rain shower has washed all the radioactivity away and dissolved all the monsters running "outside." All that is about is the incredible amount of "curtain" that continues in it. One of the main elements of the bad and lo budget movie making period was the superabundant use of curtains in the design set. It was cheap. Complete with one setting? Pull the curtain across, place a different piece of furniture in front of it, and have a different location within minutes without moving the camera or changing the lighting. 'Curtain' is a skill in which an actor gets a commentary on what is happening outside any building in which he is located ("Looks like rain" or "Here they come, and it looks like that she has a sheriff with them! ‚Äùkind of things. He does this by standing on one side of the window - stretching over his body and lifting the curtain from the window, but along the axis of the shot - ie Towards the camera - allowing him to pretend to look out and tell us what's going on outside the screen without the viewers seeing that he was staring at the studio wall three inches behind the cheap velvet curtains. It was a lot in the movie.
