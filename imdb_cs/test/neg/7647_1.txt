Honestly, one of the worst written, directorial and feature films I've ever seen. It looked like a TV movie. And that bad. I can't believe people still hire Danny Huston after seeing him in this movie, or that they still allow John Sayles to film movies. My husband and I came across this movie on television one night and so bored we ended up cleaning the house while he was on. . . and still bored us! This made me think that critics were so trusting with previous Sayles films, such as the Lone Star, which was furious at the time, but didn't bring much. Spend your time better. Anything.
