This movie is slightly entertaining if one neglects its numerous conspiracy inconsistencies and total lack of credibility. Bruce Willis as "Jackal" never seems to fulfill his reputation as a cunning master of the underworld. Instead, he bangs around in broad daylight, marching on a mishmash of awkward disguises. Why the man has never been captured before (or identified) is out of me. Not once is the audience impressed by its cleverness or courage; Given the price he wants for his services ($ 70 million exorbitant), his methods are definitely low-budget and stupid. As for those who persecute him, they are at least so ridiculous in their behavior. They show no sense of expertise, instead relying on half-baked conjecture that sends them across the country after their whim. These incredible estimates (maybe you bought a boat, maybe it's in Chicago, etc.) It always leads directly to the jackal, who again escapes from their clumsy grip. Richard Gere, whose Irish accent fades in and out as a remote radio station, plays the inexplicable role of a jailed convict who is released from prison to work alongside the FBI. He actually makes a compatible partner, if only because his resources are as amateur and inept as his professional mates. In fact, in one place, they face the infamous Jackal, but unfortunately the FBI, though he trusts him to leave him out of sight, cannot equip him with weapons or means of communication. What kind of traffic is running here? The film also seems too dependent on horrible violence, which is totally useless and provides no tension. Probably a stealthy Jackal acts more like a demented and pointless serial killer, eliminating people for sport and writing blood sacrifices on his face. with melodram. This film is poorly executed on many levels, one clear point is still consistent Sidney Poitier. Avoid this movie if you are in the mood to think while watching. <br /> <br />
