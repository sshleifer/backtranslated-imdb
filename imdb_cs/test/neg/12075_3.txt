Wow, this episode started in STOOOOOPID! Enterprise trembles when Abraham Lincoln floats in space and welcomes Enterprise !!!!!!! Is it just me or is it really a lame-brained idea?! Lincoln comes on board and welcomes them. Abe suggests that they move to a barren planet where they meet other famous dead people - good and bad. It seems that a really cheesy-looking rock monster has put together a team of GOOD and GOLD to fight for domination. The whole thing seems to be really scary and inherently unfair, because the GOOD party is saddled with Surak - the Vulcan who makes Gandhi like Ramba !! Despite the absolutely great assumption, the action is pretty good and it's great to see the shots of the seeming doubles that fight in this grotesque match. But don't think about high art or deep science fiction. The bottom line is that the series was on its last legs as the first series and it really looked like they brushed this turkey and filmed it regardless of the absurdity of the premise.
