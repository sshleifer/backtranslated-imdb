Italian / American co-production with Linda Blair and David "The Hoff" Hasselhoff: how could such a fan of a horror movie resist such a feeling? Well, on the basis of incredible, extremely tedious, and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so, I'd say "very easily"; Fortunately, however, things will eventually get a little more fun with the introduction of several inventive scenes of death and those who are fortunate enough to find an unabridged copy, including nudity (unfortunately my copy has been optically modified to remove such offensive material) < Hoff plays Gary, a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend Leslie (Leslie Cumming) to a hotel located on a seemingly deserted island to take photos for her latest project. a book about witches; While there, frustrated Gary also hopes to try and heal the bad case of blue balls by relieving Leslie of her virginity. His plans for nookie are cut off, however, by the unexpected arrival of the developers Freddie and Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross), their pregnant daughter Jane (Blair), son of Tommy (Michael Manchester), architect of the architecture of Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland), real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth). island hotel. After Gary and Leslie explained their unexpected presence on the island, new owners will welcome him, and when a stormy storm suddenly rises, it is dangerous to return to the mainland. agrees to spend the night in the old building. Unfortunately, unknown to new hotel guests, the place is also home to the spirit of the evil witch (Hildegard Knef), who requires human sacrifices to return to life. One by one, the victims are dragged into a whirling red vortex (which is guaranteed to be unintentional laughter) before they encounter a terrible fate. None of this makes sense and acting is cruel (Manchester) Tommy is particularly bad, while Hasselhoff proves he's one of the best players to talk about others, but those viewers who do it in the first half, they are rewarded with pretty decent gore moments: Rose has her lips stitched together, before they are baked in the hearth; Jerry is crucified and burned alive; Linda is tortured by hags and impaled on swordfish (!!); Freddie's veins pulsate and explode in blood geysers; and Gary gets stabbed in the back. Oh, and Leslie is raped by a guy without lips and Blair is obsessed again.
