The idea of ​​nine stupid prisoners who run and go on a trip sounds pretty good for the movie. Especially because it's supposed to be funny and I think cordial warming in some strange way. The problem is that the film was very rarely fun and often just seemingly pointless and unnecessarily rude. It was as if jokes or interesting scenes were being created over and over again, but no one bothered to finish one of them - there was no payout. Also, the film was simply helpless and had fraudsters meandering through Japan, even though they left so many crime victims alive, it was impossible to believe they would not be caught almost immediately - especially because they continued to use the same stolen caravan for days off. And as for the rough game, I just didn't have to see the scene after the scene after the scene of the men urinating on the road. Plus, believe it or not, there's a scene where four guys are out of rape sheep! Overall, I really hated this movie. And it's a shame because I almost always like Japanese movies - just not badly made and uninteresting like this.
