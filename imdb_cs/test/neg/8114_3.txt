I'm sorry, but for a movie that was so stamped as a semi-classic and scary movie, but seriously, I think that when the director laughs me in an accident, that's not a good thing. The characters in this movie were so high and incredible. I couldn't stop laughing with Issac's voice, it was like the high voice of a British voice. Not to mention that Malicai is through the dramatic hold of his ass character. people. When a couple has a bad car accident, they come to the city for help, but of course they get caught in a child trap and sacrifice themselves! But Malicai has other intentions when he is sick of following Issac's orders. Corn children could be something big, but it turned into a bad movie that could easily be done. Like I love Stephen King, I'm sure it's not what he intended, and that was a pretty lame story, or at least the actors destroyed it. As I said, for a good laugh, watch it, but I warn you, it's quite pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3/10
