Being a longtime fan of Japanese film, I was expecting more than that. I can't really bother to write much because this movie is so bad. The story could be the cutest romantic thing that ever happened, a pity that I couldn't stand the horrible act, the mess they called stimulation, and the standard "unpredictable" Japanese story. If you have noticed how many Japanese movies use characters, conspiracies, and twists that seem too "different," they forcibly give up this film. Seriously, a 12-year-old could tell you how this movie would move, and that's not a good thing in my book. "Beat" Takeshi Fans: His role in this movie isn't really more than a portrait, and if you're not an angry fan, you don't have to waste this film waste. <br /> <br /> 2/10
