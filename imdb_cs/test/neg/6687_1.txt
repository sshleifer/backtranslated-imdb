I couldn't really find anything in this film to be a rational human thought. For some reason the writer decided that a few random players would act like a guy, scream and scream like the Cro-Magnon twins. I understand that it was gymnastics, but seriously, what about the whole roar and the human blessing? I also saw at least five actors with hyperactive terror syndrome and stage 10 syphilis. Although this film has real human acrobatics, I must say that it is surprising that you can make a film like this without any form of human language. This is indeed a milestone in the history of filmmaking because there was no conscious decision to make the characters express anything more than Urrrrr! or Rfff! sound. Unbelievable.
