First, the first thing that came to my mind when I finished this movie last night was "Why 8MM 2?" Because I saw the first one obviously and what was it to do with the first movie chart? The only thing that was similar was the fact that the couple had to go to the porn industry, even on the land, because after you see the end of not messing up, it just didn't make sense. The Diplomat and his fianc√©e are in Hungary and have noticed a woman who was swimming naked in the pool, very attractive, so when she sees her in the club, they decide to have a little fun and have a steamy three. But things are extremely intense when a diplomat is sent from photographs of all who have an affair, worried that it might go public and jeopardize his career, it pays off who sent the pictures, the diplomat gets scared and "kills" that guy, leading to a murder case. He and his fiction decide to find a girl with whom they have an affair, but things only deepen and darken as they move on to what they got into. What could have been a thriller, turned into an unexplained and not thoughtful movie that was sad. As I said, the title really has nothing to do with the first one, so don't fall for it. It's just a sexual thriller that doesn't make sense, but it's good for those nights because it's frankly that it's one of those movies where it's so close to porn that it could also be called a soft core . <br/> <br/> 4/10
