I tried to give this show a chance, but it doesn't really fit with me. Although performance is good, writing is not. The two oldest siblings, Derek and Casey, are just as annoyed; I think we should go with Casey, because he's the protagonist, but I can't find her at all likeable. Parents are constantly portrayed as absolutely helpless. Three younger children are on the show most attentive things; Lizzie and Edwin are sweet as they combine, and Marti is cute. The lines of the plot are a little far-fetched and the whole premise is usually hard to swallow - mixed families are common, yes, but this family doesn't really try to mix it. Overall, I think it is getting stronger.
