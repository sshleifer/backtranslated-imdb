Why does this movie have so many raving reviews? This is amateurish, unreal and unpleasant. The only memorable thing here is a song called Corny. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are low and "comedies" (if you want to tell them that ideas are weak) look like remnants of SNL remnants that wouldn't even dare to wear. <br /> <br /> I'm not really trusting IMDb ratings. That's light years away from Kentucky Fried Movie - not even in the same Galaxy. It is not even possible to write 10 lines about it. OK, another good thing: ugly street scenes and ugly people - something not much visible on TV and movies today.
