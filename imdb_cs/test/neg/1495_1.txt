An entire group of teenagers meet to discuss their fears, but an uninvited guest has shown up and kills everyone. Probably the worst horror of the 1990s, Camp Blood (1999) is the only movie that could challenge it for this title, has some of the dumbest characters and situations that admire the TV screen anytime. The so-called end of surprise is terrible, as is the rest of the film. Slightly fun at sooo bad it's a good level. My rating: 2 of 10.
