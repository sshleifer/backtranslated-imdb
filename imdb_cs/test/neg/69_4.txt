"Witchcraft" could only be an incoherent and lamented horror film of the 1980s, but fortunately it has several compensation features such as fantastic gore effects, an exciting musical score and some amazing casting choices. Frankly, the script does not make any sense of purpose, but who cares when Linda Blair (with a hairstyle exploded) portrays one more girl who is obsessed with evil forces, and David Hasselhof portrays a hunky photographer (who can't seem to lie) to a film that it constantly contains bloody voodoo, sewn lips, crucifixion upside down, vicious burns and exaggerated but really scary melodies. Eight random people gathered at a deserted island holiday resort off the coast of Massachusetts. The young couple is there to explore the dark history of the place; a dysfunctional family (with a pregnant Linda Blair, though it seems that who is the father and where she is) considers the reopening of a hotel and a monk female architect simply called occasional sex. Are they forced to stay in a dilapidated hotel at night, and then suddenly home? an aging actress or something that always dresses in black? it starts to take them in different ways. Everything is somehow related to the opening sequence, which shows that the woman accused of witchcraft jumped out of the window. Incidentally, the plot is of lesser importance in the Italian horror franchise, which began as an unofficial spin-off of "The Evil Dead". The atmosphere is occasionally disturbing and make-up effects are undoubtedly the most prominent feature of the film. There is something extremely morbid and disturbing as he stares at the defenseless woman who is hanging upside down in the chimney waiting to be fried.
