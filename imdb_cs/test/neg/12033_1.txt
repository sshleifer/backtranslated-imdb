First, let me start by saying that this SOUNDED movie is very interesting: a serial killer who copies Edgar Allan Poe's works (who is one of my writers of all time). Sounds good, right? Yeah, definitely not. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. At all. And that's not exaggerated. I've seen a lot of very bad movies. This one takes a cake. And I was even ready for a bad movie before I got into it. Perhaps a writer should study some law enforcement procedure: If you have a killer name, his lifetime history, a criminal record, and HIS ADDRESS, where is the first place where you should look? Hmm. . . maybe. . . his house? What?! NO! That's a pointless idea, Anthony! How could you suggest something as bright and straight as going bowling? * spoilers end * Honestly, sometimes I can forgive a film if writing is good, but acting is wrong, or vice versa. . . but it had everything wrong with what you could find. I think my biggest pet was how the police / FBI acted. For example: Black FBI Agent: "Okay, threatened woman, sit here in this car in the empty car park while I go in and look around the potential crime scene where the serial killer is supposed to be. Sounds good ? " FBI Agent Moronic Female FBI: "Yeah, that's okay. Go ahead. I'm not going to focus on my neighborhood or at least check the circuit." FBI Black Agent: "Good, I would!" Honestly, if you want to be in law enforcement, rent this movie so you can learn how to act. . . Or if you are human and want to learn the same thing. <br /> <br /> 0.5 / 10: Half point for film and store. Congratulations! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
