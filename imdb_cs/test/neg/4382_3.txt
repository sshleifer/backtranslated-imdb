I chose this movie from a local family video for sale for $ 1.50, which was probably the first sign that it wouldn't be good. Watching with 2 friends, neither of them even wanted to finish because of how horrible this movie is. Surprisingly, I couldn't stop watching it. But this film is definitely a textbook case of making a movie. The story is pretty simple and sounds great: Chuck Norris has nightmares about the serial killer behind the bars. The serial killer escapes and his nightmares become reality again. Serial murder, Norris, roundhouse kicks ... that sounds like a great movie. And some of them are pretty good. The flash scene where a man smashes a tooth-ladder is intense, the scene where the van cascades from the cliff and crushes is amazing - and I learned how to break out of jail with nothing but Chapstick, a gun and a dentist. thread. But there are a lot of mistakes with this movie. One: The editor is a fool. When you do an action or a thrilling movie, you have to keep the energy moving. There are too many scenes that are not essential to the plot in this movie, slowing down and distracting from the overall story. At least 10 minutes could have been cut and stimulation would have improved and the film would have been slightly better. Two: The sound guy is a fool. Someone seems to have tried to make most of this movie in an area where you can't get a decent sound, so most of the dialogs are expressed, killing stereo sound and not mouthing. Music is also too dramatic in some scenes. Three: The casting director is a fool. As a psychiatrist, they took Billy Drag. Billy Drago is a great cult actor (from Brisco County, Hills Have Eyes and more) and would make a proper serial killer or some villain. His character is so vanilla that Drago skills are unnecessary. Four: The writer is moron. Two shots are in this movie - serial killer hunting and romance between Norris and his pregnant girlfriend. Every time I saw the woman on the screen, I wanted to pull my eyes. And indeed, she never came to another plot to make her story totally useless. <br /> <br /> Will I ever watch it? Maybe. But if you don't delete this movie at least a dozen times, you should never. Not recommended.
