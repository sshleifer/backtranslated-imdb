Well, I'm watching a lot of movies and this really sucks ... BIG TIME. I'm sure we're all sick and tired of the low budget trick to make Vampire movies using some "martial arts teacher" again "actor" type movies. I am also so tired of knowing some form of combat technique and then being able to fight somewhat boring film on my way. I forced myself to look at it, and one of the main reasons was that the leading actress was pretty pretty (Ha-Ha). Well I hope it helped a bit and if you have time and want to give Braine a rest Watch it !!! Hopefully one day this type of movie will not be released, but then hey, where all the low-budget actors will play :-) <br /> <br /> The movie also contains many bloops, but I'll leave you to find it because quite a bit of fun while watching and also if you are a little perfectionist it will bother you ;-) Cheers!
