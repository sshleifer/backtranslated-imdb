They laugh. Clich√©d. Overdose in style to compensate for bad writing. Remember when MTV actually used to broadcast music videos and other shows besides Real Estate? Aeon Flux (2005) is based on one such exhibition? a cartoon from the mid-1990s? featuring a superhuman female protagonist in black latex clothes. Aeon, who plays beautiful Charlize Theron in this adaptation, is a cold, secluded rebel who is as dexterous as a dancer and as deadly as a viper snake. She must be if she expects to kick the donkeys of totalitarian government. I like science fiction, but I hate the sudden influx of half-entered futuristic dystopian technologies overdosed on movies like The Island (2005) and Balance (2002) (the bottom of the pile). Aeon Flux has all the problems that are present in these films, but intensified. That is, there is nothing original to show and compensate it with the elegant style that Matrix (1999) has catalysed. Special effects are therefore sensational in Aeon Flux, which earns a few points, but scratches the surface and there is nothing there. To make matters worse, all the performances in this movie are cruel and some really hurt me to watch. Charlize Theron Aeon Flux is interwoven with the tastiest hard chicken and it seems director Karyn Kusama can't decide where to go with her next? should she separate it more or more emotionally? She does not know! Let's go in both directions! Imagine taking a shotgun, loading it with a full-fledged evolution of characters of different kinds, and burning it into a random mess. This is the character of Aeon Flux. Aeon Flux presents all "mandatory" ideas in dystopian society - individual vs. society, nature vs. science, emotions vs. cool reason, etc. You have seen it all before and you have done it better. Go read Orwell, Bradbury or Huxley, or even watch Logan's Run (1976) or Blade Runner (1982) ... anything! Avoid this sinister ill-fried cheese-fest as long as you can. <br /> <br /> 3/10
