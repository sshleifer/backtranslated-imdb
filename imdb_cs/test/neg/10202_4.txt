... in search of the sweetest movie "so bad it's good" I repeatedly laughed for the first fifteen minutes of different movies just to be disappointed and bored at the end. This time not !!! My eyes tore, my stomach and cheeks hurt when I laughed all the way through the movie. Sure, Hulk Hogan is a subpar actor and the plot is absolutely predictable, but they all immerse themselves in this movie knowing all this - all who want to see it when they rent it is Hogan, who pulls out a can of fright, with a bunch of "YEAH BROTHER "sa" WHATCHUGONNADO "flies out of his incredibly goose bumps. And while the Hulkster on the screen fades in comparison to the Hulkster in the ring, the final cheese seekers will certainly not be disappointed with this backhand gem. The laughter of rebellion.
