A group of friends discovered gold deep inside an old mine. But when we take gold and think they hit it, they woke up to a dead miner who is in hell Bent to protect his treasure. "Miner's Massacre" is a chintzy b-horror movie in the extreme. You have all your familiar clichés, your group of intellectually handicapped teenagers, the characters who go on their own to explore strange noises, a pair of pop-scares, a mysterious sheriff, an old lady that everyone thinks is nuts. -Bill Karen Black not less), and so on. However, it is done in a fun, non-pretentious fashion that makes the movie mindlessly fun in "so bad, it's a good" way. Characters and dialogues are what you would expect from this type of film - known, routine, and unoriginal. However, all the actors do a decent job of considering that I saw movies with a bigger budget of their kind with worse acting (I know what you did last summer, anyone?) And add some credibility to the movie itself. The thief in this movie (49´er) is apparently derived from the lilac of Jeepers Creepers, to brown coat, hat and long white hair. Just like a creeper that he never talks about, it hurts. Gore is in my opinion somewhat disappointed. There are a couple of pretty horrible moments, but too much is off screen and death scenes are often laughter (Spoiler forward!). There is one really hilarious moment when the girl gets dekapitated by the aforementioned villain, and to achieve this 'effect', the filmmakers hid the actress's body under the thief's coat, with her head sticking out, and giving some fake blood to her neck. Seriously, you can see the outline of her shoulders! I think they could do a little better there, even if the budget was low (and I'm sure it was, but still?). Special effects are inexpensive but effective enough and for the most part slightly well done for low budget film. Apparently, either the effects of the guys or the director have a thing for explosions and fire. Nearly every scene at the end of the movie has at least a few characters that are burned to death (always in slow motion) or SOMETHING, whether it's a car or an old mine cave. Seriously, no one has ever heard the term; "Stop, Drop and Roll"!?!?!? "Miner's Massacre" (Or "The Curse of a Forty-Year-old" You Want to Call Him) is cheesy and stupid, though entertaining, and if you don't expect it through the roof, you'll be amusing enough. I feel generous so I give him 4/10.
