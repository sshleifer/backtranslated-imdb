Nothing special to see here, the animation is outdated and the plot is a typical futuristic era. This film has an original story, but if it doesn't have an original storyline or character, in my opinion it's not worth seeing. I'm not saying the movie was bad, it was just a typical anime story and I thought I was watching this movie like a thousand times. So if you are looking for something original, look at another thing.
