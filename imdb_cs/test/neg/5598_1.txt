This was done in 2004 for the gods of interest, what happened to our state-of-the-art special effect? What happened to our rough edges, but still good actors? The actors in this movie were incredibly awful, there was one or two that weren't bad, but the rest, biggg thumb down. I couldn't listen to a badly written dialogue, I mean, who the hell did he write that script? Please never write again! Special effects? Don't get me special effects. Surely they could come up with better than completely false-looking green balls of light in the eye wells. It looks so old and honest. Even the simplest thing to look real ... teeth looked so fake and stupid that I almost wiped a tear out of my eyes in annoyance. Come in, I can't believe it was shown to the public.
