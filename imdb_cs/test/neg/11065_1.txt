There seems to be some money behind this film, but it would be impossible to imagine a film that would be poorly planned and executed if I actually started watching it. First in a cave with characters (the usual young adult stereotypes we've encountered in horror movies since the early 1980s), the film is shot almost close up. Since the actors wear a light helmet, it means that everything we see is glaring lights alternating with total darkness - we never see what the characters see; so when they shout "Look there!" we are left to ask "What?! Where?!". In the end, the film has a nauseous, confusing effect of stroboscopic light that makes no sense until we reach the end. And I won't tell you what "end" means - but you'll know it if you've ever seen the old early sixties when Arch Hall laughed at "Eegah!" with Richard Kiel. But what kind of fool would he ever want to make variations on a theme like "Eegah!", remembered for a long time as one of the worst movies ever made? But here we go, people. Aside from that, unlike "Eegah!", "The Cavern" is no one thought of goofy fun. It's unnoticeable. (I ran it at x2 normal speed just to make it, hoping I could actually see something through the end of the movie, but when I did it was just stupid.) This movie gave me one satisfying moment; because it cost only a few bucks when I got it from a DVD player, I could break it with my own hands - relief!
