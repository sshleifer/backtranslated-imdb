This music is totally out of focus with the film that appears now, and then, as the Wagner bombast and Lone Ranger rush, they don't exist otherwise. Negotiations outside these two principles do not exist. It would be a great student film. Russian soldiers are just models that try to act. The constant interruption of the work with explosive camera angles and black and white clips of people was quite unpleasant, but that is just a personal feeling. The story of the story is not worse than others, in fact, it is not worse than most others, completely ignoring logic and reason and reality. At least nobody went in front of the machine gun for three minutes without being hit. Three top bad guys were camping.
