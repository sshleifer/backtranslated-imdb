A challenging riddle, updating Herman Melville (!), About a young man's vague incestuous relationship with his aristocratic mother who was brought to his long-lost sister who was raised by the Roma. Or something like that ?? not that anyone really cares about deciphering his multi-layered plot engraved with pornographic sexual scenes, pseudo-symbolic images (siblings who float in the river of the blood) and other bizarre touches (the Gypsy child repeatedly offends the passers-by on the street until it is beaten to death, deafening rock band music used to demolish old buildings). With regard to the source material and the presence of Catherine Deneuve (who at least bathed in naked), I expected much more from this; is there a longer TV version of POLA X?
