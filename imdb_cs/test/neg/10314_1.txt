The DVD release of this film hopes to buy this movie in the name and face of Sandra Bullock. Her picture (from years after this movie) is basically a cover ... and a back cover ... and an inner cover ... the same image. Its name is clearly displayed on the front cover, all 4 edges and the disc itself. It's a first name in the star list. Her resume is printed inside the case. This movie has to rotate around her character, right? POORLY! It is her first film and plays a smaller role. After watching a movie, each role appears to be a minor role. The character of the dog actually shows a certain personality. Less than an hour after I watched him, I don't even remember the names of many characters. Maybe if I watched it a few more times, I could actually find the plot, but I don't think it would be worth the effort. Oh, wait, I just remembered a funny piece! Shoot-em-up video games fans get a kick from "Doom-cam". Looks like the first shooter. Hands and gun pointing in front of camera. I'm not generally a person who is critical of movies, but it can be the worst movie I've ever seen. I expected to see some silhouettes on the screen, sit down and make fun of it. I'm just glad the money we used for it went to charity.
