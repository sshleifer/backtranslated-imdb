What might be some haunted material would be an incomprehensible, nutty movie that probably even the filmmakers probably didn't understand. If they showed more Satanic ritual or whatever, it could be more creepy, but as it now stands, it's a waste of time and brain cells. Is anyone else sick of the whole "little child drawing spooky pictures with a crayon" thing? Could there be a bigger horror clich√©? Probably not. I know, I know, it's from some other country, and it's too sophisticated and sophisticated to understand, so I shouldn't expect a "conspiracy" to feed me with a spoon, blah, blah, blah. It does not matter. I'm still saying the movie is blowing.
