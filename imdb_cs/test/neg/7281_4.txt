I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie. I don't think I've ever seen a film half as boring as this confident piece of waste. It would probably be better if the director did not spend most of the film that would represent his own work of art, which is not so remarkable. The next thing I didn't like is when a figure burst into her face and a gallon of blood wears off soon after. I don't know how people bleed there in Japan, but I hope they have a lot of blood donors.
