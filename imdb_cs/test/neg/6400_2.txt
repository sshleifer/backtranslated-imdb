It takes place on Fire Island in the 1970s. A couple of Peter (Craig Dudley) and Buddy (J. Will Deane) throw in their home on July 4th. Unfortunately, their relationship is falling apart and they have to prepare for a house full of very strange guests. The rest of the film records the party and what happens between Peter and Buddy. OK - I'm gay, but when I did, I was 8 years old. If it's a real look at what was gay life in the 70s, I'm glad I wasn't around. From mysterious introductory credits that show that children play in the sand, this film slowly goes into disaster. There's a guru (Robert Case) who talks about zero meaning. I wanted a guy guy half in his first LONG speech. There's a young guy, Danny, who's there for the first time. There's a lesbian couple (who doesn't do anything - except one tape for no reason). There's a leather queen. Worst of all is a womanish man named Jimmy (Jimmy Foster). We introduce him and his friend (whose name I never got) when they get a flat tire. They basically scream and scrape for 10 minutes and have no idea how to fix the apartment. I know some people find it funny, but I found it offensive and quite sad. The party itself is full of people you would never want to know. It's like being fired at a party full of bad actors playing unpleasant people. No one can act with the sole exception of Dudley. This can be valuable as a portrait of what Fire Island was like in the 1970s ... but it's a pretty boring display. This gets 2 just for the frequent male nudity of some very nice bodies.
