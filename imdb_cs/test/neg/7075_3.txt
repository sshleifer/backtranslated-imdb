I saw this movie and I love horror movies. <br /> <br /> I didn't know what to expect, but once the movie was on the road, it was nice to watch it. The idea was pretty original and the acting was nice. Especially Jenna Dewan as exciting / evil Tamara. The worst thing about horror movies is to make a good end. But there the film failed. For a change, the end of the hospital scene, where all the employees are gone. First you see the doctors and nurses running around, but then everyone went home? No scream for help while being chased by Tamara, escape to the roof (also a smart move ... no) and off Of course there is an open end. No .... the movie started out great, the main part was nice to watch, but in fact it all messed up with all the clichés of bad horror movies. Jeffrey Reddick failed to see this movie after having done some really good movies like Final Destination 1 and 2. <br /> <br /> If you like a horror movie full of clichés, Tamara is a good movie you can watch. I like movies that surprise me.
