I was very interested in this film despite the article I read about the director in Tattler. I do not condemn movies according to what the director may or may not do. This feature debut was very hard to follow. I have found that split screens are a distraction to the drama in the film, some of the supporting characters gave bad performances, and the film was a copy of several other movies I saw. There was really nothing fresh about it
