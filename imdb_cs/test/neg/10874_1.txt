Because that's what Hell Ride is. Larry Bishop and Tarantino's Weinstein money party with the promise to ever deliver a movie. I'm all for a fake boobage and booze just like another guy, but did we really need the movie? There's really nothing worse than the warmed-up remnants of the old trend. And I'm not even talking about the 70's grindhouse cinema, because Hell Ride has none of the raw and unpolished feelings of an era to pay tribute to. No, this is smooth and shiny MTV Hollywood through. The old trend I'm talking about is the confident pseudo-hip-bizarre film world where Tarantino meets Guy Ritchie and Robert Rodriguez. All three boys were at least talented and for some reason they found success. Hell Ride is just a secondary copy, fickle and uninspired, polished to the max when it should be raw, a "supercool" aspect of distress and stupid. There is no reason why such a simple and totally missing story must be narrated in convoluted, backward and time fashion. It's just a post-Tarantino joke. There is no reason why dialogues should be so insensitive that people waving their gums when they say NIC: at least when Travolta talked about Pulp Fiction cheeseburgers, she felt fresh. The dialogues here represent a little more than the pseudo-macho posture. There is also no reason why a rock'n'roll guitar has to aimlessly tangle the entire film. Perhaps the lowest hits of Hell Ride are when trying to be quasi-existential. In the desert there is a cheerful scene of dreams / illusions where Bishop dreams of peyot and sees colors. I was half-awaited old Indian to come out and offer wisdom nuggets. The only savage thing of this abysmal grass is the boobage and the monologue of Vinnie Jones about the tattoo of his wings (and perhaps some outer desert deserts). Lots of boobage and hot terribly clad babes. Now it's something I can do, but a movie they don't. Everything else is just an empty shell, imitating other, infinitely talented imitators.
