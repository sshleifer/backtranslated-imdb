Except for the fine stand on Clara Evans ... the show was pretty bad ... so why did I watch it? Too much coffee and she had to rest before she hit the bag. As I watched BB change into his most sacred Big Chief jersey, it was fun at best, laughter in the worst case. <br /> <br /> I could have done better Skeltor and special effects on my Dell. Boxlietner saw better days, this guy is a year younger than me, and looks more and more like Scarecrow from his TV series in the early 1980s. Women have to return to acting school, though Evans size 40 and play 17 years old (she's in her early 20s was a stretch) .... The Sci-Fi channel did better that this ... but for us people who don't get out to bars much more, I think we have to take what we can get ... after all you get away form CNN, MSNBC and Fox coverage election 2008 this day is a good thing.
