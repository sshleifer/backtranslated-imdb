I'm sitting here to write this review and the movie is not over yet. In fact, I just checked it and it's still 45 minutes. But no matter what, there's no need to see it to the end. I will just write this review and laugh as the movie plays in the background and encounters some sort of horrible conclusion that I don't care when I see or know. <br /> <br /> As for my hostility to this movie? Characters are not believable. The story is not believable. The neatness of the film is scary. Basically, every film element sounds false. Obviously Buscemi thought he had something to do with dozens of films that had already explored the worn out motives of dysfunctional families and the apparent nonsense of life. However, Buscemi was wrong because this film contains nothing new. It is very difficult to be depressed, but fortunately no one can be depressed because it is clear that there are no people like this in the world. What is depressing, however, is the knowledge that somehow this film has been chosen by several undeserved prizes. Disgusting!!!! Bottom line: stay away from this worthless movie at all costs.
