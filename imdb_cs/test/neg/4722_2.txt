Argentine horror director Emilio Vierya directs the screenplay by Jack Curtis and Antonio Ross. Cheesy and ridiculous are mixed for the method to crazy. The Doctor's son is approaching his early death until his desperate father transforms the heart of a monkey into his chest. As expected, things get strange; when this young man turns into a mask that wears a monster and wanders around the beaches, they look for pretty looking girls to make slaves. When heroin is injected, its beauty becomes zombies. The monster summons his dazed minions with a strange organ music. So bad ... well ... it's bad. Cast: Jose E. Moreno, Alberto Caneau, Mauricio De Ferraris, Gloria Prat and Gina Moret.
