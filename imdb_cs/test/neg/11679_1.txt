This film is said to be about three young idealistic people, two of whom join the Naxalite movement and the blah blah. It's really just another movie about some beautiful, rich people trying to decide who should be next to each other. peasants and naxalites and political struggles of the era only serve as a picturesque background. Literally, because we don't hear villagers say a word, it doesn't matter that they learn someone's name, so they take the same "role" as "natives" in old Hollywood movies. The film is also boring, and the story doesn't really get us anywhere else - except for the different bedrooms. Obviously, we should admire the art of everything that doesn't mean any good song and dance routine, which of course wouldn't save the movie, but could at least ease boredom. <br /> <br /> My friend Japna was upset about the immorality of the story, not the bedroom, but the whole nonsense of the story. The message does not seem worth promoting.
