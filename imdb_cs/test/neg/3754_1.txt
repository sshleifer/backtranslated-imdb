Full Disclosure: I was born in 1967. At first I was preoccupied with a premise - after all, if you were a teenager growing up in the age of Reagan, the journey to memory was to laugh or three. Pop Rocks, Atari and Rock 'em Sock' em Robots? They loved them, not * despite being cracked, but * because they were punchy and stupid and amusing. But when VH1 decided to do the "I Love Last Tuesday" series, I knew enough. Going Hal Sparks have nothing better than reading from telepromptera, how idiotic Slinkys are? (Wait, let me check ... hmmm, no. No, it seems not.) Snarks, snotty uber-hip position has its place, but enough!
