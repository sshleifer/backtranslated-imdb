I like movies in this genre. Beautiful girls, toilet humor, gratuitous nudity. So why didn't I like the movie? No movie like this should add even the slightest confusion to the conspiracy. Who's who, where the money is, it's not SE7EN, just laughing at me. Maybe it's me, but I've never felt it frustrated watching American Pie movies or other more modern National Lampoon movies. This film has no flow that keeps me smiling and waits for the next. Instead, I stopped thinking, "Why did they keep the scene?" I do not recommend this movie. If you expect Van Wilder, think again. The only fun I watched this movie was to guess what movies the actors were when they were kids. 2/10 velkoryse.
