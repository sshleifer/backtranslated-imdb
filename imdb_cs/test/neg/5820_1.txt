Thank God it wasn't restored by ITV. This series, while popular (God knows why) has a very simple - 'Look I found another body for flowers / shrubs / trees / anywhere they work - already the sixteenth, which is a conspiracy of this series. The dialogue is so simple that it is written for children - it talks to the viewer and explains every point of the plot. It just happens when someone makes something ordinary - and nobody notices it. Every time they look at someone's murder and investigate it, everyone else gets in the way - they're going to burn everyone's lives - including those who are totally innocent. They break up and enter people's homes, steal objects and evidence (even firearms) that are curious and get into people's lives, spying on them and going through their belongings. They never apologize, they can never be caught or arrested (and if they do, they can talk out of it, although another character who does the same thing gets in jail !!!). <br /> <br /> Always come trumps. Now I know this is an easy series, but I think it shouldn't be realistic for the first few episodes! To put it simply, it's unrealistic. I think they have found enough bodies on the continent in the undergrowth (where they are every other week), so I hope they never come back. br /> <br /> ITV should get some action on the screen instead of all the humdrum - 'somebody was murdered at the village fair - again' the type series.
