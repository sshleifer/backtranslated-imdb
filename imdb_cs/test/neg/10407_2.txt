Louis Gossett Jr returns to the well once again, while Chappy Sinclair, who goes to Doug Masters (played by Jason Cadieux, who is for Jason Gedrick who wisely refused), teaches a new group of recruits, but this time they find spoiled air force pilots who are toxic to waste. This is a series that is getting worse with every other entry, however it has no zip or even action to make it still worth seeing on the cable. Iron Eagle IV is directed with such indifference that matches look like we are watching a playstation 2 game played by two lobotomized teenagers. It's horrible to watch, and Gossett Jr, who has made his share of turkeys, seems down here. And I saw Cover-Up, Firewalker, Aces: Iron Eagle III, Toy Soldiers and Jaws 3D. What is mysterious about Louis Gossett Jr is that he seems like Christopher Walken in his quest to do anything as long as he works. How do I watch his Oscar post win. His better films include Iron Eagle, The Punisher and The Principal. Considering that these two films play it together with Dolph Lundgren and James Belushi, there is really something to say that the three gratifying actions are running for his better work. Of course Enemy Mine and Diggstown remain his best post-Oscar win job. <br /> <br /> * of 4- (bad)
