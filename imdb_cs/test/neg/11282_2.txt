I come from a few movie screenings and this movie has become one of those I can't stand to watch. In terms of the awards she has received, those that award Turkish festivals are not, in my opinion, credible. My only explanation for the Queens festival award was that I think some comedy layer was "acquired in translation" because the subtitles helped distract from terrible performances. At the beginning of the screening I attended the presenter briefly talked about the history of Turkish cinema and mentioned in one place that early Turkish cinema was appropriately named "scenic cinematography" because many of the creators and actors were people from the theater scene . Ironically, this film falls directly into this category. English speakers who read the headlines may think that Turkish is a naturally loud language and attributes it to everyone screaming in the movie. It could be ascribed to the amateur nature of all actors, but the main source of "yelled-out-dialogue" is the main character, played by the only professional actor in the film. No wonder his background is in the theater. My guess is that in response to his loud line delivery, all the other amateur actors have raised their voices the same way, and therefore turned the film into a series of unnatural performances. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this all, a snail-paced story gets a very boring movie. I must say that I also have a personal problem with Turkish films that capture a completely rural life with shallow uneducated characters. Since the "Zugurt Aga", one of the best Turkish films he has ever made, Turkish filmmakers seem to be unable to avoid the attractiveness of the country. This is only interesting in small batches and if it is so beautifully arranged with excellent writing and direction as in the Zugurt Aga. Most often, however, it is extremely boring and frankly somewhat embarrassing for the native "urban" Turks. Rural communities form a neglected, deceived part of the country, and while it provides good material for comedy, it is a huge cost to the Turkish imagination. Western audience, whose only display is Turkey, this film undoubtedly assumes that Turkey is like Afghanistan. I wish the creators to realize this and let go of their passion for "rural man" stories and remain faithful to most of the country that lives in cities that shamefully cause metropolitan areas in Europe.
