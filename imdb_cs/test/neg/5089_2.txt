wow, i'm just one watching it. <br /> <br /> As CRAPPY post production is on this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not a kid, I literally could do a better job myself. <br /> <br /> All postproduction is wrong, all of it. Whoever cut this film should be banned from the film industry. This script was, among other things, a wreck. absolute waste. Don't mention Jack Bauer and his Patchy Pirate in Spongebob accent. WTF makes his character there? But for me the biggest mistake of all was the development of characters, interference, dynamics, dialogue. WOW. I can't believe how bad it was. I gave this movie 2 out of 10. 1 for Samantha, which is a great actress, too bad to make everyone look like an amateur. next one goes to cinematography, which was really good. Otherwise, my friend, that's one bad movie. Even feeling like making a complicated post on it, it was just a terrible production. Poor actors, they didn't know what they got into ...
