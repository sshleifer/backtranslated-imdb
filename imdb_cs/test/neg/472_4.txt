The Screaming Man is a story of greed, betrayal and revenge in a small Bulgarian town. William Cole, a wealthy industrialist, ends up with a part of his brain replaced by the Russian taxi driver Yegor. They couldn't both be different, but they shared one thing - they were both killed by the same woman. William and Yegor, returning to the life of a mad scientist, form an unlikely partnership to help them follow their common nemesis. Bruce Campbell returns to the B horror movie genre, which gave him his cult status, this time not just in front of the screen but behind the lens. Unfortunately for this time, laughter doesn't give and Campbell has to resort to what he does best to try to fill the gap in this movie. <br /> <br /> As a Campbell fan with movies, books and action characters, I was hoping to add another hit to my collection. Although, after I saw this movie before buying, I'm glad I don't have the "pleasure" of adding it. The film goes wrong for the first time in a story that seems to be a harmless fun at first glance, but it turns out to be boring, pulling out a dribble. What is sad because Mr. Campbell himself wrote it. The comedy never really hits, it just scratches our heads. Campbell seems to have run out of things that are funny and have resulted in the audience fighting what we've seen before. is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. It brings freshness and fun time when the film really needs it. It helps if you are a fan and follow these shadows from Evil Dead to Xena, which is why I felt compelled to love this movie. Campbell's experience as a director, directing episodes of the Hercules series television. Campbell makes the film well, even with a low budget. At the end, there aren't so many things to do as you might hope, but Campbell fans will stay behind him no matter what, unfortunately for this fan ... I won't.
