This movie made me so angry about his stupidity that I felt the need to create an IMDb account to share with you my opinion. I liked Ashton Kutcher in "a lot like love" and that's why I still wanted to see this movie despite its current 4.2 rating. It is highly overestimated. I believed that the actor (any of them) would consider the scenario and would not agree to participate in such a low-quality production. It's very disappointing. The home sitting theme was much better used in "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo". Things that didn't make sense here: a fist of all, a homeowner leaves his dear pet with someone who knows nothing about his care. Second, the rule is not to leave anyone in the house, but the housekeeper does not follow this simple rule. Doors not locked?! And so on..
