This is a textbook example of how Hollywood did not trust the audience, and pants to its great stars. The Christian character is completely redesigned, the anti-Semitism of Noah's face from his own army unit is virtually ruled out, Michael's story is changing significantly, and the end result is to decimate the power and terrible beauty of the book. I almost wished I didn't see it because the ability of films (sounds and images) to resonate so powerfully in your brain; I'd rather stay with the impression of a book. The book could be written today, it's honest and brave. Movie, neither. My advice: SKIP film; Read the book.
