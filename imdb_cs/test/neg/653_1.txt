Renee Zellweger is brilliant, but the rest of this movie just doesn't work. It's like a hamburger-jello-form salad - an interesting idea, but who ever thought it would actually work on a movie? I like two previous films by LaBute - they were mercilessly honest and funny. This film can be ruthless and frosty - with jumbo dollops cutes. (As a high concept, I think: Doris Day-Rock Hudson Sam Peckinpah may have done - now will lower your expectations to match the current mass-produced Hollywood state.) That actors are talented like Freeman, Kinnear, Eckhart, Vince, and Janney ALMOST to their scenes come alive, a testimony to the immensity of their talents, which rise above material that simply does not bite. At the end of the film, I would find Freeman's insidious, feeling of good speech, which would be funny at the end of the film (lynchean way) if it were not because of the stupid suspicion that this unconvincingly committed moral intention was to be seriously accepted. .
