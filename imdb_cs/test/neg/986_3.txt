The best part in this movie is the first one to be found in Sicily. Crialese shows a good talent for photography and the start of the film is pleasantly surprising. The rest of the story is pretty boring. Crialese insists on stereotypical situations and characters, trying to melt neorealistic designs and video-music techniques, Fellini's surrealistic memories, and a very annoying and totally off-topic soundtrack, leading the whole thing to the end that gives you an overly long story. Honestly, it's a really overrated movie and Crialese is a real overrated director.
