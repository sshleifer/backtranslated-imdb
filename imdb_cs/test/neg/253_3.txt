I watched this movie twice in the past six months (what I have to go through so you don't have to). The first review left me half crazy and crazy. The second viewing at 5 am on a rainy morning was a little better. he just screamed once in agony. Pocona (Aztec's mum) seems to have had some kind of Aztec princess who was "supposed to keep her girlfriend". (Now it's hard!) But before the film tries to kill us with a whistling Aztec ceremony. Singing will bleed your ears. Anyway, there is the usual reincarnation of nonsense. Not to mention the treasure map on the breastplate and bracelet, which is guarded by this veiled ox, Pocon. After that, Pocona looks like he was for 2000, and is deflated by his tomb. a bad case of revenge by Montezuma (or read the script for this movie). This will smell your breath. The evil Dr Von Krupp looks like he wants the Aztec treasure (perhaps to finance acting and scriptwriting lessons) for casting & crewing. cape, hat and something like a ski mask. Guess it's better than Laughing Fat Man. Bat in a typical crazy scientific fashion wants to rule the world. It emphasizes it by casting eyes, laughing maniacally and chewing the scenery. It has a cobbled together invincible robot. It looks like 'bot was made of dustbin, chandelier and grill from 1957 Buick. It will make your eyes bleed.A company even takes credit for not having this can! Well a powerful showdown between Pocona and Robot takes place in the mummy's new crypt that was made homeless earlier. About half of this film is excluded from "La Aztec Momia", which was never released in the US in its original form, but in the chopped cruelty of Jerry Warren (see my review on "Attacking the Maya Mummy" ) and "The Curse of the Aztecs" Mummy ". The robot is honestly stupid, as is most of the characters. If this and the plot does not mean you are screaming with laughter nothing will be. He got one, but after seeing the "Mayan Mummy" (which is a movie that deserves to be burned) and watching "Robot" again, he collects 3. You have to watch it without expectation at all.
