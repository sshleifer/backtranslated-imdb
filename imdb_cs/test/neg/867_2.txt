Mom starts at night in the middle of nowhere, in what looks like a wooden building in the desert. Pick-up truck picking up and angry father chucks his slutty daughter Virginia Monroe (Claudia Christian) out & leaves her there, but she's not alone as shadow figure Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) watches her from a short distance. Virginia is trying to talk, but when she pulls a cigarette, tall thigh, high heel shoes under leopard print, Nestor grabs her throat and pulls her into the dark. Nestor then tears up, turns into a monster and starts eating her guts. Virginia is the last victim of a serial killer who has Lieutenant Carl Hendrix (Art Evans) and LAPD confused, or at least the news that a local television reporter named Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas MIller) tells his audience. Clay lives happily with her pregnant girlfriend Alice (Mary Beth McDonough), and therefore his mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) has a spare room that she decides to rent on the blind blind Nestor sunglasses. Unfortunately, for Emily, Nestor's sunglasses accidentally knock him down, revealing that he has strange colored eyes, then Nestor then turns into a monster and bites Emily to turn her into a body she likes. Nestor takes Emily out to train her, finds suitable homeless people (Rory VanSaint), murders him and eats his intestines, but Emily's son Clay witnesses the whole thing and has to choose between what's right and his love for his mother, who now just happens to be a grotesque bloodsucking and meat-eating monster! Modified, written & directed by Patrick Rand I thought Mom was a pretty horrible movie. Looking at some of the other comments on the IMDb & genre that has been featured, many of them seem to think Mom is a horror of comedy. Now I can tell you that I have not seen any comic elements in my mom at all, because there are none if they are not very fine. All I can assume is that people see the comedy in the real situation that Mum represents, being an old lady turns into a monster that feeds on the body and the predictable problems and emotional anxiety it inflicts on her son who finds out. There are no jokes (besides naming Beverly Hills prostitute (Stella Stevens)), grotesque humor or anything that is remotely funny in the movie itself, and if I saw it playing straight straight for 90 minutes of running. So there's no comedy in mom, must it mean there's a lot of horror? Wrong, Mum sucks and is painfully slow to watch, especially after the first thirty odd minutes of Nestor, who has turned into a monster several times, bit Emily, showing her how to find food and find Clay. Until then, Mum had been moving at a fairly good pace, had some special make-up effects, OK, and I was interested, unfortunately, Mom is running for another hour, which is basically the emotional stupidity that Emily's son suffers, the possible breakdown of his marriage and his marriage. is torn between love for his mother and the fact that he is a monster who feeds on the body. This part of the film is incredibly slow, boring and as boring as washing dishes, though it has nerves to resort to clich√©s when Clay tells her mom to go to her room and stay there to lock the door behind her and tell her away. and put the grid over the window so she couldn't escape her room. Mom's script totally ignores the origin of monsters and asks us to accept just that this thing exists without giving us the only reason we should, no matter what stupid explanation it might be, I think some background for a monster helped. Technically Mom is a bland and inexpensive look, although I can't say it's wrong that it's a very average thing all the way with nothing particularly impressive or anything I can make fun of to pass the time. The special make-up effect on the monster is fine, but their use in very fast flashes, blinks & you'll be missing. Don't be fooled by any fantastic video box like me, the monster's only three times the maximum and all of them are in the first thirty minutes. There is not much gore either, separate arms, some short gut eating, burned body & drill in one's arm is all we get. Acting is fine, but please, Mr. Brion James, what is it that it's a lengthy accent!? At least James had a good sense of knowing he was stupid and reasonably decided to be killed at the start of the procedure, everyone else was expecting the black lieutenants who were also black policemen in the Fright Night (1985), but you can recognize him from Die Hard 2 (1990), did Mom & Die Hard 2 in the same year ?! Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! Overall, there's nothing I can really recommend to Mom as a horror movie and it's definitely not a comedy to me. Very poor, very disappointed and once again entrusted with a fantasy video with many boxes of great looking monsters. Definitely avoid it.
