I know it's hard for you to find European video / DVD movies, especially from the 1980s, but please check out the original version of Spoutloos (1988) - and see why the Hollywood version of Vanishing's screws up bigtime, especially in the final. I really like Sandra Bullock, Kiefer Sutherland and especially Jeff Bridges, but that's so lame compared to the original. What he thinks? Can you imagine Seven with a happy ending when Gwyneth Paltrow happily runs into Brad Pitt's arms in the final? The whole idea that the original was such a great international success was due to the shocking finale. So why do you accept this kind of shake remake? Really, avoid it and GET THE ORIGINAL.
