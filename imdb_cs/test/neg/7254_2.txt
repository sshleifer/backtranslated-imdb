Watching this movie led me to wonder why Universal Universal was like this? They had a great series of movies with all the classic horror movies. The dawn of the atomic age has brought an onslaught of huge films of creation. Spiders, Ants, Praying Mantis. With The Deadly Mantis, we have giant praying mantis flying around the Arctic, scared of eskimos and pursued by armed forces. The beetle reaches a tunnel in New York, where the soldiers will eventually destroy it. Of course, all this is much more traceable when looking at MST. Who thought it was a good idea to start a movie by showing a giant map?
