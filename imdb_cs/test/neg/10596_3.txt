The DVD sleeve explains the assumption: "Three problem teenagers are headed to jail," and "they are ready to make time until Captain Greer offers them an agreement to work for him - secretly." The movie opens with the definitions of the words "Mod" and "Squad", so you won't have to search them in the dictionary. For a visual definition of "Cool", look for photos of the original trio: Michael Cole (like Pete Cochran), Clarence Williams III (as Linc Hayes), and Peggy Lipton (as Julie Barnes). <br /> <br /> One black. One white. One blonde. Once they defined cool. Three who make Scott Silver versions of Aaron Spelling's "Mod Squad" are twentysomethings: Claire Danes (like Julie Barnes), Giovanni Ribisi (as Pete Cochran), and Omar Epps (as Linc Hayes). They are not able to do much with the material. Mr Ribis's depiction is farthest, which means that he is the most distant from the original characterization. Mrs. Danes romance Josh Brolin (as Billy Waites) who seems to be in re-make "Marcus Welby, MD". You will not believe that Mr. Lerner and Epps "Linc" danced. He explains, "I'm not a fairy, I love dancing!" and requirements, "Spin me!" Scott Silver ~ Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi, Omar Epps
