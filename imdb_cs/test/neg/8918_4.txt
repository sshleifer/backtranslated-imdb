I just saw you died today. It's bad, almost very bad. <br /> <br /> 1) Direction and editing are terrible, just awful. Nearly turning off the film, Fauntleroy (director) has no idea what he is doing, he seems to be filming things randomly and some scenes don't make sense at all. I also hate when the same scene is reused in the same movie, in this movie some scenes were used 3 or 4 times. Pretty bad. 2) Dialogue is sometimes good, sometimes horrible. I like the fact that they wanted Seagal's character and Treache character to appear to be in a similar relationship to the characters in Lethal Weapon, but it didn't work simply because some of the dialogs WOULD NOT SENSE, and I speak English very well Well, it's not so that I didn't understand the words, it was the fact that jokes and dialogue lines had no meaning whatsoever. <br /> <br /> 3) The script is pretty bad. Why is she always trying to complicate DTV action movies? Seagal's wife in the movie has psychic abilities, why? Is it useful for the movie? NO. Seagal removes a lot of people working for a guy who betrayed him and knows these people without meeting them in the movie. STUPID. The story sometimes goes off track and jumps back without any reason. The story is sometimes chaotic and absurd. They should have kept it simple and it would work. 4) In some action scenes it's not Seagal, it's his double sensation. You can say it because they just shoot it from the back and never show their face. He also beats boys with film martial art, not true as aikido Steven knows. Stunt double uses kitschy kicks and punches. 5) Steven is good at the movie. 90-95% of the lines are said in their real voice. The rest is dubbing, but it's not that bad. It was good. Steven seems to be enjoying himself in the movie and is more in the action he had in Submergen. He likes Treach as a partner; at least he doesn't like it. It also seems to have been in better shape than some of his recent movies. I hate the fact that she wears clothes to hide her body, but in the same outfit she wears on the DVD case, she looks more than OK and should wear clothes for most of the movie, not the stupid long leather coat. Br /> <br /> I really think Seagal was willing to make a good movie. The fact that he came late and flew early from Fauntleroy's ON TWO MOVIES doesn't seem like a coincidence. I think he realized that the crew was amateurs, or just because they took care of it, and he didn't give it anymore. It could have been damn good in the hands of a better company and crew. action movie for Seagal. Something like Out for Justice or Over the Law. I sincerely believe it. But the people who made the film are not very good at their work or have not had enough money to do the job properly. Too bad because I liked Steven in the movie and Treach was also cool (Ice Cool), but the rest was bad. Hey, at least it gives me hope for Black Dawn and Shadows of the Past. I think the mercenary could be just as badly processed. But hey, Steven seemed to return to the same mood he was while making his better movies and at least that's why he was watching the movie. I liked it, but it could be SO much better. 4/10
