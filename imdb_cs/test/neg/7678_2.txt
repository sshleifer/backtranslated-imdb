This movie is sometimes scary, maybe not like when naked George Kennedy tells his girlfriend that he wants a little more sugar. Fortunately, his nudity is covered with a blanket, but the picture is even more frightening than anything you might find in Schindler's list. The dialogue in this film was inspiring; it inspired me to watch another movie. In one scene, when an air hostess comments on male pilots, Kennedy asks, "Why do you think it's called" cock "? Charming. very, very bad.
