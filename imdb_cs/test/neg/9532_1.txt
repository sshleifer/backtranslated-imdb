This is one of those films that would like to tell you a lot about women, the universe, about a better life, about the terrible loneliness of a brilliant Manhattan architect who has all the connections with everyone, including his three-year-old - who may seem irresponsible to some - In fact, the hero wins his hands down in terms of selfishness and the scene with his old school friend, who starts out as some good old-time conversation and ends up on a threatening note is an oasis in the desert movie. The scene with the-the-father-who-left-home-when -I-was-child was told and said and TOLD.Of of course it did not prevent the offspring in his way And when you see the attitude of the female hero, you might think she never heard of a woman's lean. Best of all is the soundtrack, which includes excellent songs by Willie Nelson, Tom Waits or Bonnie Raitt. ... But you can enjoy them without this boring job.
