Sex is the most striking aspect of existence. It is probably the most interesting activity between birth and death. LE DECLIN DE L'EMPIRE AMERICAIN studies human sexuality in a dry and boring way. In fact, worse than just being boring, seeing a naked 40-year-old is, well, uncomfortable. I think there is some shock value that adults are so old as our parents talk about sex, but after Twenty Minutes, it stops being interesting. Perhaps if the characters were 20 years younger, the film would be more visually captivating. LE DECLIN DE L'EMPIRE AMERICAIN has no time.
