And also a wonderful start, a real quick start. It keeps you longing and waits for it to come. Unfortunately, high adrenaline dries quickly, but it's definitely over after half of the movie. And it's a shame because this movie has really good ideas and many of them will be thoroughly explored. But this is also one of the mistakes. By examining too many things, it is mixed into many things, so at the end you are too confused to follow some plot or characters. It's very dark and moody, but it doesn't help much if it's also a genre of hopping, just to try to fit into all - and everything in its story!
