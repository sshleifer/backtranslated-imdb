I do not often write reviews here, but I cannot stand up and let other people suffer through this film without at least trying to warn them. This movie is terrible and it's not because "I don't know what the director was trying to say" or "I'm too stupid to understand the plot"; This movie is terrible because of the wrong direction, typing on the screen and playing. This is the "trifecta" of bad movement and the reason why the movie was right on the video. They are trying to be something like "high voltage", "Hostel" and "TCSM" with the abolition of some of these ideas, but it just doesn't work. I had no great expectations, nor did the middle who entered the film, but I was still very disappointed. It had the potential to be very good with nice settings and a good idea for a movie, but it was unnecessary.
