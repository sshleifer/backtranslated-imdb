Eric Idle, Robbie Coltraine, Janet Suzman - it was almost impossible to go wrong. Of course he has some funny moments - a scene in the showers when Robbie Coltraine reflects the horrible werewolf line Lon Chaney Jr "I can't help" is cheerful. But in the end, the storyline and direction are flat as a pancake and as tired as a 90-year-old nun of 180 "Hail Mary". When I was a kid, Carry On movies filled this niche a little better, which is a really sad film accusation with such a promising cast.
