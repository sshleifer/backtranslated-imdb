A marching around 14-year-old girl in a tango swimsuit is one of them. For fans of this movie, I would like to ask: would you allow your daughter to go around such a resort? And would your 14-year-old be able to handle the reaction he gets from the men? If so, I'd like to know why, on both counts. Such a suit is a clear challenge for men; It is hypocritical to suggest that it is not. And elsewhere, what would a teenage girl ever say that her father was her lover, without excuse for serious mental problems? That's almost as disgusting as a swimsuit. Simply put, some things aren't just funny or appropriate and they will never be.
