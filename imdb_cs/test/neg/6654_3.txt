Well, the plot is fun, but it's full of stupidity. To sum up things up, a cop / dad poorly wants to save his son from cancer, but the only way to get a transplant from a criminal (Michael Keaton). Well criminal agrees BUT escaped in the hospital while Transplantation continued and the police and police dad were not allowed to fire at the criminals to save their son. (dead criminal - no son dead transplant). Well, the police don't have a brain in this movie if they never heard of TAZER killing a criminal without killing him. The end of the movie, as simple as that. But when it all crazy and stupid, including 2cops death and a couple doctor getting burned pretty badly.
