"Shadows and Fog" is certainly one of Woody Allen's weakest films, right there with "September" and "Hollywood End" (although Allen didn't do the same thing as "Anything Else"). "Shadows and Fog" is Allen's tribute to the German expressionist style of filmmaking, omnipotent and stylized light and shadow, and ... you guessed ... ... a lot of fog. But you can say that Allen was trapped in technology and parody, and he forgot to shoot a movie that someone would care for. Fortunately, he did "Husbands and Wives" in the same year, so things weren't for him. <br /> <br /> Stage: D
