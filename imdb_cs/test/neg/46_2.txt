Acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in "screaming teen" cliché horror with more thriller-like stimulation. In some ways, Acolytes is very successful, but in many other ways the film fails miserably. Overall, Acolytes avoided the typical archetypes of the naivety and innocence of youth endless horror movies, such as the Cabin Fever, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and countless other films where unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers have sex, screaming and one by one they are detached from a monster. Instead, this innocence is replaced by pride, retribution, and arrogance. The characters had several opportunities to save themselves from immanent death and despair, but they did not do so because of their own personal demons. In the end, you were left with the feeling that there were (and perhaps not any) innocent victims. <br /> <br /> As the title suggests, the film also touches on following the leader or authority. This was used in a direct sense if the main character would become a serial killer and was also used less directly throughout the film. Watching the central character is a reoccurring theme throughout the movie. Despite all this, filmmakers have also incorporated a lot of clichés that I suspect was deliberate and gave the film a unique blend of depth as well as the shallowness that I found interesting. This, perhaps unintentionally, plays well with the characters that are, at the first appearance very shallow but as the story develops it becomes obvious that they are, at least two major male characters, quite complex. <br /> <br /> But technically, the film has a lot of problems. Cinematography, which is typically considered high, is considered rather sophisticated and overly stylized, using Formula 2/3 approaches too strictly. Many of the transitions I felt were also too stylized. The use of symbolism was not only vague, but also considerably over used. The plot was poorly planned and relied solely on misinformation to achieve a more hockey twist that was poorly resolved and left the audience. confused. The methods used to solve the climax are cheap and poorly prepared, the motivations are routinely unclear and the main points of the plot remain untied. Overall, the relative originality of the film, the themes and the work are lost in a maze of poor technical design, overly stylized images, vague motifs, blunt and unnecessary symbolism, and inexpensive twists maintained only by lack of or completely incorrect information. <br /> <br /> If the film was better done, it would be excellent. But in my opinion, Acolytes only gets two stars.
