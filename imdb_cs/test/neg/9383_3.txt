When Jan Svankmajer leaves his imagination free, get ready. You are in dark, appalling movies like "Alice" and "Little Otik", or short gems like "Down to the Cellar" and "Jabberwocky". These are all excellent films that, at best, represent disturbing, surrealistic filmmaking. On the other hand, when Svankmajer tries to make a political statement of any kind, he recommends to leave in a hurry. Svankmajer's films in this vein tend to be both adolescent and preaching, and they repeatedly present straw cartoons to express their pseudo-brilliant insights. "Lunacy", unfortunately, is this second type. film. Cartoonish ideas and characters are stretched paper-thin for scary two hours. There are a few moments that are briefly interested, but the few oases are separated by the vast desert of boredom. <br /> <br /> If you found Svankmajer's horrible, monotonous short film "Et Cetera" brilliant and cheerful, you'll probably love "Lunacy." If you've never seen Svankmajer before, please start elsewhere.
