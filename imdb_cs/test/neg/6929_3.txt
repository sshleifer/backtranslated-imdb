I loved the book "Little Princess" for most of my life, and I was very excited that there was a movie. But I was horrified by this adaptation. Not only is the acting wooden, and the conspiracy of convoluted mish mash different incidents in the book, but the topic is all wrong. The real theme of the story should be that a girl can only be a princess when she acts like one because Sara does when her 5 of her 6 buns give her a beggar, even if he's hungry. The theme of the film seems to be that all the girls are princesses who are making cheaper things to Sara and that it should be written on the Hallmark card than on this story. There are many other things wrong with this movie - too much on the list, but here are just a few of the bigger ones: This story should be set in the British in the mid 1800s, not America during the First World War. Miss Minchen is tough for Sara from the beginning and does her actions when Sara is left with no money much less surprising than she would be if she was as sweet as she should be at the beginning of the syrup. Nowhere is it reported that Becky is black. Sarah's father is not coming back, he's dead. He is his closest friend and co-worker in diamond mines, who will find Sarah and restore it to its place. In fact, diamond mines are not mentioned at all, even though they are the source of Sara's wealth. Through all that Sara has faced, she always acts like a princess, gives what she can, and forgives those who have hurt her. She would never call Lavinia as a "crazy pair". Such a thing is completely out of character for it and undermines the whole philosophy that it should behave well no matter what it is. This is by far the worst screen adaptation I've ever seen (with remarkable exceptions of "Ella Enchanted" and "Anne Green Gables the Continuing Story"). why the director felt it necessary. be changed to be interesting. I suggest that anyone who wants to know this story should follow the 1987 version, which is much better. Or better yet, read the book. This will be more worth your time than an hour and a half unnecessarily on this version in the movie.
