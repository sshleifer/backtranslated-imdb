Don't see this movie! It's ... repulsive! The start is really very good, but on Wednesday everything is falling and I really regret spending 80 crowns (about $ 11) on the ticket! Peter Dalle should consider it his last chance to win people's interest. Great picture! The only clear place is the beautiful work of Robert Gustavsson, Lena Nyman and GÃ¶sta Ekman. <br /> <br /> I hope you take my advice ... The image is waste.
