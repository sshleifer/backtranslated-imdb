Time travel is theoretical, so I can give the scenario some space. <br /> <br /> I also understand the concept that by changing one variable, you can potentially change the way that history has broken down. But I can't understand how the change has evolved over time. We are exposed to a series of "time waves" that gradually retrograde planetary evolution. While this is a convenient rendering device because it allows our heroes enough time to solve the problem, it doesn't make any sense at all. If you change the variable and this variable has changed significantly, or even completely, the planetary evolution, then at the time you come back to the future, the evolutionary process has already been established and no waves are needed. ? After all, why should a change that happened 65 million years ago wait for it to be effective? The fact that a moth has been projected forward in time can give it some credibility, but the life of this moth 65 million years ago has been substantially changed, so any change in evolutionary history would begin, and not depend on the return of Our present time. <br /> <br /> To solve the problem, the team will return in time to avoid changing the variable from any time. With this success we see that changes in evolution have never happened and that nobody even remembers events! What work for the solution should certainly work for the original change? I like the good rolling sci fi adventure, but if it's not set "in the galaxy far", it must have at least some grounding in the theoretical option to make it really fun. Good premise, bad conspiracy, sensible playing and, in all justice, just a twist on Jurassic Park. <br /> <br /> Not on my "watch list" again.
