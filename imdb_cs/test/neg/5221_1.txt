Normally I don't like Chuck Norris movies. I appreciate his work as a martial artist and his combat scenes are usually quite well choreographic. Chuck is undoubtedly one of the great martial artists. I found a movie in my local bookstore that I haven't seen before and took it home. While playing in this movie was worse than most Chuch Norris movies, I was hoping to see at least one battle scene. I quickly began to realize that this was not a typical Chuch Norris movie; rather, it was a Christian film intended to illustrate the "good will prevails" paradigm. There is nothing on the cover that suggests it is a Christian film, except for the label. .. Goodtimes Fun I've never heard of before. I'm sure I'll keep this in mind the next time I see a movie from this company. I have no problem with Christianity ... I have a problem with tricky proselytizing. If someone is going to make a religious film, they must have at least a good sense to tell the viewer that this is what they get. The only redemption part of the exercise is that I spent only $ 3.25 to spend 97 minutes to look at a great martial artist who wasn't fighting. At least it was dinner, so I spent some of that cooking and eating. In short, if you're looking for a movie about average martial arts, and not hoping it will be a lot, don't bother with this movie because it doesn't even offer it.
