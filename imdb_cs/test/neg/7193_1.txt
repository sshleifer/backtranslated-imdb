Well, don't bother. This film looks so tired, acting is so old-fashioned and the plot and characters are so drab that they should be studied instead of being watched. It's really a terrible waste of film; Stereotypes, clich√©s, nonsense and amateur filmmaking. I watched it in incredible horror with an open mouth. How could such a film come into being and, more interestingly, how could anyone consider it fun or traceable? Old, tired, careless ... at best junior high parody. There is nothing attentive, except to study a very ancient film. It's not a good movie, just old. These are not Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy. That's bullshit. Acting is so bad that it's worth just looking at laughter. Some movies are so bad they're good. But this goes around the corner and back again.
