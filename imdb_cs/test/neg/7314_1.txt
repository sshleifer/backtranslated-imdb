"Crime" was one of a series of texts published in Australia from the beginning to the mid-1990s, which investigated the alleged victimization of a privileged heterosexual man in the age of feminism. This creature only needs a look at Pretty Young Thing and is accused of sexual harassment and his life is destroyed. Damn those female libber! Grrr ... <br /> <br /> As my tone suggests, I don't buy any of these BS anti-feminists, and that's why the movie didn't like it. 'GM' trivializes the issues of sexual harassment and teacher-student relationships. Sexual harassment here is the result of a perplexed young woman and the professional boundaries that teachers should maintain ... well, when a teacher is a charming and handsome family man (and plays Jimmy Smits!) Worry about you. Sexist waste, and even its review, gives him more time than he deserves.
