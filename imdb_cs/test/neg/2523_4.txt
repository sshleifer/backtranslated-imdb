When I attended college in the early 1970s, it was an easier time. Except for a brief occurrence in 1994, I have since been totally free from the influence of illegal substances and I have never regretted it ... until now. DB: TBTE must be, hands-down, the best movie to watch when it stoned. The strange, dreamy state it creates is very strange when you don't smoke, but I'm sure it will seem perfectly normal after a big doobie. (Not that I recommend it, you understand.) The reassuring narration, as usually in a high-quality cinema, the victim of a TB imprisoned in the image, would be ideal to help the stoned viewer follow things. complex. Plus, everything in the movie is pretty organic ... from old-fashioned natural breasts to a bucket of fried chicken. There is no doubt now that a young man with a hand (ahem) problem is completely gone in the movie. In one place, just KNOW he's going to say, "Hey! When I move my hand, she leaves the tracks!" Believe me ... you'll know when you get to this point. The only other thing we have to deal with is as follows: How good can a movie be when at least half of the budget has been spent on moving a huge bed frame around for interiors and exteriors shots? Certainly you must see horror enthusiasts, but suitable for a wide audience under the right conditions (if you know what I mean, and I think you're doing it). It only earns four stars because I can't actually say it took some talent to make.
