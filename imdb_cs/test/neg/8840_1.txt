With great anticipation, this year, I looked at this film, the contribution of Spain to the Oscars race. The film is partially unnecessary, banal, pathetic, poorly written, modified, acted and directed, the film is too long. She did not succeed in providing a "message" that she tries to give, fails in narration, clumsy historical conditions and, above all, rhythm. There are some so extreme misfires I have not seen in the movie in a long time (the story of Lucas, whose dead sister lives in his head, divine revelations, everything the lizard nonsense). The Spanish-speaking audience yawned around me and quickly lost patience, and some of the comments I heard were whether the members of the Spanish Academy were taking drugs before choosing an Oscar film.
