A totally ridiculous film that makes fun of the process of hiring universities. While it is true that SAT is not all about evaluating a student for admission to college, what the film is talking about is absolutely ridiculous and not worth repeating or viewing. stupid people who have an extremely narrow view of the whole process. The film is an insult to the hardworking high school students who work hard and then have to suffer a long process until they receive a letter of acceptance or rejection from the schools they asked for. This film certainly deserves rejection at all levels.
