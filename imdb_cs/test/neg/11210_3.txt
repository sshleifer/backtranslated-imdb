This is a great movie for the first time ninjas who are dating. If you are trying to impress a cute ninjette, I recommend playing this masterpiece. It's one of those specialty movies that lets you skip large parts without interfering with the plot. I also wondered where Teal Ninja is hiding? Are ninjas color coded like this? It is normal? If I had been attacked by one of these yellow or orange ninjas, I'd have died laughing before his sword succumbed to him. The next day I ended up with a black ninja star test, it was a multiple choice, it was pretty good. I found lots of questions about how to "sneak" around and look bad. It's all about eyebrows and attitude. In principle, the film could be better if: 1. There were no color-coded ninjas (or color-coded ninjas could join into a super ninja). 2. Joe died in the first two minutes and Patricia had to take revenge on him 3. Various monkeys were scattered around the ensemble 4. Patricia didn't speak and Patricia was replaced by another 6th Frenchman was also a ninja star 7 Chris Tucker, Whoopi Golderg and Chris Rock were Added as "comic" relief 8. Ninja Strengths originated from miticlorians.
