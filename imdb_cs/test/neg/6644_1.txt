To date, I've never seen Elizabeth Shue in anything else because of the smell of this movie. Badly acted, badly conspired, and racially Neanderthal, it took place in Chicago where every black man apparently lived in a blues club. . SPOILER AHEAD. . . . . SPOILER: Her "blues" solo was even more painful to watch than her clueless performance and intro into him - "No one leaves without the blues singing" - was just as stupid as a post. Children who were babysitters were unbearable, and before the end of the film I wished that all of them would be terrible. I must say that there is one special thing about this film; it takes a lot for the film to offend me, but this smoldering piece of impudence did what Chopper, Phantom Threat and Catwoman couldn't - make me sick to my stomach.
