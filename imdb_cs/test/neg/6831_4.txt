Normally I'm a fan of Bruce Willis, and although I was playing a cool professional killer, I thought he was the most enjoyable character. This means that his character makes such a mess of his professional activity, it's incredible he hasn't been caught before. The plot is thin until it is pointless. The end was no less annoying and offensive to the fact that it could be predicted from about 20 minutes to the movie. ** Spoilers Follow ** In Hollywood morals, good guys always win, with a few casualties on the road, and the bad guys are dying or they're at least headed to justice to the end. The breathtaking insult of the film is the way in which our IRA terrorist, who somehow became a plush, untouchable character, gets into a new life. Like his former playmate terrorist (who is now a loving wife and mother). Who is the bigger villain? Former (and if we can say, intrepid) terrorist or hired killer? I don't see much to choose between them - in real life or in film. This is the poorest movie I've seen this year.
