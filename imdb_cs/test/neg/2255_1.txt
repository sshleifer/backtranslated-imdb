It usually sounds a lot better in my head (so forgive me for breaking up) I'm barely Tarantina's biggest fan (and will try to * not bend to call him 'hack' ... which is pretty hard) I don't like it taunt or criticize a movie before I see it. So, with careful hesitation, I went to the cinema today to watch 'Inglorious Basterds' <br /> <br /> Now, to call it a rip-off rip-off, it would be unfair. Tarantino is so happy to be able to take the Enzo Castellari title (less than the spectacular) of Dirty Dozen, but not from his plot (what he takes from all the other genres of films) 'Inglorious' will open with the Nazi officer and his long questioning against a farmer who hides Jews in his basement. This is such an anti-climax, in it, it's dialogue is outdated, and the result marked a mile away. Of course, one of the hidden Jews escapes her (but she later eats). We (apparently easily pleasing) viewers are treated to the performance of Lieutenant Aldo Rain (ha-ha, the name almost sounds like B-movie) King ALDO RAY .... ha-ha Quentin ... keep those 'honors' coming) and this character is played by anyone other than Brad (DALLAS) Pitt (sorry, DALLAS was the only good thing he ever played) Jolie keeps us with the jaws to the canine dog in the south, outlined by the Nazi killer. Meanwhile, Mr Tarantino forgets that real adults can attend, so he assumes that teenyboppers will not hear about 'Dirty Dozen'? The Rain Squad consists of (John Cassavettes looking) bloodthirsty Jewish soldiers who want to return to Adolf Hitler. Tarantino pays special attention to two of these men in all her superior knowledge by throwing her long-time best friend (and classmate) son Eli Roth (as a baseball bat controlling the "Jew Bear"). The second man's name is Hugo Stiglitz (and I bet more than half of QT fans have never heard this title before this movie) Keep Tarantino in good work, you have mastered 6 or 7 hommages (in the first 15 minutes), and It can downplay the plot (or lack?) <br /> <br /> Anyway, cutting a long (and extremely boring and lengthy) short story, both Raine and his men ('Inglorious Basterds and the only survivor of the first chapter, both they have a separate plot to kill Hitler in a Nazi-propaganda film performance, in a French cinema (owned by a predecessor who was mentioned here), Another boring (and nonsensical) talks followed by two and two as Pitt rolls away And any real tension that would lead to the assassination of the deadliest tyrant of all time is postponed by directors who insist that in the film of World War II placed a song by David Bowie of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> My problems (and there are many) with this movie is the re-occurring problem I have with most Tarantino products ..... he rarely knows when to either start or stop. I don't need a "homage" to 'honor' to get a * joke * (whatever it is) I knew Inglorious Bastards, Enzo Castellari, Aldo Ray, Hugo Stiglitz (and the ultimate crime of the film) Ennio Morricone's scary score from REVOLVER. I'm going to the cinema to see the stars ..... if it's the best you can do, it's Barad Pitt, I think you're the main move here (Mr. Tarantino)? I don't want the audience to direct the movie. I pay to see your vision, your ideas, your creativity ... NO how you can rewrite endless scenes from endless movies over and over again. It is high time that fans of fans (on IMDb) employed some 'hard love' on your 'idol' (God knows if you don't have .... studios should?) <br /> <br /> Tired old worship argument Tarantina is "good if you can do better ... do so" Let me tell you if I was a 46 year old director, with a (unfortunate) QT move ... Do you want to offer you much more than a heated confused re-hash of better movies from World War II than this tripe. The directors they try to imitate have made films so bad by chance or because of budget constraints. Again and again, it's a cop to let his fans listen to his lack of imagination as "art." I'm sure he's able to do better (but once he has given him the advantage of doubt, once again ... and not to mention 2 and a half hours of my life .....) maybe not?
