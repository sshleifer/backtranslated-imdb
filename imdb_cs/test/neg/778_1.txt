I don't understand why so many comments suggest that this is an acceptable pastime. The glamorous horror of this film monster cannot be exaggerated. Me and my girlfriend were watching him and I'm not sure we can ever have sex again. I'm not sure what was worse, the disheveled, uninteresting cast, their totally non-genogenic genitals, the insidious humor attempts, the sparkling sounds that claimed to be songs ... <br /> No, I know what was the worst of all. The girls in green jerseys, with their green color on their faces, licking Alice to dry her, then suggested, in a broken child's speech, that she was eating breast milk. That was the worst. Also what was with the sisters and why do they seem to have so much trouble finding each other's vaginas? Why are all men actors gay? Why Humpty Dumpty Throws Into a Dildo and Pretends to be His Cock? Why did my eyes have to see it? There are no words.
