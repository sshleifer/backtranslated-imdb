I've heard ravers stories in the movie and that's great, but that's just a 1/100 movie. The problem with this movie is cheesiness. I never got the story or why the kid steals girls. It doesn't make sense, but hey ... why were they randomly curious about the club. Many parts of this film make no sense, but overall I was interested. It was confusing on many levels ... Maybe I'm not enough indie enough for this movie, but judging by the B-looking end of the scene they ran out of money, just cut some things and forgot about the plot. Its a low budget and it seems. I like the fact that they used few special effects that were bad but didn't use any quality. I would say that this film is a basic bad scenario with good production. Definitely not as random as many movies I've seen, but pieces of puzzle just don't make sense. I would make an exception to the last battle, when all the effects fell on my ass in the 1950s. Sparks from models and the like. See if you like the unintentional action movie comedy. Mystery Science has a candidate.
