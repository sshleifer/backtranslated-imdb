The director spent a lot of time looking at the scenes, except for historical photographs and all the sounds of the old bustle. It is a pity that producers and writer / director Michael Cimino spent zero time on any historical fact about what the Johnson County War really was. Much of the war was about how public land should be used for grazing. Breeders did not want poor shepherds on earth to compete for a whistle on this cold wind platform. The whole epic does not mention any mention of sheep grazing, which was one of the most important reasons for the war. The worst scene is the battle between the peasants and the hired killers. Peasants are shown circling the gunmen as a bunch of Indians would do in much earlier Hollywood movies. The real fact is that Johnson County Sheriff William (Red) Angus, with a figure of 200 to 300 men, has captured gunmen and imprisoned them in the barn at TA Ranch. I doubt women have been involved in the siege. Ellen (Ella also known as Cattle Kate) Watson and her second husband, James Averell, were hanged by Lynn's mob about three years before the Johnson County invasion. Ella was never a prostitute. This was a duck spread by the Wyoming Stock Associations (WSGA) in order to discredit it. The fact that the plot makes her a madam mess is merely the interests of WSGA. There are no facts in events, time series, or background characters. Why would Michael Cimino use the real names of people who were loosely associated with the Johnson County War (and the events that led to him) is behind me. The film might be more interesting if it was about the political consequences of the federal government's intervention in the affairs of the state government and what happened after it was rescued by WSGA's Calvary gunmen. Some efforts have been made to prosecute Cattlemens who were responsible to Johnson County lawyers. But since Johnson County could not afford court costs, and Wyoming Governor, Amos W. Barber, backed WSGA, charges were eventually dropped. Overall, I think the movie was just an excuse to show Isabelle Huppert naked for most of the three and three / four hours of running on the DVD.
