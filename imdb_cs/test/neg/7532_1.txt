This is a really bad movie. This may seem like a simplification. A nasty, childish retort comparable to a petty insult. The truth is, there is not enough I can say about the confusing senseless conspiracy, the truly terrifying action (I speak ugly people), or the random images of violence against women that make up the chaotic pastiche of a radically terrible film. making mistakes that drive this insult to everything that is good and decent in the world of cinema, nay, human culture. Please take my word for it, don't look at it ... sometimes. I'm serious. Stop. You'll thank me later.
