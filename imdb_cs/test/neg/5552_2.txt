I love camp movies, believe me and the usual techncolorian gore Gordon Lewis doesn't bother me at all, but this is just one of his dumbest movies, even more than BLOOD CELEBRATION, I'm not kidding. GORE GORE GIRLS is about a crazy person who kills lots of go (re) - go (re) girls in a nightclub. Detective and reporter trying to find out a big secret. Perhaps the performances here are a little better than the usual average acting H.G. Lewis movies, but it doesn't say much. Working with the camera is even terrible. But at least it's kind of attention when girls make girls ... you spend a good time with her, and killing is in a very absurd situation. , very bad way: The girl is killed with a wooden hammer punching in her ass (!) and just don't let me talk about what it does with the nipples. You'll laugh like someone else. But the better this mess is, it's a scene I only love from a campsite: a little girl before a lot of feminists are dancing in a very American way. While it is important to remember that it was one of the first films to receive an X rating because it is violence. <br /> <br /> ONLY if you want to laugh and go through a good time (but only with a lot, And LOT beers).
