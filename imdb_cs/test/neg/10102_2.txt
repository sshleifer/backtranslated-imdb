I just watched it on TV. It was on Sunday afternoon movie from ABC. There is some tension in it, but there are so many bad qualities that the film really brings. The script is lame enough, and the fence features are not very realistic, such as the way a 911 operator laughs and hangs when someone reports a murder. I don't know what the writer thought when they came up with this idea, but it's not very realistic. I thought this movie would be a thrilling thriller, because there were a few scenes that seemed to lead to something good, but unfortunately they never did. There were few conspiracy elements that were used in other films similar to this, and eventually, did not prove to be very creative. <br /> <br /> If there's something good about this movie, it's cast. Every actor in this film did well to work with. The terribly underrated actress Elizabeth Pena was great in this movie. She is very sexy and has an incredibly sexy voice. However, if you want to see a movie that is really good, watch The Incredibles animated movie. In that movie, make her sexy voice well used. <br /> <br /> What I can say, this movie is not really worth your time, but the actors were good. Unfortunately, everyone was wasted on this movie, which is a real pity. This film tried to be a good thrilling thriller, but eventually fell. If you want to see a good movie that is similar to this but much better, see The Hitcher. If you want to see something with cast members of this movie, watch any of their other movies. You can actually easily pass this movie if you ever have a chance to see it.
