This film begins with a man who seems to be a sports driver. She meets a gang that contains an arrogant boss, an apparent idiot, a fat boy who never speaks, and a woman who turns between three of them. The group, called Satan's Angels, wants Rod, the driver, to become their personal driver. He says no, but then he says that after the authorities make him a spy to check them out. He robs the arms trade in an absurdly missed scene. The scene includes a woman walking into a shop with long hair in a bun and big round glasses. He says he wants protection and wants the trader to load the gun to show her how. Then he takes it from the merchant and shoots. The other three in the gang (except Rod) run into the store. They take everything out of the walls and then play with him just like the kids who get their toys on Christmas Eve. This movie is wasting precious time on the chart screen.
