Sure, it's hard to be gay, especially in the south. We understand it. More than ... and again. What is worth mentioning is that filmmakers have almost completely focused on "more extreme" characters in these small city bars; Stretching queens, hairy sleaze bar long closed, and a guy who was brutally murdered for being gay, but had nothing to do with one of the bars that were the subject of this movie. There were snippets of conversations from other people, people viewers might be better able to relate. But they were overlooked, practically skipped, perhaps in a background flash. It would be more interesting, at least for me, to hear the experiences of the more common homosexuals and women who were either enriched or otherwise on the experience of a small city bar and / or the absence of this community.
