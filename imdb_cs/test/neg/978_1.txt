I was looking at "Deadly Voyage" because David Suchet was in it after enjoying it in "Poirot". And Joss Ackland is always worth watching, so I went to the movie with the expectation that it would be a potentially valuable film. Unfortunately, it shouldn't have been. I will not bother to criticize the performance, pace, cinematography or any other structural aspect of the film; others have already expressed their views on these elements. The only thing I want to address is the message of the film, because in the intrus it declares that it is based on a true story and there is a supposed importance of the film in it. "Deadly Cruise" primarily focuses on an impoverished black African man named Kingsley who wants to move to the US because he believes he can make money there. Nothing more, nothing less - his motivation is absolutely selfish. (Of course, some people will go ahead by saying they do it for their family, but in fact, they have decided to have children on the income he could have made in Ghana, so he just created his own problem.) ship to New York. In this process, they face harsh conditions, members of the racist crew and other challenges. But here the film leaves me unpopular. Why would viewers care about Kingsley? Simply because it has a goal? The goals are not such a rare commodity that they should be superior to being a ship captain or a woman who has left home with his newborn baby. Kingsley's goal is illegal in the eyes of the US government. It is also illegal to steal from a Russian shipping company. If he got to the US, it would mean eliminating a system he didn't. And if they get caught, the shipping company will be fined $ 45,000. I very much doubt that each of the prisoners cares about what someone else stands for; they are clearly just for their own profit. He could have spent $ 1,000 he won in the lottery at the beginning of the film, for a legal passage to the US, and asked for a residence permit. Instead, it takes an illegal (and dangerous) route. Because Kingsley's journey is illegal, selfish, and cannot be ethically justified, why should we care for him or his suffering? Simply because they face challenges? Why should his challenges be privileged over the challenge of a Russian shipping company that has arrived in New York without having to stay? Because it is black and the shipping company is white? The reason is probably because Danny Glover (the film's executive producer) and other participants want us to resort to Kingsley as if he were a hero on some noble voyage. But once you accept that illegal immigration, theft, and foolish mission are not noble at all, you can't really care for it. Before I play a racing card, I assure you that I felt the same no matter what ethnicity / nationality involved. Imagine that a British man decided to put on a train heading for Bhutan, sneak across the border, and collect "unwanted" Buddhist antiques to return to Britain for sale. How many sympathies could the challenges they face generate? I bet very little. So why should we feel different to Kingley? Because he's black? Because he is poor by American standards? Banking makers share our belief that the end justifies funds, and that a shipping company that is fined $ 45,000 is insignificant compared to the remote ability of an unskilled worker to earn a little more in the US than he could if he just stayed your home country. I didn't buy it for a minute.
