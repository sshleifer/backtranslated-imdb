This film should go down in the fiefdom annals as one of the worst of all time. I'll stop to say it's the worst movie ever, because I haven't seen any movie I've ever made. Until then, I cannot do such high claims. The story is outdated, acting is terrible, at best "special" effects are not more than a few pounds. dry ice and fan. Someone had to be connected with someone to get the movie. Mr. Busey sent it! The dog is well trained and cute, which is the only redeeming quality in this movie that he should never have. I will never return two hours and $ 3 of my life.
