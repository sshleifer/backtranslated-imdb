It's nice that these three young directors made films with good productions and decent acting. There's some good work. Unfortunately, he suffers from what affects most modern gay cinemas; Recycled land, too well-known facilities (I've seen "pool" settings too many times in gay male movies) and hackney scripts. The most unreal of all is "Dorothy", whose absurd assumption is that a cute young guy will have trouble laying in New York because of the lack of identifiable homosexuals in his neighborhood. <br /> <br /> As for cinema shorts play as a cheap little gay after school specials. There is not much imagination in their writing or execution; Basically they follow a point-and-shoot, shot / reaction shot / master shot convention that becomes painfully boring after five or so minutes. In the works of Todd Haynes, Sadie Benning and the late Great Marlon Riggs ... but there is no hope for a viewer cinema. These films are incredibly midbrow, rarely whitebread, and their values ​​are basically fooling to gay bourgeois sensitivity. Which is probably why they play so well at gay film festivals.
