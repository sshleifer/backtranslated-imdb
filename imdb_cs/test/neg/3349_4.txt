I saw it on a cheap DVD release called "Entity Force". Since I like the 80-year horror movies, I thought I was in a real treat. Sadly, the movie is usually boring and you're still waiting for something to happen. This eventually gets a little interesting, but that's the last quarter of the movie. It's too late. When the action happens, it's not so great that we get dead corpses floating on the ground and chasing girls in the mausoleum. It's not the absolute worst I've seen, but you can do much better. I would recommend it only to the hard horror collectors of the 1980s.
