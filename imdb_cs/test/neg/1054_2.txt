This is your typical junk comedy. There is almost no laughter. No real moments. No memorable lines. No scenes where you think it's "smart". Nothing. The plot is embarrassingly bad. It's ugly to look and get bored like hell! There is no substance. This movie has nothing. It doesn't matter if Farely was in it or not. The crap movie is a crap movie no matter who is involved. David Spade is such an awesome comedian who plays the same miserable character in all movies / TV shows. There's no life here. No fun. No intelligence. There are a lot of other "stupid" comedies that are more fun. This film is just pathetic. <br /> <br /> 2/10
