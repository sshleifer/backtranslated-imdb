Time Machine begins in New York in 1899, where Professor Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) proposes to his beloved girlfriend Emma (Sienna Guillory), who, unfortunately, just after being attacked by mugger & Emma is shot dead and dies in Alexander's arms. A leap forward 'Four Years Later' & Alexander built a time machine that used to travel back to night Emma was killed to save her, but she is still killed, this time differently. Alexander realizes what he's doing, but he returns many times Emma always ends up dead in one way or another and longs to know why he travels far into the future to discover the truth. However, after the destruction of the moon, two new races, such as Eloi and monstrous Morlock, who eat Eloi, have developed on Earth. Alexander decides to stick to and save Eloi. Directed by Simon Wells, who is in fact the grandson of HG Wells, who wrote the original book The Time Machine, on which The Time Machine is based (1960), the film was founded & it is in fact the 1960 film That producer John Logan script is based on here rather than the original originally literally source. While all three share the same basic story and ideas, this remake adds a subplot about killing Alexander's fiancé Emmy and that's why he inventes a time machine rather than just being smart and capable. The script is a mix of sci-fi, action adventure and drama, which nobody really caught me, nor did I care so much, there are certainly some pretty special effects, a few nice action scenes and the moment when Alexander's question is answered why can't Emma save Actually quite intelligent & makes sense that I never caught my imagination and never moved it. Time Machine Time aspects are very similar to Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1992) in the sense that you can't change the past, but at the same time the future isn't just a good movie like Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The character is fine, though I thought Guy Pearce seemed too young to be a crazy scientist capable of inventing a time machine, and there was never a real explanation for him because it was like the moment when another machine he invented and made, not a time machine. one & it works perfectly. I think the Back to the Future trilogy offers much more excitement, laughter, excitement, and overall fun values ​​than The Time Machine, and when I stop losing to call it a bad movie because it moves at a decent pace, says the Reasonable Story and its moments I wouldn't say brilliant or even particularly good. There is also a cheeky little reference to the book and the original movie that are both name-controlled here. The advantage of this modern version has over the original is the development of special effects & especially CGI, which leads to the scene of time fast around Alexander in his time machine complete with huge buildings to be built, new ridges, canyons and mountains to be formed and an elaborate pan back that ends up in space as we see personal rockets orbiting the moon. The effect of work is good, there are one or two moments that look a little under par, but generally speaking the effects are good. I saw The Time Machine on TV and the station that played it wrong, and scanned it so that the left and right edges of the frame were cut off the screen, cutting off part of the year on Alexander's time machine, so I didn't really know what year it went. Director Gore Verbinski seems to have taken over the last eighteen days since Wells suffered from "extreme exhaustion" while IMDb says the time machine itself was the biggest and most expensive helicopter ever built for the film at that point that is hard for me . Believe and Guy Pearce broke the rib during the battle scene but continued as a soldier. <br /> <br /> With a projected budget of about $ 80 million production values ​​are high with a lovingly renewed New York period & good work effects though amazingly The Time Machine was nominated for an Oscar for Best Makeup, but lost to Frida (2002). Acting is mixed, Jermey Irons gives a good performance in horrible makeup that looks like a rejection of the Lord of the Rings movie while Samantha Mumba singer does her big screen and is just awful, though Guy Pearce is pretty good and pretty sympathetic . The time machine is not a particularly bad movie or a particularly good, just a rather unusual movie that is observable and passes through an hour and a half, but nothing else. Watch back to the future instead (1985).
