I appeared as an extra and I was on the spot of a journalist dealing with "The Dain Curse". My involvement was during the segments of this film shot in Jim Thorpe, Pa. (Jim Thorpe was also one of the "Molly Maguires" in 1969). I announced an "event" in Emmaus Free Press, where I was an editor of 1978-80 (the paper stopped publishing in the 1990s). I remember the excellent attention paid to details of period costumes, cars, etc. The modern Jim Thorpe asphalt streets were covered with gravel to mimic the rural town of the South of the 1920s. At the time I was interviewing the producer and talking briefly with the director during the break for change; I didn't get an interview with James Coburn, who was always very disappointing for me. As a party, I briefly appear in one of the street scenes with a hat and a tweed jacket. The producer asked me to "jump" and it was a real excitement. I still have a collection of black-and-white photos that I took from a newspaper production job. One day they may be interested in film / television historians. Lou Varricchio
