So many great actors, so little worth watching. But with the script that lacks so much of what made the book special, I don't hold on to anyone on the screen. Even though the book was defective, it was one of Grisham's only ones I really liked, especially how she captured the taste of a deep southern town, a somewhat different world to coastal urbanists like me. I also loved the fact, the nature of what is in the book. In the movie characters, the "nobility" is given a personality that seemed so burnt. Thieves and transparencies are flat and 1 dimensional. But as with so many works by Joel Schumacher, apparently lacking authenticity and authenticity, each point must be delivered through the hammer to the gate. So preaching, driven and superficial about such a terrible tragedy, I wish someone would make a remake and the story got a little more right.
