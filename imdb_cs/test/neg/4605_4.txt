Perry Mason: The case of a glass coffin finds that Raymond Burr defends David Copperfield / Rick Blain as the magician Peter Scolari from the murder of one of his assistants. The trick involving the suspended glass coffin in the air is melting, and Nancy Grahn's body crashes. Nancy was one of the six assistants who work with this act and learn two things about it. At first, in a moment of drunkenness, Scolari seduced her, and she claims to have been impregnated. Second, he lives under the supposed name and has a secret from her past. Billy Moses, who probably never thought he would do such a rude thing at a law school to confuse a couple of good old boys looking for the truth in his hometown of Grahna. A little more action than usual for Ken Malansky is almost killed. One big mistake in this secret is simple forensics. The doctor's report should provide concrete evidence that the victim was killed in such a way that Scolari could not do the deed. The police were supposed to look differently for the killer. When you see who the murderer is, you won't blame the individual, but you'll also see the investigating officer James McEachin get sick from the start. It's kind of spoiling this particular Mason movie.
