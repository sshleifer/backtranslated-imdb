It was like watching a movie trailer coming and coming, except that no movie came. The film is so unsatisfactory and obviously unfinished to be almost ridiculous. The subject of this film is in a very short timeframe and, frankly, nothing really happens in the 90-minute screen. I was hoping for a definitive Australian film about our soldiers in World War II and how they fought incredible chances in terrifying conditions. <br /> <br /> When I said the acting was great and the location authentic. It could have been a great movie that gave us much more money and time, instead it's not even average and I can't recommend it at all.
