Normally I'm finishing every movie or book I'm starting, even when they're poor, just because I hated them. That was so badly done, I was distrustful. I'm not just looking for Spielberg magic - I rent foreign movies, and I rent really old science fiction (most recently Soylent Green - worth renting) I like both Hollywood action and the slower development of moving characters. Different movies need to be approached differently to be appreciated. I couldn't find any redeeming element to this ... The action was so wooden that I wasn't a bit on the edge. The development of the character was virtually absent - you don't let anyone apologize or identify with them. In the end there were so many pieces that it could not be added. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time - look better at dry colors ...
