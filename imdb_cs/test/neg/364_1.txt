First, let me start by saying that I am a loyal supporter of Thomas Howell's C career since then "The Outsiders" and "The Hitcher". He was up and coming star in the 1980s - with hits such as "Soul Man" as well. The future was clear to this young actor, and he had the potential to continue from there in Hollywood. Give it that way - Tom Cruise was a little bit of "The Outsiders" while Howell had the lead. Check out Cruise Today !!! However, choosing material such as this one will denigrate Howell's career even more - if possible. Why does he choose this? A small portion in a large film would be more beneficial to him than this waste. The story is basically set in a post-apocalyptic world where everyone lives underground, where chaos rules. Howell's Shepherd - Protects a flock of different religious leaders by killing all unwanted things. In other words, it's a hit-man. The sets are so bad that they wouldn't appear on the Thunderbirds episode. The use of slow motion is unnecessarily repeated throughout the film, but it is well-founded by misconduct (and the poor is a kind word), no continuity, scenes that are by no means thrown, by vehicles that seem to have been made. from a box of corn flakes and a directorial style that borders on stupidity. Yeah, and the story was too pathetic. I hate to write bad reviews about movies - especially those I really like the star about - but the movie is so bad that I don't believe it can be proud of one second. I'm not a director or director, but I'd hide my head in the sand if I spent all my money and time on this movie. In short, it was a monumental waste of time and energy, and I would not recommend EVER to see this film. It's free with the DVD player I bought, but I still shut it down because I was embarrassed for Howell. Come on to C - do some credits and embarrass yourself with these non-hit miracles and try to slide down and get a good part - no matter how small. <br /> <br /> 1/10 - and just because there's no setting for 0/10.
