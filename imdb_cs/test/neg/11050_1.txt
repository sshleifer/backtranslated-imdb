This film was terrible, simple and simple. He will probably be worshiped by those who see only "movies" and not "movies," and therefore apologize for having such a limited understanding of the theatrical brilliance of this film, but in my intellect I am safe enough to say this boring, confident and the painfully drawn movie was a waste of two hours and nine dollars. I was annoyed to see it in the inexplicable good reviews he received and came out of theatrical thinking that these reviews had to be written by enthusiastic film students and the aforementioned group of individuals who avoid regular movies perhaps for fear that one day they can really enjoy one. The story is quite promising - a man is imprisoned for 15 years, never knows his prisoner, or his crime. He is then suddenly released and given only five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who imprisoned him. However, a great concept soon falls apart into a pathetic wit as Oh Dae-Su runs around hitting people up, trying to have sex with a young girl who attempts to use the restroom and eat live, writhing octopus (probably for dramatic effect, there is no other reason). All the while trying to figure out this terrible thing he did to earn fifteen years in jail, and when he finally finds out, it's both ridiculous and big breakdown. His nemesis, the man who allegedly went to school with him when he was a young man, looks like a model of the Banana Republic twenty years younger than him. Hey, I know the prison was hard on Oh Dae-Su, but it's too much to find an actor who looks a little closer to his age? Of all the things that are wrong with this movie, it seems to be the easiest way to fix it. And a big secret - the one who kept me in place for 90 minutes when I could be something productive out there - it's some kind of joke from the storyline that included incest and reputation in high school. Come on! Throw the bone away - was it really the best they could do? I sat over a stupid dialogue, exaggerated, grim sets and gratuitous violence? (By the way - I'm not at all against violence in the movie if it seems to fit into the story, but in this case, it seems that I was forced to watch our hero knock someone's front teeth and cut off his own tongue with a pair of scissors to He turned me away from discovering that I was wasting my afternoon watching the spectacular piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> Take my advice - do something different with time and money, or take nine dollars and look at the humble " film "- the one you can really enjoy.
