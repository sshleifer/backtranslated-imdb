I'm still waiting for the dark movie muppet, where we won't know how it will end from the beginning. I think Linklater could make one attempt to experiment with animation. This time I did not intelligently expect such a thing, but deeply wished. Joan Cusack was blazing. She moved to the tv-for-tv level lazily, who seized this with a cynic clich√©. The Muppets were more of a life than she was. Disappointment. But the whole movie was Pepe Bar. I loved him. He was the only one who made me laugh (while Goldbergh, when God choked and cursed me). Unless we can see dark muppets than at least PG: 13 with more controversial jokes Pepe and Animals with Metal Head, egg-nog-chuggin persona. Worst Muppets I Saw Even Boring Christmas Carol Beats This One Out. Muppets must avoid a commercialized holiday. <br/> 5/10
