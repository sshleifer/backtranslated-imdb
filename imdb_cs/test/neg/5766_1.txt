I'm shocked to find out that some people got more than two stars. They must either make fun or be completely blind to the art of acting, directing and other film shortcomings. just so bad. The three first characters, including the "excavator", were just terrible actors and I think AWFUL! Maybe the director didn't care or maybe he's a worse director. It was like watching a bad school. The movie was of course filmed with a video camera (lowbudget - not a real movie) and the light setting wasn't very good. In addition, a healthy person (if he had it) must be either a newbie or a drunkard because the sound was amateurish. Even in one of the first scenes from the kitchen (AWFUL actor btw) the sound from the dialogue was bad enough. For example, when a woman moved her head while speaking, she heard her voice disappear and return. It sounded like they were trying to fix it in postproduction by turning the volume a little when she turned her head. In addition, you had constant irritating sounds from camera equipment or other sources in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> All these squeakers during the first 5 minutes or so. Do I need to say more? <br /> <br /> A good school project or entertaining project for friends to watch but never be released for a real audience, especially for a paid audience. THIS IS RIP OFF if you don't have a very low standard on movies or just a bad taste. You're CLOSED! SB.
