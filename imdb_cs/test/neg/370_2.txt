If you take movies, Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome and Steel Dawn with Patrick Swayze, you'll have a pretty good idea of ​​what the movie is all about. The only problem is that the film lacks one production value, and is mainly a cheap copy of the former two. It is true that the film has a lot of action, but asks the viewer to suspend the faith. No one can shoot a 50 Caliber Machine by holding it in your hand - and there's nothing left to kick off, nor can you shoot a group of people with an automatic weapon and skip a whole bunch. There is also a problem with poor editing, when the school bus overturns, it's easy to see the cannon that did it. And the lady who drove it is useless because she had more than enough time to stop the truck. If you are only interested in mindless behavior and violence, then the film is easy to follow. But don't expect anything to paar with Thunderdome, or even somewhat cheap and cheap Steel Dawn.
