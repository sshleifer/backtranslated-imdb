This is said to be the first Polish Western and is written and directed by Piotr Uklanski. This film, known in the US as BOADTY DEAD MAN'S, uses some strange visuals to tell a story that is short in dialogue. Val Kilmer plays a corpse, and some scenes are through his dead eyes. Some unpleasant visual situations are actually comic in a sick way. My favorite one is a young man who puts the gallows to cut off one of his own fingers, and in fact tests himself the strength of the rope. A cowboy known only as a 'stranger' (Karel Roden) finds a dead man (Kilmer) who thinks he's a wanted man. He takes him to the nearest town to collect the reward. He eventually loses a corpse and a potential reward in gambling with the city's drunken sheriff (Boguslaw Linda) and has a few burgesses turned against him when he has a dalliance with a bartender (Katarzyna Figura). He can escape certain death and lead a small position on a dangerous wild chase. One scene has an alien tending to scalp wound by cauterization with gunpowder and struggle. He rot the corpses strapped to the hanging post when the sheriff discovers there is no reward. This movie, also known as SUMMER LOVE, has a haunted theme song sung by John Davidson. However this western is like watching a train wreck. There's just something that tells you not to look ... but you.
