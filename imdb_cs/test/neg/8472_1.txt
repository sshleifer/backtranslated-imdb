I stayed for almost ninety minutes with this horrible movie, waiting for some revelation about dancing or spirit or inspiration or something and giving up! What did the makers have to do? She is an old woman with limited talent who is obsessed with herself and nothing else. To fill the story without a point, we get some things about the other people in her throne, her help to the burros, and of course her ten cats! You don't see this movie. And they have nothing to do with anyone who loved him - they have no idea. In this world, there are fascinating people with wonderful stories to tell, but Marta Becket is not one of them. The people I took in this movie say they forgave me - but they never stop making fun of me.
