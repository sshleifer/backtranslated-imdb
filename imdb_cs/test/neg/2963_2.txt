This was on TV yesterday. I was painfully forced to go through it and I barely went through it. First of all, with the exception of Leroy, Hilary, and perhaps Coco, none of the other students we should care for have any discernible talent. It's like HSPA had no standards, just log on to the dotted line and you're in. <br /> <br /> The stories were grating and clear. Doris was just incredibly awful. The homosexual was such that a clich√© was fired (funny as the school had only one gay man, right ...) I liked the character of Leroy, but your teacher's call to obscenity and the subsequent school demolition was to send Leroy a cover. Lisa looks like she should be anywhere else, and because she wasn't talented, I wonder why they left her. I'd rate this one star (horrible), but the music wasn't that bad, and I had that premise. It would be much better if the students were attractive and really had some talent.
