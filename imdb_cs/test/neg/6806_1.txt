To enjoy "Fur - an imaginary portrait of Diane Arbus", Stephen Shainberg needs a viewer to suspend all the reality and previous knowledge of American photographer Diane Arbus. Paradoxically, it is the very use of Diane Arbus's name and knowledge about her life and the work that will make this film a big one. The beautiful WASPish and the charming Nicole Kidman as the anti-glamorous Jewish Diane Arbus is that Shainberg didn't get Arbus, or what her work was about (unsentimental realism) and seems to attract Arbus only to a superficial level through her photos of circus freaks. What follows is a kind of fabulous and trivial fantasy fantasy biography with Robert Downey JR as the furry fictional love of Kidman's love. But this is not the banality of the story, which is the main drawback of this film, but the director's misogynist attitude, which Diane Arbus, one of the most distinctive and original photographers in the world, has failed to create her own ideas about her work. While his previous film 'Secretary' was a study of female masochism, his ongoing depiction of a woman as submissive spoils this film completely - and flies in the face of the real life of Diane Arbus' courage, tenacity and fearlessness in one survey often a shady world of outsiders. Imagine imaginary biopic on the life of Madonna's pop star with Guy Richie as her Svengali, the man behind her career, and you'll feel how seriously wrong and imaginary the movie is: It can only work if You have no knowledge of the subject, or simply decide to ignore all the facts. It's a shame, because once you remove all the references to Diane Arbus, this movie could stand on itself as an interesting study of fetishism and a good escort by the secretary. 4/10
