A few years ago I bought a movie called Cellar. I heard it was supposed to be a great movie, but it turned out to be a flop and a B-movie. The story is good, but there are no good effects in the movie. (Maybe they haven't had enough money for that budget?). <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch this movie, be sure to watch it three times. First, only and last !!!
