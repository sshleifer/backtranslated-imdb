First I give this movie a low score of 4 out of 10! It was nothing but a wannabe film. I felt very much watching this movie. I was led to people that it would be more drama and more facts about the real story on which it is based. Instead, I spent more than an hour of middle-aged middle age breaking the law and taking drugs. It's abit like a football factory, but with no real action and no good ending. After watching the movie I was wondering what a movie is? If you love movies without a real story and lots of drug abuse and swearing, then it's a movie for you. I'm a LARGE fan of crowd and gangster movies, but this movie hasn't lived to humor. I see where the writer tried to go with the film, but he never achieved his goal. One of the worst British movies I've ever watched. If only the movie had more story, it would have a bad movie.
