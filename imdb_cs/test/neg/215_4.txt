The new guard in the armored vehicle will step out his co-workers to steal 42 million from the truck. No bad guys, so no one will be hurt, right? Of course things go wrong and the new guardian decides to have conscience and do things by saving the life of a dying man. I confess that I wasn't really interested in that. film, but I had no interest in Mr. Fox's Fantastic, and the movie from my first decade. Armor is even more disappointing than I thought it would be. As a deceitful film, it cannot deliver goods, it is boring and full of holes and jumps in logic that one will think about it. Despite this, the film has a really great cast, but the movie doesn't even use it. It seems that everyone is unnecessary in wooden characters who make stupid choices. Columbus Short is an uninteresting leader who is never charismatic and never makes viewers want to give crap. Matt Dillon is a robber champion and plays Mr. Nice Guy in the beginning, then when things don't go his way, he quickly becomes a criminal. The rest of the impressive cast include Lawrence Fisburn, Jean Reno, Skeet Ulrich, Fred Ward, Amaury Nolasco of Prison Break and Milo Ventimiglia of Heros. Others do not do much, and when they do something, it is without much consideration. The film is quite short, but even though its runtime is under 90 minutes, I felt it was pulled out. How long can you make a movie about a caught guy? The phone booth did a decent job and was even more limited. Jumping logic about conspiracy here is tragic. 42 million and all the security they have is fine every hour? The whole plan of my understanding was to drive trucks to an abandoned warehouse and hide the money. Pretend to hit and burn trucks. Then they would leave the money. Of course something goes wrong, or wouldn't there be a movie? With a series of unfortunate events, the so-called hero plunged into the wagon with an injured officer. The rest of the movie is Dillion, and his crew is banging on the door to get inside. How very exciting. The script requires our hero to have financial trouble, he could lose his house to turn him to lose his brother. You see, both their parents died and they both looked at each other. So now he has a reason to join the robbery. At first he didn't want to, but his financial problems are the right pressure to throw him into the thick stuff. How convenient. Armored whole rotation on the heist genre is that it's from the armored car, from the guys who drive it. After this basic assumption, the film hits the face. I found that it would want it to end sooner and sooner when someone spoke. Talking about the end, it's shit. <br /> <br /> Skip.
