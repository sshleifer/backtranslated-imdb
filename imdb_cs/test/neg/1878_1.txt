I have seen tons of garbage, in every language, about every subject and every trend of filmmaking. Each director and every budget is available for each period. That means I really have to say: <br /> <br /> This is one of the three worst movies I've ever seen. It is painfully bad. It's pompous. It's grim. It's incomprehensible. It is annoying. It's a really bad mess. It's a piece of you-know-what. And more importantly, it lacks a point. And even if it doesn't matter, the characters are so unreal and uncomfortable that it is impossible to overlook the lack of coherence of the whole thing. Actually, I felt sick in watching this waste. The theater where I saw him (Lincoln Center in New York) was full when it started. By the end, half of the audience went out. At the end, Q&A was programmed, but no one remained. Except for the two of them, everyone else ran to the door, including me. <br /> <br /> Save 2 hours of your life. It's probably one of the worst actions. <br /> <br /> If the cinema is in hell, this movie will play forever 24/7.
