Wow! This is a movie that should be shown on TV at 2 am on Cinemax for all those insomniacs (the Lord knows they would probably watch this movie out of boredom) Terrible acting, the killer is far enough from fright, saw clowns at carnivals, which were more frightening. Lots of useless 'skin' in this movie, pseudo-porn scenes that are just terrible in over a million, gawdy soap opera style script that really hurts the film and the director really had no sense of any genre tried with this movie. I saw a group of teenagers with their camcorder parents doing a better job than this. I don't think there's a part that this movie could recommend to anyone ...
