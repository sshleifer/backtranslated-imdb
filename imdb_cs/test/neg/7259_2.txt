Other commentators have described this film as a "classic 1950s SciFi" with clever use of footage and documentary recording and clever character interaction. Nothing can be further from the truth. Yes, this is a classic 1950s SciFi ... but the SciFi of the 1950s on its best stupid worst worst. Consider that the first Mantis prey is a radar station that is displayed first from the air, then on the ground. .. but the station is (out of the air) in the picture as on the top of the mountain, with snow on one side and a semi-cloudy dark ground on the other, but when (on the ground) investigators visit the site, it's suddenly on the flat, evenly white plane, miles from the nearest mountain. Also, consider the ridiculous pseudo-scientific buzz of a highly recommended expert who is brought to explore a huge claw. He says, "Well, we know that one thing ... couldn't come from an animal because every known species of animal has a skeletal skeleton. Even reptiles and birds have bones." Then he continues that some creatures ... snails, crustaceans, insects ... don't have bony skeletons. Excuuuuuse me? Let's define "animal" here. Even in the fifties, anyone over six years old could not take this man as a biology expert, because he clearly does not know what an "animal" is, nor does he have the ability to name several broad categories of animals that lack bony skeletons. (sharks, rays, jellyfish, insects, molluscs, arthropods, gastropods, sponges, arachnids, echinoderms .... you get an idea.) Characters are cardboard, 2D types of stocks ... a scientist, a sidekick girlfriend, a big evil monster. Nothing here has any sense of creativity. No pulses, no signs of life. There are no funny dialogues, special effects are stupid even for their time, and stock footage is employed with reckless ignoring continuity. This is a B-movie making at its worst, with a production crew that clearly couldn't be bothered to try even half the heart. Use sparingly, like a sleeping drug or punishment for young children who are easily offended by bad science.
