Ken Burns's "Baseball" is a decent documentary ... representing the clear origin of the game, a great depiction of baseball's first years and heroes. There's plenty in this movie for all the baseball fans ... who said the movie has some glaring drawbacks. 18 hours is just too long a time for human attention. It is clear that Burns stretched out his film to fit into his "nine shifts" concept. It's not even 18 hours ... the pace of each segment is slow, almost morose ... music is always nostalgic and wise. Isn't baseball exciting and fun at all? Why is each player and their achievements presented in a tragedy? Speaking head after talking head, every course turned into an emotional heat, yakking about baseball as a metaphor, baseball like Americana, psychology and baseball theology ... enough! This is syrupy, macks. Billy Crystal is here to sell us all the Yankee hokum he sold us. Ken Burns uses the national anthem as the theme song of the series and manages to play "Take Me Out To The Ballgame" so many times you can vomit. We'll get it, buddy. It is clear that Burns is a neo-Hollywood faux-liberal, so he spends about a third of the film in the Montenegrin leagues ... these segments are spent on the rampage of yesterday. not as open as Kenny is today. For shame! He plays baseball for being segregated in the 1930s and 1940s, but does not realize that America was segregated at the time! Burns falls over the heel's head in love with Buck O'Neil, a former negro-league player, and drools over every piece of record in which older O'Neil waxes poetic about his game days. Nonsense ... Burns would be better with an adult to help him adjust his work down. "Baseball" ends up as bushy, stupid, civilian propaganda disguised as Americana. It is clear that Burns is not a baseball fan ... otherwise he would know we're looking at games that laugh and cheering, not crying and soliloquies ... listening, Mr. Burns? There's no crying in baseball.
