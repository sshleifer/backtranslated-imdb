I'm very pleased. I like bad movies. I love movies representing attractive young women in a small amount of clothes. This film gives everyone the wrong name above. Yes, you know that what you receive is not high art or something. But even for that type of movie, beach girls aren't too good at a distance. Some people have given it 10. I can only assume that these are the people who had the organs that allowed a rational thought to take place surgically removed. It's not very good. It's just not very good. 3 out of 10 just for a) novelty value for famous relatives and Burt Ward and b) some girls are cute. By the way, did I tell you that it's not very good?
