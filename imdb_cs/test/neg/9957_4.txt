"Dr. Cameron, a proficient scientist will succeed in his serum creation experiment, which transforms men into wolf creatures. Originally, he created this formula to help the world, a scientist decides to use his newly created subject to exact vengeance on scientists who were Lenora's Daughter of the Scientist When it comes to the actions of his father, and shares her suspicion with a journalist, when a scientist loses control of his creature, he falls on a scientist's daughter and reporter to stop her. "According to the synopsis of the DVD sleeve. Mad Scientist George Zucco (as Lorenzo Cameron) creates his formula rather unimaginatively, mixing human and wolf blood. This brings the beast in the mighty Glenn Strange (like Petro aka Pedro) who is directed to perform as Lon Chaney Jr. in "Of Mice and Men". Johnny Downs (like Tom Gregory) and Anna Nagel (as Lenora Cameron) are a nice werewolf hunter and miss in need. Sure, the "mad monster" is not a substitute for "wolf man"; but it's a useful addition. Grainy black and white photo enhances the hazy atmosphere of cow sites. "God" (uncredited) strikes also a well-ended ending, too. Like Blaine (Robert Strange) he said, "Blending the blood of a man and a beast is absolutely sacramental!" Sam Newfield ~ George Zucco, Johnny Downs, Anna Nagel (1942)
