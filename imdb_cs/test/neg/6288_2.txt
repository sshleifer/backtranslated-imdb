The funniest thing about Fortunes is that one of the main characters, Lewis (Urbaniak) has a writer's block and apparently did the film's scriptwriter. It's also sad, I think I think it's supposed to be a comedy or a drama, but that's the funniest thing I remember from watching it. Three friends go out and drink one night. On their way home, the two decide that the "gypsy" tells them how they are called. These two lives are falling apart while the third friend is standing. Then nothing happens. I hope I didn't spoil the movie there, but really this extremely low budget, poor quality movie, had some idea when it started, but it quickly got into the depths. Hell. Yeah, I'm tough. Frankly, it wasn't so bad, it was just a blah. The above-mentioned writer was uncomfortable watching, though he might have released one or two of those two fun lines. The clich√© of "lady," the only one who didn't get her fortune was just annoying. The only clear point was the remaining friend, a married dad whose wealth was said to be something that had happened to his son, and he had to be prepared. He was a witty, real and clearly the best actor in the film. Unfortunately, it doesn't say much. I may be too cruel. Damn, they got the ambition to make a movie, they went and got finances and they did something. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend a film based on it, there are hundreds of thousands of other independent films that have hundreds of thousands of better ideas and executions. This one was literally 10 minutes of thought stretched another 81 boring minutes.
