Quite a horrible movie, I'm impressed that Derek Jacobi and Vanessa Redgrave agreed to be in it, it's like a long episode from a bad TV detective series. The biggest mistake has to be Vinnie Jones, he just can't act, the one who had a clear idea of ​​throwing him as a leading man wants his head to examine if he didn't put his own money in the project? He should stick to the heroes and look horrible and not talk! Also was central heating around Dickens times, as there were three large radiators behind his desk ??? No wonder it put it free with newspapers as no one would pay to see it.
