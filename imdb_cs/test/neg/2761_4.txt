I've read a lot of books in my short life, but that's far from WORST !!! I just did a reading of this worthless piece of trash and when I finished it I threw it across the room! I hated it and let me give reasons! 1. The soldier dies. Why would the author make a soldier die? Why couldn't she keep him alive as a good love story author ?! I applaud Patty deeply for trying to claw that the FBI agent's eyes are out. Ruth (black housewife) is fired and for no apparent reason! She tried to calm Patty and then Patty's SOB dad fired her for no reason! Ruth and Anton and Patty were the only bright spots in the book. And grandparents too! 3. Perm. Yes. Perm. Now people can think, why would it upset you? So here's the reason. Patty's mom asks the girl if she wants her hair to end. Patty says no, but Mum calls Mrs. Reeves (a horrible hairdresser) and tells her to grant permty to Patty. Why would God's green earth do that? Why would her mother ask her daughter if she wanted her to let her afford it. Mom always pretends that Patty has a word when he doesn't have a word at all! She should be awarded the "Worst Mother of the Year Award" for things that give Patty. Thank God Ruth cut her off! 4. Discrimination, Racis and Prejudious. I hate this discrimination in this book. They use the word * beep * too much. Yes. I know the blacks were free in those days, but they had virtually no rights, but come on! Why Teach Today's Kids That Word! They just teach them how to discriminate against people. Not only were the blacks discriminated against, but also the Chinese. In the book, people refer to Mr. Lee (a Chinese man) as a "beep * This is really despicable and last but not least ... Jews and Nazis. wrong for her favorite Anton: She's a 12 year old girl! It was just a crush as well as 12 years can really love 22 years. Come on! This is not "Lolita" and "Lolita" It's a good book, not a piece of dirt! I am surprised that this film is not considered "dirty" as "Lolita" is. 5. Patty goes to the reformator. Convictions are for thieves and murders, not innocent 12-year-olds! The teacher or whatever was called Patty is an ungrateful, spoiled brat. Patty should have a community service or something like that, she didn't do anything wrong, just help a friend. 6. Favortisem Parents played their popularity with their c kids. Patty, their first-born daughter is clearly the least favored, while Sharon, a five-year-old brat, is their favorite daughter. Dad says he wanted to take Sharon to Hollywood, but he clearly forgot his second daughter. 7. Dad. I hated him! He meant that Patty, like her father, could have Hitler. Her father beats her for no apparent reason, and the way she finally talks to her is so angry that you will be caught when you think: "Patty would be better treated in a concentration camp." Well there you have people. 7 reasons why I hate this book. Instead of reading this book, read "The Anne Frank Diaries" or anything else, because I warn you, it's very depressing and it'll be really crazy! The only reason to get 4 stars is Anton, Patty, Ruth and Grandparents!
