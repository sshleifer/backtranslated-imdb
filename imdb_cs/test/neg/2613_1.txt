You know, I'm sure the boys were sitting in the office one day, saying, "HOW CAN WE MAKE MORE MONEY?" They made all possible varieties of toys that they did with their current characters. So they decide to steal the idea of ​​Star Wars, PREQUEL, and we can create all new characters and sell them as toys. Something they did in puppet master 3, but who cares? Anyway, they choose time before the first movie, when Toulon is still alive, he and the puppets are sitting around, and the wooden head on the floor and the puppets want to know if he's a dead family member or something, no matter. This is how the story of a puppet masterpiece begins. It's long, it's boring, not interested in body. The funniest part is that it tells the story of the origins of these new characters in the film, but gives no indication of their fate. SO GUESS WHAT, as soon as the proceeds of the new toys pay off, they can play a new (and 4th straight rotten) sequel called "PUPPET MASTER 8 SEQUEL TO PREQUEL FATE OF DEAD RETRO PUPPETS!" hold your breath!
