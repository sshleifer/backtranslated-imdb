And so it started with "Shreik" broadcasting horror movies, then we had a Scary Movie, a really good attempt at a new kind of genre, a renowned mission. however .... now we have: Scary Movie * Scary Movie 2 Scary Movie 3 Scary Movie 4 * Date Movie Meet Spartans Not Another Team movie * plus many more (really funny movies tagged with *) <br /> <br /> and ..... super hero movie .... it seems that the people who are doing these movies still can't understand what makes sending funny. Using rip-off from other movies in a funny way is all right and good if done properly, but not many manufacturers seem to know how to do it. Scary movie (1) did well, the following sequel was then horrible as he tried to play the franchise, but it was redeemed by Scary Movie 4. There is no other teen movie was good because it used spoofs well ... and on his credit I am sick teen movies. however, this movie plays as a bad version of all of these. He relies on slapping that even three shooters crouch, violating the idea of ​​Stephan, and then, when people get bored (and manufacturers knew when it would be), we'd be treated by Pamella Anderson in a leather suit. To conclude, spoofs should be about making an honest model of the original movie with the original story, not plastering random starts of a legitimate film on the story of a real movie. <br /> <br /> shivered at the thought of "SCI-FI MOVIE" and prepared my seppuku knife ready
