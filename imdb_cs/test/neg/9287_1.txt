I usually like Lawrence and being in Australia I haven't seen much of his stand up, so when I saw it in my video store I thought yeah I'll check it out. I wish I didn't see it now. Obviously, Lawrence had a profound experience that opened his mind to him, and I think he wants to share it with others, but that was neither time nor place. Really. I believe the phrase of the night was "riding until the wheels fall", which mingled with simple lewd jokes that spun around sex and genitals. No matter what the humor, Lawrence lacks a gift that could put him in the fashion of Eddie Murphy, Richard Prior, or Robin Williams. Lawrence was just plain lewd, the only time I laughed was to relive his legal experience and his hospital recovery. If there were negative points, I'd give them to them.
