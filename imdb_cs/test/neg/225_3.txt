After reading Fool For Love in my Drama class, I was looking forward to how Sam Shepard manages to bring the amazing game to the screen. Much to my dismay it was nowhere as fun as a game. The film seemed to pull, the music was unsuitable for the tone of the film, and the entire raw energy of the game seemed to have been vacuumed out of this movie version. It's a shame to see how it happened with Shepard's involvement and plays Eddie's role. Do yourself a favor ... see the game next time it's done in your area, or just read the book instead.
