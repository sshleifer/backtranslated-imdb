I'm a big fan of sci-fi movies. So, when I saw this EPG movie, I thought I was for a nice evening. What a disappointment! Such a bad display of "special" effects that I couldn't imagine in 1980 but in 2005? Come on, why would you do special helicopter effects flying in the desert when you can shoot the right one at a much lower price (I think)? And those "muppet" killers ... well, I could do it better than a few hours in the garage. You can expect to have a low budget for a movie, but I don't think it's reasonable to have a low movie for any budget. As for the "star" of the movie (tonight I use a lot of quotes ...), Lou Diamond Philips, this guy isn't even remotely an actor. Maybe he should stay in martial arts movies. All in all, terrible movie. Maybe I'm in a bad mood tonight. Then again, maybe not. Candid 1 out of 10.
