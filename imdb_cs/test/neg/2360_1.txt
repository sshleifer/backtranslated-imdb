utterly useless ... when I was there, I did say that I had to say with the theme that it captures the club's atmosphere in complete respect. Maybe it did so that the characters were not just mouthpieces for incredibly horrible, unreal stories. So many scenes that could be used to ruin and which would have allowed the Office to shame (not to compliment this film). It also could help have some semblance of story, point, news, commentary, anything. Seriously, Kevin & Perry Go Large had more to the subject than this movie (the term used in this case very loosely). Minus numbers should be reserved for such films. -10 (extra turd)
