As I sat watching this episode, I kept looking at the clock and waiting for something to happen. When the hour was thrown, I thought they would really give us a big pop and then - nothing. The whole family curls around the Christmas tree like something from the Hallmark Canal, then fades to black. Nothing to get any excitement for next season. The only thing that was out of any kind of incentive to watch the next season was the ambiguous nugget offered by Agent Harris while he was poking a sandwich that the guys in New York wanted to get to New Jersey. Wow Really? I'd never expect this from gangsters, I'm on the edge of my seat. Almost seems to be trying to make everyone lose interest. There is more plot of lines that ends just disappearing than any show I have ever seen. They frighten and crash, but rarely bring more. What about Arabs hanging out on Bing? They still throw them in front of them and nothing happens magically. Paulie's hat on his knee some kid after Tony promised him that nothing would happen to her son, and poof, in the wind. And how many other meandering drug assemblies with Christopher will we have to endure? Please let him be arrested or overdose, or something interesting. It was one of the few exhibitions I was looking forward to looking at, but now, forget it.
