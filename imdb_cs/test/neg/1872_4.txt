One day he caught "The Rain People" on Classic Movies tour. The film was released in 1969. Shirley Knight performs as Natalie, a Long Island housewife who - exactly unknown reasons - leaves her husband to embark on a trip, not knowing exactly where she is going. Natalie is also newly pregnant, which complicates things. Along the way, she picks up a brain-damaged ex-footballer "Jimmy" (James Caan), who was sacked from his college and is hitchhiking. There are many twists and turns between these two paths because Natalie tries to take care of Jimmy and begins to realize he's mentally limited and can't take care of herself. He goes through his own struggles, no need to say, and is unable to take care of him. Natalie seems to be on the edge of a nervous breakdown at times; She makes some special phone calls to her husband, who asks her to come home. Natalie tries to blow Jimmy several times, just to put him back in life through circumstances. Young Robert Duvall plays a strange and worried cop who makes friends with Natalia. All the time you have the sense that this movie will end badly and it does. This film is sometimes uneven and the scenario is somewhat absent. It was driven by Francis Ford Coppola and he would, of course, become extremely famous for directing "Godfather" in the coming years. Actors are good, no need to say that everyone will have futures ahead. Shirley Knight is the least known of the three, although she is also underestimated as an actor. James Caan is particularly effective here, and he seems to be occupying this character. This film is now a little more than curiosity, no doubt because it is the early Coppola film, and I admit that I've never heard of it. So God bless Turner's Classic Films for bringing him to a new audience.
