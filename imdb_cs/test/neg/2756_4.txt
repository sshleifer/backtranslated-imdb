I saw the MST3K version of this movie and it's a bad movie - but not as bad as its low IMDB rating (currently 1.8 out of 10). The film has at least several production values ​​and apparently had a competent editor (as opposed to films that are really horrible). The main problem with this movie is that it has no appealing characters at all. The main character, Marv, is so pathetically morose that he practically asks for all the bad things that happen to him. Neither is he too clever, or he would have figured out to stay away from the pleasing girl Betty. And even more miserable than Marv is his father, who is nothing but a drunken loser. The culmination of the film is a sequence of heist at the end, but even that is so weak, any excitement that could be added to the film is completely missing. At least this movie made for a very humorous episode of MST3K because Mike and 'Bots do a great job of making fun of it.
