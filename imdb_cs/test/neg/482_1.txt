I love so-called "blaxploitation" movies and I've seen dozens. Some of them, such as COTTON ARE TO HARLEM, SHAFT, and HAMMER, have excellent manufacturing value and are very entertaining, while many others are very cheap and silly, yet entertaining, such as BROTHERHOOD OF DEATH or COFFEY. But DOLEMITE manages something rare for this genre - it's just cheap and silly and not the least fun! It's like blaxploitation for very, very stupid people. <br /> <br /> Years ago I saw a take-off on Dolemite movies on "Mad TV" and unfortunately, the real DOLEMITE is no better. Like parody, acting is just cruel. Rudy Ray Moore has all the charm and charisma of a piece of balsa wood. He can barely read his lines and his "karate" is a joke - with his kicks apparently missing the goal again and again. As for the other actors, many might be even worse. My favorite was the FBI guy who couldn't even remember his lines and really tried to get them out - yet they didn't bother to shoot these scenes again! In fact, it was so little that I had a hard time figuring out whether the film was intended as a joke. <br /> <br /> If you think that despite the horrible actions and actions that are worth seeing this movie, you are wrong. Even for those perverts who hope to see some skin, they will be disappointed. Naked women in the movie really look like the hard luck of prostitutes and there's nothing remotely sexy about their sagging bodies. I think looking at old people naked - REEEAALLY old people naked - is no worse than looking at these "ladies". And as for Rudy Ray, he has "male breasts". No Black super-hero or anti-hero should look so badly naked !! For the sake, put on the clothes people and come up with a script that doesn't look like it was written winos !!! <br /> <br /> FYI - There seems to be actually a sequel to this movie! ! I can't imagine them, so you'll have to find someone else to check them out. I watched PLAN 9 FROM THE OUTSIDE SPACE, TEENAGERS FROM THE OUTSIDE SPACE and ROBOT MONSTER, but I don't think I can get to the next Dolemite movie - they're so bad!
