I saw a great clip of this movie I will talk about later, and then a list, and I thought I could go. Basically, the bartender down, Randy (Matt Dillon), his cousin Carl Harding (Paul Reiser) and the murder investigation, Detective Dehling (John Goodman), have something in common to see the girl of their dreams (whether they got married or not) ), and they would do anything to die with her and even die. All three of them met / saw her "One Night in McCool", the bar that Randy was working on had no knowledge of each other, but all three can't stop thinking about Femme Fetale Jewel Valentine (Lord of the Rings Liv Tyler). All three tell their stories to someone they hope to listen to their very intense and revealing stories, interviews with Randy, who talks to Burmeister (Michael Douglas, who produced the film), Carl with psychologist / psychiatrist Dr. Reba McEntire) and Dehling's priest Father Jimmy (Richard Jenkins). They admit all the details of what they were willing to do, their sexual contact with her, and eventually they are all assembled in one place, all intending to be with her and all involved in the final shootout that leaves one dead. they run (and eventually die) and one overwhelmed, and the unexpected guy he chooses (but at the same time is obvious because he is a sex obsessed with Douglas). Also starring Andrew Dice Clay as Utah / Elmo and Sandy Martin as Bingo Vendor Woman. If I had to choose a favorite moment, it would surely be what was mentioned on 11 along with Cool Hand Luke on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments, where Tyler copies a woman who washes her car with foam all over and Goodman, very sexy ! Besides, not the most memorable movie. Good!
