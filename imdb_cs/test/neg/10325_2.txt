I add 2 - I to Guy Ritchie and Woody Allen. We don't even remember what the movie was about. The only thing we recall is one firing scene where actors fall to the ground, return to the other side of the corridor or something and then return to filming. It was like watching 80-year-olds with two broken legs trying to do stunts. Also, when the characters drove in the truck, the noise of the engine (or radio? Can not remember) would disappear completely when the actors spoke. Front Cover Sandra Bullock. very sad, very bad.
