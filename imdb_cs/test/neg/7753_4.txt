I bought a DVD to get Julie Ormond. Well, I got it in spades. She was beautiful in romantic scenes. too bad Bill Paxton flew to autopilot for all his efforts. I almost lost my lunch when he took his big fat white out of his flight suit to say "engage" with Julia. "I followed 'Sabrina' with a French soundtrack to see if Julia called her own dialogue. They used someone else. In any case, Julia was selected for this Dutch film through a native French speaker with sufficient English to communicate with an American airman. at least one well-known name for the British-American market, Julie could be handed over to my unknown eye for the Belgian. <br /> <br /> The film was a strange one, a Dutch film about Belgium in World War II. I would think that national pride would require the German attackers the theme of heroic Dutch resistance, and the Belgians were much more passive than the French or Norwegians during the occupation, with the most fierce fighting of all coming in the Balkans, where Tito's Communist guerrillas gave the Germans a fit. to lose this impression. <br /> <br /> After a few Watching this movie multiple times suddenly lit up as the movie is out of season, set on June 16, 1944, when an American plane crashes in a Belgian farm land. Trees look mid autumn with lots of leaves and the weather is warm. People walk in light clothing and the grass is still green. There is no small trace of snow or ice. That must have been the mildest winter in Belgium. The real storyline of the movie was a mess. Where to start? For those interested in the history of World War II, the film encountered a farce. The reconnaissance aircraft was a huge four-engine converted bomber. Such aircraft existed, but would require a massive fighter escort to survive. In fact, smaller and faster aircraft were readily available and would have been far more suitable for the task. The vital codebooks in the movie would never be transmitted on the plane. The crew didn't need this information to complete their mission, while compromising this information would be a huge defeat of intelligence. Even given the film's premise, the first items to be removed from the plane would be the codebook. They would be on their way to Berlin within 10 minutes of the arrival of German soldiers at the crash site. The home of Daussois, where Major Brice resorted, was a farm where no one was interested in farming. Food would be very rare in Belgium at this time. The Germans would need a significant amount of locally produced food to support their forces. The family car would have been expropriated long before the arrival of the American airman. Likewise, there would be no fuel to operate it. The plot where Henri Daussois turns out of jealousy in America is pathetic. He would have to reveal everything he knew about resistance so he could live. He would have to act as a double agent to thwart any effective opposition. A woman with a secret radio would never survive the war. "Major Brice" was captured in civilian clothing at the end of the movie. This made him a spy under the laws of war and was responsible for the execution without defense. He could not humbly surrender to face the interrogation without limitation by the Geneva Convention. They'd rather force them to kill him and save their friends if possible. I did not read the novel on which this film is based. If this film is a faithful adaptation, it shows a huge lack of development in the novel. Regardless of the novel, screenwriters could easily produce an excellent script that would not lose this opportunity to deliver a much better film.
