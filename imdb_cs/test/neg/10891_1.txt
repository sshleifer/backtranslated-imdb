There are films that are so bad they're good. Then there are movies like Rest Stop that should never be made because they are just terrible. Bad Gaming, Unimaginable Characters, Predictable Conspiracy, and Allegedly a Supernatural Twist That Nothing Fails to Story. Half the decent special effects are the only thing that deserves a note. I can't even bring myself to write the outline of the plot because all I really want to do is warn you not to waste your time and money on this movie. Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this movie at all. It's 1.5 hours of your life that you'll never get back. <br /> <br /> 1/10
