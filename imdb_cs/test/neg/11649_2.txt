This movie worked along with some of the most predictable stories and shallow characters he has ever seen. Of course, the writer bought the book "How to Write a Movie about a Space Catastrophe" and followed her to play by play. Especially the stereotypical use of astronauts who talk to their loved ones from space - putting on a bold show in the face of a disaster - has been done over and over. Max Q seems to have been written in the hopes that manufacturers will project $ 50 million in the project. But according to the second half of the film, which included numerous attempts at special effects, producers could only get $ 50,000. To learn that the movie was nominated for "Special Visual Effects" Emmy made me absolutely gob-smacked. I think a handful of high school students with Media Studies could create more credible effects! And the plot of the holes is too much to mention. But as an example I choose one. Now I'm no NASA expert, but it is very unlikely that a worker connected to a shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a power position in the control room when things begin to collapse into the program. Certainly there is someone more experienced in Mission Control who would be called by the program director rather than twenty-nine years old who wasn't in the control room earlier. The only saving mercy for this film is Bill Campbell's work. He can make a good attempt to save something from the train wreck, which is the scenario. I give this film 2 out of 10, with Bill Campbell's above-average work in the lead from the bottom mark.
