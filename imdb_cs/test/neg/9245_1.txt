Why would someone do such a movie? Why would someone invest in such a movie? Why would someone in film business work on such a movie? Why would a theater have such a movie? Why would a TV channel program such a movie? Why would every critic bother to review such a film? Why would anyone watch this movie like that? Why should mental examinations not be done with writers / producers / film directors like this? Sometimes there are films that are so bad that they are good. That's a movie that's so horrible it's awful. Indeed, IMDb has to introduce a "0" or even a minus scale to take on the works of this terribly demanding horror.
