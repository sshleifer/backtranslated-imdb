Just to save you $ 3 or anything worth renting movies in your local video store, and a breathtaking hour-and-how long-this-film-there is a simple plan. Go to a friend's house, talk to them to rent Pest, watch the first 30 seconds or so and then exchange your apology for leaving. The opening sequence is really fun, it's definitely worth watching. Unfortunately, another 99% of the film is terrible. Without a shower scene at the beginning, it's one of the worst movies ever.
