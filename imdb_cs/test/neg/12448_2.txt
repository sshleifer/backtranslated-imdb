That was bad enough - from bad acting, bad technical details, bad camera shots, and bad sound (even though I was watching a DVD, sometimes I couldn't hear what they were saying, sometimes it was my speakers, even inside. Same conversation). The storyline was predictable, and the characters consisted of mostly incredible neurotics, bi-polars, and cartoons. The evolution of the characters was a terrible ... brother's little sister (why was she even written in the script?), That annoying mum (again - what purpose?) An adorable girlfriend (why she didn't let her go long ago), "dark suits" gang (how original - I couldn't think of a better name I think), hot girl drug dealers (they must have hot Latina if you have LA gangs I think, but really ...), etc. I can't believe I watched the whole thing.
