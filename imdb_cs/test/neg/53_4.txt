I do not get it! Teenage leads in "Horror Star", allegedly all are devoted horror fans, but when their favorite idol (Conrad Radzoff) goes away, they dig out his corpse and do all the disrespectful things like disco-dancing around the house and throwing the remnants of food. It doesn't sound like something real horror fans would do, now? I am a big horror fan and I am extremely idolizing outgoing icons like Vincent Price, Peter Cushing and Boris Karloff, but I never thought to remember their memory. No wonder Conrad comes back from the dead? undoubtedly, after the session? wipe them off the ground! Mr. Radzoff was no longer known for his friendship in life because he sometimes killed directors who disagreed with his visions, and even after his death, suffered a huge ego. Even inside his tomb, there are videos that could shorten potential visitors, and a group of teenagers live to enjoy enjoying a murderous business outside their movie sets. "Horror Star" (a.k.a. "Frightmare" and "Body Snatchers") is a fearsome shocking movement of 80 years, but there's a handful of cheesy & gory highlights. The film mainly suffers from its own stupid plot because nobody? nor a film school student ??? he's stupid enough to steal a recently buried corpse and actually thinks he's going to get away with her, and there are too many lengthy moments to fight. Conrad's video-speeches from behind the grave are extremely talkative and undermine the tension, but on the other hand his killing methods are pleasantly inventive. One teenager enjoys the experience of being cremated alive and others (Jeffrey Combs in one of his first roles!) Losing his head in a wonderful decapitation sequence. In the most complicated succession, a poor girl's head is crushed by a coffin. Writer / director Norman Thaddeus Vane wanted to bring a tribute to the year of horror cinema and apparently how to make a film look sinister. Places and scenery are great, but Vane lacked the necessary funds to provide his film with proper continuity and editing. The performances are overall decent, with Ferdy Mayne (imitating Christopher Lee) and Jeffrey Combs playing the most memorable roles. "Horror Star" can hardly be called a necessity to see or even a good movie, but it is worth watching in case you are an admirer of B-horror enthusiasts.
