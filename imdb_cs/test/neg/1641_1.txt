(spoilers) I am pretty much a SEEN movie that this horrible movie was a sequel. His name was Ator Battle Eagle and I saw it when I was only 8 years old. He gave me such a terrible impression that I never forgot it. I was a fan of MST3K for a long time, so when Cavedwellers went out on the tape, I bought it. I was horrified to realize that it was a continuation of the poor film Ator, which I saw long ago! The Ator's costume somehow got past the last time I ever saw him. How can she wear those little bikinis? He doesn't care that it points to the fact that he doesn't ... have a package? And the poor Thong ... he doesn't get any lines and no girl, and he must follow that curly hair girl doofus Ator around all the time. Did anyone else notice that Miles O'Keefe was a woman? No wonder he's not interested in a nice one, because somewhat unusual Meel. I'm sure evil, but angry evil Zor guy is more of his taste. I loved Zora's cardboard spray painted with a swan and the way he'd been trying to touch a part of Ator all the time. Combat scenes are so poorly choreographic that it's a miracle that swords can sometimes come together. The blunt old man spends all his time and is depressed. Ator drinks from the cup he was given to him by the man who hates him, and then looks surprised to be drugged. But he had to be quite clever - he invented a hang glider in space for five seconds and then flew it into a crevasse in the space / time continuum, so he briefly traveled to Bulgaria for the 17th century. It was after stabbing a giant snake puppet, of course, and saved the post of coel Meela while she was sitting around doing absolutely nothing. The real hero of the film was Thong, who had several times rescued Ator from his boundless stupidity and killed the evil Zora in the covenant. Kudos to Thong, the only competent person in the entire film.
