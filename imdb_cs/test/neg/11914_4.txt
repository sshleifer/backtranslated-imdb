Neither of the Monograms is better (don't even be fun here). Shanghai Cobra has a lot to do, but in the end it is too confusing and crowded to be too satisfying. The film opens with a murderer named Shanghai Cobra, who has already hit twice and is now in a scene with a guest. We have a guy, a girl and another guy who has some supposed connection when one man dies on the streets. Yes, I am simplifying things here for brevity, because it is really the core of the problems with this film - it has too much without a real, fulfilling explanation. I didn't even go to a cookbook that has some participation and a box that talks to you and has a screen and doesn't seem to have a problem with it! All this in the first five minutes. Then Chan enters a movie that works for the government and flies to help a friend. He also has the right to control the radio store in the bank and is looking for a man wrapped in bandages to help arrest in Shanghai many years ago. I found the conspiracy very involved, as mentioned earlier. Toler is back as Chan. He is always friendly. Benson Fong and Mantan Moreland are back too. They both do a good job and are pretty fun. But the convoluted plot didn't convince me, and most of the movie was watched with a strange, questioning look. This is not a bad movie, which is not only very interesting, except the most dedicated Chan fans.
