Lance used quality support from James Cameron. Hell, he even had his own television show (Millennium) for the coupl'a period. Why is he doing it? Couldn't find a better way to pay your bills? <br /> <br /> I like a good low budget movie. Some of them can only laugh at their ridiculous assumption, their textbooks, stereotypical characters, or often because the actors are related to the director / producers. But this film has no redeeming value. I didn't laugh. I didn't cry. I had only the sick feeling in my stomach. The feeling was quickly identified as a pity. At one point, Lance Henriksen was an A-list supporting actors. He was in Terminator (he was going to BE terminator before Arnold appeared), Aliens, AliensIII, classic B-movie Pumpkinhead, among so many others! I wanted to send him money. Maybe we should start a Lance support fund or something. Then again for doing this thing ... maybe not.
