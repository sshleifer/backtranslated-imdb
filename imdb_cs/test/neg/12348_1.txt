I was looking for a documentary of the same journalistic quality as Frontline or "Fog of War" (Errol Morris). Instead, I was appalled by this shallow and na√Øve description of a very complicated and disturbing man and his regime: Albert Fujimori. This film should be called "The Return of Fujimori". The director assumes she made a "perfect" film because she alienates both profi and anti-Fujimor factions when she is in fact a very biased and unprofessional work. The film has several crucial facts wrong: <br /> <br /> 1) Uses the so-called "landslide" elections in 1995, in which Fujimori was re-elected with 65% of the vote. , as an example of the massive popular support of Fujimori. But we all now know that this is the fruit of a very organized electoral fraud. 2) The film states that Sendero Luminoso (the shining road) killed 60,000 people. In fact, the Commission's Final Report on Truth states that there were 69,280 deaths from political violence in Peru. 33% of them were caused by SL. This leaves another 67% in the hands of the police, the army and other groups. The fact that using the same misleading information Fujimori has been using for 10 years is another example of how awful this movie is. For anyone who has an education about Peruvian politics and history, Fujimori is clearly the perfect manipulator, a vicious character and an infallible egomaniac. His regime was far from democratic. It is still a threat to the Peruvians. Despite these facts, director Fujimori tells the story. Not only how he wants the camera to be placed, but the story and direction of the film seem to be part of his political agenda. He always has the last word. There are no journalistic "cojones", just soft questions and unquestionable remarks. Where is Oriana Fallaci when we need her? When the director was questioned after the screening, he did not hide the fact that Fujimori had deeply impressed him, his charm and intelligence. Yes, she was definitely enchanted by him, and you can tell by looking at this movie. Obviously, it is very difficult to spend a lot of facts pointing to his responsibility for corruption, murder and fraud. She assured viewers that Fujimori was really a "patriot" when, a few moments earlier, one of Peru's leading journalists was very relentless when he told us that Fujimori was primarily a "traitor". She went on to say that despite all the charges that were not "the only dollar", his bank account was in his name, etc. It was like hearing the same gang of unscrupulous criminals who ruled the country for 10 years and defended the master. It was a sad moment for journalism. This film is for the history of injustice. It is an insult to hundreds of dead people, disappeared or unjustly imprisoned by Fujimori's regime. No wonder she later admitted that all the Peruvian intellectuals she befriended, and at the same time made it a betrayed movie. Objective? Instead, I am attacked by the words "opportunistic", "naive" and "denial".
