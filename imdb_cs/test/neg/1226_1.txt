He was really looking forward to continuing Lonesome Dove, but this was a total garbage. Cinematography was terrible. He shot too tightly. He almost saw the Grand Canyon across the stationary telescope. Cut, cut, cut. Not smooth. Rather like a bad student editor. I don't know if McMurtry made the screen, but the dialogue was terrible. Really as Val Kilmer's view of Doc Holiday in Wyatt Earp, but what the hell was he doing with this character in Comanche Moon ??? I have no idea. It looked like he was shot on the soundstage with the old Bonanz sets. How can Lonesome Dove be so bad with this director? Where was his head .............. Can't say much about acting either. It is a pity that I was so rushed to be so beautiful a west that could be, but just to get him into a cannon. Read more reviews and find out that others have felt the same. Even the curiosity to watch the next few nights, because it would be just a waste of time like the first night. <br /> <br /> (2nd place) .............. .... OK, because nothing else was on TV, I have to be honest and admit I was watching the last 2 nights in Comanche Moon. And I'll be honest to tell you that I didn't get to the end of either of the last two episodes because I fell asleep! I can only admit that I watched two main characters carefully and I could choose some of the maneuvers that Steve Zahn had done in portraying the character Duval had done so well. I have to give credit to Zahn. As for the depiction of Karl Urban ... free of dead meat. I can only say again that I was very disappointed just because I cared so much about the original LD ​​and as others ....... defended my feelings for a really great western.
