If directors / producers / publicists wish to promote the film as "based on real events" and make a film to inspire and make sense, then to start, to preserve any kind of credibility and integrity, you would like to keep the film as honest as you can. The team that wears "all black" jumpers and makes haka in America is just stupid. Every half an intelligent person would know that "all blacks" are a national team of Rugby Union from New Zealand and their jumpers are all black and Haka is doing them as part of traditional Maori dance. Having such a stupidity in the film, without explanation, only reduces the film's credibility to zero and negates the message and inspiration the film seeks to achieve. The question is "Why"? Why would you do such a stupid thing and for what kind of profit? I can only say that writers or directors or producers have seen it on television before the international Rugby Union match and the idea of ​​"wow, that would be great in our movie, no one will know it is It never happened that they are too stupid to know about NZ nd all blacks, it will be great. "<br /> <br /> How would an Americian audience respond to a film made in NZ about American Iron Grid, with a team that wears American Indian costumes and war colors, makes a native American Indian war dance, run in circles screaming" oh woo woo woo, oh woo woo woo "respond? They would laugh at their heads! <br /> <br /> People who made this film and the industry that spawned it should have their heads read. For some reason, the industry thinks that they can "fool all people all the time". <br /> <br /> It's just stupid!
