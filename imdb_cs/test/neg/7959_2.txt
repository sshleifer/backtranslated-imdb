I am a big fan of Deep Mehta's work, especially Fire and Earth 1947. Unfortunately, this movie of her eyes is missing _all_, which is needed for a good movie. The film tries to show the situation of a widow in India at the beginning of the 20th century and a new wave of ideas for their rehabilitation at the same time. Pointed with the child's widow as a central character, although the storyline was too banal from an Indian point of view, it could still be a very strong film. Alas! the film lacked both the sensitivity of the fire and the intensity of the emotions on Earth 1947. Although man assumes that the story is given, though there are hundreds of things that I would otherwise like, Well, filming is especially unfortunate. Everything is said. Everything is shown straight. Absence of sensitive implied sentences. The absence of things remained unspoken. I couldn't believe it was Deep Meht's movie. There were some very standard Hindu film characters - like an old widow with her own interests, or a father who has a double meter of top quality. Can't write a script without these old style standard Indian movie characters? Many people appreciated Deepa for making a film and proving a point against Hindu fundamentalists. I agree that she has taken a bold step, but should not worry about the quality of the film, or is itself controversial. Obviously, if you start with a story like in the water, you will feel that widows will feel painful. And the movie had nothing more than that! So where is Deepa's contribution to the movie? And talk about acting, etc. - pathetic !!! Lisa Ray has a pretty face, a very pretty face - but that's where she ends. He cannot speak Hindi; can not emotion. John Abraham is no better. Most widows seem unnatural. The saving grace is Seema Biswas and the young girl. They're wonderful. And that was a contemporary film - but Hindu dialogues suck in great time. Even there, the statement is as unnatural as it is. No rustic accents !!! No local slang. No nothing. All that was right was probably the filming location. I thought the vidhwa-ashram file was reasonably real. The overall blue tint throughout the film is also apt. But they're not all watching these movies. You won't get anything. There is nothing in the story or direction. If you have to look at the girl doing it.
