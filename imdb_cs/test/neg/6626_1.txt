Is it a bad movie? Don't take my word for it. Consider the following press releases of people trying to watch this movie: While watching this movie, Mr. Harold Faber's brain from Sanduska, Ohio, was forcibly thrown out of the skull. 200 km / h and avoid curling on the ground, shouting NOOOO NOOO NOOOO. Ms. Louise Robbins of Enid, Oklahoma, a 69-year-old retired housewife, committed a ritual seppuko with a knife in butter while watching this movie. Mrs. Janine Hosmer from Columbia, South Carolina gave birth to a seriously deformed child while watching this movie, even though she wasn't pregnant. While watching this film together, Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Wells of San Francisco, California, spontaneously exploded with such force that Mr. Wells' left tibia joint was later found in a house wall in Marin County. <br /> <br /> There have been many similar incidents. Of those who had no serious consequences, such as those described in detail above, at least 75% became undeniably, violently and, of course, insane after seeing this movie. The remaining 25%, most of them were crazy before they overlooked the film; the residue was either blind and / or deaf or in a permanent vegetative state. I'm not saying you don't want to rent it if you want to. I'm just reporting what was in the paper.
