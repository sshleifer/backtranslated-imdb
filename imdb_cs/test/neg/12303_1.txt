Shame Shame Shame on UA ​​/ DW for What You Do! <br /> <br /> I was horrified. Don't let kids see this movie. Humor is totally unsuitable for children - plus it gets bored and disappoints. Certainly * we all * read Theo's amazing children's book, and we certainly have expectations ... but this is pure waste. Dr. Seuss would be ashamed and certainly would never give his "thumbs" in such an attempt to earn a classic. <br /> <br /> What a pity. Spend your money on the book. If you own a copy, then book and donate it to the children's toys program. This film is NOT for "free" viewing of tickets. Hold on to the book. The TV version of the cartoon works well if you want a visual display - save money ... seriously. SAVE YOUR MONEY - It will be on the cable of the patty's day. Shame Shame Shame On What They Do!
