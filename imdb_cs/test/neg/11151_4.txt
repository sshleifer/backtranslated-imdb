I like Arnold, and I love the theme, but it was a very disappointing movie. When I first saw the previews, they were dark and ominous, and Arnold's name was not mentioned. But I knew him, which led me to believe that he made a film that has a more serious, exciting mood. That it wasn't just another Schwarzenegger (though I admit his majority is pretty good!). So far, he has avoided any religious theme movies. And I was excited. I was wrong. This is just another action, a blast, a movie about a fire. And it's pretty bad.
