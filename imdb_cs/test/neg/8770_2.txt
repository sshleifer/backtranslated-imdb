... not to waste time watching this futile project. I had my comment deleted twice, for reasons I haven't understood yet, except suspecting that someone who deals with "Gone" is not satisfied with what I had to say. So this time I was telling things until I got into them, with an excerpt from my original comments that could by no means be considered a personal attack on anyone, nor an unfair commentary: <br /> <br /> " "Gone" is the kind of train wreck that gives new meaning to words, a terrible, contradictory dialogue, a scenario that just plain peanut like a fish out of the water, playing that would be embarrassed by the friendliest theater theater community, cinematography Inspired by the "Survivor" school moves in crane shots, followed by a static shot, close-ups of nostrils, terrible ADR work, special visual effects that are not, music for pedestrians that absolutely cannot keep any mood or emotions, terrible adjustments with absolutely perfect nonsense freezes and disappearing, no artistic directions to talk about --- litany of badness just goes on and on ... I felt right Avdu cheated from the time it took me before I made most of it ... were better digested staring at the wall ... Under no circumstances would anyone at the unhappy to read this topic yourself to this "movie" since long before before they finish, they will want them to be "ripped out" before they made the mistake. "<br /> <br /> The case is closed. Amen.
