I am surprised to read all the positive comments on this film. Even my 4 and 6 years old were bored. Chipmunks are cute ... but the story is too obvious. Not recommended for young people with the least sophisticated taste. While we were visiting, we heard several viewers from the audience; But I was wondering why. <br /> <br /> I don't admit I've ever been a 'chipmunks' fan but I expected to be entertained. It's not even an 'escapist' movie if I can tell. Simply heavy handed look at 'success too young booty'. Have we seen more than enough of what we are with Britney Spears, et al, we? <br /> <br /> Don't bother.
