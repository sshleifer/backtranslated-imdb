Ivan the Terrible is a more filmed scene than "big-screen-opus". Citizen Kane - a similar work in many ways - is the opposite (in the way we expect such a fare) in that he has a lot of filming space for example. Acting is intended to express the motivation and thinking of the characters for the audience; if he succeeds in understanding the nature of what matters, how did it happen? And because of the low number of actions, how else can it be to express events that affect the story, and consequently, the machinations of the characters and decisions other than "exaggerated movements"? Also, there is a historical level of why acting should not surprise you. The rise of totalitarian regimes in Germany and the USSR forced filmmakers who stayed to shoot films as they knew. Because they were prevented from accessing more modern works, which showed the development and technology of cinemas, they used only what they knew. Nazi government control in Germany destroyed the great German film industry of the 1920s due to their total control of the film industry. And propaganda movies can only "amuse" German troops so much; for example, the need for popular German silent films of the 1920s, for example. So a lot of Ivan Horrible Film technicians would be derived from such captured German films that were delivered to the film crew (as mentioned in other notes). Nowhere was he confused, and although he personally found it exaggerated, it is by no means a bad movie experience - and certainly NOT among the worse movies at all. The game is fine and some of the cinematography is excellent (even today's standards, more below). Definitely not popcorn flick; one cannot leave his brain outside his door. Perhaps a very symbolic date - it is worth watching on the big screen if it is unable to watch movies with lights turned off at home, as many of the movie elements are lost in these movies mainly in black and white. It all depends on what you expect with ... <br /> <br /> WARNING - SPOILERS: You do not read the following comments if they affect your personal view of the movie (s). and if we do not mind the obvious Communist propaganda (as opposed to capitalist propaganda). For Ivan, as Stalin himself saw - obviously in his influence on the film direction (see other comments) - and anyone with world-wide historical awareness outside the American perspective will understand. Maybe Ivan was a former Stalin incarnation, or maybe not; it is rather a diatribe on Stalin and his motivation, decision, loneliness, promotion of footage, etc. - using Ivan's personality - than any historical record of Ivan. Also note the obvious use of each color in the following: Red (for the USSR) in the banquet scene. And maybe blue (for the US) during certain shots when the wearer wears a crown? But he has many excellent visual effects, such as deep shadowing, or the outward shot of the begging Ivan returned to Moscow.
