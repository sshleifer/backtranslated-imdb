I believe that in 1997 Hollywood was not entirely at the point of openly celebrating homosexuality, so it might want to give some credit to those who put this film together to show some courage. He simply wants them to be given credit for having made a really good movie, and in my opinion "In & Out" does not apply to that number. It is the story of Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) - a small English high school teacher who, on the eve of his wedding, educates a former student who wins the Oscar and who then has to go through what can only be described as a period of self-knowledge when dealing with a gay man. For me, this was the first problem with this movie. In fact, Howard didn't have to be gay. The film would be more fun (and perhaps even more provocative thoughts) had Brackett remained defiantly straight despite the stereotypically homosexual aspects of his life and the city's belief after Oscar's speech that he was gay. (In fact, I thought that identifying him as a homosexual because of the presence of these stereotypes could actually be more offensive to the gay community, as well as to equal men who like poetry and believe in neat dressing!) <br /> < The kline was pretty decent in the role, and he carried the film very much. In addition to him, most of the other cast members (though fine actors) were people not really known for their success on the big screen. People like Tom Selleck and Wilford Brimley and Bob Newhart are good actors but not big movie stars. Actually, I thought the funniest (if very small) role in the movie was the super model Sonya, played by an actress named Shalom Harlow (Speaking of stereotypes, I loved her oh-so stereotypical model line I promised I will have to shower and vomit! ”Finally, what really changed me about this film was an absurd ending, starting with graduation (and honestly, even when someone decided that it was really necessary, the film was supposed to end there instead of to continue with absolutely useless wedding ceremonies at the end.) Basically, I had a few laughs, but nothing more. 3/10
