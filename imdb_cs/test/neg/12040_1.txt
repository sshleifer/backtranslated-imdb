The opening scene really got me into watching the movie. However, no more than 5 minutes later, I was already putting my eyes out. Not only could I not understand the word that was being said, it could be better for a group of mentally disabled. One of the highlights of this movie was that there was a punk white dwarf. However, I am quite a bit connected on how a white dwarf was a child of two African Americans. But I think anything is possible. Also, why the hell was Robin? I'm not sure if something has added it artistically. Overall, I strongly recommend jumping off the cliff before renting this movie.
