Diane Arbus (Nicole Kidman) can be justified as an early childhood child as the first representation of the 60's turmoil that followed. The film itself does not deserve such a width. The lack of character development, motivation, and justification for the character's behavior makes the film very disappointing. I sat and watched and waited for some explanation of bizarre actions to find out that Shainberg had let me see a story that had to be inside a joke. The fact that a few presented facts did not correspond to the life of Diane Arbus did not help or clarify things. The washed-out direction of Art in "normal" life of Diane was nicely contrasted with the brilliant colors in her life with Lionel. And the stairway door was a fine example of Diana's attempt to inject her new life into her existing family (but I don't see how the door to the dining room's ceiling could be directly connected to Lionel's apartment two years ago) from the stairs upstairs. Perhaps my analysis is a bit too literal in looking for some character development and a relationship of understanding that goes beyond one sentence or one comment. I would also like to see at least one of Diana's photos. I'm not waiting for the sequel.
