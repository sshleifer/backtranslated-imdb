I got it on a double DVD called "Scream Theater" and it's undoubtedly one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen. And I saw a few really bad ones. The school is gone, and of the three girls (who, if they are teenagers, that I would eat a hat) are talking about a "non-stop party", so of course they all go to the house of a girl whose parents are the strictest to sleep on. Meanwhile, a psychotic fled from a local bug-house where one girl's father works and is freelancer with sharp objects and wearing green scrubs, and sports wide open eyes ... I think it has to show he's bonkers. Of course, because he has the bone he chooses with this doctor, he goes to his home, whose location is obviously well known. Meanwhile, some dumb-jock types bang down the beer and out scare the girls, and of course the loony appears too and starts cutting the neck. And that's about how heavy metal music is moving in the background. Or maybe it isn't, but really, that's all you need to know. If you do not spend your time stoned or drunk, you will find that you are not very interested in it, and even if you are lost unnecessarily most of the time, you will probably still consider your intelligence insulted. 1 out of 10.
