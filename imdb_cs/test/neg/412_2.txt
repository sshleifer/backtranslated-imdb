I entered the film and waited for a small action mixed with a strong story. I understand that changes between written works and films must be made ... for many reasons. Changing the relationship between scientists (they were the father - the daughter in the book) CERN Director was excluded, causing the scene between Carmeleng and the director to be changed to Carmelengo and the head of the Swiss Guard in the Pope's office. Ron Howard made sure his father was inserted as a cardinal with the cardinal. the accent of hay but lacked all symbolism. Both Lagdon and Carmelengo climbed into the heavens in a Hanks helicopter that landed in the river and the priest landed on the chapel as described as a Christlike image. At some point, this film has to be redesigned by the director who does the job
