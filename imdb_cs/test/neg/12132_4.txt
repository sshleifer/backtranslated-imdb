The First Watched 4/30/2009 - 4 of 10 (Dir-John Waters): Corny Waters-like comic musical with some funny scenes and good parts, but that didn't mean it was good. John Waters directed this music full of 50s spoofs when Johnny Depp plays the title role. This movie is very similar to what it did with the 60th spoof called "Hairspray," but it is not as effective. Some of the tunes are catchy, some characters are interesting in their unpredictable way, and the views are fine, though sometimes exaggerated. The story is similar to "Grease", where there is a good group and a bad group. The bad group guy, Cry Baby, wow is a good group girl. The good girl then joins the wrong group, but as soon as Cry Baby hurts her - she returns to a good group. It just sets the end where Cry Baby tries to get her back. Now, one difference that is expected in Water movies is that a bad group doesn't seem all bad all the time and a good group behaves as though they have a pole up their-know-what. I definitely saw it in Hairspray. It's not that much fun and goofy in this movie, but it leaves us as if the film could be much better. Johnny Depp's initial challenge is to be able to curl one tear down his face at different times (that is, his namesake) and make him all over the place. This is exaggerated and the underlying bottom is that the movie is fine, but not so great.
