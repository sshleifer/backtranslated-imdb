I am not generally a fan of high school comedies, relying heavily on humor in bad taste, and seldom wandering away from the clich√©s of stories and characters and downright boring dialogue. But I had a share of guilty pleasures, especially when I was alone in high school. Seeing oh-so-recognizable teachers had their butts kicked always pleased and occasional laughter could also be the case. These movies only work if at least one of the characters is immediately sympathetic, in the case of 'Cheats', especially not the protagonists, that was not the case. Of course, it didn't help that the actor in the game was one of the most irritating, not talented, arrogant kids I've ever seen in comedy. Acting in a comedy is not a joke, it's hard to be funny: the delivery must be fine or the material goes to waste. In this case, it was not very good to start and the jokes that were half funny were professionally cast. This movie was 3 hours long, the director never heard of stimulation obviously. Stay away from this, there are many other fun teen comedies out there, like 10 things I hate about you who's your dad and Superbad.
