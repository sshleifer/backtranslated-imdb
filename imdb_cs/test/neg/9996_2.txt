This is a rough, inert, confident bore. When the only thing that suddenly gives movie life is hanging, you know the business is corrupt. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Truman Capote as a narcissistic, tic-ridden, self-indulgent, cartoon-voiced, insect-like cartoon. Why it is this way is never explained and we lack the underlying information. The scenario focuses on Capote's writing "In Cold Blood" and his link to the brothers who murdered a family of four. The acclaimed writer 'Kill A Mockingbird', Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), accompanies Capote in his initial crime quizzes, and her presence immediately indicates a much more interesting topic for biopic. Unfortunately, Lee is quickly relegated to the endless scenes of Capote bemoaning his painful existence. Watching him is like watching Dr. Smith from "Lost in Space" complains about his "delicate back" to anyone who will listen for two hours. The difference is that Smith was funny while Capote wasn't. Rare film self-assassination kills him as well as Director Bennett Miller's unwillingness to add any kind of shading. The film, as well as the piano score, is one of the notes that provides no contrast, no emotional coloration, and no intimate drama. If Capote is really so uncomfortable, why shoot a movie about him and expect viewers to watch him? Although supportive roles are well implemented (Chris Cooper is his usual determined man), he serves such a small dramatic purpose, because in the end it's all about Capote (!) Director Bennett and screenwriter Dan Futterman fail to emotionally engage his intended audience because they were overwhelmed the cultural baggage of Capote's "legend." Their product is still born Oscar bait ... and there is more evidence that one big genre pic has more "truths" in it than a dozen piles of oh-so-honest bullshit like this.
