At first I wasn't sure who the movie was aimed at - it seemed like a children's story, but the kids don't understand it and they won't find it boring. There wasn't much to do, Bruce Willis wasn't drawn as an actor at all. He made a lot of views on his side with his half smile - unless you were interested in his big fan. And if it's a story you're interested in (a person who seems to have everything but is lacking emotionally, learns lessons from a child), I'd like to look at A Boy. He has everything that this film lacked, humor, sadness and reality.
