You might get something like that. I'm translating movies for life and it's the first movie in my five-year work experience that I found offensive to my intelligence. Of course, there are silly Hollywood movies about drunken teenagers for spring break, but those movies don't even claim to be serious works of art. But when someone strives for size and poetry, it brings a confused (and often absurd) story, lots of diverse scenes, pretentious dialogue ... Then you get the worst kind of movie that some other reviewers have defined very precisely as "pretentious crap". For those who consider this film to be intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it is your intelligence and your imagination that you have apparently used to try to create a sense of this pathetic attempt (it's in our human nature to try and give meaning of things). One more thing: I tolerate political misstatement very well, I am for artistic freedom and suspension of mistrust, but the Slavic female figure was too much. I wish someone told the director that it was a bit absurd (even in an unrealistic film) to portray a Slavic woman as a half-articulated disheveled creature associated with the forces of nature, probably because she spent her entire childhood. looking at stars and milking cows on a three-leg stool.
