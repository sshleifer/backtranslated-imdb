There is nothing I hate in the film more than conceit, and this is one of the most beautiful films ever made. It goes without saying in each frame: "See what deep, sophisticated film we do," says the director and screenwriter as they tell us and say to themselves: "Let's see how we can refute and confuse the audience even more. "I'd rather watch Ed Wood or Edgar G. Ulmer's worst movie than that. At least they gave us honest waste, and at least their films were fun. This film is as entertaining as the root canal without anesthesia, so it equals torture. Do these screenwriters ever hear the word 'story'? It does not look like that. They have a concept, are able to create an atmosphere, and have been able to put together an excellent cast and get good performances from them. And for what? To bore us an hour and 45 minutes? Nothing really happens in this movie. The only exciting part, and it only takes about two minutes, occurs when one of the soon-to-be-emigrated homeowners starts shooting at state employees who come to tell him he has to leave. But none of this comes. Too bad he didn't stop shooting until he hit the screenwriters. The only redeeming features of this film are acting and some beautifully photographed scenery to the end. 3/10
