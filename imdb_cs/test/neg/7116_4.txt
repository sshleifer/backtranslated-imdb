Mr Brento wonders if this film is produced by the same producers of the Dragonball Z television series, of course not. This is a real action movie in Hong Kong based on the first episodes of Japanese original artwork (which was also based on the comic book series). And I really don't know if it was made under the license of Dragonball creators ... <br /> <br /> The story of a monkey boy with special abilities is an ancient story known throughout Asia (in Japan, the boy's name in Songoku is in China is Sunwukong, it is Sonogong in Korea, etc.) and the story in Dragonball has a lot to do with the story. By the way, as I said, this film is based on the first episodes of Dragonball (which followed Dragonball Z, although I think the American version had another broadcast order). And all the scenes related to sexuality were also included in the original cartoon series (without being too crowded and so insistent!), But for your comments I can assume they were completely eliminated in American dubbing. Anyway, I agree with you that it is bad in the film and its bad adaptation. But maybe because nobody can forget it after watching him ...
