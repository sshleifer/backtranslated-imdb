This movie starts promisingly enough, but it gets a bit convoluted and captured in its stylistic charm. The set of designs, costumes and music was beautiful - as close as possible. The more I got into the movie, the more I felt as though it were for the director's entertainment, not for the audience. Although I enjoyed watching it, except for a few short music scenes, I can't say I enjoyed it. The director shows a huge imagination, but if he was entertained with the film, he could not share it with the audience, or at least with me. I didn't get a sense of whim and I didn't get into this universe. The great cause was (surprisingly) Zhang Ziyi. You can say he's trying very hard, but he seems to be so bad that he leaves almost amateurishly. She's a capable actress, but she has limitations. I noticed that in his acting work, he wasn't yet responding to his teammates, the mistake that created the emptiness of chemistry. The language barrier in this film seems to only make matters worse. She and Odagiri act as if they are on separate planets. She is also not a very good singer who made me every time she sang, but fortunately there were not too many scenes. Odagiri was fine, but he wasn't very impressed. I didn't even care for the characters separately. It really is a painful lack of characterization. The only reason to look after them seems to be that they are good looking. But without a convincing love story in the middle of the movie, it's hard to worry about what happens. The film also selects detours to smaller scenes that didn't add anything to the story and actually distracted attention. I had to rewind because when I went to the subplot, I couldn't remember what the hell we were doing in the main story. There were also scenes where it was hard to tell what was going on because it was so stylized. Mostly I'm just disappointed because I really like the concept behind this and there are a lot of things I love. Music and dance choreographies are really great. Supporting performances are uniformly excellent, fantastic in both acting and singing. It's too bad that the main actors were so bland.
