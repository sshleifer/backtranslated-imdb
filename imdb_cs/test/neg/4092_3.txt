The biggest problem with this movie is that it's not like Bruce Allmighty. The first film played on the imagination of every sprig that it is capable of controlling its surroundings as it sees fit. But Evan's experience is quite different. He has no control that Jim Carrey fools, and instead the story focuses on the power of faith. That would be fine because the first film preached the same message. The problem is that the continuation is a sermon at the expense of comic relief. And to add insult to injury it also throws in politics into conspiracy. You will get a clear feeling that there is a clear message with this film and its main goal is not to make you laugh. To sum up that film is a failed mix of Eddie Murhphy's "Distinguished Gentleman" and Charlton Heston's "Ten Commandments". I'm not sure if Steve Carrell is to blame, you feel it's his character that limits his comic abilities, the former news anchor Evan Baxter shouldn't be funny, he's basically an antagonist who has become the protagonist in this only contributes to the confusion of what this film report is about.
