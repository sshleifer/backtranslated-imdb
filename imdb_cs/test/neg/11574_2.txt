"In a remote lab, scientists are experimenting on (inserting a scaly creature here) and creating control monsters. Meanwhile, the military team / scientific daughter / bank robbers will find their way to a remote location and are amazed by the huge animals. a race that won't be blown up by the forces that initially created the monsters ... "The sad thing is it sounds like a dozen movies that have appeared on the Sci-Fi channel. I have to wonder what's going on? Sure ... I like bimbos and Hollywood-Hunk wannabes eat CGI animals as well as another person ... but where is the plot or originality? It is true that there are times when the Sci-Fi channel is lit. Battlestar Galactica, if a little dark, can be very good. The writers continued to pump life into various Stargate offers, and the latest BBC import of Doctor Who is surprisingly good. Even in various "giant animal" movies on Sci-Fi, animation seems to be getting better. Compare kommodo in this movie with a somewhat awkward version in the first huge kommodo movie on Sci-Fi. But good ... how is it with another conspiracy? Maybe some - a different-giant creature? On the whim I started searching the Internet. Among the litters I found some interesting stories that could appeal to SF fans and Russian CGI animators at once. I offer http://www.macrophile.com/~arilin/archive/metamorphosis-day to the network with a suggestion to contact the author for the rights to the story. (The story contains violent images generally at the same level as the various sci-fi channels). The story has a subplot, ethical and moral commentary on the nature of humanity and ends on one of those horrible "Really killed all the monsters ???" moments, but rather let you guess completely and in a completely different way of thinking. What's generally what science-fiction is supposed to do, isn't it?
