This is a totally useless remake. From the opening title to the original footage, it was a real mistake because it reminds the viewer of what a great little period work was. The new version that follows is an exercise in redundancy. Brian Kerwin plays a photographer of a "city boy" returning to a semi-deserted desert town settled by a scattering of undeveloped clichés. Daby-Doll Lolita, "ornery old exploiter, maimed veterinarian and his Asian wife, etc ... Kerwin's character testifies to" something "crashing uphill and shortly after they started Strange things make it happen because the strange blue rock pieces are scattered around. The temperature begins to rise, all the water in the area disappears, people start acting strangely, things explode. Kerwin's character gets into the car and gets out of it more often than is possible in one movie. The film makes no sense of place, no character development, no humor, no tension. Everything that Jack Arnold's original haunted little Cold War paranoia classic was abandoned. It just runs through its minimal hoops and then just ends. Special effects are not too strange - the interior of the ship looks like pieces of stuck foil wrapped around some ropes that were then hung in the front. The cameras frame some of the most uninspired and clunky wire-work ever put on the screen. The story is repeated - everyone says everything at least twice, while Kerwin says at least three times during the film, "Let's get out of here" twice in one scene. A lot of things will remain inexplicable at the end - why do aliens, for example, need all the heat and water? - not that someone cares about care; if filmmakers didn't care, why should we? Acting is adequate - it deserves better than a scenario that sometimes has improvised quality rehearsals. Although the actors often seem to want to cross it as quickly as possible - a remarkable example of this is when Elizabeth Peña registers the shortest, symbolic moment of "frustrated desperate hands to gesture gesture" before Stevie's annoying son begins to watch it do "Angry annoyed teenager smashing something off the table" gesture. Continuity errors include a sticker (GB) on the back of a Kerwin Jeep that appears and disappears, double acting gas in an exploding car, the city is in two places simultaneously - once in space. Elizabeth Stevie's POV shot as soon as he attacked, and Peña seemed to close the car door twice. The film makes the biggest mistake. It's boring.
