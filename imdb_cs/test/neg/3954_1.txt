Bad, bad movie. When I saw the synopsis, I was expecting something like a Ring with a video game instead of a tape. Nothing like that happened. I admit that the idea is interesting and can be turned into a good movie, but that's not it. First you choose a real man, Countess Bathory, a stupid step that doesn't give anything to the story. Anyone who would be cautious about her in her story would wonder why and how this Hungarian nobleman ended up in this film. Choosing a generic spiritful spirit would be much, much better. Then there is the whole game that is a game in the game-in-real life. As I said, interesting, Ring-like story. But instead of evolving into a good story, it's just flows and without explanation why this game has become what it is, why it was created, and so on. Wasting a good idea. Finally, the film doesn't have bloody funny parts that can, if not, save horror movies at least. The death scenes are too fast and the acting is too wooden to be fun. <br /> <br /> Avoid if possible.
