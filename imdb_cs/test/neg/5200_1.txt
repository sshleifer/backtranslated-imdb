Since I am required to write at least 10 lines and this garbage deserves not only one, I will begin with the following words: 1. I voted for this terrible so-called film. > 2. Let me explain why these turkeys are produced by David Varod mainly in my beautiful homeland, Bulgaria (just in BTW, for illiterate people around - this country is in EUROPE, north of Greece and has nothing to do with Mexico and Uruguay) A few years ago, NU Image invaded our country and started making crappy mostly straight to video versions. Why here? Because there are extremely low fees to the Bulgarian crew and Bulgarian actors (most of whom are known), which are in many ways better than most of their American colleagues. I am ashamed of it personally. The reason is, of course, the kindness of the participating Americans and their desire to get the most if not the whole profit. In fact, it wouldn't be so bad if only production wasn't so dirty and pale. For years there was no good picture. At present, the NU picture is being sued here for a very controversial purchase of our national cinema production center, Boyana Films. There is no doubt that there was corruption, there was a fallacy, there was a lie in this recent purchase. Bulgarian cinema is dead. Long live the Bulgarian cinema!
