Not much to say about that. It's really, really bad. The game is bad, the script is bad and editing is probably one of the worst jobs ever. It is so sloppy and jerky that it serves only to confuse the audience. There is no real conspiracy to talk about, mostly a truly false-looking monster who attacks Europeans and tries to walk like Americans. Pass this.
