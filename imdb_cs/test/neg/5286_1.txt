This movie is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There are no twists at all. Although the deal is decent, the plot is terrible. There are also a lot of mistakes in the movie and it was uncomfortable to watch. For all of you who like horror movies, slasher movies or even B-movies, I don't recommend it to anyone at all. Most of the film is focused on nonsensical killing, in ways that aren't even worth discussing. This movie would be very well likened to the miserable remake of Jeepers Creepers, who wasn't that big of a movie. For anyone who wants to spend the day at home watching badly filmed movies, this one takes a cake.
