It's awkward, I liked 3 minutes on the way to work to stop at the video store, and it was 2 for 1 night and I was really impressed by half of the nekkid pic of 'star'. I think this film shows what the New York Film School and the father's wealth - judging by the bio of this clown in the lead - can do for you and for you, and that's what we have here and In addition, the photoshopped pic of the leading "actor" with someone else's body in the image that won't happen anywhere in the movie. it is a strange reason in so many ways that money has been thrown on it by apparently low budget money buckets, but from the very beginning, when all the compars laugh in their scene of terror that it is not good could have any magic if it was done for 2 cents! in short order I missed the scenes and quickly advanced to see the picture on the box that was all I really cared about. weird why do i just rent porn or something? But wow is a bad deal that is funny I think and bad playing that is just bad. Robert englund is quite pathetic along with others. It makes you appreciate more not so directly on the video horror that is there. . . blah, from which I would not bother. shoulda watched uh hellraiser 3 if i wanted to see 8 packs! I would like to imagine horny old gay guys with 2 minutes in a video store going to be a major tenant of this and they should start class action suit!
