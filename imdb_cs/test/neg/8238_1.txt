I picked up this movie and I was horrified when I found out that the film was based on the rape of a little girl the parents had consciously taken away. My first thoughts were that I was never ashamed of being an Indian and a Hindu. I found that this movie is bad. Please don't waste your time. When it comes to music, there are a maximum of 2 horrible songs and the movie is cheap. Beautiful scenes are not what India is known for. I just hope I shed some light on how disgusting this movie really is. Yes, it can emphasize how bad people in power, especially when it comes to religion can be, but to sit and watch nearly 2 hours of this movie can do almost every gag. If your a good Indian movie watch something director Mira Nair.
