Uggh! Hanna-Barbera of the 60s and 70s! What lousy and inimitable cartoons that have drawn these hacks on us! It is a pity really, as in the 1940s and 1950s "Hanna-Barbera" meant quality - because they produced so many wonderful cartoons of Tom Jerry. However, with the major cost-cutting efforts of the late 1950s, cartoons generally began to look quite poor and budgets were slashed. In fact, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera were fired by MGM and replaced by a team of Czech animators who never saw original cartoons! So by the end of the 1950s, the team was out of work and decided "if you can't beat", join the "em" - and start producing terrible little cartoons - with horrible animation, backgrounds and writing. It is unfortunate, but the team production of miserable cartoons has worked too well - which has made them rich and most successful producers of cartoons of the 1960s and 1970s. During this time, over and over, bad production values ​​were their norm, and a long list of VERY forgotten cartoons was created. In this case, it's incredibly bad INCH HIGH PRIVATE EYE - an absolutely indecent and stupid idea. If you want to know what the exhibition was about, the name says it all. Rotten to the core and strong evidence that the production team scorned the kids for us!
