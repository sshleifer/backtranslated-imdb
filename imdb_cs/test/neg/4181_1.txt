The first DH wasn't that great, but I really didn't expect it to be. But this horrible film was beyond criticism. I really try to look at the bright side and give movies like this chance, but I couldn't find the real good thing about this. I appreciate what Bill Cowell was trying to do, but this movie was just soooo boring. The story of the film is really not that bad. In fact, it's somewhat original. But the film form is really as bad as many people say. In my opinion, this ranks up there with "The Off Season", and "Dracula 3000". I know a lot of people really garbage and put off movies like this, but I really can't think of other good things to say about it.
