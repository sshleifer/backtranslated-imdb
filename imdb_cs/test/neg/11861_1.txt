Anyone who writes that it is all good can work on it or give money to this divine terrible experiment at college. It was lousy, slow and painful to watch. Running time only about 84 minutes, it looked like three and a half hours. The only blame is the director who knows nothing about directing the scene where to place the camera! 95% of this horrible film was shot with long masterpieces. Two or three people in a frame talking or shouting forever (or whatever seems to be forever), No close-up !! No medium shots !! There are two so-called combat scenes that any filmmaker with a brain would have shot for some close shots or medium shoots for them. They looked very amateurish. The scenes with the father and son who were screaming at each other would work better if only the father or the son, who worked or reacted, was cut off. Tri-C must be very deadly to show it anywhere. I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time some of them are fun because they're so bad, it's not one of them.
