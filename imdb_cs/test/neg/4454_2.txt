A lot of Alistair MacLean's books came to the big screen. Some of them (The Guns of Navarone, where the Eagles Dare) were translated fairly well; some (Breakheart Passage, Zebra Ice Station, Secret Trails) were passable enough; the couple (River Of Death, Bear Island, The Way to Dusty Death) was pretty rotten. Caravan To Vaccares is another film based on one of MacLean's most popular bestsellers, but unfortunately it's another one that deserves to be added to the "rotten" list. Caravan To Vaccares, addressed by uninteresting characters who get into uninteresting situations and escapades, is an absolute failure, both thriller and fun. Her only half is: a) that she is shot at very attractive places in Provence, and: b) Charlotte Rampling looks utterly devastating (with totally naked scenes to start) as the main female character. Disillusioned American drifter Neil Bowman (David Birney) travels aimlessly across France as he meets British photographer Lila (Charlotte Rampling). They decide to accompany each other and, during their travels, meet the mysterious nobleman Duc De Croyter (Michel Lonsdale). Duc convinces the pair to help him protect and accompany the Hungarian scientist Zuger (Michael Bryant), who is looking for various shady sides because of some of the information he wears in his head. The secret of Bowman and Lily is that Zuger has discovered a secret formula for using solar energy as cheap, economic energy. Hungarians need desperately to get his formula into New York, but hired guns were put on his trail to capture him? Probably so that he can be taken back to some unscrupulous criminal lord and tortured to reveal his invaluable secret, which he can then sell to the highest bidder. Bowman and Lila find themselves and their scared refugees on the run in the French countryside from their deadly opponents. The film seems to be extremely cheap and amateur, almost like an extraordinarily low budget movie. - professional cast and crew. However, a fair financial sum was actually thrown into the film, and much more was done by all those involved in different places in their careers. Therefore, it is to be assumed that the film is bad only because it was written, acted and directed with a significant lack of care and interest. Stimulation is deadly slow and the points of conspiracy become so strenuous that the viewer must keep up with the story in too large a non-free effort. Birney's performance is not evolving, and Rampling just creates a stir due to her nude scenes? The character itself is absolute boredom, and the actress looks right bored. For those who manage to keep to the very end, there is an unusual scene with some deadly rodeo clowns and a wild bull (!), Which, although not particularly exciting or well executed, is at least different from the norm. In most respects, Caravan To Vaccares is a very unsatisfactory film and once again is a powerful novel by a prolific author in his transition to the screen.
