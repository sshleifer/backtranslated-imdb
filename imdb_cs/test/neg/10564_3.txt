OK, when I say "wow", I think, "Jesus, please help me." I have an old copy of VHS that was printed before Troma got a copy of the title. The film is about an alien crash landing on Earth to terrorize us with a weapon that invades people into oblivion. BE CAREFUL!!! And I mean these special effects. There is an amazing number of errors. Acting is terrible, but I would say that the only one who will make any effort will be the sheriff. The film itself is really grainy and poorly lit. In one particular scene there is a day outside and then a shot showing the night beast shot from a gun with the night behind him. Then it shows the day again. * Shakes his head * I usually like low budget horror movies, but I had to make myself finish because I never saw a movie without it. The only success of this film was an alien that was not stereotyped. So for that, and just for it ... I give it 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie if you had a bad day. You'll be even more depressed about the failed attempt this movie does.
