I used to see a bit of this movie and I was interested in seeing the whole thing just to see why the critics gave it to two stars, a result I agree with. Basically, the film begins with the frog Kermit (Steve Whitmire), who tells all of his Muppet friends that they have lost everything, and depression ends on the bench (and maybe even thinking about suicide). Meanwhile, in another world (heaven), angel Daniel (David Arquette, who was already in the Muppets from space) will visit 'Boss' (Whoopi Goldberg, another reason I wanted to see the movie) to show that Kermit really needs help. In flashbacks, it shows Kermit, Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson, not original and better Frank Oz), Gonzo (Dave Goelz), Fozzie Bear (also Jacobson), Pepe Prawn (Bill Barretta) and all the other Muppets have prepared a stage show for many people who look at the Christmas holidays, and it all seems to be going well. It really means that Rachel Bitterman (Joan Cusack) is determined to either close the show or the theater down and Kermit does everything in his power to make sure it doesn't happen. Of course, Kermit last fails, and Bitterman tells him they're done and can officially take the theater. This is where Daniel is sent as Kermit's guardian angel to help him, but Kermit is not in the mood, and finally ends up saying, "I wish I had never been born". Obviously, you can recognize the spoof's amazing life, with Kermit as George Bailey, and Cusack as Mr. Potter, and in the end, of course, Kermit realizes how much it means to everyone, and returns to find the theater retained as a historic landmark. Also starring Whitmire as Rizzo Rat and Beaker; Goelz as Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Waldorf; Barrett as Dr. Teeth, Rowlf the Dog and Swedish Chef; Jacobson as an animal and Yoda (the only character that sounds similar to the Oz version), William H. Macy as Glenn, Matthew Lillard as Luc Fromage, Carson Daly, Molly Shannon; Scrubs' Zach Braff, Sarah Chalke, Neil Flynn, John C. McGinley and Judy Reyes, Mel Brooks as Joe Snow; Brian Henson as Scooter and Janice; Jerry Nelson as Robin Frog, Statler, Pops and Floyd Pepper and Kevin Clash as Sam the Eagle. The most remarkable moment for me is the theater spoof Moulin Rouge, besides and the familiar faces in it, not fantastic. It was nominated by Emmy for Outstanding Music and the lyrics for the song "All Matters". The Muppets were number 47 on the 100 largest pop culture icons. Sufficient!
