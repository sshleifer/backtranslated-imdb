And again, I'm in a minority. I didn't like it. This is just a Varney job I haven't embraced, including Knowhutimean. Slam Dunk Ernest evaluates the credit for being the worst of the line, but it is a clear competitor for this dubious title. This work is too harsh, and also a base that can be loved. Lovingness was one of Ernest's key components, and this element was completely lost. Unfortunately, most think it is the best of the series, but if you loved the essence of what Ernest, Ernest did, you'll realize what I'm referring to for about fifteen minutes to this work. It was too flawlessly a basis for fun. <br /> <br /> It's 3.5 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
