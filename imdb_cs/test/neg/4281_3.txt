Being a great Disney fan, I was really disappointed when I watched this waste. The animation was nice and the background was amazing, but I believe good animation does not create a weak script and a weak story. I will have to disagree with people who say it is not suitable for children. Yes, there are a few deaths in the movie, but isn't it something that children should at least be exposed to? But I turn. The script is riddled with bad puns and lame jokes ... in a way I could expect from most dream movies. The music was wheezing, morale necessary (and forced without any spell.) And the characters plunged into songs at totally inappropriate times. The characters were also cold, and I couldn't accumulate any form of emotion (irritation of the bar). I am a great jungle fan of the book, Aladdin and the Emperor's new groove, but this Disney movie was a sheer and sheer waste of time ..... don't look at it !!!
