Reading most other reviews, I mostly agree with most comments. One thing I would add is the incoherent way in which the film was directed and produced. I think some of these new wave makers think they're clever using unusual (sometimes jerky) camera angles and moving from one scene to another. It goes well with these film festivals, and with some of these critics like India, but it spoils the movie for me. I noticed in the review, one comment says that none of this movie makers movies have become blockbusters. This could prove to be a point because the film has the "hasty impression" that interests you why such a beautiful movie lacks a smooth flow. As for the commentary that Kiefer Sutherland is a big name that could be put on a poster, I bet he crouched while watching the final cut. This is a story with real potential spoiled by trying to be different in its production. It's worth watching, but not many would come back for a second look.
