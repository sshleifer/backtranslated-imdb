This documentary documentary, part of a biblical study, the search for treasures, all embezzled, can sit well in its television origins, but it feels like a feature film. Right from the first point of view, it is a cheesy-looking envelope art, one can question the integrity behind this serious subject, which is shown in the forefront when shifting the search for Jesus' tomb to a general action font that looks more like National Treasure or Tomb Raider. and exploring the historic burial ground. Such is the awkward way in which the whole process is spinning. A more curious child then a good researcher, Simcha Jacobovici's surveys meet as confident while his research comes as manipulative. For all the fascinating revelations, this filmmaker tries to pass on to his viewers the alleged evidence, a flood of repetitive claims that repeat the same research and findings over and over again to prove that Jesus' lost tomb has very little information to back up inflated, though challenging claims. What this means is a very frustrating attempt to beat the audience overhead with the same little factual evidence to support the authenticity of this tomb, which makes it ironically difficult. While relentlessly linking many of these mini-coffins found together to support the theory of Jesus of Nazareth, this research leaves a well-rounded approach to the constant tracking of this romantic archaeological obsession. There may be some formidable factual data that can shed some light on many traditional dogmatic Christian beliefs, but in essence the shady nature of this project has caused it to be just a piece of exploitation, funded at a time when Da Vinci's code was all out of that rage. Finally, it was good when the art of cheese wrapping was right. Despite my appreciation for the documentary form, The Lost Tomb of Jesus always has an interesting theme and transforms it into a too long and unprecedented hunt for a geriatric adventure that replaces any meaning and sanctity for the ignorant motivations of this team. At a time when these robbers had finished their research and reluctantly had to stop research because of social demands, viewers were left in the sense that the director insisted on creating this secret, whether it started there or not. There are several truly powerful moments in which the halls of history march through this document in inconspicuous ways, but all the decoding, exploration, and theorizing in the world have left this misguided vanity in a restless emptiness of apathetic reaction.
