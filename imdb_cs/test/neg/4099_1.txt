This picture is bad and blew up Michael Pohl's short film EXTINCT in 1995. While Michael Pohl's idea was original and perfect for a short film environment, the SOUND OF THUNDER plot was poorly adapted from Pohl's story and not fit for him. a feature-length feature that can be expected from a major Hollywod studio. The tragic flood situation that destroyed the trains in Prague was in this case just one bad connection in a long rusty film. It's a pity for the studio to release such a product ... it's a shame. Especially for Warner Brothers, a studio that broke new effects with shows like BABYLON 5 in 1993. The visual effects for TV shows of groundbreaking CGI on episode television in the mid-1990s were much more sophisticated than what is brought to the screen in this picture. In such cases, sad as it may be: Can a movie.
