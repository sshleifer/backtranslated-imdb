This movie has one or two slightly interesting gags, but it's not worth waiting. After an inexplicable argument between the two boys who threw themselves into the cinema, we moved to a family holiday! Hollywood and driving driving their caravan across the screen over and over as the Danish dialogue is expressed. At least I think it's a terrible, horrible song that accompanies this assembly, it's so loud that it sometimes becomes almost inaudible. Finally, the caravan arrives at the gas station at night, where the family breaks out, they have another conversation before they leave. The camera then stretches to reveal the actor we've just seen. He speaks directly to the camera and realizes that he is the director of the film we watch, about him, and how he came to film. <br /> <br /> A nice idea that ALMOST (but not completely) makes the previous sequence worth the pain. <br /> <br /> As the film unfolds, it meets two characters who have met picking litter at the beginning of the film and all make up a film company. All kinds of not too funny and clumsy comedy follows, as the crews get together and attempt to raise the cash needed to start filming. Of course, this movie was put together on a string of shoes and promise, and there's a nice little idea that tries to get out, but the execution is so incapable of losing the idea. Comedy is more than things that fall and all speak (or shout) at once. So many actors are screaming so much at the same time - Robert Altman can do something like that because he has a script, rehearsals, decent sound techniques and editing equipment. They all shouted at one mike who, through his sound, was hiding in a garbage can in another room, not for clarity.
