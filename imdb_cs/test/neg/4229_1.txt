It was a misfortune to see this really horrible movie. Think about this scene in Magnolia at the end with a slow pan on this woman. Now remove the pelvis, add breathing and unshaven men to the mix, and you have what the whole 2 and a half hours of humanity was <br /> <br /> The inspector is a real delt, not even a delt, just a dark, slow, slow-moving simpleton. How that crime has ever solved is beyond me. Mandatory sex scenes are terrible and grateful. Possible villain of this work (raped and killed eleven-year-old girl) is marked very early and no surprise if they are not similarly muted. <br /> <br /> Don't forget to work with the camera. The director said it was up to the audience to give their own interpretation. I suppose it also meant providing your own dialogue (there is a bugger all - it adds to its level of boredom), imaginative work with the camera (just static shots, totally stripping the apparent beauty of the film's filming landscape) and conspiracy! <br /> <br /> Truly terrible. <br /> <br /> 0 of 10.
