I spent a year in Iraq and among the hundreds of movies I saw here was this little gem called Vampire Assassin. Judging by the envelope (an African-American with corn rows with a curved blade, a leather coat and a badge), I expected the blade to tear. Just enough. So I pop it and watched the bounded overweight African-American without a blade, no cornrows and, well, nothing but ... I don't know. If you've read any of these other reviews, you'll get a movie overview. It's shit. Bad. Really bad. I do not know if it was Highlander-esquire lightning after killing immortal vampire, or karate-kick sound effects for the camera zooms in, or twenty dollar budgets for props, or "OK, we have 90 minutes to get they did it before we were caught shooting in the Johnson & Johnson parking lot "or on martial arts that are as exciting and fast as two old people who have sex or 7th grade. talent, or eccentric Asian Master who is either kind or acidic or whatever, but the film will make you question your existence. And that's amazing. Not many movies can be so bad that your head explodes like scanners. If you're with friends heckle (or MST3K), it's a movie for you. I've seen it three times and I think it could cause permanent damage to my psyche. If you still have no idea about the quality of the movie, people have tried to free it and no one would. Not by force. Long story short, watch it. Be like masochistic pleasure or punishment. This will rock your skull (and for the most part, for all the wrong reasons).
