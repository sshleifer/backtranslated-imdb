This film was very disappointing that several elements of the book had been misrepresented. The main story is the same, but there are a few mistakes that hurt the movie. 1) Boobie Miles got hurt at the beginning of the story in a Texas Tech preseason game. This means he doesn't do anything during the season and Chris Comer will come sooner in the team. 2) The game against Marshall was lost in Marshall. The team portrayed as Marshall was actually Midland High one of Permian's main rivals and here's evidence - Marshall High's Mavericks Colorful Scarlet and Silver, Midland High's Bulldogs Colored Purple and Gold. Check out the jerseys and see who it is. Also, the real Marshall High's football list is immensely Black, the team shown was racially mixed as Midland High. 3) Permian only loses to Midland Lee by one point in the district game. Midland Lee loses Midland High and Midland High loses Permian. These are the teams that have created a coin roll as such. 4) Boobie is returning to the team as a reserve for Chris Comer, and after not getting any playtime in Midland Lee, the team will end up in half time and never stand on the side line or go to any games again. 5) Brian Chavez was the tight end and defensive end that wore # 85, not the tight end and strong safety. In addition, Boobie wore # 35 and Ivory Christian wore # 62. <br /> <br /> 6) Coaches end up with Chris Comer as a player more than Boobie because he has a better lifting ethic and runs more straight up as his employees prefer, which is partly why Boobie leaves the team. 7) Dallas Carter is playing in Austin at Darrell K. Royal Memorial, where UT plays in the state semifinal, not in the state finals. Carter wins the state title but is forced to forfeit due to an incompetent player. Acting is done pretty well, but if you read the book, you'll see that these mistakes are quite true. I am also tired of hearing all the PC hypocrites outside complaining about the display of Dallas Carter's football team. The team by book is as big, monstrous, talented and black as the film shows. People say it's a racist depiction, but reading a book, you see the real depiction of the team. The story is greatly changed, so this movie has a score of 3.5 / 10.
