Few movies interrupted expectations and disturbed me just like fire. The film is demanding waste. Nothing at the artistic level. The only thing she managed to get is a ban in India. If it were just because of the poor quality of filmmaking rather than the actual debate, this ban would be more justified. <br /> <br /> Now that I have a problem with my system, I'm more capable of analyzing the movie: <br /> <br /> * From the beginning, the film feels incredible, especially when the protagonists begin to talk in English. Of course, the director did not make a film for an Indian audience; however, it underestimated its international audience despite simplifying it. Watching the character of a home help conversation in perfect English is too unreal to be true. These scenes are not very effective. They come as a shock and impede the flow of the film. I still wonder how this philosophical dialogue is related to the story. I felt that Surrealism was lost. They will never reach either of them. The names elected for women, Radha and Sita, are the names of Hindu deities, and have therefore been chosen to shock viewers. Since the film was not meant primarily for the Indian audience, the choice of shocks by name is not meant to achieve its goal, which is absurd. <br /> <br /> * Direction quality is very poor and some key and fine scenes have been poorly processed. A better director could make this a powerful emotional drama. I always thought Shabana Azmi was a good actress, but her talent isn't evident in this movie. The male leadership was completely nonsensical. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the Earth and want to see more of the director, stay away from this. Please.
