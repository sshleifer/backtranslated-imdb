Lil Pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp. Animation and voice play were ideal for this type of movie. <br /> <br /> For the first 20 minutes, or so loudly laughed. mostly on concept. After that, wit thin. Lil Pimp would be classic. Instead, this movie consists entirely of one joke that takes too long. Weathers, voiced by Ludicrous, has some rough and witty one-liners. Unfortunately, that's all a boy's pet rat is good because he contributes nothing else to the story. I finally grew up with his comments as I did in the rest of this movie. I'm a big fan of South Park and other adult-oriented animations. I also play some online pimp games, so I'm partial to the pimp stories. The transition from a little boy to a lil pimp was brilliant; but then the story and dialogue became redundant and predictable. I give this movie five. It is worth watching a great concept and voice playing. Don't expect anything else or you will be quite disappointed.
