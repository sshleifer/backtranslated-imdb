S l o w, l o n g, d l l. . Oh my God, boring. <br /> <br /> Characters so annoying - you'll cringe every time you see Jimy Smits or a guy who has played Tomtom since then. They should never rehearse or review an ongoing film. Mel Gibson was absolutely wooden. It may not be the worst movie ever made, but it went almost directly into the video saying it was pretty damn close. <br /> <br />
