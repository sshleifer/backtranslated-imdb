Creation? Yeah, that and the movie they're in. Hell would seem infinitely more frightening to watch the damnation forever. Six college students are hiding in a convicted hospital to save money and end up being victims of an ancient monster who has to ask for five casualties before returning to the "dark world they came from!" In addition to the great logical and coherent problems (plus the fact that it seems to be unfinished), this catastrophe is horribly acted, written, edited (by J.R. Bookwalter) and the FX make-up and almost nonexistent. It's also significantly shorter than it claims (only 80 minutes), but I don't complain. It's the worst movie I've seen from Full Moon producers from executive producer Charles Banda and the boy is BAD! I hardly bothered to comment on the comment, but it got inexplicably good reviews here and I thought the different views were fine. Proceed with caution!
