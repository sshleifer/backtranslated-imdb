Well, the movie wasn't terrible, but the one who created the game on the screen didn't do a good job of creating the essence of the unger. This film was slightly below average and did not tell the story of one of the most interesting people ever born. I recommend reading the book "one of a kind" a real unger story. They have left out huge parts of their lives. They also occasionally did not understand the real practitioner that he was. The reality of his life was sometimes out of order. And in the end, they didn't really distort the real personality he had. So please don't take a movie; read the book. By the way, I'm not just some kind of prick that feels you have to stay 100% on a real story, but it doesn't even come close !!!
