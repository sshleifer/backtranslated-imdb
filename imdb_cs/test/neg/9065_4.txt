OK so it is about 30 minutes gore without a story at all. There is no spoken dialogue, no headlines, no real characters. You see three people in the whole movie (which are alive) and two are for a very small reason. The main guy has no emotions and just cripples the corpses for no apparent reason. That's the whole movie. I like to see very bloody movies, especially since the real gore in modern movies is not very common in America. So yeah gore effects were pretty cool. But it's just not distracting. Why does everyone think it's so distracting? There are no characters at all, there are only 3 live people and 3 corpses. No one has any personality or back story. You see the three corpses that are torn and you can't really identify with them if you don't identify yourself with death itself and how it could happen very well (despite the fact that one loses his job and goes to prison very shortly afterwards). the viewer has to look after and make sure he identifies himself with the victim. For example, in a good horror movie you should really care for the main character. Here's just a guy and a corpse. It's as deep as a puddle of a single drop of rain. They never give you any reason to worry about anyone in the movie. Everything is hacking a couple of bodies, then having sex with the body. Now, with the sex scene, there's a strange thing to do, he makes sure he wears gloves but doesn't use a condom. So he couldn't worry about catching a strange STD to have sex with a corpse, but until his hands disappear, there's no problem, now it's really logical. I don't like the movie, I liked that it was very bloody, but when it ends, there's no reason to look at it again, there's no reason to worry about it, and it's just not a very convincing movie. I say if you find it for less than $ 10, then you could also get it, but if it's more than that, it's not worth it.
