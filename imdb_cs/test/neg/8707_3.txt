If you are a Christian or a Jew who hopes to see the exact biblical (or Torah) portrayal of events in Exodus, you will be disappointed with this film. In a typical Hollywood fashion, people who are not even in the Bible were "created" to support characters and play a big part in the film. Jethro's role is changed completely and he becomes nothing but an untrustworthy father instead of a pastoral priest who has given Moses great advice. God is largely removed from the film, and the viewers have the impression that Moses had to invent things for himself. Nothing can be further from the truth. This film is a typical humanist twist on biblical issues and attempts to put most of the responsibility on Moses for trying to understand what God wants and what to do. Those who know the book Exodus well will see not only the inconsistencies in the film, but also the totally blatant changes of events. Most importantly, they will see an almost complete absence of divine dialogue with Moses, which determines all that Moses does in the burning bush. Far from being portrayed in the film, Moses is guided by God's detailed and direct communication. Even Hallmark obviously cannot recognize God's direct role and many events make no sense without his spoken words to Moses. In order to compensate, Hallmark has actually changed some things. For example, after the golden calf God is tormenting people and has to look at the symbol of the snake to live. Instead, Hallmark creates a civil war, and the Israelites choose parties, then beat each other. Of course, the Moses Party will win. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the minimum value may be unbelieving because it can cause them to seek answers, but believers should stay on. Twisted events and changes make it a danger to anyone who does not know his Bible. Read Exodus for yourself, there's no substitute.
