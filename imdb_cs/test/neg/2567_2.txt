Dr. Steven Segal saves the world from the deadly outbreak of the virus. This film feels like a foolish esteem that has turned into an unintended classic camp (the best kind). Memorable rows include "Knowledge is like a deer. Chase it, and it will run away from you" and "Drink it. It will feel better." It is so subtly bad - they couldn't do it worse if they tried. Segal is trying to convince you that he is 1. sensitive - by saving the affected pony; 2nd good father - a script for his daughter; 3. Man of Science - Looking at a Spectrum of Spectrum; 4. in harmony with nature - using homeopathic remedies; 5. politically correct and multicultural - by having Indian friends; 6. Iconoblast - by opening a rural practice after a former life in a national research laboratory; and the 7th action hero - by being really fat but still fighting. ROTFL. <br /> <br /> It's good to see a swing on a Saturday night, with friends, preferably (but not necessarily!) Drunk.
