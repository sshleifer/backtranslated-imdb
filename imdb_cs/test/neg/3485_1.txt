I was fortunate enough to have grown up in San Diego (not the biggest waves in the world, but it was a hell of a childhood, I'll tell you) and I've seen a lot of so-called surfing movies in my life. After I first saw NORTH SHORE, I can only say THANK YOU, I've never seen it as a child. If I saw it and mistakenly thought it was a realistic representation of a surfing scene, I'd sell my album and get into, I don't know, accounting or anything. Seriously, the movie has so much to do with real surfing, because TOP GUN was a real military life. Acting is terrible, music is worse, cinematography is at best at best and OH MY BOH what Laird Hanilton thought?! WOW !!! DO NOT SHOW THIS FILM !!! TO SUCKS !!! If you want to surf REAL, see RIDING GIANTS. Shit, watch SURF'S UP instead. Seriously. It sucks. Poorly. She sucks REAL wrong. Brah. ;) <br /> <br /> PS: I had to change my summer from "WTF?!" to wtf because, apparently, we have to whisper at this point. NO YELLING !!! (shhhhhh!); D
