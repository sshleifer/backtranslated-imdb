This movie is so bad that it's worth seeing. This film will have viewers slipping in and out of the coma within the first ten minutes. It all started when a bunch of writers came up with the idea of ​​a kidnapped jetliner and a passenger who could fly a small plane had to land an animal. However, they know that it was done many times to make it different, let's do it very badly! Major Masters has the name of a pirate of the 80's "To Live and Die in L.A." from the character played by Willem Dafoe. This saved 10 minutes at the time of writing and production. The aircraft is supposed to be a Boieng 747. This aircraft has a unique silhouette, even in the dark with its characteristic front hump. Ask the late Ronald Reagan, who was lamenting this place when the Russians shot down KAL 007 in the 1980s. . You don't need a flight engineer on this complex plane! Heroine is played by constantly pouring Gloria Lynn Berg. After making a kidnapper, despite several bus costs for people on this jet, no one bothered to look at the guy who nearly killed them all. He is simply forced to entertain himself. The frozen plane, leaking fuel from all the bearable Shenanigans, won't return to Hawaii, so the Masters will try to land at the island's air base. Only the track is 300 meters too short! Four army boys with small Bobcats (the kind you rent to spend a day driving horse manure to the back of the barn) will clean the 200-foot jungle and 300-foot jungle in 20 minutes! No need bulldozer here! Where can you find such guys? These guys could make the highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas for 3 hours with only soup spoons, compass and duck! <br /> <br /> After the hell's obstacle is fixed, the Masters will try to land on the plane as the heroine discards. Hijacker giggles for himself and can get more trouble without supervision. He is finally suppressed in the most retarded way that I can't say. But can you say Moby Dick? <br /> <br /> There are so many retarded scenes in this movie. The wounded captain is parked prone to an airplane bar, while the Masters, who probably barely fly, will put the plane in 60 degree banks and 20,000 feet per minute drops. The pilot should be French kissing the ceiling during these challenging stunts, but he won't move his thumb. I think if they chose different actors to play the game, it could be better. If we need a movie heroine in the movie, why not choose the more famous actress Bernadette Peters, who also seems to be constantly tied up? In addition, singing and busts well aging Peters might pose some gratuitous shots. Now with a singing angle it could be kidnapping, Let's Land Plane Film MUSICAL! Luciano Pavarotti was cast as a pilot. They can sing a duet in the cockpit before the kidnapping, and there's no way the Tuba tenor would fly to the ceiling because the Masters is working on this big bird. In line with the musical theme, the Masters could then play Andrei Bocelli, who Peters can sing when he lands on the plane. Not only is he completely blind, but he only knows a few words of English. Now it's a conspiracy! Think of the edge of the conversation between the Masters (Bocelli) and the Air Traffic Controller: <br /> <br /> ATC: "Sir, please strike back to 180, the flaps are set to 25 degrees." Bocelli: "What?" <br /> <br /> ATC: "Sir, now spoilers, confirm braking pressure at 250 psi. Keep descent at 500 fpm" Bocelli: "What?" The kidnapper could play late big Rodney Dangerfield, who can churn out a plethora of his liners as he sits tied and unguarded. wife is in group sex, yeah, she found me in front of judge and jury! Get an idea? Missing Opportunities The film has your standard crying and sighing passengers who are never developed. Woody Allen could be in the back offering one of his neurotic monologues: "She said I was great in bed. I told her I was practicing a lot ..." Now it's a movie! Also, according to a similar movie "Executive Decisions," where lazy eyes Steven Segal is mercifully killed at the beginning giving that movie a chance, 747 is a massive attic up. The plane was introduced in 1969, so who knows what has accumulated there for almost 40 years? My uncle has old clothes, sleighs, magazines and things in it. Wasn't it cool if the Masters opened the door and saw Chevy Chase staring at the tears in the raincoat and watching the old Super 8 childhood movies? Just a recommendation. So give him a chance and how to expire and know how big this film could be if I had a hand in my hand ...
