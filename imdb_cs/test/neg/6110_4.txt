A single line summary is actually a stroke of a very old joke that starts with "what is a Jewish porn movie?" While this movie had interesting moments, it was too slow to move and didn't do enough to explain to those of us unfamiliar with Orthodox Jewish customs exactly what was happening and why? How many people who came up with this movie would know that the bath in which the female figures wash themselves is actually called "Mikveh", a ritual bath that is used to purify spiritual impurities? The same question could be asked why the bride was circumvented by the bridegroom while her face was covered just before the marriages were carried out. These two examples are just two of a large number of such moments that have remained totally inexplicable to an uninitiated audience. This film has its moving moments along with expressions of great love and emotion. The characters are presented very authentically up to the number of garments that an ultra orthodox Jewish man must wear, as well as the religious rituals he must perform when he wakes up in the morning to begin his day. The attitudes of Orthodox Judaism to women in general and to wives in particular are interesting and sometimes insane. This is another reason why more needs to be explained if this story is to be understood in context. I recommend this film to people who are familiar with Orthodox Jewish traditions and rituals, as well as those who may be interested. in a short look at what is the life of people who practice this way of life like. <br /> <br /> The story of two sisters who, in their own way, rebel against the "system," has a slight interest in the best.
