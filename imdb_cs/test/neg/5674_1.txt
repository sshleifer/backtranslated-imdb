This show is based on a concept that loudly + obnoxious + repetitions = funny. Comedy writing is non-existent, in fact I face serious repercussions by even being compared to entertainment of any kind. Here is the assumption. Two girls accidentally get their shenanigans posted on the internet and cheerfully follows their initial success, they invent the idea that they should do a web-cast to show off their brilliance. OK, so where do I start? Let's start with a laughing track, oft used but never a successful reminder that we, the audience, should laugh. According to foley guys, this show is the funniest thing on the planet. We should all drop the load into our pants because it's the brilliance of humor ahead. The mixing track is serious every few seconds. It's quite possible to usurp Scooby-doo for the king of laughter over-use. Then you will find the most interesting shouting-on-our-lung-craziest-grouping words-to-seem-stupid trick with little to no success. Oh, and let's not forget to create new words to make it funny. This is web-o-licious and poop-tastic? What the hell ... <br /> <br /> Finally, acting. I can't complain here. Actors are young and inexperienced, but that should and could be remedied by good professional help. Because of nick's inexperience, he should help the actors define their craft. Instead, in the usual nickname, the actors are placed in front of the camera and said "act". Which is largely robotic line recitation, missed timing, and overall epic failure. The lack of anything in this show makes it a disgusting representation of how funny it is. Don't waste your time. This show makes it difficult for all humanity
