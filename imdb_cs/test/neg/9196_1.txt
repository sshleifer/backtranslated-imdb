This is a bad, bad movie. Full of clich√©s, unrealistic moments: punching the air at the party after the fire, it doesn't matter that someone lost their home and property !!, announcing the pregnancy at the bar along with all your friends before telling you the privacy of the burning building first for no apparent reason stereotypical funerals and tense relationships, very lengthy, cheesy music at the end, unrealistic treatment of a girl who was rescued from her apartment, a very unrealistic explosion from this same apartment! ! Do they have a couple of oxygen tanks in the attic or something? Anyone who has an ounce of joke sees that this movie was a joke. It's a shame because firefighters do a great job and deserve to have a good movie about what they do, but not at the expense of common sense.
