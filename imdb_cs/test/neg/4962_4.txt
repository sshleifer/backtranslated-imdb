I'm a German student, I'm sorry for the mistakes (I'm working on it;)) <br /> <br /> Stylishly very interesting conversion with an effective sound effect accentuates a false drama action that is not reflected by the terrible bad actor (insincere and unnatural movements and expressions of feelings), making the relatively weird and pointless story less better. Just a typical slasher-genre with in this case very special action. Many side games partially destroy the main story and let the audience into the darkness, create weirdness and let the senses of action and mere point muddle. Certainly his hit for slasher-fans, but not for me. But even though the interesting style of cinematography and the adeptic use of light has turned out well. So not the best ...
