... ever! (I've always wanted to write it :) Many years ago (in 1993, as I recall), one of my former classmates persuaded me to watch what he called "epic masterpiece". It still seems to me to be the worst movie I've ever seen. Acting, story, effects - everything is wrong. If you're not one of these people who just love to appreciate garbage, you should pass it on. However, it is likely that you have seen it since you read it. <br /> <br /> From almost 500 movies, it's just a short version I gave 1/10. I haven't seen any other low-frequency Asian warriors, so I think there are even worse things! Scary ... <br /> <br />: P
