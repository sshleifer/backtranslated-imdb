It's an incredibly stupid, boring, unimaginable, lazy piece of waste. When you watch a direct selection of a video, it is fair to expect the film to be at some level, but it goes beyond mushy. It's just terrible at every level, with a ridden script cliche that manages to be incredibly stupid and incredibly boring at the same time, casting no name over the actors, and some of the worst special effects I've ever seen. Even fans of slasher movies will not be able to find anything that would make this movie a useful hour and a half. The story focuses on your usual group of young people who decide to spend a weekend at a remote West Virginia farm that one member of the group recently inherited. Unfortunately for the teenagers, the inherited land was once owned by a farmer who sacrificed to help his crop grow, or something stupid along these lines, and now some evil bogeymen are ready to kill everyone. I do not know anything about the writer, director Pavel Moore, but I suppose he has more than ten years and therefore he should be able to come up with something more original than the murderers. Honestly. The special effects that bring scarecrows to life are ridiculously poor. They often look like barely more than Haloween costumes on sticks. Such special effects would have been considered rather rather poor twenty years ago, but by today's standards they are nothing but embarrassing. This is a total waste of time for all viewers, whether or not they are in horror. If you have to watch a movie slasher, rent one of the films "Friday 13" or "Halloween". Most of them aren't very good, but they're definitely better than bullshit.
