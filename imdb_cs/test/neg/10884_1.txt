I've seen a lot of movies. In fact, I love B horror movies, they are my favorite genres. However, this "Garbage" (I refuse to admit it was the film's honor) was the worst piece of crap I've ever tortured watching. Actually, I signed up for IMDb purely because I needed a way to at least express how awful Garbage was. I was looking at "Movies" (at least deserving honor) made in the basement of high school students who were better written and managed. I have nothing but compassion for the poor actors in this "Garbage" because they just tried to earn a check. Now and forever they will have this stain on their records as a virgin who has been raped and given to Herpes! If writer / director John Shiban has any dignity at all, after apparently absorbing countless people to do so, he should never be allowed to come back to the camera and try to apply his so-called "Gifts" to something more suitable for him. .. .How washing the floor Peep Show !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
