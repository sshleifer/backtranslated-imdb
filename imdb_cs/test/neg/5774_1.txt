And unfortunately, I also have any movie that relies on a bad pun, because its slogan or its title should be included at $ 2.00 bin, but we've decided to try a second, wrong movie for the movie night. We had a winner at "House of the Dead" - go with it if you want a laughing movie. Some witches jumped into the water after Mr. Miner set him on fire. Some guy dug in the woods. And the same guy grabbed a new girlfriend right in front of his old one. I don't remember anything else. The last third of the film was totally empty and we were all waiting in the agony to the end.
