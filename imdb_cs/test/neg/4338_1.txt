Don't forget the rave reviews of this movie. It is Van Damme's worst movie and one of the worst I've ever seen. It would be for someone who has no depth, which would require nothing more than shooting and blasts to enjoy. When I saw him as director Peter Hyams, I realized that Peter had no talent as a director. but is very good at filming and the like. However, films also need other elements; for example a story. He didn't have one. This could explain the horror of some recent Hyams movies, hardly anything better than this, really. You can't help thinking how some people have ever been behind a camera.
