The main page review admits that the film is terrible, but that you should forgive it because it is pretty violent. No, you shouldn't. At the end of this review are spoilers, but how can I "spoil" this rotten film, I have no idea. Even if you're deadly Alien / Before a fan like I am waiting for a DVD. It doesn't cost a rent of $ 3.99, but you will be much less inclined to hate this movie if you pay more than $ 12 or better per person, plus theater purchases. The theater I watched AVPr there were exactly two laughs, both the girl sitting next to me. Otherwise it was utter silence. No ooohs, or "it was a bad ass!", Nothing. Imagine being a patient on an operating table and having just received an anesthetic. Now you know what you will enjoy in the theater after the opening scene of AVPr. <br /> <br /> What was the budget for this movie? Like the War of the Worlds, MI 3 and other movies driven by the f / x director seem to be much more involved in what CGI people can come to than with the development of characters or conspiracies. Spielberg tried and failed several times, usually with Tom Cruise. Sure, movies make money, but should they? The War of the Worlds and the Minority Report had a budget to pay for a decent scenario, Tom Cruise et al, and the SS itself, but were still terrible. I'm sure AVP wasted 90% of its CG budget and had no choice but to hire any actor to say yes, even though the casting agent would do better by going to the supermarket and picking actors at random. There is no tension in any scene, so we are never surprised. Who cares who is killed? We didn't know any of them, we all know what happens when Lilean aliens make their physical departure, we all know that blood is acid. In Alien, Aliens, 3, Resurrection, and even AVP directors take advantage of the fact that strangers can think, can hide and place traps. This director decided that Ridley Scott, James Cameron, and others were idiots for character development that you want to see either live or kill. In this installment you never care who lives or dies, not a child, parent, pregnant woman. Characters serve only one purpose in this film, to die. The opening scenes show that the film will be a predictable joke. Character development scenes mix clich√©s, bad humor and bad acting, and numb the viewer to the point where we don't really care if they kill themselves until they die in previously unseen paths. But not. The director tried something different from those who preceded him in the Alien franchise, but managed to throw away only good portions of the first films, human protagonists and steal the rest of the other sci-fi films. <br /> <Br /> There is no original use of Alien or Pred characters. Before actually having a little problem killing the Aliens by having a dozen, although the last movie led us to believe that Before Honored Aliens as such a deadly enemy they used to kill one as Rite of Passage. AlienPred is never developed as a fearsome creature. His ability to inject parasites into the host is torn from several different films that were probably Hellboy, where Samiel's torn tongue pushed eggs into Hellboy or Doom, where mutated creatures left their tongues behind after kicking the victim's throat. Simply put, we have no reason to worry about anything in this movie. There is violence, but it is not a shock or surprise and there is nothing that has not been seen in any of the hundred slasher flicks. CG is fine and both types of extraterrestrials are made to look and move as they did in the past. But since characters are never developed and acting is so bad, we hope everyone will die. The little girl was probably the best bunch actor, but unfortunately we're not ready to worry about whether kids, women or anyone else lives or not. We want the movie to end. Eventually it does, but not before the next stolen plot line from Resident Evil 2 has a nuke target Gunnison way to wipe out "infection". And not before another stupid scene to open the door for the next sequel, but does it? In a movie filled with bad scenes, the worst could have been put in the last place. Sorry for the repetition, but everything repeats: bad script, no conspiracy, unoriginal action scenes, uninspired direction, abysmal performance, decent f / x that has been wasted due to many drawbacks. <br /> <br /> I don't mind going to an independent movie and being disappointed. Actors and directors and crew members are likely to get their careers and work on the cord budget. For a movie with this type of budget and hype I feel cheated along with disappointed. This film is a painfully boring loss of time from the opening scene to the final credits. Sadly, the Hellboy 2 preview was the best part of AVPr and HB2 didn't look so good.
