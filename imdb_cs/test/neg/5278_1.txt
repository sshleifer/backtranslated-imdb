I have seen many - perhaps too many movies with direct access to the video, without the budget that are starting to run, and have developed a taste for "the good" or those that are less sucky, as ridiculous as it sounds, hahaha. DR. CHOPPER is what I would like to mention as ... absolute stupidity. Nothing about it is pleasant - the actor sucks, the characters suck, the killer sucks, the gore is minimal ... and sucks. It is a group of college friends who embark on a newly discovered family cabin owned by the parents of one of the children. It is supposed to be a relaxing retreat, but little they know that a mortally ill former plastic surgeon - bad, along with his two assistants - is looking for usable tissue to save the doctor. Her name is Dr. Chopper, because he rides a motorcycle and of course chops. That's just a horrible movie that's not worthy of anyone's time. He said enough.
