Rating: * 1/2 of **** <br /> <br /> "The Net" is one of those movies that won't stay in your mind until the next hour. Well ... Just when you think it's bad. It is an average, unhappy, hollow, ridiculous and predictable piece of waste. One of the adjectives I used above is why I added 1/2 star to the one I would give. Is it a case of "so bad is it good"? No. It's a case of "so bad it's ridiculous". Bullock in (a Surprise!) Very Bad Performance by Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time. She works at home, has no friends, and her neighbors don't know her. Suddenly she finds herself in dangerous situations after her colleague dies and the same happens to her. Its identity, bank accounts, etc. Etc. They're all erased and now Ruth Marx. The plot includes government and ... Wait! We haven't seen it yet? Yes, a thousand times. The "network" is trying to be modern, to be a portrait of the nineties, depicting a computer as a villain. Big deal! It's a movie about nothing, just an excuse to show ridiculous action scenes. Take a boat accident site. I just laughed when the camera started slower ... <br /> <br /> What makes everything even worse is Sandra Bullock. How awful it is! Has she done a decent movie? "Time to kill", ok. But she is still a bad actress, a repeating robotic face moves in each of her pictures. The advantages and disadvantages of the computer have already been mentioned in "2001: Space Odyssey", the best, most intelligent and most complex movie ever made. No need to compare "The Net" with it, is it ...? The only reason to see "The Net" is to laugh as I said and see what it is trying to be. The results, well, are a shame. <br /> <br /> Remove this movie from your mind!
