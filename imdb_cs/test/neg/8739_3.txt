To be honest, I've never read one of the comics and I don't even remember the 2nd and 3rd parts. I can compare with the first part (Werner - Beinhart) and this is really disappointing, compared to most of the other movies I've watched in recent weeks. The first minutes are just a useless clone of the first movie intro, and then it gets worse. There are a few good (funny) scenes, but overall it's just another boring second attempt by the German film industry that can't succeed (almost as usual). One good thing: The movie is quite short (75 min.) Bad thing: Contains only a story and jokes for 45 minutes;) -> Don't play it
