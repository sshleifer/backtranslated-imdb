This overheated South Gothic "mellerdramer" has a few good moments - but it is too often spoiled by the director of a cliché, a cliché, and a star who has apparently decided to wear it rather than turning it into a personal presentation rather than allowing the writer / director Gabel to update Inge or Williams as a contemporary "Midnight Cowboy" meets "Lolita" tearjerker. Close your eyes, listen to the exaggerated South accents and decide whether you are witnessing a feature film or an acting class - full of eager amateurs. Johansson is once tolerable (ie less handcuffed than usual) - although in any case not good, Macht is decent, though he is too handsome a boy to believe, and Travolta eats the scenery like never before (with the help of a decent editor and some directing restriction, his performance could be really moving; how it is, he - and almost everyone else - is too clumsy to ever move us around the point of boredom or resistance). Kara Unger is perhaps the best of all; if her role was going beyond a few lines, she might even be nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Pic is almost rescued by Leonard Cohen in the style of snarling thematic song, decent production design and location, and a constant reference to literary works (which have won otherwise standard script reviews as "poetic"). useful are some old cast professionals like Sonny Shroyer, and perhaps most importantly is Soderbergh Elliot Davis - whose fine work will undoubtedly be attributed to the director, who is currently ten or twenty years old. Learn to drive. But probably not.
