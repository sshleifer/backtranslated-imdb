Let me be clear. I hate these kinds of movies. I don't like anything where the protagonists are all bourgeois English. I find this kind of literature and film very difficult. You never want to read Jane Austen's book willingly. That is, the only reason I read W. Somerset Maugham's book and watched that the subsequent film was for class. Mary Panton (Kristin Scott Thomas) is a beautiful English woman living in a borrowed villa in Florence before World War II. One night after eating with some of her wealthy royal friends, she willingly picks up an Austrian refugee, has sex with him and ditches, and then kills her. As the film goes on and on, you really want to dislike Maria. <br /> <br /> What a load of crap this film was. First, there were many subplots, and the characters invented in the film were not even in the book. I doubt if Mr. Maugham would appreciate them too late. The characters, though rich, have been some of the most superficial and self-centered people I've ever seen. The only reason I didn't give him less than three stars was that acting was the only thing that could be applied. Always talented Kristin Scott Thomas is ideal for Mary's role. In fact, I couldn't imagine anyone else filling her shoes. Sean Penn and Anne Bancroft also had support roles that were as good as leadership. <br /> <br /> Save the pain of watching this movie.
