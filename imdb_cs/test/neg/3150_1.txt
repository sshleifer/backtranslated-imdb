I AM NOT LYNNE BATES MY NAME IS RITICHIE, BUT LYNNE IS MY MOM I AM ONLY USING ACCOUNT! Barney and Friends, (or Barney, as it is called here in England) is the funniest show ever. I never really liked it, it was about 3 or 4 years ago when I was born, so it was nothing new. My friend loved this dildo show. I was about six and I was at his house and he had a Barney VHS tape on the TV. I turned off the power and he wept. INCREASE ITS DINOSAUR FOR CHRISTMAS SAKE! Anyway, I caught Barney on TV that year and loved it. A few months later I got a VHS and I wore a tape I loved so much! I gave the tape a few years ago, but at the time I loved it. But show! My God it was wrong! Several children fell victim to pedophiles because of this ass of so-called fun! Never again, never! It's not just me who hates Barney! 85% of all comments on this show are bad, and just check out the amount of You Tube Poops and videos that take the Barney Clutter are on You Tube! And don't get me on Blow Job Blow! Why the hell should manufacturers dare to give such a sexual name! One more subliminal message in the children's show! And that Baby Bop is the worst thing about Osama bin Laden! All in all, I give Barney and my friends MINUS 1000 OUT OF 10!
