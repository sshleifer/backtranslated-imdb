Let me start by eagerly awaiting the release of this film for a while. When I finally got the chance to see it last night, I'm sorry I was incredibly disappointed. It's hard to imagine a movie that could make "Exorcist: The Beginning" in the fall, but "Dominion" does it. No, wait ... it looks like a great movie. Maybe I was too excited about this movie, and that made me do it. After all, the idea of ​​Warner Bros. published two versions of what is basically the same movie, within six months of each other, was an exciting attraction. In addition, I am a huge Stellana Skarsgard fan, and in real fashion gives great performance despite the often absurd content of the movie. On the other hand, the supporting cast in this film is pointless. Clara Bellar seems to be able to express only one expression - an empty look, and all her lines give the same monotonous tone, while Frances Gabrielle Mann's father is just ridiculous. The effects in this movie are, at best, ridiculous and the sheer kitship of all of this is enough to rob the film of any chance of being taken seriously. This film brought more repressed giggling than anything else, and except for one really cool shot that lasted about three seconds and made my friend cover her eyes and whine, it neglected to offer something in the scary department one. I could go in more detail and maybe give away spoilers, but frankly, I'm too exhausted from thinking about how bad this movie was to write all the things I'd like to say. The saddest part of the whole thing is that the basic idea that both versions of the film tried to give ... the story of a priest who lost his faith and then regained it when he coped with his troubled past. .. had great potential, especially with Skarsgard as the lead man. Unfortunately, this potential was useless for us. Go and watch this movie only if you are really curious about how it differs from the Harlin version, but don't expect to see a good movie or you will regret wasting money and two hours of your life. Otherwise, settle for the version that was first released and continue.
