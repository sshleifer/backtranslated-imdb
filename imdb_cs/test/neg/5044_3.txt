The gargoyle begins late at night in 'Romania 1532' when a peasant girl (Daniela Nane) travels her horse and cart to see her own business as she falls down from the moon clouds over a living gargoyle and attacks her. and it will be at the castle with some description where an angry mob of local villagers and a priest can end a gargoyle or think ... Cut to Contemporary Bucharest where two CIA agents Ty Griffin (Michael Pare) and Jennifer Wells (Sandra Hess) is about to negotiate the safe return of his rich US ambassador's son from his captors. In search of one of the kidnappers, Griffin loses him on the roof of the building, but finds a large pool of blood and no visible signs of what happened to him. Dr. Meanwhile, Christina Durant (Kate Orsini) and her colleague Richard Barrier (Jason Rohrer) are restoring the church when the church worker Gregor (Mihai Bisericanu) informs Richard that he has found an ancient relic. slimy cocoons & one very angry & very lively gargoyle that wastes no time to kill them both. Griffin & Wells are when they are missing and will soon realize that the local legends of monstrous gargoyles are true with a local priest named Father Soren (Fintan McKeown) who plans to flood the world with them ... <br /> <br Co - written, co-produced and directed by Jim Wynorski under his usual pseudonym Jay Andrews Gargoyles is yet another Wynorski masterpiece can add to his credits, no. Screenplay Wynorski, Ion Ionescu, A.G. Lawrence & Bill Munroe is stupid, shameless, boring and as simple as you can get. To begin with, I would like to know if there was only one gargoyle left that laid all those eggs because I'm sure she couldn't get pregnant. How did he survive 500 years in that hole? What is he eating? How did the priest know he was there? Why didn't anyone else come to that? Why did the priest want to flood the world with them? Decide? The gargoyles barely take over the world, and then let some priests rule as king, and do what is left to the government? Just like the guys who wrote Gargoyle, I don't think they think well, do they? Whatever way I look at it, depending on how I approach it, from any angle I try to figure it out, no matter how many times I try to round the circle Gargoyles just don't make sense and the story has a huge conspiracy, blackouts in logic & it's not great to start anyway. The character is boring and clichÃ©, the action is repeated and infallible, while the film as a whole is a real boring place to walk. People do illogical things, and everything that happens is far from comfortable, as a priest tries to convince Griffin that Gargoyle exists and suddenly appears and attacks them. A cave full of cocoons is such a rupture of strangers (1986) that it is embarrassing and the end was lame. The piece on the big Ferris wheel at the fair was fun, even though the boy ridiculed the boy's fear of the heights and forced him to get it. Director Wynorski cuts costs and steals tracks from other movies, in fact the best scene from Gargoyle is the chase of a car through Bucharest, but it was taken from the action film Jean-Claude Van Damme Maximum Risk (1996) ). There are no shocks, fears or atmosphere. Special effects are terrible, CGI Gargoyle seems to belong to a computer game & has little interaction with live members, there are plenty of scenes of people looking into the sky trying to look obvious. There is no valuable gore to observe, there is one terrible decapitation & that's it. <br /> <br /> Technically, special effects are terrible, but otherwise it is clear, Romanian sites look good Romanian. Gargoyle went straight to the video and shows him quite cheaply. Acting isn't too much, the personality victim bypass Michael Pare is for the dumbest of boring heroes. Gargoyle is a crap movie, it fails on all decent creation features should strive to achieve. Full waste 90 minutes when it comes to me, one to avoid.
