This is a horrible movie that is barely recognizable from a book, even though it has similar charts. The time it takes to watch this movie (which is only 1.5 hours) would be much more advantageous if we were doing something else, including watching the grass. Adding badly done fantasy scenes makes Catherine seem stupid. The actress, who plays Catherine, also came across ditzy like everything else and looks surprised even if she is to be lovingly looking into Tilney's eyes. Honestly !! The film ends with Catherine's fantasy scene, where one can't help but wonder if it happened, or if it's just a delusion, and not in a good way that thinks of you, but in a totally awful way that basically summarizes the horrible movie . The only good thing about the movie is the title written by Mrs. Austen herself. Generally I like BBC production, but this is terrible.
