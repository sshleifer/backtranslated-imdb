For those who might send me nasty e-mails, I'll push it. There is a trend in Hollywood where those that create too-unpredictable movies are instantly impermeable. The Garden State tends to be one of those films. Certainly, Zach Braff, the star of a somewhat overrated sitcom, surprises people with some talent behind the camera, but that does not guarantee the kind of praise that accepts such a movie. The story is often too thin and shallow to give a real look. People likened this film to a graduate, but these people are the types trying to overcome an independent cinema. India movies are subject to the same hit and miss mentality that typically hits studio movies, but people seem to have forgotten that there are far more bad indie movies than good. The garden is not appalling, but it's not great. First, the film is too fast, leading to a relatively fast Large reemergence in its earlier life. Ten years later, people tend to act as if they never left. Where is the embarrassment? Of course, the situation is always resolved by a quick tasting of drugs (which I said was described quite accurately). The film seems to present many emotional inequalities, which gives us the idea that emotions will emerge later in a deeper and more thoughtful way. However, they will not be able to reach them on these fronts, and therefore we are interested in why the way to some of his decisions and moments was quickly resolved (similar to Peter Saarsgard's theft). It wasn't absolutely abysmal, but maybe we should stop praising the film as something that isn't.
