If you're a weirdo who thinks it's "romantic" and wonderful to have sex with a woman who is the genetic equivalent of your mother, get her pregnant, and then have her having sex once she has an abortion and not telling her she is with you relative, then you would like this movie. Do not forget that this guy is married and has a son at home - it is even more disgusting and regrettable that he has no conscience what he is doing. She can't do her job, her family, or Mary. It's defeated. There is nothing romantic or positive about this film - it's ugly and incestuous. <br /> <br /> He moves slowly after the first half of the film and doesn't go anywhere. I couldn't even finish watching this pathetic apology for 'romance'. I'm glad we didn't waste money in this movie theater. 0/10
