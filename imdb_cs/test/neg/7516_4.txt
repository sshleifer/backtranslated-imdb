You know they want to make the Moon a real one, and there is a debated project in Geneva that could lead to the machine being timed - all I can say about this film is based on facts about the future (film) science projects but real. I hope the moon will exist, it won't happen like in a movie. Now I saw the original film about the film itself and I also read the book. I didn't like the book, but the movie does. I totally agree with the previous remark that this film was depressing, unlike the 1960s. It was very good with strength, this was just a paralled future of what is a good movie.
