He bought this movie for one dollar and found that I could never go wrong. He enjoyed Ice-T acting and rapping that brought a lot of class to this Los Angeles movie and the pimps world. There is a boxer who kills one of his opponents in a training circle and who has a career, but because of mental problems from childhood and killing this other boxer he leaves. He was hired by a pimp looking for a bodyguard to protect the girls who work for him in their shop and make sure they were not defeated. This boxer falls in love with a boss's girlfriend and starts with all sorts of problems. This is fun and then becomes a great laugh comedy.
