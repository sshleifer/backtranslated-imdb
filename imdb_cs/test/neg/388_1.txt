Land Cabinet is an ugly job with excellent actors. There is nothing more (or less) in the film than the endless abuse of an attractive female prisoner by a sadistic police officer. Setting is minimalist. This could be considered a soft core of S&M porn because the drama lacks all reference points, such as time, place, and political context. Given what's going on, the futuristic fantasy environment is lost, the abuse becomes purely personal. Pornographic aspects are justified by being a warning against the evil actions of totalitarian government, but because there is no real context for the torture of this young woman, we are leaving the disturbance, but we have learned nothing. <br /> <br /> What is a point? That torture exists in the world? That the abuse of prisoners is bad? Are these dictatorships abusing innocent people? We already know that. Earth's cabinet echoes such works as Darkness at Noon and Ionesco Rhinoceros, but both of these works were made by competent artists whose work had a historical context and depth of meaning. This work is amateur and dialogue sophomoric. A certain thumb down.
