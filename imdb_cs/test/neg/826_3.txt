Ali G was initially funny. His interviews were fresh and original. The idea of ​​a fake gangster who wore OTT clothes and used street wisdom was initially appealing. But this film is just rehash of old jokes, humor was mainly childish and spun around the male genital organ for the most part. The film claimed good actors like Charles Dance, but their talent was wasted when they played silly 2-d characters. It's not "terrible," but it's not funny at all. It could be said that the film was the last bastion of comedy Ali G. Then he ran out of steam.
