Like another user I got it cheap - I thought. Â£ 85. Although it is not worth the amount of money, it is a total classic that I, like other users, first saw when I was little, and I was looking forward to seeing myself again after 20 years. The story is incredibly thin (which is why it could work for kids), but all the stuff on the radio and truck fix it. It will look good on my DVD shelf in the coming years. First Viewing (1980): 10/10. Second viewing (2002): 4/10
