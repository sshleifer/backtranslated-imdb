He just finished watching this after he got to the Michigan Bar sick trial. I wanted something that was mindless and that I could just sit and say, "What the hell did they think?" I was not disappointed in this commitment, but if I looked at it in a serious mood, I would be angry. The company that did this thing only combined CGI shots from the first Octopus and added a small footage with a fake octopus that makes the one used in "Bride of the Monster" look like a masterpiece of special effect shots. Since when does the octopus have fangs? The reason is that the NYPD is investigating several murders / disappearances on the Hudson River shortly before July 4th. He and his partner (who will soon be transported or soon to chew the fig octopus) will explore in a rather awkward way (they all believe that a huge octopus will kill people) and occasionally be accompanied by a woman. from the mayor's office. Of course, he believes on one that the octopus can get so big that the thing attacks the cop and the mayor's office. Surprisingly, all hell doesn't break and only a few cops and a few civilians are killed. <br /> <br /> Really lame. Don't bother with it.
