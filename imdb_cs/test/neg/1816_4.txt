This is the first and, if I can say, the only finished production of the "Heart of Darkness" ever released. Prior to launching "Citizen Kane", Orson Welles shot some test shots for the "Heart of Darkness" version, which was to be filmed entirely in what would now be called "POV", where we could see everything from Charlie Marlow's main character; he would be seen only gently in mirrors, windows, water, etc. The film was never made. "POV" technique was used, not very successfully, in 1947 in "The Lady in the Lake," with Robert Montgomery starring as Philip Marlowe. Probably, the match of the two "Marlow (e)" characters is just that. Of course, "Apocalypse Now" by Francis Coppola was based on "The Heart of Darkness". Short novel "Heart of Darkness" by British writer Joseph Conrad, who was born in Polish. magazine in 1899, features one of his favorite ego favorites, ship captain Charlie Marlow, who also tells a short story of "youth" and indirectly tells the story of "Lord Jim". Marlow, temporarily out of work, decides to accept the work of a river boat captain for a Belgian company involved in the brutal exploitation of King Leopold II's personal resources. Marlow travels from London to Brussels, signs with the company and tells him that his job is to take the ship down the Congo River to a far inland station headed by one of the company's most productive agents in the colony, a German named Kurtz. The transport of ivory, latex (for rubber) and other products from Kurtz's station stopped, and no word came down from Kurtz for some time. There are rumors that "left native". Marlow is to investigate, take the necessary steps, and report on his return. He takes a passage down the West African coast to the mouths of the Congo, is delayed for several weeks as he is forced to repair his ship at a station company on the coast, and finally sets off against the current to find Kurtz Station. River, warmth, vegetation, wildlife, insects, humans, all choose their perseverance, their imagination and their mental resources. He finds that Kurtz is sick, half mad and close to death. The last meeting and death of Kurtz are almost antiquals, especially since Conrad is so vague about what is happening, that we are left to think of it ourselves. This is a novel in which you close the book vaguely dissatisfied with the end, but still its story deserves a wonderful atmosphere. This "Heart of Darkness" was filmed by Guyana in Central America, where it was behind West Africa. . This is best where the novel is at its greatest disadvantage: In fact, it shows that the world's first urban planners will look like a boat trip on a tropical river. But the rest of the movie was forgotten. Tim Roth does his best as Marlow, but so much about conspiracy, characterization and character relationships has been changed to know that you wonder why they bothered. If the goal was to make Conrad's story on the screen, why didn't they leave him alone? It is unreasonable to expect that no compromises will be made when the book is made into film, but so many changes have been made that I have no film rationale for asking if they are just incompetent screenwriters and cameramen. The most disappointing was John Malkovich as Kurtz. He was totally distorted and simply got rid of his role. Everything about him is bad: His appearance, his acting style, his voice, his accent, everything. A very good choice would be someone like Bruno Ganz (unlike Malkovich, a real German, just like a character). It is a very unsatisfactory production and I would recommend it after reading a book if you want to depend on more than your imagination to get a visual image of a boat trip down the Congo River around 1900.
