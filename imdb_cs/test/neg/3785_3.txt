So this guy goes to the psychiatrist's office to meet for the first time. After completing the paperwork, the psychiatrist says, "I'll show you ink spots. Tell me what you see in them." "Well, says the patient," he looked at the first: "I see a man and a woman who has sex." When I see the other, he says, "I see two women having sex." When he saw the third, he says, "I see two men having sex." When I see another, he says, "I see two men and two women having sex." Psychiatrist puts down the inkblots. "So," he says, "we'll start by discussing your monomanism." "MY monomania?" says the guy. "And you with all the dirty pictures!" So this film will hit me.
