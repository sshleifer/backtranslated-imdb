I can't believe anybody's green, let alone volunteer in it. I will never be able to get 90 minutes of my life back. This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Some movies are so bad they're good. This is so far away that it's so bad that it's terrible. I wasn't expecting it too much, it was a low budget, jumping on the bandwagon, rehash movie B, but I still got below my expectations. Even TV films have higher production values. There were (very) bad special effects, a shocking dialogue, a terrible deal, and a completely unexplained plot. Who cursed her and why, why did the 6 inch snakes turn into heel legs, did anyone ever hear about poisonous snakes or pythons? 100 passengers? 3000 snakes? So many promises, nothing. Some comments would convince you that this movie is worth watching the last five minutes. It's not even for rent. Stay and watch a low budget TV movie, enjoy it much more. Why did this happen? Oh yes, blatantly cash on the internet phenomenon that is SOAP. Shame on you Mallachi Brothers, shame on you
