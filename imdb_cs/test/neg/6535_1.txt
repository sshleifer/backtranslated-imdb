IMDb presents this film as a comedy. I have no idea what genre this movie is, but it's definitely not a comedy. maybe tragedy. I'm not going to say if it's a good movie or not. All I know is that it's not a comedy. I wanted to laugh tonight and what I got was some bizarre idea of ​​some joining an ugly chair. This movie is not what is advertised. It is a film trio that I can only assume is intended to "think" people. I would not recommend this film to anyone I know or even do not know. It's a ridiculous drivel that makes no sense at all. That made me think fine. It made me think, "I wish I had the ninety minutes of my life back." I'm sure the world is full of Christian critics who have a liberal view of their world view that will make this movie something worth watching. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of them.
