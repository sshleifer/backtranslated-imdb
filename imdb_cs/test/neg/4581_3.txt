I live in Edinburgh and I am very thirsty for history, I was very discouraged by "liberties". Bad breed of dog to start !! The owner of Bobbys Old Jock was an old single man who came to Edinburgh and died a pauper in the dormitories, not like a movie. For anyone who comes to Edinburgh and hopes to see the sights of the film, you won't find a cemetery in Princes St Gardens !! There were a few moments when the tissues were great. The actors were fantastic in shutting down a rather poor script. I don't feel that poor Wee Bobby actually had enough time on the screen, maybe because he was "lost" in one place. All that was said, the movie was fine and every 8 years old would like it.
