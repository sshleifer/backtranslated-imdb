When I found out that it was Christmas holiday 2, I couldn't wait to buy a DVD. I sent the money and watched it as it passed through the mailbox. I love all the national lampoons movies with chevy chase in it, and I bet he was glad it wasn't in this! I couldn't believe how bad it was, you think it wasn't possible to laugh at national movies, but believe me it's! . This movie seemed to be a good idea on paper that had cousin Eddie as the lead character, started getting nervous from the beginning of the movie, and became completely uninteresting in the middle of the movie, and at the end of the movie I went dead and I couldn't remember what happened ! .
