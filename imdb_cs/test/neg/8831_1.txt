I would like to say clearly that I am not at all religious. I am an atheist, but I saw that Richard Dorkins was always opposed. I would also like to point out that I am not the kind of person who continually argues against something with philosophy, but I feel that when comparing science and religion we must be philosophical and willing to question faith in the mainstream of science as well as questioning religious beliefs. I wonder if Richard Dorkins sometimes spends some time thinking about faith philosophically, anyone who thinks science and religion is long and hard will realize that science is indeed the religion itself. Yes, there is a fundamental difference between the way scientific beliefs are compared to other religions but in its roots, it is a belief in a certain human instinct. In this series, Richard insists that scientific methods are the only right way of thinking and they have a sense of believing in something only if the evidence is strong enough for it. If you delve deep enough into how science works, you realize that it is as irrational as religion and that it is faith in the end, faith in evidence, faith in our common sense, faith in our senses, but more than anything else belief in our instinct to follow the pattern of repetition. It is not easy to explain, but to think about how the laws of physics were decided was because they were and still are the most common patterns of repetition. which we are aware of. I believe that human beings have an instinct that makes them convinced that the longer something stays in a certain state or place of existence, the more we believe it to be a blind belief that it is more likely to remain. For example, we do not expect that gravity will suddenly work in the opposite direction tomorrow, I mean to push matter away as it is to attract it. The only reason we do not expect this unexpected change is that we have known for so long that it always attracts, as we are aware. But that doesn't mean he can't do the exact recoil tomorrow or even right now. No matter how long something can stay in a certain state or change, there is no rational reason to believe about it, but we do it from instinct. I would like to ask you to consider what is the long and short amount of time? There is no such thing, I do not know exactly how long it took for these wise men to know that everything must be made of matter, sound, light, etc., but give them what they would consider a marginal path! Let's say much longer than actually 12,00000000000 years! Is it a long time period? 99999999999999999 years is 12,00000000000 years seems incredibly short time. We know that in the next trillion years, there might be extreme changes in the so-called Laws of Science. It's all about comparison, only when we compare things, can we say "that's long" or it's short. It is the same with big and small, wide and thin, heavy and light, strong and weak and others. I doubt every scientist can tell me why he thinks trusting this instinct makes sense. I'm sure I don't see why it should be, but that doesn't mean we should stop using it like humanity. With this in mind, the most hypocritical commentary made by Richard Dorkins was when he said that faith is irrational, "the process of not thinking," he said. If what we have in this instinct that I have described, and this instinct that we all have at some level, is not faith, I don't know what the hell it is. Other times, when it is hypocritical, it is when they talk about religions that are bronze, "myths about the Bronze Age." I would like to emphasize that no matter how many scientific methods have changed over the years through experience, experimentation and evaluation, pure science rules are getting older and older! They can even be described as holy bible sciences. He continued to be sick of different religions that are stubborn: "I'm right, he's bad", but he looks back at how rude he was to the various interviewees, he seems to be just as stubborn. To be fair to him, at least he is not trying to bomb religious communities. I appreciate his hatred of certain religious beliefs that create war, but I do not respect his arrogance in his own faith. As for me, Richard has the right to believe in science if that is his way. I am also scientifically taken into account, but I do not think she has the right to go up to religious leaders who have hostile arguments, try to force them to think about them, and practically label them stupid. Despite all his education, experience and discoveries, he seems to be unable to challenge his own belief system properly. I have read what she says in defense of this argument that open atheists like my self are presenting what she tells me that she is totally absent. Finally the title of the document, Root of All Evil. This says religion is the root of all evil, it is not true. There are causes of evil that have nothing to do with religion. The whole documentary series was a frustrating, narrow-minded, hypocritical and balanced waste.
