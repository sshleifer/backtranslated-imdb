I recently watched this movie mainly because I'm a huge Jodie Foster fan. I could see that this movie was created right between her two high prizes, so my expectations were quite high. Unfortunately I thought the movie was terrible and I was still wondering how she was ever convinced to make this movie. The script is really weak. The story itself could have been somewhat believable if someone like Mel Gibson played the role of a hit-man. The idea of ​​running Jodie with Dennis Hopper and his irritating accent couldn't be bought. I thought Jodie looked great throughout the movie, which was probably the only reason I watched the whole thing. Maybe marching Jodie around with as few clothes as possible was the only reason the movie was made. I saw Jodie's television biography, where essentially all of her films were commented in chronological order, and this film was the only one he never mentioned. After I saw it, I see why.
