I just caught a "Farewell to the King" on the cable, and maybe it's just because I'm a girl, but I thought it was on a crazy side. The screenplay and direction are pretentious (once I found out that John Milius was responsible, everything became clear). Supporting actors were not really bad - James Fox was excellent. The biggest disappointment was Nick Nolte, which I usually enjoy. As soon as he is born, he begins to speak very stiff English, and for half the time he seems to be a little upset, as if he were smoking a portion of Borneo's rainforest. And then the end - what ??? Learoyd happens to be on the same boat as a botanist (by the way, a botanist fired a girlfriend or something?) ??? The ship just happens to run on the beach conveniently near the island mature takeover crazy anglo ex-headhunting army deserter ??
