Hellraiser: Bloodline is where the continuity of Hellraiser's mediocrity goes well. Gone is the imagination and invention of the first two films. Gone is the ethos of Pinhead and his minions. They are sick people's desires. In fact, everything that once made Hellraiser so original was destroyed by this image mess. All that remains is the basic premise of Christian mythology that there is hell with evil demons. What happened to the evil men do? This watering apology for the Hellraiser movie is stuffed with endless Psycho Babble, so Pinhead becomes a philosopher who doesn't look like nonsense and not a harbinger of destiny. <br /> <br /> The film uses the most basic film patterns to separate characters and are individually killed. Pinhead is not Alien. The connection between the box and the "demons" or "hell" will never be discovered that it just comes to the victim and sits on the sideboard. The leading female character is called "Rimmer," and of course, I think manufacturers are really funny because they all still call her name. The film should be fixed to give it a name. Shame on you Kevin Yagher and Alan Smithee.
