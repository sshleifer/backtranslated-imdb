One day I thought about what was the worst today? I answered myself with a simple: "Oh, it has happened. I rented Killjoy / Killjoy 2 on the DVD. What to say? The budget was not big enough to rent a police uniform, the film carved sexual scenes and death scenes. There's one funny line I remember, and acting is much worse than the first. There seems to be no lighting on the "set" (forests somewhere) and the clown killer known as Killjoy (which makes Leprechaun look like an Exorcist) is less than spectacular. This time he is not portrayed by Angel Vargas and is completely changed as a character from a crazy irritating clown to another kind of crazy irritated clown who says "CHILD" a lot. Somewhere between Freddy Krueger and the grass blade ... this version of Killjoy lies. Somewhere between the pile of dirt and the pile with --- t lies Killjoy 2. It's a badness underestimated. This film has no redeeming qualities, except for the song at the very end of the credits ... which gives the enjoyment some enjoyment. Killjoy 2 is not really a movie, so much exercise in tension. Killjoy 1 is at least good enough to be considered the worst movie I've ever seen. MINOR SPOILER ######### Let me describe one of the supernatural scenes to kill. The girl is locked in a wooden shed of some sort (maybe in a shed?), When Killjoy glances into the hole. She has a few small trembling teeth (like the ones you can buy from Spencer's Gifts), and she does something with them (maybe she unpacks them!!). Then he holds them in his hands and says a terrible line (which can't be written on IMDB). From what I learned about this scene (not from what the movie shows), their teeth went into the cabin and killed the girl in some interesting but unnoticed way, and then returned to Killjoy. If I were the teeth, I'd run away. Run away from Killjoy to never get to me. Killjoy 2 is hopefully the last Killjoy we have to endure. Even as movie fans, others would say they are very bad, I think this "movie" could unite the human race and create world peace if it was promised that this film and anything that reminds us would be destroyed. I give it 2/10 - simply because the creators have succeeded in moving the pictures.
