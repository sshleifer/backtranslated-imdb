I must say it's not very good. Polly Bergen is fine in this movie. I'm gay and honestly, there's so much cliché for this time in history that it's just sad. We started watching it, then we turned it off, then we decided it would be fun to make fun of the rest of the movie. But everything has been said, the basic idea of ​​the film is good. If it had been rewritten with less fictional lines and it might be really good. I wouldn't recommend them all. IN additon this is what coo thinking line is so lame. In addition, combating hairdressing is fun because it's so bad. Lesbian nurse in the room with them while trying to get on it is so weird his sad.
