When I was a little girl, I absolutely adored The Swan Princess, it was the same fairy tales about Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, Princess and her Prince, who is saving that day, is always a timeless story that will never die, well, hopefully. But I thought I'd look at the sequel to The Swan Princess to see what they are and unfortunately, this is a typical cartoon sequel that just disappoints more than fun. The only character I found was still very entertaining, she was a queen, was very entertaining in this film and had the best role. But with the voice changes, they were noticeable and also bothered me quite a bit, I don't want to be picky, only it was too weird for me. The story was also more or less borrowed from the first princess swan, but the villain in this film follows Rothbart's footsteps. Odette and Derek are going to celebrate their anniversary, but Derek was too impressed by the struggle for his kingdom to keep him safe. She also comes with her mother's birthday, forgetting it because there is a new villain in town, Clavious, who hopes to go beyond where Rothbart's forces went and kidnap the queen for her birthday. But Odette has to go back to her swan me to help Derek fight him and save his mother. Swan Princess 2 is obviously more than fine for kids who don't mind me, it's good pure fun for them. The reason why these sequels are disappointing is that it's usually just for kids, it's the audience they're trying to do, but it's funnier for everyone to enjoy the jokes and the story. Now there are some laughter and giggles, but this was not, in my opinion, as clever as the first swan princess. I would recommend it for small but if you are looking for a fun cartoon, I would recommend staying with the first princess swan. <br/> <br/> 4/10
