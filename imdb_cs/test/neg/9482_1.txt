OK I saw this movie. Someone must kick me. WHY must Olsen twins insist that the world be subject to this stupid torture? It was another movie watching Olsen twins travel to an exotic place, meet some cute boys, look nice and have all the drooling over them. Direction, plot development, ugh acting. I do not know about the US, but in my country it is considered to be a very stupid hop on the wheel of the guy he met 10 minutes back. Although I am convinced that these girls will never learn to act, I really hope that one day we will watch a film with an original, even slightly acceptable plot.
