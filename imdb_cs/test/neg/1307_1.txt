I usually like these movies without a brain, but it was too stupid. There was too much clich√© and the plot did not make much sense. There were lots of free ends and the end was extremely poor and steep. We didn't even find out if the great master plan worked. We only saw the main character sobbing over his dead, Professor (who died for stupidity (see below)). One scene pissed me off separately. Why was the professor in his vessel only about 5 minutes of oxygen when he went to manually dam the dam? And if they had only oxygen tanks containing 5 minutes of oxygen, why didn't they lead two or three of them? Then would he survive? it was bloody stupid. The film is quite full of such stupid things. I can't recommend at all.
