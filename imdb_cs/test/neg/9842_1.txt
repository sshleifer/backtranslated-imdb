This movie is terrible. Not only is the story incredible, the situations in which the characters stand up are so stupid that it is not shocking. I find it sad that Daisy Eagan, the star of The Secret Garden in Broadway, decided it would be a career move. The idea is interesting, two young girls come very fast. But sex isn't even exciting. The film is stupid, the story is stupid, the performances are stupid and the whole concept, while interesting, falls. I'm sure all 14 year old girls are recognizing with the boys after they have had their first season trying to flush the toilet's panties. Better luck next time guys. Scale * T-Scale *
