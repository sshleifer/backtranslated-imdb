I couldn't agree more. The book is one of Dean Koontz's best novels and this film is a total travesty. I watched about half of them throw the tape into the basket in disgust! I have no idea what the idiotic director thought he was doing this piece of crap, but I'd rather tear my eyes out of the sharp wand than see this pointless movie again! Everything about this movie is just wrong. First, the main character is changed from ex marine to KID high school. WHY??? The second love of his life in the book becomes his mother in the movie! I bet Freud could say something about it! LOL. The dog is pretty cute and the best in the movie and totally thrown out all the others! Also, the main character helping them in the book betrayed them in the film. There is really nothing good to say about the film except that at least it's quite short for an hour and a half or so. If someone hasn't seen the movie yet, do yourself a favor! READ THE BOOK! It's much better than this worthless waste of time!
