The width and height of this film overwhelmed me. About a week ago I wrote a commentary on the silent epic MACISTE IN HELL of 1926, which refers to it as "stunning". Then I met Pollonia Bros BLOOD RED PLANET. Wow ... <br /> <br /> It's all about the range of thinking behind him. Pollonia Bros and colleague John McBride thought so much that musings of Arthur C. Clark and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: SPACE ODESSEY is lucky to have been released thirty-two years before this heart. In fact, Kubrick had light work with the modellers, the budget, the real actors, and the main studio support for his little Star Trek, and all Arthur C. Clarke had to do was write the damn thing. What's so muscular around a typewriter? Pollonia brothers, on the other hand, had to think radically, out of the box and quickly. They accepted half a dozen of their friends and colleagues - including the hot chicks - bought a lot of colored bulbs, attacked the old office supplies dumps for each keyboard, monitor and hands-free headset they could find, all agreed black turtlenecks, made with everyone basketball in the county, have learned enough 3D modeling and texture editing to revive a couple of spacecraft, spend a few hours drumming the script, do what is a scary space puppet monster because the terrible little monster Jabba Hut carried it, was fried R2D2 , spent literally days working with VHS camera and Amiga to shoot and edit their movie, and came to the winner. This is the best D.I.Y. Directly at home video fan movie epic space I've ever seen, and in proportion to the amount of talent and resources available to Dwarf filmmakers i LOGANS RUN or BATTLESTAR: GALACTICA (original series) as a cool look at our future, directly to the announcer who he wore a badly-tailored second-hand suit. As a species, we are doomed. For a minute, it's a huge advance on such later epics as DINOSAUR CHRONICALS or PREYALIEN: ALIEN PREDATORS, which is funny because it was either of these masterpieces before. Somewhere on the track, Pollonia began to take it easy: This movie is executed with some conviction that it will convince you that you can really breathe in a vacuum wearing a dust mask and two biker syringes. And the scene where the extraterrestrial beast consumes a miniaturized crew member immediately thought of where I saw it before: GODZILLA VS. SEA MONSTER, where a giant crumbling monster crab skewers two canoes and dreams of them at the camera. That made me cry when I was a kid. That made me cry like an adult because I'm wasting my time trying to be a critic or writer or writer / critic and these guys get to have all the fun, actually making a real feature-length epic with a lot of cool colored lights, hot chick and talking projector called KAL. One of the flight crews even takes his black baseball cap back and glowing with his goat like the Metallica clown. Is it supposed to be a joke? No. It's an epic statement about humanity, humanity, and humanity that deserves to be seen by anyone who has the ability to take none of them too seriously. Take a look at the GALAXY OF TERROR 2-disc box in your favorite DVD discount stores, which is probably where it belongs, but how many of us can say "Yeah, they have a few box sets of our movies for sale on Best Buy . "<br /> <br /> 4/10: Anyone who doesn't have a sense of humor would like to try SILENT RUNNING or maybe TRON. One day, however, a foreign civilization on the other side of the galaxy captures the transmission of this film and decides that we cannot be confused with it. Good work, guys!
