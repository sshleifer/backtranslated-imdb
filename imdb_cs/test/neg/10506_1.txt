I hope the people who did this movie have read these comments. The choreography was scary, the plot was nill and the actors where so low budget power rangers appear 5 stars of this junk. <br /> <br /> Battle scenes where you can really see the actors waiting for you to take the next step. Cameras and poor lighting could not hide cheap effects. The flash was just stupid. The guns looked like something of the final fantasy game and the double bow and arrows were just boring I had ever seen. <br /> <br /> Another movie that you decide to try to invest in some wireless technology, better the script and try to spend some time on your stunts. Frankly speaking, there are shows on TV that play at night and are thrown together in hours that look better than this. Stick to the martial arts (if not as bad as your actions), then to quilting.
