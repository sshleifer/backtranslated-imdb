Unfortunately, I went to this movie for fun purposes based on the limited information I saw on Fandango. Since I'm a science fiction enthusiast, I'm interested in the concept of UFO film. Instead, this film quickly emerged as an evangelical Christian propaganda film. Suitable for viewers of like-minded individuals but very non-Christian who want to use the movie scene and preach to unsuspecting audiences, especially with regard to ticket costs and concessions. Shame on you! At least Da Vinci's code didn't save his wild madness. So this class B movie (and I am kindly) will be praised in those churches with similar beliefs, probably on Wednesday and Sunday evenings of the youth group. But if you are a major Christian or non-Christian, you will not be comfortable.
