The film is nice Well depicted, but not originality ... this movie is directly copied from "The Hitch", where Salman plays as Date Dr. Like Will Smith, and Govinda as some fat jerk who's desperate to get in love with his boss until the end of the movie comes to an old Indian Flimi style, the father of the bride doesn't like the bride's lover and gets some more groom, and Govinda's lover's bride comes to the end and save her from a new groom and fantastic dance and other things. <br /> <br /> The comedy was really good, no doubt when it comes to Hindi, it will be much more fun .... Finally it is worth watching, but when it comes after a few months in television ...
