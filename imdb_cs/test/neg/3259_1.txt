After watching Caddyshack 1, I heard that it was a sequel and decided to look for it. The film looked pretty bad, and I was wondering to stay away, but I gave up stupid and actually bought the damn thing! All reviews and all the bad things you have heard about Caddyshack II are true. The movie is just worn out by ideas and lamest plot and jokes I've ever heard, gopher, acting the whole movie is really bad (Randy Quaid was fun though). Just stay away from this movie as much as you can is all I can really say. I deeply regret watching and buying DVDs, but I'm not sure which decision was worse. Stay as much as possible.
