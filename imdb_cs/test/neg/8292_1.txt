Lost a Bet? As a film fan, I like to appreciate the bad movies along with the big ones. But "Shoot or Be Shot" has no fake or funny pieces, unintentional or not. While unrated, there were no unsuitable scenes (winks or you miss nudity, cartoonish shooting) violence "with endless firearms", so one is led to believe that manufacturers just wanted to save the fee needed to do so It will make his way to the cable with barely 10 seconds edited out. <br /> <br /> Of the eight people in the theater with us, four of them left in the middle of the road, muttering statements like Shatner plays an escaped psychiatric patient who has been denied release because he looks at himself as a screenwriter, and the test committee verifies his request for "INSANE." who "shoot video because it is 80% cheaper than a movie" and decides to force them to shoot the script.
