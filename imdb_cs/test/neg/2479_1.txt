Really, really ... What will please the audience (American!) In this so-called show it is absolutely out of me. What we can learn from these series: <br /> <br /> 1. Every year, each casino spends about $ 2-3 billion on satellite rental and a huge number of high-resolution cameras for their security teams. Let the FBI bite the dust on them. 2. Every safety worker must have sensual breasts, naturally, of course. Breasts must be exposed all the time, otherwise they will lose their jobs. 3. If an employee becomes a man, he needs a breast implant, then go to step 2. <br /> 4. One in Hollywood one can brazenly rip another show's ideas then implement them as their own and call all that crap "original" and "art". 5. Any security with breasts larger than 39D is considered immortal and cannot die. <br /> <br /> I really want to be able to vote with negative values. -10/10 for this!
