For all my flaws I am inclined to be charitable for "Things". There is an nugget interesting, scary, claustrophobic story of Hitchcock style here. Put it in the hands of a writer like Theodore Sturgeon or (if you prefer the British perspective) Robert Bloch, or the one who wrote "Day Of The Triffids," and maybe you had an ugly, disturbing little scarecrow story that was the best thing in the book anthologies horror and thrilling stories. However, someone has decided to tell this story as a feature film, and cheap, second speed on it, and so most of the potential is a waste. A story like this really needs a voice like Sturgeon to bring out interesting character jokes in better light. His classic story "The -widget-, the -wadget- and Boff" is an example of how he can gather an isolated group of "ordinary" characters and turn them into the funniest, compassionate and fascinating people you've ever met in a 40-page space. A good writer can with a few selected words make the reader "see" some of the liveliest and memorable events ever scar his emotions. Instead, we have a movie where some of the most irritated and improbable characters that have ever been produced are concentrated and created for interaction in the unconvincing "Where Did It Happen?" moments that just lie there. (IE blond psychic girl who claims that "You are all evil and I hope you are destroyed!"). We get lead stimulation and slow blocking and blunt sets and tough actors. I blame the director for the "stiff and shallow" part. These are all third-order actors who have never done a great deal of time, but are also "real" actors, and a good director could get better performances. We get unsolicited lesbian undertones that make the viewer feel uncomfortable and exploited without any kind of reward. (If I have my baser instincts exploited and I feel guilty, I want to do something better than that). And we get more than an hour of fearsome growth that is scattered over 35 seconds in one of the worst anti-climax I've ever seen. Good stuff about "Thing"? Um, well ... some of the close-ups of the witch's head that quietly gathered directives were effective enough. The poor and clever widow came to life (though I wanted to sock her sock in her mouth). The first scene, where a big, "simple" ranch hand silently turns on a greasy cowboy and kills him, was a little shocking because the conspiracy became a problem for the big guy to be quite sympathetic. And, as I said earlier, the idea of ​​insidious power from the past, which turned members of the isolated community against each other, is good and can keep interest far beyond the true merits of poor performance. What it definitely is for. However, as I said, I am inclined to be charitable because the director probably worked under a thrilling budget, cruel time constraints and the best actors he could find. money. Heaven knows how future generations will judge fake crap like "The Cave", "Wrong Turn" or "House of Wax" remake 40 years from now. I hope they are charitable for our own taste in supporting our generations of film storage waste.
