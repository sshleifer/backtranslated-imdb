This film is delayed by a cheap film that is trying to be a stoner film because the characters are looking for a pot, but none of them are smokers just a bunch of garbage Thomas Hayden's church shouldn't be directed especially to this film, which is a waste of film. The people who liked this movie gave good comments, but of all the people who are here, they are just retarded and don't watch movies, so they think any bad movie is good when the actors suck and the film sucks balls. I think many people will be upset because this film is trying to make it look like the ultimate weed movie when it's just the worst weed movie I've ever seen, I hope people stop the director In the direction of bullshit like that weed, this movie can't be funny or fun.
