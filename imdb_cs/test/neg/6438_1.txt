This soap is worse than bad: it's poisonous. Of the many TV shows that have had a corrosive impact on British society over the past twenty years, Eastenders is a prime example. For two decades, this show has celebrated the oaf, thief, wide boy, cake, gobby, violent, sexually incontinent, criminal, ignorant, uncompromising ... How many times has someone or someone pointed out that Eastenders "reflects" life"? Exactly the life on which planet? It is written about "working class" characters, as imagined by middle-class people who have passed a creative writing course. They want to show their high school peers how familiar they are with the "working class" that they dream of a Lumpensian brave who is an Eastenders citizenship. It has a toxic effect on some minds less. Well equipped than others to master fiction, so we find members of the real population provided the attitudes and behavior of Walford residents. So, it happened that Eastenders mirror life; but only after life was deceived into the Eastenders mirror. Other soaps followed in the footsteps of EE, filled with their stinking firearms with ugly, potato faces, shaved heads, pot-bellied characters, frowning and constantly threatening. This is the proletariat as perceived by writers who produce this waste. Writers will be rich in the proceeds of this ascent and will continue to use the finer things of life in rarely enclaved enclaves. Meanwhile, a growing number of new TV-induced drones will continue inexorably towards cultural bankruptcy. And there you have new priests and new creatures from the early 21st century. Much of it is due to the immense power of the illuminated dance pixel box in the corner of your living room. It's your fault, gentle reader: that's what you chose as the only window through which you can look out of jail.
