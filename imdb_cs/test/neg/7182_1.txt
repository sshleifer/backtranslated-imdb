Another example that we should keep away from trying to make spectacular action films in Sweden, does not work, except for the Widerbergs who have not yet beaten MANNEN. Stormare does the best he can, I think, and some scenes are slightly effective, but the plot is full of holes. Why does Hamilton continue to attack the base and know that his wife is a hostage? It was fun to see Mark Hamill, but his Bad Guy-part was very underwritten. I am constantly wondering that relatively large Swedish films like this one get without a reasonable, functional scenario. 1 of 5.
