While I was sitting and watching the whole thing, I have to say that it wasn't good.it was all over the place, with big bits of information missing about how things evolved and even inaccurate in some bits too.If you know nothing about Michael, You need to understand the thing.You must rely on your current knowledge of man to make some pieces to make sense. The making was a bit dramatic, Flex Alexander didn't look anything like Michael who was postponed for me and at the end he literally looked gray.saying it to display Michael As a somewhat naive but very positive, gentle and loving individual was fine even though they still made a fool of him time to time.If you want to watch MJ's life story look "American Dream". to cover the "Bad" era I have no doubt they will eventually make a big movie about the life story of MJ, cos Michael You rock ;-) !!!!
