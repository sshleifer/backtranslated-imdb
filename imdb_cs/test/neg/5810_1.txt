It's hard to know exactly what to say about this still weak and boring little movie. The story is predictable when it's not completely laughing. It is all a question of "conscientious gestures" which, as stated here, bear absolutely no conviction. Yes, MGM's "production values" are beautiful, and yes, Mrs. Lamarr was beautifully beautiful, but she and the great Spencer Tracy had absolutely no "chemistry" together - and that's the only thing that would make this clich√© show. all effective ... I understand that this movie got bad reviews when it was originally released; time has not improved.
