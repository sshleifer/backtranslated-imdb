This movie is about the worst I've seen in a very long time. Terence Stamp is absolutely useless and the only thing I enjoyed was to hear my favorite song "If I Million Dollars" from BNL's opening credits. Ashton Kutcher plays the lead character, a dear fellow who has slipped into a house where he was sitting for his boss. There are disasters. Blah blah blah. If you have time to kill and have nothing better then it's a movie for you. Otherwise, watch something else. There are not necessarily any redeeming moments, but it is nice to see Molly Shannon and Jeffrey Tambor on the screen. It is always a pleasure to watch, even if the light spots have been subdued.
