This conglomeration fails so miserably at every level that it's hard to decide what to say. They don't deserve one line, much less ten, but follow the IMDb rules, here they go, and I probably won't be successful for the first time and have to write some more to accept this proposal. LOL <br /> <br /> If I saw this schlock during the 1970s, as I went through my mushroom phase, I would still consider it inconceivable and shallow. The most interesting shot for me was a long shot as the elevator door opened and closed. I was on the edge of my seat. One person wrote here that he had met the creator of this mess, as if it were the day of the red letter in his life. We can only pray that something much more exciting appears in the poster.
