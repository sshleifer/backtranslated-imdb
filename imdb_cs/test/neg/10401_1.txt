Kubrick may have been the greatest director of all time. Maybe he did more classics than anyone else. Maybe he was a perfectionist. But man, his first attempt was always wrong! Kubrick had a good reason to try to make this movie disappear from the map: it looks like Ed Wood's movie. She has strange narrations, cheap shots, bad dialogue, ominous music reminiscent of your sci-fi / horror movie with the 1950s and what appears to be related to the cast of "Reefer Madness", which is spreading without reason. Sure, there you can see undeveloped Kubrick. It's a psychological / horror study of war. The characters have become dehumanized and insane. There are people who play more than one role. There are constant shots of faces and special facial expressions of different people. There are some interesting shots. But really, it's a mess. Of course, I'm not going to discourage you from watching. If you do, you join a selected group and several thousand people around the world who have access to it.
