The back of my DVD describes the conspiracy "El Chucabra": after his capture in the wild, the legendary bloodthirsty creature Chupacabra escapes into the city, creating chaos and panic. As they chase a deadly animal, an animal control officer and scientist Dr Starlin Davide realizes that vigilance with his own suspicious plan also follows an elusive killer for a mysterious research facility run by the evil dr Goodspeed. This horrible horror movie is somewhat amusing when you watch it under the influence of alcohol. Silly, acting is wooden outside the faith and direction is amateurish. \ tTwo rubber suits of Chupacabra are easily the best thing on this movie. 3 of 10 and it is very kind.
