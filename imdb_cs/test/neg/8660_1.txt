What a crappy movie! The main character in this film was to be born and raised in Canada, yet had a stronger Indian accent than his parents! Is it just me or Uday to look gay in this movie? Also, do all the cubs in Canada dress like sluts? At least it's in this movie. All women are dressed like strippers. Don't waste your time with this! The only good thing about this movie is setting it up in beautiful Vancouver. I wonder why Bollywood is going through a downturn? It's because of movies like this. I miss good old days when Hindu movies were really fun, and I couldn't finish the movie because it was so bad. I think Bollywood has to stop trying to replicate the Hollywood style because it just doesn't work. He has to stick to his roots because that's what makes Indian movies fun.
