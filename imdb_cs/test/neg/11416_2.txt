"Quit while your forward" is a phrase they never learned. A typical Hollywood sequel scenario: if the first movie was just shocking, the second wasn't, expect the third to be the worst thing that hit the screen this year. Even worse are the prequeles whose events have already been explained in detail. If you haven't seen the first two movies, you won't like it. It's like starting to watch the Lord of the Rings or Star Wars with the latest trilogy movie. So this movie is not "stand alone". Don't forget the first film about the revenge of Lucians? Remember the second one about a long-lost wild brother? Well, if you've seen those two 5 minute moments and put them together, will you get ??? 5 min prequel. But ether makers thought these five minutes were vital historical events, or just wanted to give some actors, casts and crews some money, and maybe make some money in the process. "I have a lot of money, I make a living and I'm bored. What will I do? I know! I'll make a movie." So even so you get 5 min prequel and stretch it for 90 min ?? It's the movie. And you know what happens to the main "immortal" characters, so there's little tension. By the way, the whole movie drama is in those 5 minutes. The only thing that raised an eyebrow was the mother who killed the begging of the film. Sick. The rest was a remix to Braveheart. If you want a comedy, check out Braveheart first and then this movie. <br /> <br /> Will I brag a little now? the movie gave me the mood. Who invented the concept of "vampire vs. werewolf" in the first place? It's older than I am and got old as fast. And why do vampires look like girls warm, while werewolves look like psycho bears? Hiding bad movies behind the clip will fail. Isn't it time we got some reasonable, slimer werewolves with an upright attitude? How can their invariant werewolves even multiply when they all tear apart? And why with all their powers the vampires ruled the world? Blaa blaa blaa ?? What a shame.
