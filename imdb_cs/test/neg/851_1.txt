The Italians are undeniable masters in dubious "art" as they pull out and imitate movies. What they do is to engage in an innovative, cash-generating and foreign concept, to maintain a basic conspiracy and just to add a variety of actions, sleaze and political misstatements. But what to do if a non-Italian original is an allegedly well-known film and is difficult to overcome in terms of conspiracy and controversy? Well, I think you simply overlook everything related to building a story or style, and fully focus on that something that is practically a porn movie! This Italian turkey was inspired by the successful slave saga "Mandingo" Richard Fleischer, released a year earlier, but because the creators were still too lazy to invent another name, you should not expect anything that remotely resembles the narrative depth, the drawing of the characters. , disturbing atmosphere or provoking statements about cultural relations. "MandingA" is a clean and simply sexploitation effort where conspiracy develops only over the last ten minutes, in other words, when you stop worrying long ago. The characters in this film are a gathering of despicable bastards, which is, of course, the expectation when you are dealing with the rich and unpleasant white people who run a plantation in South America. The older and extremely slim site owner is a widower (who has also probably won several Mustache-of-the-Year awards) that exploits and extends the whips of the slaves working for him. His mistress, who, if I understood that he was also his cousin (?), Is a real female of a woman who has provocative arguments and sneaked out of the house overnight to be copied with crucified slaves. When the plantation owner's son returns from Europe, after about 25 minutes of purely wasted run time, they finally finally develop. A handsome young man has sex with a biting wife several times (even before slaves, supposedly "showing off" as their masters do?), But in the end he falls in love with the daughter of a cherub preacher. Apparently his romantic preference is angry with a nasty woman and she conspires a terribly cruel act of revenge that will forever change the life of a plantation. Hi ?? I just realized that this brief description of the conspiracy actually "Mandinga" sounds like an interesting movie! Well, it's not, and I'm sorry when I woke up someone's expectations. It is an incredibly boring and ugly film to fight, but if you are attracted to these topics, then try the above-mentioned "Mandingo". Much more than ill-exploited, this film is really a keen portrait of one of the darkest historical aspects of mankind, and it was also a well-produced film, with real actors, great music and impressive movie locations. "Mandinga" has nothing to offer.
