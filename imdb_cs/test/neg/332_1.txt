I knew Brad Linaweaver in Florida's State of U in the early 1970s when he was an inspiring, resourceful writer I thought was headed for more fame. <br /> <br /> That's why I rented this video. Well, well, time was not kind to Mr. Linaweaver. I believe that the pressure on living makes higher ambitions unnecessary. Another flower whose flower came and disappeared in the summer breeze. Amen. There's nothing to say. And nothing more to add. A sad epitaph on a once-flowing career, as mentioned above. But it is the price one pays for pursuing shadows without a solid foundation or goals for oneself in life. Because this film has no purpose, no purpose, and I wondered what happened to Brad's creativity, his once glowing genius? Away, gone, years of neglect worsened his once shining mind.
