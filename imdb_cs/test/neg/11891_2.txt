At the University, our philosophy professor, Mr. R., played "Roger & Me" in full. This was at a time when obese was still largely unknown; A charlatan-in-the-making, soon-to-be-household-name that was still busy honing his facts bending facts and still learning how to manipulate easily the impression of pathologically paranoid, mentally ill, sexually frustrated, illiterate, half Literate, clueless, and ridiculously trusting among you. When we looked at it, I thought, "Yeah, that was somewhat funny - in a totally stupid Bugs Bunny kind of way - but what is an ultraobjective, anti-capitalist turkey propaganda that has no objectivity This is her only purpose is to take cheap shots of the people and ideas that the filmmaker has pet-peeves for .documentary about any imagination. ‚ÄùOur beloved Marxist professor, however, was absolutely thrilled with R&M and we ended up not only that we do not criticize any of its aspects, but Mr R. has indeed spent the rest of the class praising his "qualities." To understand each other, the words "propaganda", "audience manipulation", "left-wing extremist" or "selective presentation of facts" never she didn't leave his constantly smiling mouth ... And just to remind you: it was supposed to be a class of philosophy, not INDOCTRINE YOUR STUDENTS WITH YOUR OWN POLITICAL BS Of course, now I get to a really interesting aspect: this professor, Mr.R, is now a very successful screenwriter in Hollywood. He has written several left-wing scripts with A-grade stars in them. The Morality of the Story: These are the people for whom all the doors are open in Hollywood. Michael Moore is a talented filmmaker (who has proven beyond smidgen doubt with "Canadian bacon"), but being a Marxist liberal opens the door to almost everyone. Tinseltown is teeming with angry pro-Chavez extremists, so political brainwashing with spatial images of reality is part of all Hollywood experience for decades. Accept this demagogue and you betray your own brain forever.
