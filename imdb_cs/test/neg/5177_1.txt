Blame Guy Ritchie. The end of the 90s of the success of Ritchie's locked Lock clich√© and two smoking barrels triggered a series of pathetic gangster films that never restored the genre. Sadly, Rise of the Footsoldier - the real story of Essex Hardnut Carlton Leach - is unlikely to reverse this trend. Despite Hartnett's decent lead, the film becomes a victim of the well-known East End stereotypes. Either they are busy blowing someone's brain, or a scaly subordinate blonde. From a spooky football hooligan in the 1980s to a key figure in the criminal underworld in the 1990s. ranks. Leaving terraces for nightclubs, Leach becomes a bouncer where carte blanche is given to kick crap out of anyone. Here he comes with notorious gangland leaders Pat Tate (Fairbrass) and Tony Tucker (Stone), and begins to realize that gang-warfare isn't what it's cracked to be. Is it fun to be had a deconstructing writer-director Julian Gilbey's ridiculous connection-dots yob patois, as every sentence looks like it starts, 'I'll be fackin' ?? or 'Ty fackin' ?? Or, at times, 'so I just went' fackin '??, typically closed with a mandatory' caaaant! Also the direction stinks with sadism, especially the apparent pleasure Gilbey gets from shooting the violent scenes in detail, and in the case of a bloody shot from the shotgun's face, in three versions. Director Gilbey uses the classic gangster story of ascension and fall, which is not what condemns Footsoldier to the big screen. Nor is it the fact that in the middle of the journey the film missed Leach in favor of events that culminated in the infamous shooting of Tate and Tucker. It is Gilbey's ugly appetite for scattered violence that will destroy the film; Whether it is a brick in the face or an ax in the head in a malicious train attack, it is unnecessarily extended. Footsoldier doesn't have as much punch wrap as you feel broken and, more importantly, robs you of two hours of your life you can't get back ...
