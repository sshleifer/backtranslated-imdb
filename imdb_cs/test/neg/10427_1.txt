and I've seen a lot of movies. I saw it in the theater in 1989 and I still remember the terrifying urge to go out. If you like John Belushi, respect his talent or even the holiness of cinema - this film has nothing to offer you. It is mostly a pathetic show for Belushi's biography, Bob Woodward. As we see the progress of Belushi's life on the screen, Woodward appears in the film as a ghost. The most offensive scene occurs when Belushi dies, looks up from his mortal bed, and sees the author standing over him and spoke weakly "Breathe for me, Woodward". There are too many terrible things to mention, all of which are the smallest that Belushi jumped out of the bag in the morgue and got into a taxi powered by a guy named Angel. I'll leave it.
