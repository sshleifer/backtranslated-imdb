I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience. It is a film that is visually rich, but with a slow direction, poor graphics, and 2-dimensional characterization. But I knew it when I went inside. I was willing to believe the two gentlemen I went with (knowledgeable comic book enthusiasts) that the visuals would be out of the ordinary and so they were. Unfortunately, the inexperience of direction meant that the scene after the scene went through very little dramatic tension or conflict. Although it is a commentary that could be created by many artists whose work is converted to the screen and who are in charge of management. The tempo of the story is lost, because the camera lovingly dwells on pretty pictures. I wouldn't go without making sure that the style of the film should be worth seeing. I tried with the work of Neil Gaiman, but I always left the feeling of a "new emperor". I live in hope, but last night was no exception. I don't think I can go on analyzing Gaiman's work without losing the will to live. Read the rest of the comments and all his mistakes are aptly described. However, I cannot understand how he imagined he should understand the mind of a fifteen-year-old girl, nor what he had to say added something to the sum of human knowledge about adolescence and the assumption of adult responsibility, or the changing relationship a girl might have with her mother. These are the central themes of the film, and they are being worked out harshly, stereotypically, and without the depth of imagination. All the nice pictures in the world can't replace the work that is wrong in the kernel.
