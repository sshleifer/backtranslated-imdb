I wish I could vote on this ten movie, it's so fun. If they wanted it to be so funny, I'd give her ten. I have to give him 1, but it's the funniest hell you want to watch. Look at the giant blurring of the flash across the screen! Where did it come from? What is it? It flies, it scares, it's electrifying, it's on the strings! This bird has a real personality. It was about ten when I first saw it, and when Big Bird appeared on Sesame Street, I was sure they were one and the same!
