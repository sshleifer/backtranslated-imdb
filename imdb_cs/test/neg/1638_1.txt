Credits come from the work of sewing Sandy Frank, which was made to transform this film into Cave Dwellers for re-release. Now that it's clear ... oh! Unbearable, painful pain. Blade Master jumps without shyness to the sword and the witch-running line that began to swipe Conan ... he never left the garage in addition to the bandwagon. As such, this Italian film is a joker trying to rip out the box office with predictable results. However, this would bring too little credit to the director and writers, who would not even try to maintain a coherent plot, continuity, any semblance of the era of accuracy. Miles O'Keefe is no leading man, now or forever (Tarzan The Ape Man proved that if Ator didn't). It's just an unlikely picture and a chore to watch.
