What bothered me with so-called "scientific" programs, such as these, is that they are presented as if it were a FACT that lives "dinosaurs" for millions. First, no one can even conduct a scientific experiment to prove that the earth is millions of billion years old. It is a shallow theory based on inaccurate radiometric dating methods with huge assumptions thrown into evolutionary sweat. Second, no one can prove that evolution has ever happened. All Darwin's missing links are still missing! When you look at all the fossils anywhere in the country or on the ground, they are complete animals of a particular species, such as a dog or a cat. No one has ever found a dog skeleton that would turn into a cat, or in the example given in this series, a dinosaur that turned into a bird. This is a sheer pig. There is more evidence that Santa Claus exists than any animal passing into another species of animal. All thoughts presented in this series are an attempt to eliminate the idea that the universe and everything in it has been created. . <br /> <br /> This series is NOT KNOWLEDGE. It is a religious world view that hides under the banner of science. Science is something we can observe and repeat. What you see here is SCIENCE FICTION. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a science fiction program that has the decency to admit it's a science fiction program, then watch Star Trek or Star Wars.
