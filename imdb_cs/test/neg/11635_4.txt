First Watch 29.7.2001 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mark Dindal): The fast, frantic animation effort of Ted Turner's animation group plays a lot like TV cartoons and leaves a lot of wishes in the area. characters, but certainly has extremely improbable villains. I'm not even sure why children would like this movie because there are so many references to old movie stars that little or no children know about. The average effort, at best, despite the praise on the box that compares it to Disney's efforts like Aladdin and the Lion King. Don't let it fool you - there's no comparison in story or quality.
