I wish I read the IMDb comments before I saw this movie. The first 1 hour was fine, although I was wondering why everything is concentrated in Chicago and why no one reported any weather anomalies from the US. Isolated acts of nature (this range) are unthinkable. But in the first 60 minutes, the film just pulls like a never-ending story. The script is terrible. As for the actors, a very bad choice. Only people hired to run in panic have kept their roles. But I have to agree that this film has some good "special effects". If you rented it on DVD and want to watch the movie, despite the reviews, then play at the maximum speed a player would allow!
