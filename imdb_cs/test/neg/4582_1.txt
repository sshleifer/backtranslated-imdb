Greyfriars Bobby NOT IN THE WEST - Bobby was a terrier. The highlight of my children's trips to Edinburgh was to go to Bobby's memorial. I grew up with the story of a brave and loyal dog, as every child in my generation did, and I remember my mother and I standing outside the cinema - with many other kids from Dundee and their mothers - to see the amazing Disney movie. How could a film based on such a wonderful story be created by the Westie, for heaven. It's like doing a film about the life of Robert Burns and portraying him as an Englishman. I'll tell Bobby his breed!
