It's early morning of our discontent, and some of my friends and I just went through watching "The Wind". Really disastrous film. Not in the sense of the forces of nature that cause confusion on the unsuspecting people, but rather a horrible film that causes disaster to an unsuspecting audience. To show you how frustrating it was to follow this particular bomb, I'll give you an example quoted during my first painful observation. If you decide to watch this movie a second time and say I'm cooking, I'm afraid the choice won't be immediate. But instead of just adulterating "ad peliculam" with lousy one-way lines, I get specifically to why exactly my friends and I made this movie. <br /> <br /> I like the low budget horror moves to get started. I even love the artsy, low-budget horror movie. I liked "Cold Hearts", "Midnight Mass", "Jugular Wine", etc. Films that were ambitious and brave, even though they lacked production values, executions and even gaming. In general, an interesting premise, unusual camera technology or just a mere scene or two will save a film that is a bit rough on the edges. With these conditions in mind, I would like to say convincingly that I hated "wind." The movie was probably the most disappointing in the sense that it was incredibly frustrating to watch. From the actions of the main characters, to the flow (?) Of the Conspiracy, to the great portraits that indicated the opening that finally strives for dust (and did not logically add to what happened in the rest of the film, and left the viewer waiting for something more , with a sense of many and nothing). The dialogue was at best dirty, delivered with wood and completely unrealistic. I mean, no one in any of the situations in which the characters would be, wouldn't react the way the characters did, or say the things they said as they called them. There was an obvious lack of vision and direction that would correct this problem. The interaction between characters and development was nonsensical. Claire, "lambent sex goddess," or so aggravating, passive-aggressive lamesters in the film thought, was so apparent in her manipulations she may also have pulled a gun on the characters. However, she was the shining top of the film. The other main characters (with the exception of Mick's Milf Mom who were not terrible) are so unclear that they can be equally displayed by the same actor. Let's see if I miss something: a borderline personality, co-responsible goons with deep feelings of sexual confusion and inadequacy, prompted to bouts of cruel rage through formless orchestrations of loose lips bimbette-sudden-and-indecent-turned-Caligari. No, I think it's about. <br /> <br /> Insufficient scope was also problematic. As the people who contributed to this film expect the casual viewer to deduce that it was the beginning of the end of the world from this amateur, incredible, poorly rendered pentagon of lust (what would they call it?) For the most part in the forest in the middle of nowhere. ? There were no "atrocities" witnesses. There were no witnesses anywhere in this film. The credibility problems that result from this lack of attention to detail have been extended from where the plot begins to kill. Case-in-point: If that kid Bob took this path through the woods to come back from the gym, and here's the key, **** every day, ****, there's a great chance that someone else would be around to they saw something at some point after the perpetrators were loudly arguing about the crime scene. One would think that with the murder of a young man in the forest, the city would be upset, the characters would be questioned, etc. But instead a witness (other than Earl, a psychopath ward without an internal monologue) was in sight. We suggest there is no witness *. For quasi-homosexual meanders, I have no problem with those. It's not as if they came as a surprise, because we were thinking that since the second scene we were screaming on a closet case for most male characters. Again, it is not problematic in itself but thrown for the wrong reasons. It was totally useless, fitting for the pure value of "shock" and / or "dangerous art", and neither shocking nor dangerously artistic from any perspective. Instead, we had a strenuous attempt to redeem a boring, clumsy film with a boring, clumsy plot. The poorly implied sexual tension, which was only hinted at in anticipation of this flaccid scene, only moved this film to a "mediocrity totem" that deserves criticism of "sucking film so badly that it lacks its own grace to suck enough to mock right and tendon. So it is with most of the film, a lot of artistic groping, very little meat and a lot of deterioration. It's not like we don't get it. Oh, we got it, all right. We don't want it. Look, the fact that we were bludgeoning as the only tabel in the final scene that made sense on his face is a hint of something wrong with this movie. Instead of moving quickly, as its name suggests, the film flowed slightly forward, as when the sweat path was moving along the side of your nose while your hands were full. Argh. The feeling quite well sums up the intestinal frustration that occurred while watching this train wreck. With regard to this film, there is no breath of fresh air, just a miasma of bad ideas poorly realized, rotting before coming to fruition.
