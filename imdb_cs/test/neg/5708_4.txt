A woman engaged in art begins to have a passionate love relationship with a man named John. They love everywhere they go and play sexual games. The problem I had was all they did. This film has never happened, nor has I seen it. Hot erotic passion was the best thing about this movie, but I wanted something else. Maybe it could be a serial killer or a secret. I needed something, and everything there was was a bunch of love scenes. Not that it was wrong or anything, I just wanted more things to happen in the movie. Maybe an associate also slept with him. Anything! I was very upset that it was all there was. Mickey Rourke was so hot then. I wonder what happened.
