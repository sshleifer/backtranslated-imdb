As bad as good - not just the screenplay is obvious, but acting is not just bad but pathetic. The worst of all is the definition of characters: unrealistic ingenuity, influenced by responses, cameras forces them to follow the superficial aspects that are introduced as keys to conspiracy. Can't prevent laughter when, in the end, the main character says that something like 'your daughter doesn't play football and doesn't know cooking'. Such an attack on women's intelligence defines the level of this film. Is there a film about the psychological behavior of the second character?, about its impact on the main character? or just about the sequence of events to keep it warm for the obvious end? Pls, make them more - I had a good time guessing what's going to go wrong ...
