You will watch some movies because they touch your soul or challenge you in ways that grow. Some will follow because you want to be exposed to adventure or shock beyond your experience; they will not feed you directly, but will help you to settle into a bigger world than you would otherwise have. After all, the hard parts of life are in what you choose not to accept. And then there are films that don't do one of these things that you'll watch out of duty, or because you need a historical context. This is quite a worthless experience in terms of building life. The problem is, of course, that you often don't know which of the three movies will be. people you trust, but because life in the film is so personal, you won't know until you go to a blind date. <br /> <br /> It was worthless to me. Yes, yes, I know that many Bunulas are the embodiment of noble and rich. And you should know (if not) that my strange movie experiences are really weird movies, really weird. The point is not that it's not film, nor symbolically deep, or apolitically / politically friendly to the way I think. It's how he gets out there. His deviation from the real deviation that bothers me. The problem is that it is a successful alternative art, which means that it is a successful commercial art. Which in turn means that it can be simply explained and the explanation is not only widely accepted, but simply coded in brief. Certainly it all applies. When the term "surrealistic" is used, it is generally used incorrectly to refer to any film image or world that differs from reality or seems strange. But when used correctly, that is, by consensus theory, it always revolves around Bunuel, and especially this movie and the one he really did with Dali. Because they invented the surreal cinema, they define and control the term. That in itself troubles me and I have my own alternative definition that does not come from their philosophy. Because philosophy is quite the opposite. It is not at all a philosophy, but a rejection of philosophy, an anti-group. His wrapped anarchy, carefully picking the things they use, and the things they're building without clearly distinguishing them. So fine: against linearity, against narration, against history, against religion (easy), against intentional love. But for a non-linear linear narrative, for establishing your own history (celebrated by countless film school professors, what else can they do?); for some transcendental "random" love. It's his own enemy. If Bunuel was alive today when he sold his painting, the first thing he would do is to attack the church or the surrealist. <br /> <br /> My regular readers know that in almost all things I'm filming, I stick to Spanish and avoid French. But in the surreal thing, I'd like to consider reverse: get your surrealism from Alfred Jarry, not Bunuel. Ted's rating - 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.
