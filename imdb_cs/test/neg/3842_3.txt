Sometimes when I watch this movie, I start thinking that the people who did this movie were on drugs. What's wrong with this movie, I'll tell you a bad chart, bad jokes. Br /> <br /> The film is about Pest Vargas, who has a $ 50,000 chance to survive for 24 hours by a German hunter who kills people for a living. Think of this hunter before he gets killed. I know what you think, "What the hell is that?" Another Wannabe Ace Ventura is trying to get the money really this plot is just boring and confusing at a time when the storyline changes and you get lost during the movie. As for the funny scenes this movie I had straight face oh yeah I made a smile a couple of times but nothing laugh-out loud.besides jokes are sinister and seen before it's like watching Ace Ventura meets Dumb and Dumber, but bad. <br /> <br /> When it comes to character development it's dry and flat. Don't learn a lot about the main character Pest all you know is an annoying cheater swindler, but that's that he doesn't change his image or be a bit smart just corny.as for the german hunter all he is is crazy and wants to go back to germany. Indeed, you will start to wonder why the island is on the island if he has money to travel to Germany. Himmel's hunting son is better, but not much. obsessed for reasons to end He stands on his father and on the sides with Pesto. As for acting not about nly there were some memorable perforamces, but just over the top.For example, John Legizomo is so on top with performance and dosen't fit into his role of being out of place, Like Jeffery Jones, who plays the hunter the same thing, but gives stereotypical performance as well. \ tAs for the rest, either just don't use enough or just over the top. The total bad comedy that you find for $ 2.00 on K-Mart.
