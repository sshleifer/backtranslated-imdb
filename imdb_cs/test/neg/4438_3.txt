The things that I find uncomfortable on the screen, the things I started to care about and annoy the people who watch movies with me are the moment when a writer, director, scenographer, on-screen chef or anyone else thinks to the end and, by a single omission - or commission - cancels all the other work of everyone else who has worked on the film. The moment "Wait a bloody minute ... What happened?" who stops the story dead in his footsteps. (Not that telling the film requires a lot of stopping because everyone who has ever seen it will know that the quintet story has a pretty good frozen fort before the end of the opening slide.) There are several of these moments in this movie. And you're so long to think about them. The film is two hours long and the screenplay appears to be on five pages. There is a lot of time to think about its shortcomings. The film is set in the frozen Earth. Another ice age has occurred and the whole world is dying. It is cold. Very cold. It's actually very cool on the screen. The film was filmed in Canada in the winter and there are icicles and real snow and the breath of people banging from their mouths in every scene. Again and again we remind us how it is. People wear big hats and layers and layers of clothing and walk around like a foolish people from Weeble. It must have been a terrible shot. My nitpick comes in the order that our hero controls the room at the hotel. He woke up in the middle of the night with a voice coming from the next room and heard a conversation that was vital to a modest piece of land, through a large grill in the wall separating the two rooms. I have no doubt why there is a grill in the wall between the two rooms. What annoyed me was the fact that the grill was not blocked by a long-term tenant with a noisy visitor. If you are trying to keep the last thing you need to keep warm, there is a huge gaping dug hole in the wall that leads to the unoccupied unoccupied room. Believe me. I live like this, I watched this movie sitting on the living room sofa under the duvet with a bottle of warm water. My breath was blurred as well as the actors. If there was a big hole in my wall, I'd block it with something. Maybe it's not the best choice for a movie to watch in an unheated room in the middle of the sun, but the boy did it to notice the lousy isolation in the movie.
