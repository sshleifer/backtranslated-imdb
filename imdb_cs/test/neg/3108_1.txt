Crazy director ... Yeah, you have to be crazy to do it near the movie. Rob Lowe was bad in nature, Ice-t was always bad and Burt Reynolds had nothing to do with the film. Crazy Six is ​​an unknown movie, with some famous actors ... that's weird. Bad movie with some good actors in it. It looks like a bad movie has affected their performance ... It was! Crazy people ..... I give it * and half of *****
