Obabakoak is a bunch of stories with a single common point: the small town of Vasque Obaba. In this film, the director tries to explain some of these stories using a young reporter as a continuum. The result is a strange movie because it has any major character (the film spends about 20 minutes on every story) than the city of Obaba. A story is really well explained and the fact is that it is very boring. It was by far the best film of the year in Spain, but, it doesn't say too much. The only good thing about film is a rare scenario. The film is shot in a very rare valley and is more enjoyable to watch the script than its story.
