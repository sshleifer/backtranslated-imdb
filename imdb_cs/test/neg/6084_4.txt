It is a pity that good actors like Baldwin and Booth have to succumb to miserable stories and scripts for money. But, hey, it's a cruel world ... <br /> <br /> That's just another long line of murderers thrillers that use all the usual narrative twists to try and make it look more appealing than it is. Sure, it has some nice locations, it's neat production, there is some good camera work and adjustments, and it's pretty well paced, overall. So, what's the real problem? Quite simply, the whole space is simply incredible. However, instead of spoiling your spoiled story, I will let you know what it is all about, that is, if you can get through it. I did, but only because I like Baldwin and I was hoping it would be better. <br /> <br /> No. And he had one of the most serious ends I've seen for a long time. In fact, maybe never ... <br /> <br /> But it's harmless fun, I mean, if you have nothing better to do.
