If you've ever heard the saying, "the book is always better than the movie," the Heart of Darkness is no exception to the rule. I believe it was much easier for me to understand the details of the film novel because I read the book aloud with my English class. We discussed each paragraph in great detail, so I understood this concept very quickly. While watching the movie, I couldn't understand the plot. This may be because there were no discussions in the classroom, but I suppose it is also because I couldn't paint my own paintings in the spirit of the novel. If you are the type of person who believes in this well known word, then leave the heart watching of Darkness movie from your to-do list.
