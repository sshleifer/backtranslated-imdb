What did Wes think he was doing this dribling? It's not good enough with any of his other work, but then again he seemed to fall into a slight slump after making a nightmare on Elm Street. This can be seen by his followers 1.Invatation to Hell 2.Chiller 3.Hills Have Eyes II 4.Deadly Friend 5.Serpant and Rainbow 6.Shocker all these movies were either average our crap it wasn't up to People under Stairs that got your momentum back and started kicking your ass again. The cooler itself has nothing of Craven's regular and none of his tensions. The only good scene where the old man attacked the gravel stairs for his job.
