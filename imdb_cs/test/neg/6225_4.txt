Relentless as one of those loud action movies. The whole cast seems to be at speed. I wasn't quite enough to director's intentions if any. I wonder if she ever saw Stanley Donen, Vincent Minnelli, or even George Sidney's musical. Structure, please! This is a fucking mess and I loved Abba. Unflattering Costumes - Unflattering towards Actors, but Loving towards Places One thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the look at Meryl Streep, who makes himself a fool. No chemistry with my friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) attack Streep with Lily Tomlyn in Altman's film and you understand what I was hoping for. I was embarrassed, especially Pierce Brosnam and Colin Firth. The audience seemed to enjoy it, so it's probably just me.
