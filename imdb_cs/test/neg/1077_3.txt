"The Italian Job" is a caper movie that performs numbers. Riding on the back of each caper cliché, it rises to no particular height and will be a film note about the end of the month. The biggest problem is that "The Italian Job" has no imagination at all. I've seen it all before and I've done it better. The game is fine, cinematography is perfectly acceptable, but this film does not completely disturb any new ground. <br /> <br /> Let's start a cliché: <br /> <br /> - an old school character and his protégé <br /> - another gang member jealous of a protégé <br /> <br / - double cross <br /> <br /> - only criminals use weapons, while good guy criminals don't have to <br /> <br /> - good criminals always outwit bad people <br /> <br /> And that's probably first fifteen minutes. Everything is so predictable. Even the robbery and scenes haunted by the car, allegedly the pinnacle of the film, seem quite common. This is especially true because they have appeared in movie trailers, so I already knew what to look for. <br /> <br /> For me, a caper film only works if it has an element of realism - maybe, just maybe it could be downloaded without relying on deux ex machina or "just because" moments . Parts of "The Italian Job" just fit that out of the window, with computers doing things that computers can't do, good guys don't hitting anyone with their driving (especially going down the stairs) and not one police car responding to street blasts, ruthlessly driven minis or even a low-flying helicopter. It has to be a hell of a city, so that these things don't evaluate the response. Acting is clear, with crew (Seth Green, Jason Stratham and Mos Def) is at least fun to watch. Mark Wahlberg is too sad to be a "nice guy" hero, while Charlize Theron is about a single actor called upon to show some extent. Donald Sutherland is a class that behaves as always and shows Wahlberg's shortcomings every moment they are together. Overall, this is a rather uninteresting film. Given the IMDb values, they are the girls who really love this movie, which I understand to some extent, but there are such better film bands - even the recklessness of the recent "Eleven" Ocean's Eleven overcomes the non-event that is "Italian work". <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> Take a moment to think about what happens to the Norton character. Would we like to cheer good guys for causing it to disappear, especially because it looks like long and painful? He didn't deserve that, so he tried to creep that he was. <br /> <br /> *** END SPOILER ***
