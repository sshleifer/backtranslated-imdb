I was shocked to read all these amazing comments on this movie because I hated it. I pushed it to the end, but it was painful - especially when I had to listen to the baby's voice. As Socact-1 remarked, even though the girl claimed to be from Chicago, she didn't have an Chicago accent - it sounded like she was trying to emulate NY accent - but she also failed. I was so confused that I was waiting for a punchline. Of all the amazing actors who could play the kid, why did they choose this one? And why make her talk like that? It wasn't just an accent, it was a script, a monologue created for her. The reason I chose this film was that the idea in history referred to me - this time in history, the type of character that is poor and uneducated, the setting - and the love triangle. As for me, it could be and should be much better. I was just soooo relieved when I read that at least one other person felt just like me.
