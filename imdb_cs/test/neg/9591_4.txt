A potentially good idea is completely omitted by a weak scenario that brings all the credibility out of the window and leaves the actor very little work. Roth covers her as best she can by being in her mouth; Hurt has as many threats as a fluffy bunny and Stamp can't decide whether he plays a former London cheater or some toff on the pitch in Eton. As for the poor Laura del Sol, she does what she can, but her character is no more than the idea of ​​every Northern Europe about the stereotypical Latino woman, who is a bondage and temperament. If you're a fan of one of the major actors, don't let yourself down or fool yourself (as I suspect many other reviewers have done it). Watch it by all means, but stay critical; You know these guys can do better.
