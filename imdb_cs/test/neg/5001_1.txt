I'm not sure what the appeal of this movie is, but I couldn't find it. It's really long, barely credible, barely lucid conversation between three guys on one scene. It doesn't move anywhere, the characters are just totally bizarre, the underlying graph is the same. It's lost to me, definitely on a movie walk. One thing that keeps you from walking out is still the unrealized possibility that it might have some point or meaningful climax, and the fact that, all the irritation aside by banal personalities, it is quite reasonable. But you have to stick to the endless dialogue that many times want Teach to close% * & *.
