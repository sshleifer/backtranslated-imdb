I hated it. I hate the self-confident, mysterious intimacy that stands for art. This movie is either stupidly scary or incredibly stupid. After the first half hour I went through the DVD version and again and again I saw the same youthful shennanigans. I began to be angry that I had spent hard earned money on sophomoric traps. Toning the dragon in sepia or blue does not mean that something will become a film, let alone art.
