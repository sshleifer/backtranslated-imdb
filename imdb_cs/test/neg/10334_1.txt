But certainly a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time. <br /> <br /> I got this DVD cheap, with Sandra Bullock as a headliner on the case. This is a fake ad - almost 10 minutes of the movie is on the screen. On the other hand, there was no other point of sale for this movie - the dialogue was terrible, the adjustment was probably done by someone who was pulled to Quaaludes, the director was ... A year-old daughter could do better, but I hope she never sees me so weak praise. It is possible that a family cat could behave better. Sandra has done a serious job for her first film, in a short time on screen, and that's the only quality of this movie. Stupid story, poorly written and transferred to the film because only class 7 should be able to do it. In short, this is a threesome.
