I haven't seen many movies worse than this one. Story, Dialogs, Playing: It's Horror! The story just jumps from a to b to c without the logical steps between them. Every time you think you missed something, but not: it was supposed to be. And why is Earth's character that Jenny Garth portrays so in love with that no-no loser guy (who actually plays in Cinderella Man with Russel Crow!)? Of course it's not Spielberg, of course ... I have to write ten lines to get a contribution. This movie is really not inspiring enough to write 10 lines! It's a romantic feeling, a good movie with a lousy story, so if you're on it: you'll have the ball.
