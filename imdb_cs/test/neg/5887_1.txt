At least some of the sitcoms that will endlessly break out of the US are sincerely wrong. However, this junk portrays the "heart warming" of the horse. Behaving sadly "taught" with views and sentences delivered in "I am an important and slim and beautiful" fashion. In the episode I just sat agog over, one's "work" was at risk simply because a colleague "placed" a phone call, slag her ability off ... !! Indeed, this is the lowest of the lowest. What kind of damage affects observer masses when they see only glittering people who go after "work". Absolutely ill. When the titles were rolling, I thought it was for the boy. You know who you are.
