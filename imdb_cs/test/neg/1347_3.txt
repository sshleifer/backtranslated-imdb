This movie could be a decent re-make, and a gosh knows that he has tried (or Mrs. English tried). Composing talented actors with a successful and experienced writer / director should be a model for a decent film. But the Englishwoman's experience - according to her biography of IMDb - is exclusively limited to television work and is obviously obvious in this film. Most of all, it was impossible to reach this film, and what kept it from reaching its potential: it looked and felt like it was made for television. To give some appreciation to Mrs. English, many jokes that just didn't work on the movie screen would be awesome on TV (and maybe it would help laughter). So much of the use of the camera and lighting would be fine on TV, but it looked awkward or strange on the big screen. If the whole movie was cut into a mini-series or sit-com, I think it might work. But this is a cinema and unfortunately it has not been overcome. I shot in so many different points in my embarrassment for actors and writers that I felt like I came out of the theater half-shrunk! Meg Ryan is her usual live, cute self (with the exception of the frightening plastic surgery she had on her face), but where did she have the chance to use her talent? She has made films where she does not imagine her stereotypical role and did not do well ... but not here. Annette Bening seemed to just go through the movements - such a great talent and yet such a bad performance! I liked the other figures of women, but they were more cartoons than substances, and it was sad to see. What worked in this film in the 1930s is not reflected in 2000, and no one has helped the Britons get changes and updates or small things. If only she (as a writer, director, and producer) addressed some help, I think it might be good. But it wasn't so. It's so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and leaves it as a waste of time and money for everyone! This New York cartoon, which I saw yesterday, is appropriate: Several movie managers have an appointment & the headline is: "Let's remake the classic with worse!"
