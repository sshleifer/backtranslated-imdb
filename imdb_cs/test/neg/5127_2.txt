Flashdance is one of those horrible, stupid movies that you actually kind-of like, just because they're so crap. I just watched it on TV and my friend and I was amazed at how it was. It is true that Don Simpson and other producers came up with the idea of ​​a relatively cheap, lowbrow flick with lots of sweaty bodies to help sell a soundtrack (admiringly catchy) pop, so Flashdance is a special kind of pioneer: the first MTV movie. Adrian Lyne started advertising and shows Flashdance is almost commercial. You've already decided to watch it, but the movie has this weird, panic undercurrent, as if it was frightening that you could change your mind at any time. It constantly sells you over and over, all the way through, using neat commercial-style editing and shiny close-ups of jigging breasts. The story is thin thin (I honestly can't think of any other movie I saw with less plot), and it never makes much sense, but its a very resourceful, costing movie so it looks consistent. People say he's old, but Flashdance has always been waste. The audience in the early 1980s knew that it was just a shabby T&A, but it works in its own stupid way. There's a lot of romance for a crowd of chickens and piles of greasy female bodies for their data set for a pump disco. How could it fail? It helps that dialogue is unnecessary, so you can catch popcorn without missing anything, and if this kind isn't your cup of tea, you can always laugh at the "interpretive dance" on display. A scene in which stand-in for Jennifer Beals cramps / 'dances' on stage in front of a TV with a fan in it and a face full of white clown make-up had us in a stitch. True guilt.
