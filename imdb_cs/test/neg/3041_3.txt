That's too much of a cliché to turn it off after the first 45 minutes. The start is very interesting, with the fair and someone kills. This movie would be better on this setting. So, Jill Johnson is a depressed sprinter with friend problems. I don't see it advisable to add her break with her boyfriend at some of the events in the story. As Jill came home late, her father sent her to babysit for Mandrakis in their charming home in an abandoned lake. Children sleeping and maid cleaning up, another empty house to the side for her son who is in college. Good. After about half an hour, walking around the house herself, she gets a couple of hangings. Ooh, scary. Which girlfriend comes to rescue, come up with a couple of high school lines about "love" and anything. A friend leaves and goes to the car. Which then drops the keys. Uhhh ... then music! DumDumDum ..! He gets angry when he picks them up and gets into the car. Which, of course, won't start. How cliché ...? So ... disappears = D Jill, alone again. UH. (Most of this movie is herself with her, so there is not much dialogue.) So more suspension calls the police. Who say they can't help but call back if they have any other problems. So then she suspects that her boyfriend is calling, or her friends friends are calling. They were only once. How is it going to be very scary? And did I mention it? Her friend is just coming up with a caller ID and there comes a terrible male voice. She gets all crazy and shyt. <br /> <br /> Yeah, so skip that. He sees the light in Mandrakis's son's house go on. So she runs through the forest with music as her companion and goes inside. Bleheh. <br /> <br /> HOW IS CANT CANT CONTINUOUS !!!!!!!!!
