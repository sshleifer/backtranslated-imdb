I'm sorry, but this movie is just shallow for me. In it, Perez is a taxi driver with a friend Keitel trying to make it as an actress. First, what the hell is a taxi driver? Even after I was sitting in this, I still don't know. Yeah, Perez also inspires DeLorenzo to follow her as a loving puppy. There is no reason for love, it just happens. There are times when characters and events really try to pull on your heart, but it rarely works. The only character you really feel is Keitel's character, just because he's doing such a good job with her. Any other actor and character would be the same as the others. The script is basically uninspired rehashing about how difficult it is to make it as an actor / actress. It was done and it was said that language and dialogue sounded like it was written by a street pimp. The end is ... well, I don't want to mess it up. Let's say it's not satisfactory. I'd be more upset if the story was good. Direction is mediocre, nothing really amazing, but not what is really painful to watch. To repeat acting, the only thing worth watching is Keitel. Although I could live on without seeing him in underwear for tiger print. Yeah, Eddie Bunker appears. Just as random as the mention is that it's random in the movie. And Tarantino has a friend of his friend a favor by appearing for about 20 seconds.
