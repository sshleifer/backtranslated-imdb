Since it comes from HBO and based on IMDb, I followed the first season of this series, what kind of waste. Characters are sometimes interesting but mostly drawn. Acting ranges from good to average talent with an emphasis on STRON G. Not only prisoners, but also viewers should leave all the hopes of the door that this story is believable, it's such a load of dung that you need unusually strong testicular courage to watch . Violence, like most of the story's development, is titillating, and any morality is reportedly being, it's a lite variety. If your idea of ​​excellent television includes writing, acting and the overall quality of production you see in SOPRANOS, DEADWOOD or SIX FEET UNDER, avoid the OZ. If you want to see Disneyland for the Illiterate Jerks, watch OZ. Things like this give a bad name.
