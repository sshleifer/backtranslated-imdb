Since this show was changed from TSS (Screen Saver) to AOTS (Attack Show), it went down. TSS with Yoshi and Kevin Rose Alex ... etc. They made the show amazing, then threw out of TSS for an unknown reason. When the show switched to AOTS, it became less about computers and more about games and magazines. It also promoted bands that no one had heard of or cared for. Finally, I couldn't watch it as soon as Kevin Rose left. He kept it interesting, but he went to do his own thing that is good. Kevin Rose now has several online podcasts and shows on REV 3. Check it out. REV3.com I think you can go to www.systm.org. If you want a real tech show, rather than Aots, then watch Kevin Roses shows or listen to a podcast subconscious. <br /> <br /> J <
