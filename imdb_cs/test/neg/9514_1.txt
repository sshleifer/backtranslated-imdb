It's so depressing when filmmakers try to be cool and so obvious. It has below average gameplay, a laughing dialogue, a split screen that is hard to follow, and many attempts to be a period movie and an autobiographical one. This film should be avoided at all costs. I was told not to see the movie. I wish I was listening.
