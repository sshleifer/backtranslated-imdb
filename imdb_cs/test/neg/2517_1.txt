Luchino Visconti, artist with sword. Courage should be the first word associated with all his opus. Film. Theater. Music. Revolution, artistic, cultural, personal. A reference with powerful consequences and endless consequences. He introduced neorealism through the work of American novelist James Cain in "Ossesione" He gave Anna Magnani the most exceptionally beautiful close-ups of her career. He gave us Alain Delon and Maria Callas. But the last word about his life and work is based on the talent of a certain Adam Lowe and the voice of Helmut Berger. What a terrible fate. For those interested, director Carlo Lizzani (a man who knew about Visconti) is a 61-minute documentary called LUCHINO VISCONTI AND PORTRAIT. It is on DVD distributed by Image Entertainment
