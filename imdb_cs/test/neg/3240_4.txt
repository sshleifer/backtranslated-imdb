So many bad reviewers, I wonder what people think when watching a simple movie that a pretty bad director did? Have you all expected a super-hit flawless movie? By no means will you see, Raj Kumar Kohli loves multi-star movies ... All his earlier work, where they are multi-starrers, but no one was flawless. Take, for example, Jaani Dushman, so many bugs, but still good fun. Anyway, the film Jaani Dushman is a Hindu fantasy film about a snake that can take any form (Armaan (Munish) Kohli), who will avenge the suicide of his lover (Manisha Koirala) on the people who caused it. It's pretty good with a big star. But I think it could have been much better. For example, take a script, you can't say it's flawless. For example, take age: <br /> <br /> Still studying at university for 40-48 years ??? There are many more, I won't list more, but there are another ten. The fixed 5.5 is good for this one. <br /> <br /> **
