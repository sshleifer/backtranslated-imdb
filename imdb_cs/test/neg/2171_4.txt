Elderbush Gilch was a great disappointment for me. I heard how great it was, how important it was. It just didn't hurt me. She had a grim story, plus some of the moronic and sadistic Native American characters who are offensive to the present standards. While most D.W. Griffith's films have depth and intelligence, this feeling feels more like a picture of a program that prepares for formula. I loved to see Lillian Gish and Mae Marsh in the roles before the birth of the nation, plus some of the battle scene productions were pretty good. According to future cameraman Griffith Karl Brown, viewers stood on their seats and cheered as the horse riding ended. I didn't feel anything. And deceive me, watching Griffith's early work at Biograph. This movie is just not what it used to be. The best thing about this movie is that it has many Griffith touches for all of its shortcomings. He manages his main actors very well, plus a scene where Indians encircle a cabin that resembles the culmination of a Nation's Birth, a far better film to send shock waves across America a little more than a year later.
