I enjoy movies of various kinds and qualities. Whether it's your typical standard Hollywood action movie or your Oscar-winning trainer in the Oscar season, movies that meet a certain standard will almost always be nice to me. I got nothing but confusion in the soap girl. First, we meet Maya, a massage room that attracts all customers in the salon. The virgin poet Harry comes in one day and falls in love. After that, there are different twists and turns thrown into a conspiracy that seem to lead nowhere. Although many commented on the controversial problem of an Asian prostitute exploited by a white man, keep in mind that this film was created by an Asian director who wanted to bring light into the issue. Whether he does it or not, it does not matter whether it is whether the film is pleasant or not. Girl Soap doesn't meet the standard I expect from movies. It was hard for me to get involved in this film emotionally, given the free plot and the average acting. Worse, the director seems to want to do drama when the tone goes more towards comedy. The film as a soap girl who does not let me go into the cinema magic will always leave me bored. During the movie, I couldn't help but think, "What is it all about?" The film must answer this question before it is made. If not, what you end up is empty that interests you. <br /> <br /> Level: D + <br /> <br />
