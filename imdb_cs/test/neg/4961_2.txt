With my two stars will I probably make it on my head IMDb ??? I hated it "-list for this apparently immensely popular TV series. <br /> <br /> Last but not least because of the enthusiastic comments on this website, I decided to buy a DVD edition of the series because I usually like British humor , I have given up in the middle of the second installment? which are black books? though weakly thematically related. Why different responses? It could be a mere generation, yet it is possible to point out the differences. <br /> <br /> Both Fawlty Towers and Black Books are based in businesses that Both companies are not successful, but they seem to be a "miracle" to survive Fawlty Towers is funny because the protagonists have to deal with situations they can't cope with. The fun is that they strive to succeed and laugh at the same time Black Books has no situations, it's just there and the owner passes on his time and is sorry. If there is a risk of a situation happening, he will quickly turn away. It is remarkable how quickly and how often the subject is dropped and the protagonists turn to something completely different than to create another joke. Telling Jokes? and not very good - all black books seem to be. Why bookstores? The hardware business would do just as well. <br /> <br /> No, stop, wait. It is a bookstore because under the veneer of roughness, vulgarity and arrogance, the protagonists should be delicate and cultivated. They are not gorillas, but humiliating losers of intellectuals. Hey, they're like you and me. The way the series does this is the only way I can explain its success. There is nothing remarkable in the actions of the protagonists about what their economically unrealistic living conditions are. That protagonists that narcissistic and vapid convey a sense of belonging and society seems to be a trademark of the time when the first world is currently living in. I recently watched Tittybangbang, also a pretty new British television comedy show. I found it very funny. It is often quite tasteless or xenophobic ??? but always with the intention and hitting of the bull's eye in his social criticism. Humor consists mainly of situations or characters with a specific purpose. Low ratings in the IMDb could indicate that this brand of humor is not in line with the times, but I am glad it is still alive and kicking and I hope it will continue to do so.
