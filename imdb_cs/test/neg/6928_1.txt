I totally despise this film. I wanted to love it - I really wanted to. But man, man - they were with Sara. And the father who lived was quite cheesy. This is right from Shirley Temple movie. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the book. That's amazing. In the book, Sara is honest and decent and does the right thing ... HOW ARE RIGHT. He has no malignant bone in his body. <br /> <br /> The film is lively and vicious. She has little things to return to Miss Minchin. In the book, Sara is over such things. She stands up to Miss Minchin. She tells the truth and she's not gonna catch her. But she won't do the stupid, insidious things Sara does in the movie. It's really very worrying to me that she said so much that he loved this book and love film. I can't help but wonder about the same book? The whole book was a personal responsibility, to behave honestly and honestly, ALWAYS telling the truth and facing the adversity of fate with calmness and integrity. Sara has a happy ending in her book - not her father's ridiculous survival, but her partner's search for her. She is accepted in this book by this new father who loves her and cares for her and Becky. And Miss Minchin is not a chimney sweep - that part of the movie was really stupid. <br /> <br /> To see all these praise for this pathetic movie, I'm concerned. Do we praise a movie that celebrates petty, malevolent behavior with a few hat favors tips? Sara in the book was kind to bone and full of integrity. I don't even recognize her in the movie ... she's not in it. Good thing Mrs. Burnett is not alive to see this terrible thing. It's horrible and inappropriate to bear the title of her book.
