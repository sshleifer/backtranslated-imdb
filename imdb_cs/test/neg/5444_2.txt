Badly acted and badly directed, "Congo" unsuccessfully tries to restore the feeling of "Jurassic Park". But the truth is, even the book wasn't that big. The first problem with the film is that Tim Curry's character has been added; the second problem is that a talking arm has been added; The main problem, however, is that cast members do not create realistic characters. I guarantee that this film will not convince you that it is anywhere in the world on Earth. Also starring Laura Linney (Happy Birthday, Laura!), Dylan Walsh, Ernie Hudson, Grant Heslov, Joe Don Baker, James Karen and Bruce Campbell; I guess they don't want to emphasize this film in their biographies.
