This is one of the four 1970s television films writer Lane Slate about sensationalistic murders in small towns. They are characterized by likable TV personalities such as police chiefs and unpredictable characters such as city regulators, including the love of touch interests. Others are: They only kill their masters (James Garner, 1972); and a girl in an empty grave and a deadly game (both Andy Griffith, 1977). Alda is located near Vermont ("Mount Angel" next to "Horse Creek"); others in California, Garner is by the sea ("Eden Landing") and Griffith is in the mountains ("Jasper Lake"). Everyone is trying to capture the feeling of a small town, move at a relaxed pace between comfortable characters, and tell a secret with at least some complicated step or turn to it. At this level, they are somewhat amusing (that they were often re-run itself suggests they have some challenge). But they suffer from overall thin stories and dialogue, slack pacing, bland settings, flat or exaggerated characters, and off-putting, forced attempts (often juvenile or raw) in color or humor. Alda and Garner are the most serious about story, characters, stimulation and tone. They have the best support casts, although Alda has better use; Griffith casts pale in comparison. Alda has the best director. "Shocking" has some surprise and drama. The killer's method is inventive. The tone is more balanced and dialogue more natural than in Griffith's. Alda's film does not suffer like other smug big city transplants to the city or hokey, exaggerated local characters, both of whom act as Hollywood script writers, not so real (the worst offender is pipsqueak of Griffith's films), moron "Whit" muttered, which, as we were told he was trying to hang up the jeep and get off with a trailer that served as a temporary bank branch, dragged off a police ship dock, stealing tomatoes from a farmer's truck, and just filling in $ 11 to withdraw "Spiro T. Babylis" to be discovered only by the treasurer. Graciously absent is the clumsy, cumbersome repetitive style of dialogue from the Griffith movies ("Are you going to lunch?" "I'm going to take a boat." "Will you go to the boat for lunch?" I won't be for lunch. " Why are you fishing here? "" It's illegal on Horse Mountain. It's also published, you violate the law. "" Some law. There are no fish in this lake. "" Then why are you fishing here? " that she is illegal at Horse Mountain. "; My name is Lloyd." "Okay, Lloyd ..." "Call me Lloyd. That's my name. My name is Lloyd." low - key and unimpressed to be taken seriously as well as a small - time police chief, certainly not a red - hot lawyer in the demand of a rival city. Rather n Barnes strikes blindly in emotional denial, or his secretary, Lasser, gives him a key track ("Why I didn't think so," he says!). An embarrassed burial scene, plus a conspiracy plot, leads to another gift guide. Worse, Barnes is more interested in the posthumous military police helmets he has been sent to help him (The Deadly Game also suggests Slate has something against the army to keep them efficiently. Barnes allows his car to be repeatedly hit by a murderer fleeing from one crime scene without pulling down a weapon or trying to take control, again ineffective and almost killed in multiple climates on his side, which are only partially repaired, by accident, the unobtrusive northeast accent that Alda affects does not help believability. <br /> <br /> There are fence holes. Why would a murderer shoot after all these years? without a trace, it seems unlikely, but compared to the newer ones - not a couple together, a shopkeeper during working hours, fully dressed The deputy sitting in his office and incredibly his dog! <br /> <br /> Aldo's film also suffers from some of the attack elements that Slate injects into all films. Barnes first appears in the bed of a motel clerk. He then treats her roughly at every step and insult and tries to avoid her children. That, and talking about a female doctor, slapped a rough, mid-spirited pattern (Garner's film was described as "sleazy," including a scene where he and the deputy laugh as the girl in the back seat of the car hit the wound on the road and part of her anatomy was clogged by a guy in the car with her. Griffith's feature of the ersatz Ropers routine, in which a woman embarrassedly tries to get a man to a "supply cabinet"; a room-type exchange with a deputy in discussing a young woman's car accident death ("you took her out? "" I took her once. "), a reference to banker" Bernice "as" swollen-up in places "and on" pin stick "into her and on" hating "and firing secretary" Maude "because she was "too hairy", a description of the practice of a female doctor as "two stirrup tables and a torch", a humiliating scene in which the speeches of Fran Ryan Griffith, the offer of "some home grown" and the offensive subplot in which a woman whom watching deputy deputy as drippy buffoon, seems to "sleep around"). Finally, Alda's film has a grim, faded, colorless, lifeless look and feel. Just Louise Lasser adds a spark. At least the other films had some ghost, scenery and nice music; Griffith climbed the mountain, the lake, and even the big city. You feel more like watching Masters or Empty Grave than Shocking.
