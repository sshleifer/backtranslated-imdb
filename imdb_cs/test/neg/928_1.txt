Terrible, terrible, horrible movie. I saw the original when I was a kid and gave me nightmares in my teens. When I found out he was on the way remake, I groaned. WHY HEAT WHY PLAY A GOOD FILM? Well, thanks to Dark Castle, we can listen to another classic horror movie. This time they replaced a somewhat interesting story with gore, slower than slow pace, and yawning inspired characters. Someone had previously said he was surprised that Paris Hilton could act. Did you watch the movie? Playing prissy little hiker. Sounds like the ones I like. Half the people in the audience actually came when she died! This will tell you why people see this movie. If this is your only reason, then find a better one because as a black hole this thing will suck more of your life than you want. If I were alone, I'd leave 10 minutes into a boring exposition. This thing is like the Moron's Guide to the Movie That Makes the Movie: In Southern Git, stupid but appealing leaders, knives a lot, gore a lot, a terrible truck, I could go on. After watching this movie, I really started to appreciate Jeepers Creepers and I thought it sucked in the movie. Save and avoid this crapfest at all costs.
