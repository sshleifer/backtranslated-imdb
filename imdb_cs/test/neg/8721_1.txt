Miniseries Dune opens a "flashforward" assembly of action sequences. The realization is fast shining that they are * the best * scenes from the 265 minute runtime and are not good. He's not good at all. Oh dear. But don't judge the book by its cover (though it's exactly what we're asked to do). Let's give Dune a chance to buy herself. Well, here's the watery opening on Caladan. But who is that ugly, strangely ugly man? Paul Atreides? * This is Paul Atreides? This general plastic puppet? And why does he look so old? What is it? Just an actor has 25? Well, it's not looking, and it's too old anyway. But at least he's got a charisma, right? Poorly. Alec Newman is a stumbling, muttering buffon. I imagine he was discovered when he was sitting in a corrective class in the dark because nobody liked him to tell him that the class was over and it was too stupid to realize it. When your Paul Atreides has a full screen predestination for soggy toast, and playing games from "petulant" to "blank", your Dune production is doomed from scratch. Other actors are hurting the poor Alek, however, gives unified devious and incomprehensible performances, so he doesn't look too bad in comparison. At least I suppose that's what they do. Because I'm charitable, you see. To be fair, they obviously have no direction. Accidental gestures, empty or inconsistent deliveries, missing stamps, it's all here. This is like a master class in how to do it. And certainly, there are more elements of the book in this miniseries than it was in the 1984 movie, but they are not twice as much for all. It pauses. Fill. Time. But we can all forgive all this for a small budget of $ 20 million, or just $ 5 million per hour. No one would be expected to have a quality science fiction on this kind of budget. Except perhaps "Stargate SG-1", which makes $ 1.4 million for a 50 minute episode, or "Farscape" for $ 2 million. And frankly, I'd rather watch four episodes of one of those who are punching in children than having to sit, even though it's a Terror Miniseries again.
