I don't really know why I agreed to watch this movie, but as a complete fool I did and I deserve to be shot for that! I saw the original Killjoy, but I said I saw him .... I started to watch him, but I found it so bad that I watched him at 4 speeds to get to him and get rid of the unpleasant dialogue, but I said I'd watch it and I did it even if it was at 4x speed. <br /> <br /> To shorten the long story short Killjoy 2 will kick off where Killjoy has finished. I do not mean conspiracy, I mean a complete and total bag of impurities known as action and cheapness. I have nothing against low budget films, I actually enjoyed them a little bit, they are different from Mega budgets, but this movie is just terrible! Negotiations are devilish and scenario ... but I think you could get a pen and paper out of Stevie Wonder and he would do something much better! This movie is just annoying, not to mention the unpleasant laugh that the clown has so clearly dubbed! I didn't do it anyway, about three quarters of the way through it was time to turn it off and throw it through the window. It can be rip off to buy as a DVD, but as a frisbee it was a mega store! Please for the love of mankind DO NOT DISPLAY it, it is perhaps the worst thing I've ever seen and considered some of the tortures. <br /> <br /> My rating for this movie would be .... Nailgun to head / 10
