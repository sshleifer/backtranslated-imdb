Oldboy is set in Korea and begins as a drunk Dae-su Oh (Min-Sik Choi) is fired from a police station by his friend just to be kidnapped, Dae-su wakes up and finds himself in a small room he wants. another fifteen years. Dae-su is fed and cared for by unknown prisoners, but is never allowed out of the room, Dae-su is starting to train to get revenge after getting out of the way he wants to do by removing cement from the wand masonry. But before Dae-su is finished, he is gassed and unconscious when Dae-su wakes up, finds himself on the roof of a tall building dressed and earned. Dae-su immediately tries to find out who imprisoned him after he met the beautiful Mide (Hye-jeong Kang), who has fallen in love with Dae-su and finally finds what he is looking for, but the truth comes to the price This South Korean production was co-authored and directed by Chan-Wook Park and won any number of glowing reviews (which distributors can choose quotes and plaster them on a video box) and even won the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes, while he was also nominated for the Golden Palm so certainly Oldboy is a true classic? Well, it's not for me because I can't understand why they liked it so much and I would go so far as to hate it a lot, unlike one or two isolated moments. To begin with, I couldn't get into the story at all, I just didn't like it when I thought it was slow and boring, and while many of them thought Oldboy was the most beautiful I ever thought was shocking. rather plain and not very well done. The end, in which Dae-su goes to the New Zealand Alps to hypnotize, feels as if the makers wanted a happy ending. I almost fell asleep for almost two hours, I was so bored, violence is tame, and it is an idea of ​​what is happening that I would imagine that most people have a problem rather than what is actually shown. In fact, Oldboy has a very low number of bodies of about seven & one mild sex scene, it's really not that graphic or memorable. I didn't warm myself to any of the characters, and when I accept Oldboy, the concept and the assumption of failing to deliver is a fine film, and I never understand why so many people like it. <br /> <br /> Based on the Japanese Manga of the same name, Oldboy, the film looks fine, there are one or two nice visual moments, though while everyone is bullying on the corridor, which is held in one continuous shot, I was pretty unimpressed and thought the choreography was pretty boring. The actual violence on the screen is very small, Dae-su eats a live octopus that is in Korea as usual, there are some fighting scenes, a separate hand, some teeth are pulled out and there is a little blood on the end. The budget was allegedly around $ 4,000,000, which is actually a little enough, shot in South Korea and New Zealand. Acting looks fine, but it's hard to say when actors speak a different language. Oldboy is a movie that I found absolute chore to sit on, don't mind movies with subtitles or foreign movies or pay attention to the land as I followed the thing perfectly, but I just didn't like any of it & it's as simple & straightforward as that. Apparently the second in Choi-woo's trilogy, which also includes Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) and Lady Vengeance (2005).
