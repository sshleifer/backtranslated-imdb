At first I was interested in this film after I read the synopsis and saw some striking screenshots, and there was a promise for the dazzling horror movie Dario Argento. Certainly I must say that the Argento films were sometimes somewhat incoherent, and some felt like a handful of visually influencing pieces loosely threaded along with a vague joining plot. <br /> <br /> Because Argento is credited with this as a writer, I must say I'm not really surprised. Even his masterpiece, Suspiria, when explored, shows the same tendency to intertwine sometimes with unrelated scenes purely for aesthetic impact. However, Suspiria also benefited from a unique main character and clear opponents, as well as scenes that eventually contributed to a possible solution. On the other hand, the Church has none of it. He has no main character, no protagonist; moreover, it has no real plot, no crescendo, no peak, no denouement and no resolution. It's a totally hollow, disparate job that looks like Argento sat down and thought "hey, that would visually make an interesting scene ... let's do it!" The film is a series of these scenes. At first it might be interesting and I have to say that the direction of Soavi is excellent. Soavi cannot be violated for the material because it is as convincing as possible. However, such a good direction points out the terrible failure of the scenario and there is no sense at all. The attempt at a central unifying plot is nothing but plagiarism of the carpentry film Prince of Darkness. Events happen only because the script wants them and the reactions to these events are completely unlikely. The narrative flow is irreparably damaged at some point simply because there is no ability to suspend distrust; it's too ridiculous. To do this, there are numerous factual mistakes that are so blatant that they become embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If it was more obviously artistic and adapted to another job, it could be frosty or tense. If it had been added to a true coherent story, it could have been a grip. But none of this was. The best she could do was confusing and sometimes angry. Lands are introduced but have never been followed. Characters are forgotten and changed arbitrarily. No logic will ever apply to any situation. It could have been frightening or interesting, but more effort is needed from the screenwriter to make this kind of feeling ... much more. but quite enthusiastic about Italian horror, which is more style than substance. This is the Argento style in its worst case, and this is a strong reason for the usual criticism.
