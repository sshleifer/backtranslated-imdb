Come on? FANTASTIC DRAMA ON SCREEN? Are you joking with people? Horrible Molly Gross I wouldn't even play at school! Where did these people learn acting? Borrow some papers from your neighbor actor? Terrible plot, terrible act. Heh ... why do you take us as an imbecile? What can I say more. I understand that this is a TV production and acting should not be what a citizen Kane has. But they should try harder to make money. And besides what can I say IN 10 LINES for a simple movie like this? Want an article in the morning paper? You mean what? Worse movie in decade? OK, you want it - you got it!
