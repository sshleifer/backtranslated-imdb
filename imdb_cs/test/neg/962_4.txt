Rudolf Mat√©'s 1950 film was revolutionized by the 1980s, Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid) is a university lecturer who has had a successful writing career, but it is now with the tubes along with the marriage. In the opening exhibition, the viewer thinks that everyone has something against him, so when the revelation comes, he is poisoned, so we are not so surprised if you are not familiar with the original. Dexter, after being told he has less than 48 hours of life, decides to track down his steps with the help of one of his students, Sydney Fuller (Meg Ryan), but finds they have many obstacles in the way. The film starts promisingly in black and white, like Dexter stagging in the rain at a local police station where he wishes to report the murder ... his own but the rhythm of the Huey lewis 80 style that accompanies this scene just serves To eliminate any sense of tension and tell the viewer that it will be bad enough, it's just a question of how bad? Sure enough we are soon using an old flashback medium, but now the film resorts to a full Technicolor. There are some short homages to Noir, how to embrace the couple standing in front of the blinds, but there is really nothing here to recommend it, the performances are terrible, Ryan in particular making her usual giddy blonde with cutesy pie smile routine. The film is a lazy attempt to put some unnecessary ooomph into an already fine film premise, apparently trying to cash in one Body Heat audience, the apparent results are undoubtedly aimed at the teen audience and be sure they are welcome to do so. 4/10
