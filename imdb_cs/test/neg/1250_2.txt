How does this film suck? As a fan of Michael Imperioli's work on The Sopranos, I took a blockbuster based on his name and story, which sounded like a promise. He still does it, but this movie doesn't do it. Every turn of a story is completely predictable; In the lower right corner of the screen I was looking for a Lifetime error. It's all: a noble woman who comes from difficult times, one who can't fulfill her potential despite her best efforts, a guy who gets stuck in the middle, etc. Etc. The stranger's mysterious identity is what I really wanted to throw on TV - I'd be satisfied with the little awakening of Stuey and I realized it was just a dream. The filmmakers can also have a "moral story is ..." a bit ahead of credits because, as another reviewer, he pointed out that it really makes a role like after school special. "Don't play, don't drink, don't drugs , stay with your wife, spend time with your children ... come on, what a little nuance? What about interesting villains? Writer / director AW Vidmer should be selected for special notice: not only dialogue is conducted, stimulation (in dialogue and at both ends of many scenes) this movie is at least 45 minutes longer than it is needed (and believe me it looks longer). Imperioli, Renee Faia and some of the support casts (Steve Schirrip, natch) are the only things that keep it from the "1" rating, but all of their good work is almost matched by the cruel task of stuey boy, not sure if it was a casting mistake (hey - it's a mob movie, so let's get someone from Bl ue's Clues, who can't do anything but exaggerate with a big, fake smile ... next, be angry with a grumpy guy in a Disney movie or just horrible overhead, but those scenes are really painful to watch. I wonder if other filmmakers took the film and its story; it's a shame Imperioli has already been exhausted by this movie. Terrible, terrible, terrible.
