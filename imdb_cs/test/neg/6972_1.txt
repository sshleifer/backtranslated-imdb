I'll tell you about Edward D. Wood Jr. He had a passion for his work that I wanted more people to keep. If we all had the optimism and command of Ed Wood's hope, the world would be much better. Being familiar with Ed Wood's story and seeing some of the most beautiful biotics "Ed Wood" (1994) several times, I admire his courage and his efforts for the work he loved; I still admire his attitude, which he never said. He had a love for directing that I wanted more people in modern Hollywood. But he doesn't care about his films. And "Glen or Glenda", his first and most professional film, is probably his worst. "Glen or Glenda" is a moderate cult film about cross-dresser named Glen (played by director / writer Ed Wood) who, despite his love for his fiancé Barbara (Dolores Fuller), doesn't seem to be he conquered his desire for transvestitism, in which he dresses in women's clothing and wig and becomes ... Glenda! The story of Glen / Glendy is narrated by a physician and he also spoke to them and followed them by a mysterious character called "Scientist", played by veteran horror star Bela Lugosi. And there is also a partial story about the character Alan / Anne, who becomes a transsexual based on the story of Christine Jorgenson, who was originally called "I Changed My Sex!" was previously established. <br /> <br /> Have I dropped your jaw? Well, just like I want to warn you about this picture, if you've never seen it before, I'd never say a lie about a movie and there's no word of falsehood I've given you. Every thing in it is true. It is a film about cross-dressers and transsexuals, a theme that does not sound very attractive and is not done in a very attractive way. I'm sure with a good screenplay and a good director (not even him) that "Glen or Glenda," despite the theme, could be a very moving picture. It's a confessional film about Wood's work because he was a transvestite in real life and on screen. But once again it's not a good movie ... or attentive. "Glen or Glenda" is a messy, confused film disorder that delves into new trenches in the area of ​​bad film. It doesn't make more sense than his notoriously stupid scene where Bela Lugosi shouts "Pull the string!" over inexplicable shots of a shaken bison. Most of the film is narrated in a monotonous voice, reminiscent of some very short short informative films I have seen before. It's like one of the really bad short films that have been extended to a 70-minute feature and twice as boring. We sit there for ages and wait for a conspiracy that never comes. There is no real attempt to build up the power with the camera locked in one position for many exhausting minutes and long stretches of time where nothing happens at all. The only moments that are worth time are the times of Bela Lugosi, who will bring light into these dark trenches. I think Lugosi is supposed to be the deity of the film, but I personally couldn't care less about who should be. I'll tell you what it was: A talented actor who trashed the garbage. But he and Wood were very good friends and they liked to work with them, so good for him. I'll always admire Edward D. Wood Jr. for his cinema passion, but I will never live how long I admire his films. The film critic once called Ed Wood's films "innocent entertainment," but I think that is controversial. Innocent? Yes. Entertainment? No, sir. And if "Citizen Kane" is Mount Everest from the movie world, then "Glen or Glenda" is probably Mariana Trench.
