For sci-fans it will be better than anything that could be launched on television at a given time; that's probably the best thing you can say about it. Good points; repartee and a sense of humor is less boring than usual in such movies, the plot is coherent and does not use any magical mystical revelation. Bad points; writers attempt to do good science but it falls down in direction and production (eg, rock drilling a mole using superheated rock drilling equipment breaks the surface underwater with a nary bubble or boiling boiler to be seen), the characters are clich√© and the unwinding plot is a nice stock standard . All right for an evening that is too tired to do anything. but don't expect any significant talk or even talking.
