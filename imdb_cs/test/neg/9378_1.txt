August 25, 2003 League of Extraordinary Masters: <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is one of the great giants of all time and I have been a fan of him since the 1950s. I went to this movie because Sean Connery was the main actor. I did not read reviews nor did I have any previous knowledge of film. The movie quite surprised me. The scenery and monuments were spectacular, but the plot was unreal to the point where it was ridiculous. It wasn't one of his better films in my mind that it could be the worst. Why he decided to be in this movie is a mystery. Going to this movie was a waste of time for me. I will continue to go to his films and add his films to my video collection. But I can't see a waste of money putting this film in my collection
