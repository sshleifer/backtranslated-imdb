This is absolutely nothing like WWF and 'Attitude Era' WWF. I've always been a devoted WWF fan and I've never seen his competition. Now I am the day I wanted WWF to take the lead. At least WCW would try to do something new and radical all the time instead of keeping the mask of the real intentions of the show, and that is true for the ECW. WWF has always been about Hull Hogan, Andra Giant and other old wrestlers like that, and "Attitude Era" just managed to catch up with the radical ideas of the competition. WWE is the same waste that was just stupid and demoralized before Attra Era. Wrestlers are terrible, brand splitting is mind mixing, and storylines and provisions do not exist. WWE is so bad that it ceases to be itself an earlier shell of itself by suddenly pushing characters and wrestlers and keeping the barriers of creativity. Sure, the show shakes the brains of sweet, innocent and easy brain children and skinny, lousy, frightened, stupid people from the Internet Wrestling Community, which the company regards as good. Anyone who even shakes and rests on the idea that this exhibition and product are good can go straight to hell.
