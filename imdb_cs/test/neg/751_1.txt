Can I give 0 out of 10 reviews? Because they deserve it. Although I am not a big fan of Jane Austen's books, I sat with this two women who are. Well, at least we had a big laugh about how bad the movie was. Robert Hardy was the only actor with a charism in the whole thing, though he flipped it as he usually does (almost as bad as William Shatner). But that wasn't enough to save this smelly of utter expressionlessness. It is often difficult to separate the girls' dreams sequence from what is "really" happening, and so many holes remain in the story that you can hardly find out what's going on. Too many free ends and end feel like "tuning again next week" climax. The leading actress is too ditsy and a strange-looking hero, the lead man is too goofy-looking and effeminate to be a compelling hero and the music sounds like some cheap modern pet project to the director's hippie daughter (I mean saxophone mixed with some space opera female lament ?). In conclusion, I recommend that you make the budget as soon as possible and order a DVD. Especially if you like disappointment.
