In 1967, I saw an excellent musical at Wintergarden, New York, where Angela Lansbury covers the stage as Mame. But Hollywood gave her the lead ???? Lucule Ball played Lucy great. She killed the film. What a mistake There was no chemistry, as it was on stage Bea Arthur and Angela, what a pair when they sang.
