I was exposed to this terrible apology for a TV movie. I was looking just because I had no cable and my only other choice was Golf, College Basketball, or local news. The plot is very general and has no substance I have seen, not to mention that he had a big mistake in his eyes. Main character, Dr. Sorensen, a well-drained astronomer, believes that an asteroid called "Nemesis" will strike Earth and cause life to end. He bases his faith on the discovery of cave paintings by a native (I'm sure I wrote it badly). Pictures show an apparent timeline, showing significant events throughout history, such as the construction of the Great Wall of China. All events are displayed in perfect chronological order, and the last timeline image is destroyed by Earth. If the painting showed me things that really happened, why would the great doctor believe he could somehow change what happens? All this aside, the film moved along with extreme formulation accuracy. There was nothing in the film that surprised me. The actors weren't very good, and on several occasions I just felt they didn't take the film seriously to make sure the characters were worth taking care of. The whole film was a ridden clich√© and a waste of time and money. I would recommend Armageddon over this piece of crap every day. At least Armageddon has some good acting performance (compared to that), not to mention the eye candy that is Liv Tyler. Now that I think about it, Golf isn't so bad .......
