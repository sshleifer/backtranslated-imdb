A woman in love with her husband (being suicidal) decides to have a child that saves his life. She was at the fertility clinic - just like the lover she takes - so they both know how artificial insemination works; but instead of using the method thousands of people use each year around the world ($ 5 turkey baster), they engage in sex. We are also convinced that while an immigrant is in love with his fianc√©, he is not suggesting an obvious alternative to sexual intercourse. In addition, even if it is a commercial arrangement when it is first with its sperm donor, it will take off all the clothes as if it were seduction. Plus, her husband won't notice when $ 30,000 is missing from their bank accounts. Does this all seem to require a more willing suspension of mistrust than even most of the Hollywood fare? Far attracted in all numbers.
