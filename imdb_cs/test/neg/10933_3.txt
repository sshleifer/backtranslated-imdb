My husband wanted to watch this movie because the newspaper review said it was better than Fatal Attraction. Well, I don't like either Michael Douglas or Glenn Close, I have to agree. Not for conventional reasons. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that need to be watched late at night when you don't want to watch something that really needs thinking, but you don't want to go to bed Yancy Butler is really nice bad guy. He is not the best of actresses, he is not really good at all, but he is ideal for this role in this movie. Everyone else in it differs from pine to oak, including a slightly disturbing boy who stumbles like a crooked Pinocchio. SPOILER: The end is a step or two too far, complete with a clich√© that is not completely dead, with a roar, you still get a moment and then there's a shot of Pinocchio with his frozen wooden grin, thanks you are wondering if they went on cooling or just forgot that there is botox in makeup. Regardless, it's a merry eighty odd minutes, and despite being a bad movie, you would have missed a humorous gene to not enjoy it. Don't pay for it, but if you're in that kind of apathetic appetite, then that's right.
