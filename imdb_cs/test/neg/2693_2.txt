I have been a Shakespeare lover since childhood. I'm also a Jew. The merchant from Venice is anti-Semitic through and no matter how hard scholars and literature lovers try to interpret him again. In the game, Shylock is portrayed as demonic and heartless and has no forgiveness, no warmth, no love except money and cruel revenge, while Christians are kind, moral people. His motives in the game revolve around money (counting revenge on the basis of the damage caused by his business, as well as blind racial hatreds), not noble ideals or injured racial pride, as this film wants you to believe. And this characteristic is given to him by Shakespeare himself, not by other characters. As a final proof, a happy ending is where a Jew loses his money and is forced to convert to Christianity. <br /> <br /> I respect that and go on. It's part of history and I like Shakepeare despite this fact. Therefore, I expect the movie based on this game to play straight. I'd rather see a job tailored to my rich language and narration without any whitewash. However, in this film, many bard sophistication and playful characters are lost. For example, in the last scene where men discover Portia's secret work as a man who also took away their rings, instead of a playful play of words and a misunderstanding of how truth is revealed, it becomes a mild spirit where two women who are in battle . Play cruelly with their soon-to-be-married. So instead, we're just left with beautiful detailed files, rich language fragments with poor reinterpretation, bad casting, one intense courtroom scene, and controversy. The truth is, I think it would be much easier to identify anti-Semitism in the story and move on if it were. Despite the fact that the creators of this film have pulled out of their hats, there is a lot of hatred, only now can people apologize and pretend that the display of Jews is no longer so bad. Finally, another problem is that most actors are wrong. Pacino is out of his league and is uncomfortable with the language, not to mention the terribly false accent. Fiennes like Bassanio is clumsy and clumsy with his tongue. Irons are as reliable as ever, but they do not do much with its role. Portia is somewhat fine, but is unlikely, and is covered with bad makeup, as well as a movie.
