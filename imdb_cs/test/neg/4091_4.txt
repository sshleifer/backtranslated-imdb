I really liked Bruce Almighty, but the moment I found out there was going to be WITHOUT Jim Carey, I knew it was wrong. Although Steve Carell was hysterical in the first movie (crazy scene is one of my favorites), and in my opinion he deserves Emmy for his role in the Office, he's pretty weak in this dull comedy. I was wondering how much the writers wrote, because we could do without a story. But even if we destroy huge holes (why elephants and lions came to help Evan when the floods only involved a certain area of ​​Washington), the movie is just ... not funny. I didn't laugh once and if I remember, the comedy should laugh at you. Or at least giggles. Not this one. However, there is little hope. Evan Almighty has a "family" written everywhere, and maybe family browsing might be nice (kids could have fun with different animals and stupid jokes), but Evan Almighty just doesn't cut it for me. br /> <br /> I give him 4/10 and I hope Carell will be more careful when selecting roles in the function.
