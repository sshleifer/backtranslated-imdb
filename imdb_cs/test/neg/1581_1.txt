Wings Hauser and son Cole Hauser team up to make a film about neo-Nazi homosexual felons and terrorize the city. Wings plays a hero and his real son is a villain. A relatively low budget movie that doesn't have many redeeming features, and for some reason no one has seen it! Perhaps because it's a pretty ridiculous and ridiculous movie, and the studio realized it! Maybe Wings Hauser himself prevented the distribution of 'Skins' after seeing it alone! Maybe people just didn't want to comment on such a bad movie! Oh, good! As actors I generally like Wings and Cole, but it was a movie that they both had to skip. Wings directed, wrote and was the main actor in 'Skins'! Extremely bad and stupid movie! 1/2 of *****!
