This is the off-line used, but it's really summing up this movie ... "If it's the current state of gay cinema, then we're in real trouble". I saw this movie on SIFF because of the high IMDb rating (7.6) and if there ever was an IMDb voting, then that's it. Just watch the fall number through the release of the movie weeks. Easy Plot ... The Boy Finds His College Ex (Friend) Married to Their Girlfriend, So Goes Back to His Old Hometown (Still Carrying a 10 Years Torch) to Find Out What happened. First, I liked the "Latter Days", the director's last feature, despite the fact that they are cutters and conspiracy plots, but with each subsequent release you should become a better director. I don't know how you get terrible support from so many TV veterans (Robert Foxworth, Joanna Cassidy, Tori Spelling), but somehow he did. Writing was Lifetime Network quality and the situations were incredible and hard to track. I still reached for a non-existent remote to move forward, but in the end I stayed to the end, hoping for a dignified end. Ugh ... no. Even the gratuitous masculine nudity that appeared during the film was so ruthlessly unreasonable that it seemed to be there to keep people in place. To be fair, the two best, especially in perfect nude scenes, were beautiful. During their friendly friendship, there was also a real sweetness between them when they uncovered how they went separately. And the film looked great ... good quality and color saturation for an independent movie. <br /> <br /> How come network TV can give you weekly, great, fun weekly episodes (like "Ugly Betty", "Desp. Housewives", etc) as bad as this?
