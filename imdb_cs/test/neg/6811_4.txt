I'll put it this way: I haven't stopped watching and it's not corporate, which is a bit cool. But my internal critic has cut it to pieces - I think I see too many movies. The wooden script, the slang of them had a sort of cover without a mouth. The editing mentioned earlier is hit and miss; sometimes evokes a good ghetto feeling, but mainly its irritating - jerky, unpredictable angles and really boring persistent detailed faces. The actors were marginal, though Letisha had her moments. I'm not sure why viewers care about Curtis, it's a total shock, and the actor is utterly dull and not particularly funny or cute. The director will not help you to love him or hate him, even; I wanted him to shut up and shoot himself. I didn't care about his impotent revenge when it rolled. The foreseeable end is not at all plausible. I'm not sure why we should believe that some of the ex-successful sellers he liquidates are stupid enough to fall for his minor scams. "Oh, you just got out of jail and you're on probation? Here are thousands of dollars for cocaine, run it around the corner behind me. Now don't steal me, etc." Good sex scene in the beginning gave me hope, but eventually left it. Rape manipulation was slightly raised if only slightly interesting. In this genre there are better films that do not harm your intelligence by trying for an authentic ghetto realism while being more like a film school. 4/10, an F.
