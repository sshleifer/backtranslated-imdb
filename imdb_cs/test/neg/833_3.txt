This is a classic example of what happens when you sit on television for too long. Everything gets tired and jokes are repeated over and over again. OK, from the beginning, the first few series was pretty good. You had a fun manager (Simon Cadel), followed by his deputy, played by Ruth Madoc, a cleaning lady who wanted to become a yellow coat, an alcoholic child hating Punch and Judy, a bent jockey and a comedian. As already mentioned, it started well but continued for too long. Once Simon Cadel left it went fast downhill, you were a terrible story of the line, and a new entertainment manager, which Ruth Madoc (again) tossed on. When a comedy is filmed in one place, there is a limit to the number of jokes that can be broken. Unfortunately, it has been so long that every joke has been cracked three or four times. If this comedy was stopped after 2 series, it would look like a classic of all time. As it is, it will largely remember the terrible last few series.
