I watched Gomed at the cinema in my town. My friend took me and I was really curious what it would look like. I must say that this movie wasn't a horror movie, maybe we can say it's "Fantsastic experimentation" ... OK here I go anyway ... But there were lots of shooting, acting, dramatic, theatrical and narrative problems is very young and Gomeda is his first feature film. Unfortunately, due to the limitations placed on the film by its extremely low budget, the visuals are often as dark as the story. And there is no mighty Gothic scene. Some people say that 'Gomeda' is an artistic film, but I have not seen laughter, horrible and hipster art like this movie. So, how can we say it's an artistic film!
