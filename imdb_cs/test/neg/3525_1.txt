We'll see ... I've seen every movie Lou Ferrigno has done. I saw Batman and Robin ... twice. I've remembered Breakin '2 dances: Electric Boogaloo ... I've been watching unfinished Blade Runner student movies ... but this movie is the most painful thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie for the market "right on video". So you can thank Blood Cult for all the mysterious Michael Dudikoff movies on your local blockbuster. You should know it's not even a good video. It is a consumer grade. This is your father's video camera, which he never uses. That's what you have to watch for 90 minutes. I'm not going to get bored with the plot details because I'm sleepy just thinking about it, but I'll tell you that watching this movie is a form of torture. I'm just looking at this movie when I'm mad at myself. Therefore, I recommend this movie if you are suicidal or if you are on a powerful challenge. <br /> <br /> If you rent this movie (God of Mercy), you'll know what you're in. first 10 minutes. This is when you are hit by the usual intro of a horror movie. You know how it goes. There's a lot of tension and accumulation before a girl dies. Yes, you've seen it, but not like this. This is the most boring intro I've ever seen. I sincerely believe that you could get a camera from eBay for ten dollars, grab the ass that smells most like gin and candy, and tell him to film your mom cooking dinner and it would be more interesting than this intro. It bored me to tears. I cried like a baby. Another thing that makes this movie so incredibly painful is its actors. Yes, I saw bad behavior. BELIEVE ME. I saw Oliver Twist's fourth edition with a more realistic dialogue. The leading actor makes me sick. "Support" actress is a train-wreck man. <br /> <br /> I won't even comment on a friend. A real horror movie. <br /> <br /> So if you can find it, rent this movie. You will never be more depressed than having spent $ 3 on anything else.
