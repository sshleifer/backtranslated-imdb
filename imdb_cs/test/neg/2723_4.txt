This could be a good TV movie, but flashbacks don't make it easier to understand the movie. As they give the viewer information on the road (the movie will continue), I found myself wondering why she had never even said it at the beginning. Then the whole route would probably not be necessary. <br /> <br /> When the movie ends, you understand why she shot, and of course she is not guilty. Too bad the producer / director used flashbacks in this way, but on the other hand, the movie wouldn't be worth it while at all. Nice movie on a rainy day, a big bag of chips to kill in the evening.
