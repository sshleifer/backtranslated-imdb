How is it possible to make such a bad movie with such actors? Were they forced into it? The story has nothing to do with the idea of ​​how things could be done if a comedian decided on the president. They don't even try. Just when you thought you were watching a comment from famous liberals in DC politics (the first five minutes), the movie runs out of the way and into the B movie drama by 1) computer voting errors, 2) regular bad corporate suits, wants to cover it with the most original lines in history and 3) a neurotic but very pretty female programmer trying to inform the upcoming president. Soon, she will be the victim of the X-Files criminal lords of the computer society who, instead of killing her, drugs her to be untrustworthy. But when he gets to DC, he won't tell him. In fact, the film changes from the B-film drama to the idiotic B-film-love-drama. So far we are so far from the original film starting point that most people turn it off. I almost did it. If it could be INTELLIGENT love drama, but no! It is not! It's the kind of "oops I'm so nervous I'm stupid all the time, so please love me for it" - a kind of love drama. All this with a slow, slow pace that has nothing to do with the political plot of the film, the X-File Chart, or the comic plot of the film. All graphs fail at all levels, reminding you of every unpleasant bit of nonsensical dialogue. Part of the love must be the result of a decision during drinking. "Hey, there must be a love dynamics between a presidential candidate and an extremely nice programmer, yeah, it'll work! Meanwhile, Lewis Black is neutered and cast into a single line of Lewis Black. Lewis Black's anger is replaced by the hope of appearing in the film on the surface, which he will never do. And Christopher Walken is thrown into a hospital with heart problems to double the dramatic effect of a heart attack closest to President Westwind. Watching how Christopher Walken is castrated as Lewis Black in roles that continually fight uphill to sound casual and Westwing-ish, but each time they fail like Titanic, it's like watching a big blue whale on the beach. Heartbreaking. And then, enter the bottom point of the whole movie: It raises mindbogglingly, extremely difficult ethical issues: If Robin Williams go to the president, knowing that he got elected due to a computer glitch? The American dream and all the good prevails when it rejects the presidency on live TV as if it was a dog Lassie. With the usual patriotic charm of the Presidency and the atmosphere that we are so intelligent that we do what we do from history, Westwing has grown in tremendous millions of years in tremendous abundance. The director and screenwriter, Barry Levinson, is now on my personal list of writers and directors. This film must be seen as a symptom of a faulty manufacturing process where people (including Barry Levinson) have to spend production money because of their personal relationships rather than their skills. It is a project that aims to satisfy the wishes of poorly qualified people in terms of career success, and the aforementioned great actors were involved. This is the only explanation. PS: Computer voting was due to double letters in Dobbs, Kellogs, and Mills. Of course it was what else could be when you write the script and you can't tell the computer from the dishwasher.
