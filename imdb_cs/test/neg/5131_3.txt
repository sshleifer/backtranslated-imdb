This film probably had good intentions. In the end, attention is paid to who is called Kellie, who, as a viewer, can only assume that he is in a situation similar to that of the film. Maybe she made a "bad" choice. This commitment is SIMPLE TO EVALUATING THE QUALITY OF LOVE & SUICY. The film becomes unbearable from the opening sequence. Once the viewer is so upset about just five minutes into the movie, it will be pretty much downhill after it was. I know the movie was low in budget and camera shots were actually pretty good ... unfortunately everything else was scary. Acting, storyline, sound quality, image quality ... acting. I'm sorry, but the deal is terrible. Terrible. It is as if the actors were trying to act like people. That's the only way I can describe it. In fact, when I watched, I imagined a screenplay on stage in my mind. None of the movements was natural, and none of the characters' reactions were matched. In short, the timing is off. The timing of the film is gone. I'm not a director, so I know what the limits of my knowledge are, but I really feel like there must have been some way to tell the time ... until they explained that the graduation was not too far away. part of the film took place during the week ... no more than one month. All that has been said is really a shame. This movie could really be strong with a little bit of tuning. All moments in a movie in which we should feel something are obvious, but just because the setting is obvious (which is a bad thing). The moving scenes fell completely. For example, when Kaye's brother takes a hat into his head and puts it on her, we should feel he has an understanding, innocence, and protection for his brother's love ... somehow it doesn't look like that. There are so many more scenes (for example: all battle scenes) and all they do is take the film. All these things together, Love & Suicide comes as one long, cheesy, low-budget commercial.
