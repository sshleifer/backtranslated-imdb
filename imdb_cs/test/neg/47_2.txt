I caught it on IFC last week and I thought it was typical of India's short film subject: heavy in style, little in essence and originality. Coming as some surprise, the coming movie stars an unusually attractive (and blond up boot) boy with 70% shag hair and too-cool-for-school clothes? In addition, this film rolls in the late 1970s elegant, which works for some (Sofia Coppola's "Suicide Maid" comes to mind) but not for this director. Another reviewer compared it to Harmony Korine's work and I agree. Yet I do not consider it a positive thing (what did HE do lately?). "Bobbycrush" is really just a waste of time and energy for everyone involved. If you can see it late at night on the cable, turn the channel and watch something else.
