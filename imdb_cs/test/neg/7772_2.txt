Lazy writing, bad acting and wooden leadership will lead us to a Canadian television movie called 2005 called HUSH. Tori's spelling and her hubby physician move from SanFran to his small hometown, where they fall into his old gal buddy, who decides she still loves him. She gets pregnant with Toria's baby (don't ask) and starts knocking on anyone who gets in her way when she's going to meet her old flame. Actors who play an old gal palace and a doctor are not worth mentioning because they are flatter than an apartment. Tori is not much better, but at least there is something to focus on when he comes back and forth before arriving at a very poor and ubiquitous conclusion. Watch instead the HAND THROUGH THE COVER.
