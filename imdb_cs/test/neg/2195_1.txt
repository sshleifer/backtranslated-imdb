When, when will Hollyweird write a decent computer-based movie? I can't believe people really consider this film a credible story. <br /> <br /> No computer operating system could ever survive the joke of this kind of annoying scrolling interface. This may look good on a movie screen, but if you have actually tried to use it for any time you would go nuts. <br /> <br /> As for "watching" people the way she did, she just can't be like that. Network security alone would prevent this. Key recording of the move was at least ridiculous. <br /> <br /> As for the software that was probably installed, no system administrator would be able to install such critical software into the production system until it was installed. tested, tested and tested again on the sand system. Probably the worst possible part of the movie was "virus". There is no way that a virus that works on one operating system will work on another system. And as for the virus that could remove the mainframe, it's just a few seconds, it's just a beggar of faith. There is no way that an open remote connection would have the desired superuser access to delete system files. <br /> <br /> I could continue, but I can't bother. Porn has a better idea that this pile of garbage.
