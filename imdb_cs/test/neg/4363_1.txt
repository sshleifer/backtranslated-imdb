This film was sucked! The first was better. None of the first ones came back in this stupid sequel and in some way this is a good thing because of bad playing, but the characters in this movie are not even better. Killjoy in the woods? Come on! Give me a break! I'm surprised by the killer's friend Blair Witch didn't show up to make a portrait. Bad behavior, bad story and just plain stupid and boring. DO NOT USE TIME!
