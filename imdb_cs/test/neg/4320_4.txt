This film is observable, but nothing special. Four girls on a trip to Vegas stupidly choose to pick up a hitchhiker (because he's cute). Everyone ends up at the motel in the middle of nowhere at night, and the psychotic problems of the hitchhikers with the women become apparent. Characters are clich√©s - he's a married, responsible woman; slutty party girl; uncertain bride-to-be; and the man-hater who just got dumped. The hitchhiker is really nice to go crazy. There's hardly enough gore and too much rape. I like slasher horror / thrillers a lot, and this did nothing for me. The end was as lame as the rest of the film. On the positive side, the actors did a great job to work with. Dialogue is not terrible, and overall I was overwhelmed by the cast I had never seen or heard of any of them before. And the conspiracy wasn't outside the realm of possibility (although I really doubt that every woman on this day and age would marry a hitchhiker - no matter how attractive she is), so I wasn't ashamed that things didn't make sense. Overall, "The Hitchhiker" acted well and made sense, but he wasn't very interesting. There are plenty of better films in the same genre that I would recommend over this ("Rest Stop", "The Devil's Rejects", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", even the "The Hitcher" remake). Do yourself a favor and skip it if you have no other options.
