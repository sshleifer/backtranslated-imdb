In this movie they do everything too easy. It reminded me of Indiana Jones, where she was hiding on the outside of the submarine while crossing the ocean. Everyone knows everything that is happening, it's really easy to get anywhere in the White House. I don't even know why I was watching half of it. Because I like Charlie Sheen and Donald Sutherland. I expect the usual ability to avoid charges from every angle and be able to run faster than a motorcycle (usually it's faster than a car in a garage or alliance). Mostly it was stupid and I didn't even know that there was a lift in the White House. Anyway, something interesting.
