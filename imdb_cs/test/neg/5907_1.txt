This movie I am absolutely funny, and I would imagine being pretty offensive to Jewish people. (and I'm not Jewish) Why? First, the whole film portrays the protagonist Zucker as a more flattering / cheating shadow of business and commerce while his son is gay, his daughter is a lesbian and his niece is a whore. Then there is an incestuous relationship that happens in the family, first his daughter with his Joshua and John, and then his son with his niece. Two incestuous relationships in the family. I'm surprised they didn't add a conspiracy to have a mentally disabled in the family ... That would actually complete the Nazi ideal sub-human! (gay, lesbian, jew ...) <br /> <br /> A totally disgusting movie. I'm surprised that this film has no response from any Jewish community.
