George Clooney's amazing production and good comedy performance can't save the curiously separate, sometimes clumsy quasi-comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen. Depressed-era road story hearkens back to yesterday with three escaped string-gang prisoners looking for hidden wealth, and unintentionally becoming country music stars in the process! The film twists, but never creates momentum. This is a great benefit from the charismatic, Gableesque mugging, as well as from the artistic direction and live music of T-Bone Burnett. Otherwise, the screenplay (Coens) is seriously lacking in humor and interest, supportive portraits of John Goodman and Holly Hunter fail to add some lift, and the second-half of the film slides risky into self-indulgence. ** of ****
