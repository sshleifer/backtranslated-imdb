My poor Tank Girl, everything about you has ignored everything. Why does he have little to do with comics? I would love a movie that would watch a conspiracy, or at least have the characters okay. Why was TANK GIRL an American? It's an Austrailian, damn it! And she does not live in a post apocalyptic war zone, living inland with Booga as a savage. He does it because he wants to live like this, not because he has to, because Malcolm Mc Dowell acts git. And why cares about these kids? The only children in the comic book ended up with violence that choked her, it's terrible that they made her a lame character. The Jet is a sarcastic wisecracker in the comic and Sub Girl is ... another sarcastic wisecracker with a strange sense of humor. In Jet, it's a little thing and Sub is a ditzy middle-aged hag. And Booga doesn't look or give anything like he wants to be. Though maybe hot roo / human love was too big for the US box office? Humor was so weak, too. Whatever happened to Smith and Brilliant Slang? What line is "Will it take long? I don't want to miss Baywatch." Even kids' programs can come up with better material than that.
