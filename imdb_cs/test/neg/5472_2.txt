Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance are legendary actors and director Kostas Karagiannis was the man of the successful thriller Giallo-esquire Death Kiss in 1974; And yet, when you combine three talents, all you get is this complete load of the drive! God only knows what led Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance to play in this cheap devil worship, but I really hope they were well paid because neither of them deserves something as amateurish as their resumes do. The story focuses on a group of devil believers who kidnap some children and lead another group to follow them. The pace of the plot is very slow and it ensures that the film is very boring. The plot is also a long way from the original being, and someone with even a passing interest in the horror genre will see something as such, and no doubt did much better. The obvious lack of budget is felt throughout the film and the film fails to overcome it at any time. This is a really depressing and unfortunate watch, and even a slightly decent ending can't stretch enough ante enough to take the film out of the bottom of the barrel. Extremely bad things and definitely not recommended!
