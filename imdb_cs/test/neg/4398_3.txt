Jeez, when I heard this movie was NATIONAL LAMPOONS I thought it would be amazing, but I really said it was more of a disappointment. I've seen most of the movies I've done, from Christmas holidays to van wilder, and this movie is the worst movie in their title, really bad actors and a very intense movie. This movie is probably good to watch if you are looking at it with a crowd of people working, and the ability to laugh, but if you're on a good comedy like me, I don't suggest this movie, I'd much rather watch the van wilder second or third time before watching this movie ... you were warned.
