Have you ever watched something so horrible that you just have to see if it's really as bad as it looks? This is one of those movies. Critics have released it, not least the way it has been funded. I caught it on TV last night and got into curiosity. If that is what he says on the box, no more or less: a low level of humor, cruelty, very much in the 'Carry On ...' vein, but with an "adult" language. Indeed, it returns back to the 60s / 70s of British porn industry, cheating divers promising real sex and not providing (instead of nipples?) That the whole tawdry era is lovingly recreated here, but with modern cinema. <br /> < This is the advantage of Mackenzie Crook (Office, Pirates of the Caribbean and much more) and Johnny Vegas, the girl in the chip shop is really sexy, and besides these unexpected positives, I wonder what happened to England. Paid work, housing estates, desperate lives As a bonus, there are some nice shots of deciduous Birmingham, and foreigners can report on British attitudes and aspirations, but overall, I still feel distrustful of having sat down.
