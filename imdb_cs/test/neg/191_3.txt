I've never heard of this movie when it first came out. He must sink immediately. : o) I saw him on a rope when I was sick at the hospital so I barely had enough energy to watch him, let alone the channel. Better choice than Style Channel. (0) (The film was filmed on-the-spot, this travel book should be on the Travel Channel. The story is recycled from shipboard awards after the 1930s and 1940s. The cast seems to have been recycled since the 1950s.) Donald O'Connor, star musicals and Edward Mulhare as a card shark, and as far as the main cast is concerned, Walter Matthau still plays the same role as in the Guys and Dolls, or it was the orphanage, which is an irresponsible player and a rounder player. As far as Jack Lemmon is concerned, he plays his role so straightforwardly that he can barely dive and dance while dancing, and as mentioned, Dyan Cannon is extremely appealing as another swindler sailing with his mother who thinks Walter is rich while he is he thinks he's rich, Elaine Stritch plays Dyan's mother, another repeat of the fifties, the funniest is the runtime between Brent Spiner and an indigenous director who immediately sees Walter as a poor dancer and spends his time trying to release him, so he'll have to pay for your free passage. Finally, even if it comes to its own. Meanwhile, Jack Mopes, meeting an attractive woman with mutual attraction, but their affair is divided by Walter's lies that Jack is a doctor when he was actually a retired buyer. But at last, both men get to the sea in a rubber boat to catch her seaplane and everything is fine. He doesn't seem to be a major player under the age of fifty.
