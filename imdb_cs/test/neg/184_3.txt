This movie is not at all like the city of God, you can have the same feeling, but it is not intense shooting or intense drug scenes, you get the idea. If you ask me, I think this movie was a waste of time, there are a lot of other movies that give 100 times better meaning and teaching than the "Wooden Camera". Yes, I can be the only one who has made a negative comment on this film, but it's just in my opinion. It's one of those movies where I can get the feeling of being blown away, but when credits start playing my friends and I all have a look and we all laughed at how ridiculous this movie is. So to conclude this matter, I recommend that you watch it. <br /> <br /> Personal note - making Africans speak English was a big mistake. In the city of God they used their native language, which gave the film much more power and reality.
