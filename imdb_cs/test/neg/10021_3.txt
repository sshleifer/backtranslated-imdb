I think it would be a better name for this movie because it is stuffed into hell and back with traces of various bugs and animals. I recently found The Prey in its original VHS 'big box' and was very excited. I just love to find old slasher movies on VHS because the artwork artwork is fantastic. Usually, however, it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic. Prey is one of those movies. To be fair, it started OK, with a murderer chasing a cliché of teenagers in the woods. The sounds you use are a great effect to watch. This film is basically a big cliché, and when the "bonfire" section appears, the film takes a new direction and spends almost half the run time on the back story of the killer. Actually, I thought it was a pretty original idea. However, the back story suddenly ends and shows us some shots from the burning forest (the lack of budget actually begins to show). Then we went back to the stupid teenagers who were picked up in the woods. The killer itself is not shown to the end, which is a shame because he actually makes an effective looking killer. Something like Cropsy from The Burning, but better. As far as gore is concerned, there is not much, although at the end there is an instant moment. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone other than slasherists - it's a really big mess.
