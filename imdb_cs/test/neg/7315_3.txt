University Professor Justin Thorne (Jimmy Smits) did it. A good-looking, sophisticated teacher, with a loving wife and two adorable children. He plays the saxophone, owns an expensive car and his students love and respect him. But when he calls temptation, in the form of one of his bright, handsome, sexy and willing students, Jennifer Carter (Naomi Watts), he gives up foolishly. The next day she is accused of her rape and his perfect life could be destroyed forever. <br /> <br /> When we see an American actor in an Australian film, we know we're not for a masterpiece. But even with low expectations, "gross mistake" is a huge flop. Based on a game with a somewhat unimaginable title and then adapted in a reasonably pleasant book, she fails to attract, persuade or distant her audience at the most basic level. The script is unpleasant and unconvincing; acting is not much better. Watts gives acceptable performance, proving that one of the first times on the screen her emotions are fearsome, but it's the only good thing about a movie that seems almost the same as it can't wait to end. The direction is not terrible or disturbing, but it is only painfully average. In addition to the above-mentioned Naomi Watts, which could be forgiven, she saw how it was at the beginning of her career; Usually reliable Jimmy Smits doesn't seem to be trying in this, and who could blame him? But all these minor failures only add to the final fatal mistake of the film, which is that focus is in the wrong place. Any empathy for characters or interest in the result is lost in the sea of ​​what is essentially a soft-core entertainment of an adult kind. By the end, the audience will probably get bored, tired and wish they did something different with their ninety minutes. If you don't want Naomi getting naked 4 or 5 times, you can certainly afford to make this nonevent movie a miss.
