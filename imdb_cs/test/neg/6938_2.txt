If you are a six-year-old boy who is in dinosaurs, you will love this movie. If you are someone else, you will look your eyes every 15 seconds. If you want to start collecting things like acting, special effects, dialogue, or the absence of a coherent plot that makes even the slightest sense, you'll have plenty of material. If all you want is a safe dinosaur fantasy movie for your baby, it'll be fine. This means that there is a lot of fun kids out there that is much smarter, and some of them are even bearable or enjoyable for adults. If your child is not in the uncompromising mood of dinosaurs, you will probably be looking for something else.
