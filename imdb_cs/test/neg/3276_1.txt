I saw it for sale - NEW - at my local store for $ 6 and said, "Hey! Action movie with the guy from Bloodsport and Enter the Dragon, directed by the guy who entered the Dragon - and it's cheap!" So I bought it. Oops! This is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some doozie. <br /> <br /> Do you know how movies that are deliberately camped like Evil Dead II and Dead-Alive AWESOME? Do you know how films to be serious, but so bad that you have to laugh out loud and watch them again, like Lionheart (old Van Damme movie) or John Carpenter's vampires, are they all right? This movie, Ironheart, can NEVER be from these movies. I don't know what the creators thought, but it looks like this movie was made without time to shoot, no budget for anything and no script. (While I'm on the script, I should point out that Bolo Yeung has no lines in this movie - the only reason she gets the first bill on the box is that she's the only actor in the movie you'll ever do. Recognize (unless you're a fan Jackie Chan, in which case you know the wrong one - and you want to call him Giancarlo!). <br /> <br /> What's sad, is that this movie is from '92. Until then, T2: Judgment Day He came out so you know that the era of the 80's camping ended ... but not quite. What You Should Know: <br /> <br /> 1) No one in this movie can act for beans. Closest to Richard Norton, he looks suitably rich and cocky, and Bolo Yeung looks at it reasonably ... and angry. Everything else is terrible. 2) Martial arts scenes are forgotten - just a few examples of white boys with lots of shaving muscles, yelling, running on Britton Lee, kicked by Britton Lee, then Britton Lee, then fell. Even the final showdown against Bolo is disappointingly short and as creative as the design of my running socks (and the same stinking ones). 3) The rest of the action is so pathetic: the weapons look like they came from the toy department in K-Mart, and they actually shoot with the sound of a hood. When someone gets shot, they bounce a little, then lie on the stains of brown-red liquid. Britton Lee apparently gets shot in the side, but you don't see it at all, then later that day you'll see a blow ... I had paper cuts that were worse than that! 4) Of course, then the girl dresses a wound, then kisses, then another thing you know is lying in bed talking after sex. Huh? What? In this film, the credible development of love interest is completely neglected as well as any development of the character's character. Remember how Bruce Lee's characters didn't need to have sex with anyone who's okay? 5) Car chase is by far the worst I've ever seen. Does the director seem to be sitting on the sidewalk with a hand-held camera when two cars drove down the road, and I don't know about 30 miles per hour? Don't try it at home, kids, these people are professionals! Hah! 6) Really bad writing. Here's a scene for you: Lee is followed, so the girl follows the followers to "warn" Lee, but her car is too slow. By the time they get caught, Lee and the bad guys are out of the car and he's in full swing. Lee killed two bad guys, but a third is shooting at Lee when the girl almost runs Lee, so the bad guy is running away. Then the girl's car stops and she can't start it. He says Lee is involved now and she goes with him. She points out that they can't leave the car because the evil ones will watch him. Somehow he convinces him that he should decide how to deal with this problem - so he shoots a gas tank and throws out her car. (And remember that later, at the same night they have sex.) Huh?!? 7) If you look closely, in more than half of the nightclub shots, dancers are very unsynchronized music. The dancers are also too coordinated (probably in the 80s all people in dance clubs attended dance lessons). There is a girl in the DJ cab with a microphone, but she never does anything except dance. Bouncers tell people who struggle to "take it out" without moving their lips. In one scene, the only Lee and Stevo bouncers pass by are just inside the entrance, but with their backs to him! Also, apparently, if you're the main character in the movie, you can go straight to the head of the line. 8) Lee notices that when she is first watched but does not do it. Notice the second time - even if it's the same person in the same car. But the girl notices. Bad guys follow twice, but they never notice. 9) Lee fears the villains will be watching the girl's car back to her, even though they've seen him working twice. The girl continues to leave her child at work, caring for a friend while she is away to have sex with Lee. Don't let parenting out of this movie! You can't think that you might be interested now ... you have an idea ... Ironheart is so bad, it's not funny, it's a SAD.
