To remake "Lost Horizon" as a musical, the need for Rodgers & Hammerstein or Lerner & Lowe type of music was needed. Burt Bacharach and Hal David had the wrong choice. When I said my favorite thing about the "Lost Horizon" is its score. It's just that the score doesn't fit on the piece. The cast is mainly composed of non-musical talents (Ullman, Finch, and Hussey, all nicknamed, and yet it doesn't sound so good). this, and earlier non-musical film versions were based, is moderate, at best. While there are possibilities for a really good, film-based musical version, they are not realized here. The film succeeds in being a good, rainy vehicle to pass through time. Otherwise you are better off buying a CD with its soundtrack. It is only recommended as a curiosity because the film has a terrible reputation. I saw much better; but I saw much worse.
