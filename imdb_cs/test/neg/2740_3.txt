I was just watching Descent. Gawds is a horrible movie. Right from the bat, he recounts a lava geyser and notes that he is a mile below Washington State. People, geysers are not so deep on Earth. They thought it looked elegant and threw it inside in a typical Hollywood style. He put down the stone and heard the splash. Steam would erupt from this well before the lava explosion, if at all. And acting was also bad. Micheal Dorn sank to a new minimum of jobs. <br /> <br /> What is a movie dog. I bet the vote is no higher than 3.5 <br /> <br /> It didn't seem that the SciFi Channel was spending too much other than having a nice boy Perry as an attempt to draw.
