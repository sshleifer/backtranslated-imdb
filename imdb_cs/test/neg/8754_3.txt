Hollywood had a long love affair with the false stories of the Arabian nights, but few of these products passed the time test. The most memorable were Jon Hall, Maria Montez's films, which have long been a camp. It is filled with dubbed songs, anachronistic slang and grotesque. It is really a fertile crop of Mesopotamian corn and today it is quite unbearable. He was nominated for his imaginative special effects, which are almost imperceptible nowadays and consist mainly of a gimmick photography. The only extraordinary, positive feature that survives is its beautiful color and clarity. Sadly, of the many films made in this genre, few of them come with the original "Baghdad Thief" Alexander Korda. However, almost every other Arab Nights movie is superior to this movie. It's defeated.
