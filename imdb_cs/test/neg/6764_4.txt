Some nameless aliens on a distant ship from a distant planet have sent a giant Kronos robot to rob the world of its energy. They have a prototype that is close to Mexico for the opener and will be sent if it turns out to be more successful. It would certainly take a lot of time for this Kronos to do this task. For reasons I can't explain that foreigners will first capture the mind of leading scientist John Emery, who telepathically directs Kronos to his first goals. Since Emery is killed later and the monster seems to work well enough without Emery as the controller, why the aliens needed him in the first place is a bit bizarre. In any case, scientists Jeff Morrow, Barbara Lawrence, and George O'Hanlon, who work under Emery, are not a bit confused about their nature. And of course they come up with a plan to deal with a huge metal giant. Kronos is the perfect film for the 1950s, the militants are never seen to be outside and try to undermine humanity. It's the perfect film for the Cold War. And Jeff Morrow assures us that we will be ready for them in the future. <br /> <br /> Players look as if they have a great old time when they put as many clich√©s into it. I think Kronos is the kind of movie Ed Wood did with a bigger budget with a little care.
