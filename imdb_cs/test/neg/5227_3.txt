I am a fan of Ed Harris's work and I really had great expectations about this film. Having such good actors as Harris and Von Sydow is always a great advantage for the director, but if the script is bad, what can you do? I really think Needful Things is Harris's worst filmography and that involvement with him was a huge mistake. Anyway, I've seen much worse movies in my life, but the Necessary Things have been disappointing because of the waste of acting talent. The story as a whole seems incredible and false. I don't know if it's because of the book because I didn't read it. But if the script was so bad, I don't see a reason to shoot it. Perhaps it was the commercial success of King's books, or the need for low quality films for the VHS era of the 1990s. Whatever the reason, this film was a very bad choice for everyone involved.
