I found out that this film is getting more and more angry. Dr. <br /> <br /> Basically, Crawford (Dennis Hopper) predicted that the meteor would hit the earth. "The Power That Is" Don't Believe Him, so they embark on building a refuge for survival inside the mountain for a small collection of people. Jake Lowe (Peter Onorati) is lucky with his reporter. for a cheesy boulevard that gets a tip from a friend he thought was dead, something was happening in the mountains. She sets out to explore. While trying to get into a secret refuge Jake spends a lot of time shooting people to death or beating them in one cent of their lives. He spends the rest of his time on Dr. Crawford about who gave doc the right to decide which people should survive the meteor. I wished Jake would do the future a big favor and turn the gun on himself. Don't waste your time on this turkey.
