This movie is exactly the same as Ridley Scott, "Someone Looks at Me", which is a classic. It's Tom Berenger and Mimi Rogers and a bad fugitive guy. It is a quality film, with a good direction and great acting performance. This film is a polar opposite. It's the same thing, just minus any good playing and adding a movie direction. I have to say that I like the interaction between Lowe and a woman. It's hot and their romance is believable on many levels. Unfortunately, this alone cannot save this copy of Ridley Scott's classic film. Usually lousy TV movies have some fanciful quality that makes them at least observable. I think the redeeming value of this film to me is that Rob Lowe and the leading woman have chemistry. That and I was able to watch and compare the plot with another quality movie.
