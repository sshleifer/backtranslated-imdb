I was looking forward to seeing this movie because the trailer looked so cool. But the fact is that this movie is boring and totally confused. There is no conspiracy, and half of the movie is fast flashing footage of football matches. Magnified shot that doesn't give you an overview of the games. I kept looking at the timer to see when the movie was over. There's only one good thing about this movie. Sound!! The soundtrack is amazing! ............. Don't expect anything from this movie.
