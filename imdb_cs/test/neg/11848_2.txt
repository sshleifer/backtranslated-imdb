Oy vey ... Jurman Park got Corman. As usual, the plot is thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave traces larger than they are, to an inexplicable science that uses lasers to keep dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks that have chickens free in cages enough Big for Big Dogs (I've seen trucks that are all caged in shoe box sizes). And everything in the first 15 minutes of this film disaster. All male actors are imbeciles (thinking of a grizzly might be free in the desert, constantly dropping items giving predators an easy kill) and female actors look like they just came out of the modeling shoot for Fredrick's Hollywood. The raptor himself is the worst thing from Hobgoblin (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a version of a puppet and a plastic model for "motion" shots. If you want a good movie to sit around and heckle MST3K style, that's gold. If you want to make film movies and perform well ... don't take Roger Corman. Acting gets 4 out of 10, some of the players on this scene have tried. The story gets 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunk story telling bad. Special effects gets 2 out of 10, I saw worse but not much.
