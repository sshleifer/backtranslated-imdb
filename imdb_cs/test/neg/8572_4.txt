Six students in the monastery do not think - kill a nun who was excited. Eighteen years later, the spirit of a nun is back and revenge for murder. Yes, basically it's a little. It's more than that, but I still have no idea what it is. The only really great thing is to influence the spiritual nun. I am also confused about whether it is in English. Most actors are Italian, and even the title is in Italian, but in the movie they spoke English (I think or it could be dubbed, I still can't say). By the way, the real assumption of the film is pretty idiotic and the end not only makes sense, but ... it doesn't make sense.
