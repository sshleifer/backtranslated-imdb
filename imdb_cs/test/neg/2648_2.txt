I went to see Random Hearts with 3 friends and initially thought it was just me who didn't enjoy the movie. After all, I didn't like As Good As it Gets and the film won all kinds of awards. It wasn't just me ... not one of my friends liked it. It was incredibly slow, as if the teeth had pulled away. The only action in the movie is what's in the previews. We didn't go out of the theater because we all assumed something more would happen. We weren't as smart as the 7 or 8 people who went out. I never went to film in my life, but I should definitely have it. This is hard for me to write because I think it's quite easy when it comes to movies. It takes a lot for me when I think the movie is amazing, but not much for me to like. This film did not come close in a similar category. Not only was the film too long for 2 hours, but it was like two separate stories in one, but they weren't seamlessly sewn together. Plus, the "soundtrack" if you could even say it was so annoying. Like Seinfeld, he has the same riff to be played over and over again (the difference is that I like Seinfeld) .. this movie had this jazz riff that played, which sounded very inappropriate, especially when people were dealing with death. plane crash. It's hard to explain what I mean, but believe me it was horrible. I can't say enough not to waste people's money. After I left the theater, I sincerely wanted to write to a film company and demand my $ 7 back .. sheshesh, I could have gone bowling or something for the money.
