Wow, what an overrated movie has turned out to be! It was supposed to be "an extremely exciting story about a crazy killer who held a woman hostage and in terror at his home." I doubt that at the beginning of the fifties it terrorized viewers and I know that it would strengthen today's audience. "He sends frost over the spine," the New York Times declares. No, the only thing I trembled is that there will be anyone on the planet who believes everything the NY Times is printing about. Well, it was about some terrified man who held a woman hostage in her house for a short time, but a man. "Howard Wilton" (Robert Ryan) was actually harmless and friendly. In fact, it was one of the most beautiful roles Ryan has ever played! Yes, "Wilton" was a nut, but he never hurt a woman and just wanted to trust a friend. The film was bored after a while, with very little terror, except a lot of yakking. <br /> <br /> Watch out, my reader ..... that sucks.
