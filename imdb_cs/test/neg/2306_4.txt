Although this movie was nothing special, I am happy to comment on at least one factor that ruled in his favor - the film's principal in Dyan Cannon. Despite the absurd story of the film and what's going on here, her work was the best in the film. Her incredible scene with homosexual photographer David Hemmings must be seen to be believed. Good work, Dyan.
