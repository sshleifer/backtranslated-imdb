Again and again I chose it in the rental shop and wondered if I should give it. Today I broke down and gave her faith, and I probably shouldn't. While the writer / director gave the film a serious effort, it fell far from engagement. Characters, even if you wanted to feel them, simply do not have enough development or depth to really engage with them. Sarah's sexual outbursts were tiring - fast. I do not mind sex in movies, and I do not mind being ugly characters, but being a "bad" girl does not mean that you are prone to randomly ask people if they want sexual favor. By the time it was revealed what had happened to the characters, I was bored and ready to go to the top, end, something exciting ... and nothing happened. Things that people in the story tell you in the end seem to be forced and unrealistic, and they just didn't play right. If they were a little rushing, maybe I wonder. It was supposed to be a rather thrilling / dramatic work and was supposed to follow the title "Jon Good's Wife" than the whole "red right hand" and horror movie. Hell ... this was supposed to be tense, period. Either way, watch it on a rainy day or late at night when there is nothing on TV. Although it's not as big as I hoped, I'd go for it through some infomercials.
