This strange little film is based on the story of Bruno (Alex Linz) in a Catholic school that has no friends and beats every day. He likes to wear clothes and his overweight mother Angela, who is a seamstress, doesn't think it's something bad about what her son likes. Angela complains to Mother Superior (Kathy Bates), but is ignored, and as two of them go back to the car, they are harassed by the other children and they are eggs. Bruno's father Dino (Gary Sinise) is divorced by Angela and is completely disgusted by his son, who is sissy and practically denies him. Bruno meets a new student at a school called Shawniqua (Kiami Davael) who is a free spirit and dresses as Annie Oakley with cap pistols. Angela has a heart attack and Bruno's grandmother steps to take care of him when Dino refuses. The film begins with a very hard and unsympathetic look at all the characters involved. Angela has something to do with Bruno wearing her clothes when he practically encourages him. Dino was told when his mother was his mother, he was sissy because he liked opera and now he refuses to help Bruno when he needs it. The Catholic school that Bruno attends is very uncontrollable and all children run uncontrolled and even call Shawniqua the word "N". Once Shirley MacLaine moves steps in the film and becomes more family-oriented (so talk). **** SPOILER ALERT **** End after the spelling bee is incredibly fancy and "feel good". Hugs and encouragement of Bruno as reporters follow him and take his image into his papers. Shirley MacLaine behaves all the time as a "tough old wide" that hits everyone. There is one thing on the MacLaine movie that nobody mentioned in these comments and has to do with her male character. I think the character of Helena could be a lesbian! She is very hard and strong and shares a shot of whiskey with Bruno in one place while smoking a cigar. I don't remember anyone in the movie mentioning who her husband was, or if he ever got married! That's why I think her character can be gay. Many other good actors appear in the film. Joey Lauren Adams, Jennifer Tilly, Brett Butler, Gwen Verdon and Lainie Kazan all had a better look at the script than they signed up for. I think when they heard MacLaine directs that it would be an honor to be a part of it. It is very difficult to feel any remorse or understanding of one of the characters and the subject matter is impossible to cover most. The actors aren't bad, but what exactly was MacLaine? Tolerance towards a young boy who wants to wear a dress and freedom of expression? We'll get it in the first 10 minutes, I tried not to do the rest of the time.
