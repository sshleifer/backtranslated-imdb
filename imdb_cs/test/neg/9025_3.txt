Even John Wayne fans will have to admit that this movie is a mess. Wayne's character, John Tobin's after the gang who killed his parents, led by half of Apache, half white renegade Pandro Zanti (Earl Dwire), featuring as a Mexican. There are almost too many silly plot points to count, but those that stand out include Sheriff Williams (Jack Rockwell) cuffs captured by Zanti around his shoes, so all Zanti must do to make them free to remove his shoe ! Tobin's friend Dusty (George pre-Gabby Hayes) takes the thrown knife in the back, and returns good as new to the rest of the story. Tobin travels through a makeshift trough through a drainage trough surrounded by the walls of a log in the desert, and lacks his brand, pursues (in fact, walks) the Zanti across the desert. Zanti looks for relief and drinks from the pool of water, but OOPS!, He didn't see the sign above the waterhole that says "Don't Drink Poison". As Zanti collapses dead, Tobin continues his pursuit of the rest of the gang and captures the whole game by blowing up a rock wall that conceals the secret passage into Dusty's cabin - as comfortable as it does. In conclusion, the new sheriff Tobin is seen on the phone talking to the new Mrs. Tobin (Sheila Terry), Dusty's daughter Ruby, who previously in the film was the target of Zanti's abduction gang. It seems that the studio was focused on making Wayne get a girl in virtually all the movies they made with him, because this type of ending is quite predictable for almost all Lone Star movies.
