It's hard to handle any enthusiasm for this fearsome cartoon epic, which for some reason has become a cult classic. Certainly it cannot be due to the totally artificial appearance of the patterns or the pure star casting. These days it is shown too often on Fox Movie Channel or AMC. I'm sorry to report that veteran actors like Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine are even cast in this confused science fiction sci-fi, none of them real rings. It's like watching an expensive budget that is spent on a Saturday afternoon that is full of cardboard figures and unconvincing dialogue. It's a comic version of Jules Verne's novel. Mature Fontaine was still appealing, but he had a painful look on his face, maybe he regretted accepting the role of a psychiatrist before adopting the script. It does not match absolutely anything from her cardboard role, but the imperial and unpleasant presence, and most of the time she looks completely out of place. Nothing better is Robert Sterling, Barbara Eden and - especially Peter Lorre - as well as Frankie Avalon, who learn that they will not decrease with their favorite title. A terribly frustrating experience sitting in a movie like this that wastes an attractive cast and is an insult to almost every intelligence. Completely unconvincing from start to finish. The film, as well as the fantastic submarine, sinks to the bottom of the sea long before the fight with the rubber octopus brings the film to a miserable conclusion.
