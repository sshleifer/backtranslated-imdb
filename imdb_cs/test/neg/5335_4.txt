Maureen O'Hara is always beautiful and attractive. Here she plays a terminally ill woman. We don't know what. He's a little predecessor of "Love Story" in this regard. William Bendix is ​​good, as are most of the support casts. John Payne should be grieving, but he seems to be us. The girl who plays with the child she accepts with O'Hara does the best with a fancy fence: Of course! Accept the orphan. She will live after handing over your wife. It's a sweet movie, but it doesn't feel honest. I was hoping to move. I was, fine performance O'Hara. But I don't want to feel manipulated.
