It was so BORING! No conspiracy! Basically a watered version of the left king mixed with an animal farm. Again, no plot at all. Grapes! The worst hour and a half of life! I had to leave the theater for a few minutes to get relief! Maybe I laughed twice. All semi are in preview. I hate such movies. Yeah, the film is pretty much sucked up. I don't know how it has such good ratings and reviews. NO FOOT OR STORYLINE !! If you look at this movie, bring your pillow or girlfriend to keep you busy. Terrible. I don't think I ever went to film and I didn't like it. It was good that the tickets cost only five dollars because I would be upset if I paid $ 7.50 to see this crap.
