This movie just came to Mexico, and since I read very good reviews here about it I decided to go watch it with my friends and girlfriend, but I was very disappointed, I do not understand how people can rate it 10/10 I mean the script and directing was beautiful, but great overall film needs a good story that missed this film completely. I enjoyed some dramatic Asian and European movies, but they had a good story, watch this movie at your own risk, if you're not Eastern European or Orthodox, I don't think you'll like it. Half of the people in the theater left, including my 4 friends waiting outside because they were really bored. I always wait until the end of the movie. As for the film, it was an extremely slow pace, with plenty of time wasting scenes, the entire length of the story could be shown in no more than 40 minutes, but extended by the scene of the monk getting to the coal which is 15 minutes full movie and panoramic views and so on until it becomes a feature film that is really boring. <br /> <br /> I encourage you to listen to me if you're still seeing it coming back and evaluating this comment as helpful after the wards. help people avoid this waste of money.
