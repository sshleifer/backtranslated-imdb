This is the second adaptation of Charlotte Armstrong by Claude Chabrol for the screen: the first was "la rupture" (1970) (from the "balloon man") and it's really a shame no one cares about. I urge one of his fans to see it. <br /> <br /> "Chocolate" spiderweb wasn't such a powerful detective story to begin with. I read it 20 years ago and forgot everything. The film promises some good things initially, eventually, eventually disappointing at the mistake.This is a confusing Chabrol film, mixing elements of heyday (circa 1969), and a lot of language-in-chick stuff dating back to the eighties, like 'poulet' au vinaigre ', not one particularly unforgettable job. Part of the disappointment comes from the cast: it's a terribly bad gathering: Jacques Dutronc plays as a zombie, Isabelle Huppert reveals a somewhat limited actress, finally rather vulgar. She worked in "une affaire de femme", it's not here. They are not supported by the young pair: b Oth are bland and unusual. Past doctors, say, Stephane Audran or Michel Bouquet (both in "la rupture") have been brilliant and have contributed to the unique atmosphere of Chabrol. The story itself is indistinguishable: beginning as some "serious" la vie est un long fleuve tranquille "(except that the character advice in Etienne Chatilliez is a very funny movie), the film goes on and on as a ridiculous psychological drama after.We will not congratulate a young pianist who, after all she has learned about her shameful hostess, commits to driving a car on a dangerous road. Because he does too many movies, Chabrol often makes turkeys. Watching one of his movies should choose this one of all his stuff for grabs. It seems that Chabrol's bourgeois satire has finally given way to forgiveness.In "la rupture" the first Armstrong adaptation-and the average detective story that Chabrol completely outperformed - you'd have him and Audran said "have so much money! " Here Chabrol lost his bite, his strength.
