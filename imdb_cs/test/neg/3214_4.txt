Nothing I don't like more than a kung fu movie that plays for laughter. That's the main reason I can't stand Jackie Chan (or his lookalikes). He wasn't always a clown, I must add. "My young aunt" is a slap of the worst kind of martial arts. It is a perfect example of how subgenre was brought to mud by endless stupid opposites and childish behavior. If you're not a five-year-old, I don't really understand how anyone could find that kind of funny movie. But humor is really a very subjective thing. Personally, I think that this type of approach insisted on the permanent damage of the beloved subgenre. I thought the main lady Kara Hui was very good here. But I had such a hard time sitting in that I couldn't enjoy her good performance. If you don't mind, you can enjoy it. I know not.
