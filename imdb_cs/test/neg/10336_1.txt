I'm not going to go into details about why this film deserves a terrible assessment, many other people have done it. Suffice it to say that out of the more than 400 movies I owned on DVD, it's just the one I got rid of - it was so worthless that I didn't want to watch ANY of it again. Br /> <br /> However, I have a note about the ridiculously high average rating of 2.9 (from 3-15-06). While over 4 page reviews I haven't seen any ratings higher than 3 stars. Looking at the voting history, 78% of users rated movies at 4 stars or less. It looks like a few people have stuffed the ballot boxes to turn this movie off the "bottom 100" IMDb list. It would be interesting to find out how many of the 30 users who rated this movie as 10 stars (none of them wrote a movie review) are not real users. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled, the movie isn't worth your time.
