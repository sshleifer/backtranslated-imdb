There is something rotten on this film and basically the way it turns a sinister and twisted character into a hero by taking advantage of our sympathy with its truly terrible situation. Sampedro, like many who have lost hope, will choose suicide. The fact that he has been thinking about it for more than 26 years seems to be aggravating his state of affairs, but the belief that we should do what someone asks, even if that means life is, in my opinion, completely wrong. What is the contrast with the uplifting example of Stephen Hawkings, a scientist who has suffered much worse for much longer! Yet with morale upside down, the film looks forward to heroic worship, and people who disagree with are painted in simplified idiotic terms. There is little room for inconspicuous, especially when meeting a priest (intentionally manipulating a real life encounter with a much younger priest). In this way I assume that the film is on the same level as the Riefenstahls Triumph of Will. The insidious idea is that everyone should have the right to take their lives when they feel they can no longer live. No matter if you are physically or psychologically damaged, there are obviously people who believe you have the right to choose. It is likely that the same people will make an abortion case. Its all part of the current trend of getting distressed or out of sight, scrubbing under the carpet, says his mother. OK, and we all feel very pleased with ourselves. So we go on a slippery way of believing that some lives are simply not worth living, and then we decide that as some people cannot decide for themselves, then we will bring the state to decide for them. Enter Adolf Hitler from the other Oscar "der Untergang". Of course, Hitler believes that he does exactly what nature does in the liquidation of the weak. Under his regime there was forced abortion between the "weaker" tribes, the mentally disabled were quietly postponed, and the Jews were "humanly" liquidated by the gas that would appreciate the film and why not for its philosophy ... "some lives it's just not worth living. " I differ from Ramon Sampedra, Hitler and all the people involved in making this film. Human life is sacred, it is not a right, it is a gift and a gift. Nobody decides to be born, who can then choose death, it's not about religion, about protecting the weak and the helpless, but something that undermines this film!
