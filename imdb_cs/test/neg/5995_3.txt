That should shake. VH1 diverted from traditional divas (Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, etc.), which in 2003 proved so motionless. Sadly, this step was reflected. The show was not to keep the show together. Queen Latifah made a fantastic show at the 2003 Divas. A kick show with a terrible rendition of Lady Marmalade featuring Patti Labelle, Cyndi Lauper, and Jessica Simpson. Well in a studio with some control, it all can sound great. However, when they compete with each other (why?), it sounds only torturous! Jessica Simpson has the most bizarre facial expressions when she sings I've ever witnessed! Cyndi Lauper also played Girl Just Wanna Have Fun. That wasn't so bad, but it was barely impressive. Even the worst was! Cyndi and Patti Labelle teamed up to perform Cyndi's hit 'Time After Time'. It was acoustic and did not fit into the rest of the show. It could be okay if both of them were not jerking like mammals. It was just awful. Debbie Harry (of Blondie) is always cool. He has his own style, and although he may not be able to compete vocal with many divas, he can certainly sing very well. Debbie came out and played Blondie's # 1 hit 'Rapture'. With some beautiful vocals. She really took notes. She looked stunning. Rapper Eve has provided a new but sadly worse rap. It was good. Another performance Debbie was teamed with newcomer Joss Stone. They played Blondie hit 'One Way or Another'. I think Joss didn't understand the song's style and just yelled over Debbie. It was quite sad when Debbie tried and couldn't cope with her style, which spoiled him a little. She should have just let Joss continue her totally unsuitable warballing. All blondie played this track. Debbie's final song took place in the massive hit Blondie 'Call Me'. It was pretty poor. It's not Debbie because you couldn't hear her. The sound was nasty throughout the show. Joss Stone also played several songs on his own. They were pretty good. The Ashanti also showed that it would make two unexplained versions of the package. First she made Diana Ross '' I'm Coming Out '' and then Chaka Khan 'Ain't Nobody'. She's not diva! He can sing to some extent, but he has no presence. Why not just get real singers inside Chaka was even interviewed on the show .... Gladys Knight appeared and made a medal. It was very good. It was probably the best show. I don't know much about her before she is an experienced artist in Las Vegas and her experience and class really shone through. This time, Patti Labelle played 'New Attitude' in a new 80's show. It was the final and it was all right, but it was too little to be late. That was one big guy. Better luck next time VH1. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was a heavily modified 55min version that was shown on VH1 in the UK. If it were the best pieces .....
