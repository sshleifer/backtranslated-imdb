"The Best 90's Movie" "Welsh Trainspotting" .... Yes, Right! I went to this movie with very high expectations and there it was all downhill. This film was supposed to be this archetypal film about drug culture in the early 1990s and allowed everyone to see it inside this scene and smashed the prejudice of the media after the moral panic that followed Leah Betts' death in 1995. Unfortunately, it has come a long way. Where was Trainspotting able to treat you as an adult on this subject and potential problems surrounding drugs, has this just given us a schmaltzy story about the miracle cure and how it can be, you know as if you are He completely opened his mind. Cue some guff by Bill Hicks and Howard Marks ad nausea. Sometimes it is painfully bad. I think the scene at the end between Lulu and her aunt actually made me laugh aloud. Now maybe I'm just a cynic, but the way Jip leads us through this story is like listening to the Acid Frayed Man you once met at a party that talks to you about how we " man "holds back and how acid has released him from the tension of modern society. You just want to shake it a little and ask him to leave the room. The script was a real problem for me because, where Trainspotting had an excellent book by Irvine Welsh, it is written and written. directed by Justin Kerrigan. The words "Jack of All Trades, No One's Master" come to mind. Where does his inspiration come from, especially in the narrative style of the main character Jip (who sets the main character in a social situation where he speaks directly to the camera, and outlines what is happening in his mind, how the scenario unfolds). speeches to the camera are just painful to watch. It is primarily a lack of empathy for Jip, but they are so desperate that it sounds philosophical that it just ends up being your average A-Level dramatic project. The direction is fine, and intentions are good, but it's so lacking in any integrity that you start thinking what a hype is. He says it's not all bad, though. There are times that are really very fun and fun. Moff is the highlight of the film for me. It also attracted a large number of quality British actors / actresses for an independent film, which might outline why something like this happened about the film. The Best 90's Film? Not so long, but if you're looking for a solid movie on Sunday night, then it could just be your bag. Inevitably, however, the film is flawed by the hype that surrounds it.
