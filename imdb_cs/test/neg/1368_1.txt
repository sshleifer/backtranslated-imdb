I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa. I traveled from Youngstown Ohio, at a distance of approx. 85 miles. I didn't know anything about the conspiracy or the players. I didn't read any reviews and I didn't talk to anyone who could see it. Believe me, I'll never make the mistake again. It was offered I believe that as the first feature film shot in a new 3D process. That brought me around 170 miles. <br /> <br /> There were two waiting lines that stretched (I wasn't) 2 or 2½ blocks and moved very slowly. I could stand waiting for me to sit. If only I knew what I was going to know at the moment, I could be ¾ of the way back to Youngstown at the time this feature was launched. <br /> <br /> By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I nodded. The news has quickly disappeared and since then it has been pure suffering. <br /> <br /> Without getting into the unbearable details, I can only offer the following tips. If you've ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM THE EXTERNAL SPACE, the allegedly worst movie ever shot stands in my humble opinion head and shoulders over this garbage. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it has ever been featured on television unless I know why. If you ever see it, do something else. Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, let someone cheat on the rubber hose. ANYTHING. Your time will be better spent. <br /> <br /> This was my first review. It could also be my last one if there is no worse movie and I don't make a book that happens. Bill <br /> <br /> <br />
