If the movie has an unimaginable, hackney story and bland characters they need to be at it by being really, really funny. You can be away with a lot if you are funny. But while there are some fun moments scattered here and there in Grandma's boys, they are so far and little between being unable to begin to create a hack job that the film displays in so much. The film is definitely not intended to surprise anyone. When Alex hides marijuana in his grandmother's house in tea tin, you know what happens later on. The film seems to have been written by a committee that studied average comedies and grabbed any gag that appeared in more than one of them. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the movie is a somewhat unusual setting. The game takes place in a video game development company that should be an interesting source of some clever comedy. But don't be fooled, it's not a video game developer. This is basically a college film frat house, in which all frat boys were pushed into a large room to play video games. The way the film completely fails to think about its setup and use it for the original laughter can be seen in the JPJP character is the more or less conspirator creator Doom, John Carmack. At least inspired to the point that he's a strange genius who makes games. In the film, J.P is a strange, unpleasant geek who is despised and troubled by corporate game testers. It doesn't make any sense. If you are one of the most important people in the history of video games (as it should be J.P.), even if you are unpredictable and uncomfortable, people will still admire and respect you at a certain level. If Stephen Hawking is uncomfortable, his associates will still not make him on his face. Also game testers are as likely as geeks like JP, but they're basically frat boys in the movie. It is a fun normal guys against the unpleasant dweebs movie. And while this formula has worked very occasionally in the past, it is absurd in setting up a gaming company. If you decide to use an unusual setting for a movie, you do not need to simply insert all the movie conventions from different settings into it. If you're not a hack. About two-thirds of the way through the movie I gave up. Something I knew would result in a number of painfully foreseeable events. And I realized I wasn't allowed to do anything in the last half hour. So I stopped (even though I made a quick move forward just to make sure I was right, that they would follow the most predictable clich√©s they did). If the film is bad, I just say it's bad, and then what can be said, but this film is so unusual that it deserves a long diatribe. Shame on a movie that attracts a good actress like Linda Cardellini and then surrounds her. without talent. I'll give the film 1 point for giving Shirley Jones a chance to be an anti-Shirley Partridge.
