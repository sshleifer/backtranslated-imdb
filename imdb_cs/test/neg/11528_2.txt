What is a clunker! <br /> <br /> MUST be made for television or cable. <br /> <br /> Look: forget the script - forget a lot of forgotten actors. Excuse me? Continuity? NSA / NIA / whatever or anyone who is (agent) takes off in F16 - is shown on F18, who sips his intestines, and later, the plane shown taxiing is F4 Phantom! Oooh, I wish I could be so cavalier. Apart from male actors (!?) Women are WASPS: blue-eyed and long-haired and finally crying about the heroes who save them. Although a stiff weld could save most of the cosmos astro-nauts, the blonde welding tool wanders. Duh! As one of ten film SF. Like a movie in itself: 1/2 (that's a half point). They should have dropped the space station and headed for Mars. Large Raspberries.
