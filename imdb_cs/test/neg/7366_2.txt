That was really the most painful experience I had at some time in the cinema. I will avoid such criticisms as "maudlin" or "historically inaccurate" or "horse crap", because it is our sympathy that would immediately come to these words. If the director make a vast magnificent love epic, well for the sake god sake MAKE REAL DAMN SWEEPING GRANDIOSE LOVE EPIC! Why bother with the so ridiculously unconvincing second-level Harlequin novels and so boring transfers between characters that we could care less about when the most decisive battle on Canadian soil is in progress? And for pompous people who think, oh, well, this story has to focus the characters!
