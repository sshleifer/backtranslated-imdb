Tell me what you will be about the movie "Sorcerer Gore", Herschell Gordon Lewis, that must be admitted that from his first films (1963 is the cruel "Blood Feast" and the 1964 crackerbarrel massacre "Two Thousand Maniacs") on his last (1972 " Gore Gore Girls "), the man remained faithful to his muse, joyfully slashing the bodies of young men and women to choose the camera. In "Gore Gore", for example, someone was crippled by pasty and pasty-dressed strippers at the Tops & Bottoms Club, and annoying ex-detective Gentry is hired by a hotty chick reporter to help out the case. The film features remarkably annoying and repetitive background music, terrible lighting, gigantic performances, ugly characters, problematic sound, and of course some patented Lewis scenes. So one of those strippers has a face in boiling oil; one has a torn head; another has a face pressed and her nipples cut off; and yet another has her ass browsing with the tender tenderizer until her entire back is covered with what appears to be Buitoni tomato sauce. (I could be wrong, maybe it was Ragu.) The movie also throws a little lame humor, though some lines are pretty funny. For example, we learned that the real name of the slaughtered stripper Suzie Creampuff was ... Ethel Creampuff! The bottle of acid says "Made In Poland" to it (I don't know why, but I thought it was funny). And, of course, some owners of the Henny Youngman strip club are entertaining. Yet it is not a movie that Aunt Ethel or Sister Agatha would show. It's one of the worst you'll ever see, with just one sure fire, a crowd of pleasing moments - the title card at the end of the movie, "We announce Pride: This movie is over"!
