Being a historical enthusiast, I rented this movie for a topic. The idea of ​​Ellis Island experience at the turn of the century with a focus on one small group is interesting. Unfortunately, the film falls. Much of the story is simply boring; nothing happens for long stretches. The director uses wacky images (offered in the form of dreaming sequences) in an apparent attempt to break glacial stimulation, but instead interferes with the authentic appearance and impression of the film. The characters are also poorly drawn. In the end, we don't really care about them as we should. It's a shame it wasn't. I would still like to see a good movie about American immigration experience, but this is not.
