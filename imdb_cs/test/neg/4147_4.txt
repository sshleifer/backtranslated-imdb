I really wanted to love this movie because I love Tromo and I loved the trailer and loved "Ghouly", another of Ferrino's movies. It had some pretty good moments, like old songs that love a song playing a car accident, and a scene that is coming to an end where the protagonist closes. But overall it was just boring and slightly uncomfortable. The "unimaginable" shocks Ferrin had come to were really predictable and worn out. Poop, murdering prostitutes, incest. He could still be good but poorly executed. Not sure if they are trying to offend, have fun, or both. At the terminal station. In the end, we watch Troma movies because we want movies with a heart. This film didn't think he had a heart. There were some good scenes, but in the end it was boring and uncomfortable.
