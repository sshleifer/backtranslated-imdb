SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> A clich√©-stupidity movie that somehow makes anti-death with a dignity statement, even when trying to do the opposite. Washington is a crippled forensic officer who has suffered and wanted to die in the last four years (apparently he wrote his huge sales book just a year ago, so it's not all desperation). He provides assisted suicide with his doctor, who will return in a week. Meanwhile, he helps in the case of a serial killer. He recruits gutsy, I don't want to do it, but I'm so good at it, cop Jolie, and watching the impossible key leaps to the very unlikely conclusions about the moments. Hey, that old screw means the killer has a millionaire woman in a steam tunnel at the old Woolworth building. Shyeah, right. It's ridiculous. Still, he's not smart enough to find out the doctor who will help him is a murderer. When he comes to Washington to murder him (before the scheduled date), he has a change of heart and fights incredibly for his life. Cut to a compulsory evil guy who will shoot a good guy scene when BANG shuts down the gun - but the bad guy hasn't slept! No woman gets out of the corner, just shot him in the back.
