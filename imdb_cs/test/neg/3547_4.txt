Tom Cutler (Jackson) is a retired policeman who now works as a Cleaner-crime scene. In his last job, he cleans up a new crime scene and destroys evidence and is unaware that the crime was not officially reported. Uh oh, this can't be good. You can hear about cleaning products all the time, but usually when a crowd or gangland is hit when it is necessary to remove bodies etc. and clean the area. This one is different in that Tom Cutler works with the police to clean up after the police investigate the crime scene. Hey, someone has to do it. You know the police won't. The film makes it quite clear and it is family to clean up the area. This is an almost good thriller, but a side plot involving Tom's daughter (Palmer) makes this story somewhat embarrassing. I think they had to fill up for some time. Oh, they brought this side conspiracy to join with another side conspiracy, but it was still far and awkward. See? It was an almost good thriller because there was a noticeable lack of tension, tension and pace was somewhat draggy. Music did not help me, as I noticed that music is more suitable for watching people on a long journey. You know the music on the go. Understand it? HA! Playing all was excellent in this almost good thriller. Violence: Yes, Gender: No, Nudity: No, Language: No
