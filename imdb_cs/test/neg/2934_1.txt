In & Out forced me to vomit. I've never seen such a shameless movie! That really meant to say that being gay is something wonderful and joyful, but has no idea how to say it. For me it wasn't a comedy if the cruel, sick joke is something to laugh at when the victim falls on it. From what I saw, this movie had four (4) big drawbacks starting with (A) The character of Matt Dillion announcing to the world who is a former teacher, Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is gay. Never mind how incredible it is that Matt Dillion has won an Oscar for what looked like a serious role on the edge of crack. But why would he say something like that? After all, it was never with Howard's students, his friends, his family, nor his final. Nobody. So why would he say such a thing when it's not true? More about why the film doesn't give us an answer, why did he say that? The reason for this is that there is no answer and no one is available for the convenience of the land. The second (B) mistake is that the film seems to have forgotten what homosexuality is - the attraction and sexual relationship to the same sex. In this film, being gay is based on the sympathy of Barbara Streisand's musicals and being passionate about literature. Everything is based on stereotypes! Both of these errors re-encounter at a graduation ceremony that must be seen on the road. Matt Dillion learns about the turmoil taking place in this little town, and the film looks ready to let us know what made him do that. When he comes to the ceremony, he says nothing, and I wondered why he came there in the world. He didn't solve anything. Then, when all viewers stood to announce that they were gays, I was so moved that I wanted to vomit! These people stood up to defend Howard, who is a homosexual and ridiculed all those stereotypes. What the film has forgotten is that these stereotypes have shown why Howard is gay. The filmmakers were just shooting in the leg! But wait there is more! During the ceremony, (C) Howard seemed to be trying to lose them to work as a teacher because people believed he would affect his students to be gay. The film tried to say that homosexuals NEVER accept and that it will not affect its students. But we didn't see Tom Selleck's character pushing Howard over and over again, even to the point where he kisses him unexpectedly to come out of the closet when there was no wardrobe in my mind? The film clearly shows that homosexuals are able to recruit. The film shoots into the foot again. And (D) When Howard came out of the closet, didn't anyone notice how the script shut him down for the rest of the movie? I counted only three lines that he had then: "Yeah!" your parents: "Hello!" student and "Are you ready?" Tom Selleck before the last reversible scene. I could be low by one, but it's not a reason to tell us what made him decide he's gay. I wanted to know what's in his head because I never once believed he was gay. As a bonus, the movie also includes some really offensive scenes. One in which Howard asks the priest to give advice on what to do for a friend (he) who is busy and has not yet had sex with his fianc√©. "Does that make him gay?" he asks. The priest replied, "Oh yes, it's definitely gay." Uh-huh. Or what the scene when all the old ladies gathered around tell Howard's mother that she may not be sad about her son's deep, dark secret because ... they all have them. Then one of the women confessed that she had never seen "Madison County Bridges". Funny? No! Becuase's film shows he is insensitive and has no idea how it can be for the family, so that one of his members announces that he is gay. I know. I have several friends who are homosexuals, and none of their families did it well. That was the wrong way to spread the situation. The last straw for me was the last scene to tell them that Tom and Kevin got married. The camera ran slowly toward the front of the church when ... It wasn't what you thought! I was thoroughly disgusted by that point and I could never forgive the sick joke. I have nothing against films about homosexuality or homosexuality. "Philadelphia" and "Longtime Companion" were very honest and true in what they said. "In & Out" is just a shout about political correctness, but it has no idea about corruption in its core. What I gained from the movie is that if you are 99% straight and 1% gay, which means that if you have the slightest doubt, they are DEFINITY GAY. It's like homosexuality becomes the dominant feature of genetics. In fact, if everyone told you again that you are worthless and stupid, you would ultimately believe it, wouldn't you? That's what happened to Howard Brackett about being gay. I left the theater sad and angry. In fact, he was angry all weekend. It was a seriously ill and cruel movie, WORST 1997.
