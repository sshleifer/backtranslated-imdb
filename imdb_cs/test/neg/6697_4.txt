A coach who used to be good but had to move to a new area to get rid of what he once did; a team with no hopeful; a star player who has a line with the coach; assistant coach with alcohol problem, the little boy who kicks on the winning basket scoring; the whole city against the coach (all except the front lady). It's an old story - straight from the British comic book, where a team of speculative dogs and mortals board Brazil to win. This film, although well composed, is full of these films. cliche. The only part I didn't anticipate was when a star player suddenly decided to stand up with a coach at a city meeting. No reason has ever been given. It seemed like a strange thing to me when I saw everything going so far. Maybe sorry poor man. Gene Hackman plays Popey Doyle's changing room. I'm sure Dennis Hopper's caliber actor didn't find anything special about his role. The same can be said of Barbara Hershey. All in all, a film full of clich√©s that could be done much better than it was.
