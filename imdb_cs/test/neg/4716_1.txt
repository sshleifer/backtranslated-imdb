I swear, I've never seen such a bad movie as Half Caste. Not just because it doesn't make sense, it's a huge piece of egolatry and self-confidence that makes me vomit. Sebastian Apocada (Apocada is similar to "apocado" in Spanish, which means "out" of life and happiness) is one male army movie that thinks Sam Raimi or the boys who drove Blair Witch Project This is a Blair Kittie project with an expensive low budget. <br /> <br /> The story, a few American filmmakers going to Africa to make a documentary about Half Caste, is simply no use. High-speed shots with slow shots, just revolts your stomach more than silly lines (what the hell is the dialogue about Bestiality?) Or lame performers. By the way, I don't believe this cast (or caste?) is American, they all look at me just like Europe. <br /> <br /> To complete this goal, it is enough to say that the creators have taken a smart step in selling the film, giving false success (as the most original film) and a nice cover (in m half-caste in the negative), so I feel unhappy because I can't claim 14 euros back.
