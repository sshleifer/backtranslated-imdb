I gave this movie 2 mostly because it is actually fine, but the film itself is just so (insert an unusually rough word starting with the sixth letter of the alphabet) - it's useless that I felt bad that at the time I voted there were three for his lowest vote. Very Predictable Conspiracy ... Two studio musicians have no money and a lot of money. However, when a friend leaves a bag full of money (which belongs to drug dealers) in their care, of course, he spends it and then "fun" begins. It's not an original idea in this movie.
