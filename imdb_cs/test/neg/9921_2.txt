It was a dirty and inconclusive mess. When I finished, I needed a shower. It's something like this - some socialists are murdered and the case is assigned to a female murder detective. They find that the victims belonged to an underground lesbian society, and she associates with a group that can have relevant information. Because the detective is an attractive woman, of course she is horny and biased (which reveals much about Hollywood and his psychosis about women). Surprisingly, none of this is very sexy or interesting, just depressing and yucky. Ellen Barkin gives a respectable performance as lead detective and Julian Sands provides unintentional laughter as a cross dressing psychiatrist.
