This is not the worst movie I've ever seen. I didn't feel that I wanted to remove the eyeballs after observing the Galaxina. It's just not good. Jokes are almost funny, but not enough. All. The few gags that are approaching are repeated over and over again. There are no production values. The sound is bad, the lighting is bad ... it just looks cheap; too much. Dialogue ... well, often missing - many unpleasant silences; they all just stood up and someone seems to say something. The film even looks ambivalent about what it wants to be - it's not always clear that it was intended as a comedy - like the one that was made after filming. It feels like somebody's film project they've thrown together before the evening, and if they've given it two weeks, it could have been good. I thought "mom and dad save the world" was rude. I like Pluto Nash. "Mystery Men" is one of my favorite movies. "Spaded Invaders" is well close to the classics. Turkey doesn't do that. "Space Truckers" was more believable. Avery Schreiber, who may be very funny, is trying too hard. His part calls straight and plays as he leans toward him. Dorothy Stratten is right in her role, but she is not particularly remarkable. Yeah, "My watches are always slow." the line was funny. I'll give this movie all the kudos it can get, it needs it. Spacecraft models are not bad, but few and are not being used effectively. The spatial scenes are vague. No sweeping passes, no detailed detailed fly-bys, no suitable action scenes when dock. (Infinity crashes very strangely in one place.) Flight dynamics is terrible; worse than what you saw are choppy, not smooth. The initial battle is stilted and static; Though both ships have just shown that they can maneuver in their choppy fashion, they trade (slow) shots in close proximity in a way that is more like a 16th-century naval battle, except not so exciting. Aliens - Imagine that all Star Wars were a cantina scene. That many rubber masks could get blunted quickly, right? Several of them are used as flashes of sight that work for the first time, but not the fifth. Mercifully, if you try to follow the Galaxin, you'll probably fall asleep. (I was busy doing something different and missed the last ten minutes, and I didn't feel it worth it to be played. If it doesn't say it's "suck", I don't know what he's doing.) potential, and it could easily be a good movie. It would be easy to remake and have a decent movie. MadKaugh
