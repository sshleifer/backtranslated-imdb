This is a great prerequisite for a movie. The overall plot is very original, interesting and something to think about. Poor production, apparently a small budget, craps from the main character, and a few side actors that would reflect this would be classic. An upcoming and upcoming producer should try to revive this story and give this fundamentally half-hearted consent to proper release.
