Van Sant copies Hitchcock's masterpiece for shot, including some modern aspects: walkman and nudity from Anne Heche. If you do not have a strong desire to see Mrs. Heche naked, there is absolutely no reason to see this film instead of the original. Hitchcock's masterpiece is much better, and Van Sant does not realize that in the shelter of nudity and gore the original shower scene is all the more scary. Ask Janet Leigh. Acting is also much flatter and the technical aspects are much less impressive.
