Pun intended. This low-budget action / horror tool for Don Wilson's ability to kick things is what's made directly to the video. The story: Wilson is without the humor of a vampire hunter who comes under the fire of local law enforcement after being forced to defeat the night's creation with respect to the public. The police are chasing him, vampires chasing him, reacting by kicking ... a lot. The story is a bit more, but it's so unimportant that I can't remember it; I think people have actually spoken in the movie, but that is in the debate. The plot is nothing more than set-up for Wilson to kill as many vampires as possible at the time of the run, usually by kicking them. <br /> <br /> The technical specifications are anemic in one word. Small color adjustment, amateur lighting, simplified camera use and angle. Blood and gore are noticeably limited, special for this type of film. The worst of the movie fouls is the dramatic shift to a super-insecure camera during every battle scene. If the camera turns around like monkey monkeys at speed, then you know Don is about to start digging everything in sight. All in all, this is a kind of bad movie that can be done good with a few friends and a lot of cynical humor. Otherwise, do not watch if you really like watching things get kicked. <br /> <br /> 3/10
