Following the film, which is the pinnacle of the 1980 Ninja genre, "Revenge Of The Ninja," the salivation fans were "treated" with this bizarre offer that mixes Ninja shenanigans with spiritual possessions .... the end result is not different in nature to that a somewhat fearsome experience when one spying human poop floating menacing towards each other in a public swimming pool. For example, consider the supposed introduction of "packed action", which is a set of all golfing places course (!) Here we are witnessing an evil green dressed ninja who kills a group of golfers apparently no discernible reason at all (though to admit that a shallow elitist attitude adopted by many participants in this particular sport is a bit of annoying ... hmmmm Maybe that's why he murdered them ... ... yes, I can eventually relate to it. In fact, later in the film, we said that one of the golfers was a top scientist, but this story is never worked out and never mentioned! In any case, back to the intro, the police continue to surround the golf course and basically shoot the absolute hell out of the killer .... and they must keep on shooting him because he just won't stay down !!! Yes, literally hundreds of wheels are pumped into it and STILL gets up to kill more and more coercive numbers. Finally (after what seems like an eternity) our miscreant detonates a smoke bomb and disappears. ... or it seems, because in fact, he's just hiding under the ground and looking for his body on our definitely helpless officers leaving the scene, he comes out of hiding and staggers away. Next, we'll see the beautiful Lucinda Dickey, a really beautiful actress, and in a perfectly decent physical condition, we're playing a phone repairman here. From her elevated position, it appears that the dying dies (at last !!!!!) ninja. However, after closer examination, the man, probably on his last legs, suddenly jumps on her and grabs her to the ground. Fortunately, after a moment of struggle, our wild heroine frees himself, but he does not count on a ninja that has hypnotic powers and is inevitably subject to them. It is at this moment that the dying ninja actually projects his soul into our heroine! His intention is to use her bodily form to kill those officers who killed him (those few who didn't actually wipe out at first!) From now on, throughout the film, whenever our hero watches one of the aforementioned officers is exposed to the vastly nasty movie scenes of flickering lights, smoke effects, and a sword that the ninja has left her in the most reversible way to the levitating towards her! a more complicated, especially irritating police officer (who has enough coat on his back and shoulders to give average yak to shame!) persists in trying to win his affection (in a totally bloody unpleasant way !!!) .. Of course, this does not take the gift of prejudice to find that in a somewhat weak "shock" (less) twist to the end of the film, HE is revealed as one of the officers he must kill! But wait for some hope! Step forward single Sho Kosugi! Yes, ninja alone and looks here as cool as ever! Golf news seems to be traveling quickly and learning about the events that have occurred there, flying all the way from Japan to solve the situation (suspect of the worst!) In a short sub-story (that's a few seconds!) Sho's interest in this particular ninja is proven personal after it turned out that this villain murdered Shoho's father / teacher (?) And blinded one of Sho's eyes (which requires Sho to wear a really decorative sword!) <br /> <br /> After stealing the body of a dead nemesis from the morgue and then watching our heroine, who provides an unconscious mansion for the evil soul, depends on the climax in the oriental temple (seemingly in the middle of nowhere) where our man Sho manages to reconcile two unrelated aspects. Now revived from the dead, the evil ninja and Sho are fighting in a traditional Ninja style with swords with a winner ........ yes, you can probably guess. Really this movie ha It's just two things, always excellent Kosugi (which always looks absolutely fantastic in the role) and beautiful Miss Dickey. What a pity that the material they find themselves is such rancid stacks of orders. Well, to be fair, I saw much worse than my time, though I'm definitely still not advised to do anything other than the desperate to finish their Sho Kosugi / Ninja film collections.
