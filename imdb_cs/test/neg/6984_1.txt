At the other end of the spectrum from RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, David Hemmings' adventures about saving a World War II aircraft with a valuable cargo are absolutely worse. Assets include a beautiful New Zealand setting, Brian May's energetic musical score and some dandy helicopter fly and chase jet. But the bad is far better than good. Donald Pleasence ham as maybe never before; half of his dialogue is almost incomprehensible. George Peppard is trying to make an Australian (I think) accent, then he puts it in half. Lesley Ann Warren is the most irritating about her. Ken Wahl's, Ken Wahl. Dialogue is painful to hear and Hemmings's direction is largely inept. The script is not only obvious but also horrible. Jokes fall flat, scenes carry no blow, and continuity is virtually non-existent. According to the final credits, two men were killed by pilot boats in the production of the film. What a shame.
