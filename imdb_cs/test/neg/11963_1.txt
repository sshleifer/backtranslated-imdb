So I and my friend are looking after our local movie shop and looking for something to pick up with the Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, so why not pick up the third installment on Scarecrow! Keep in mind that it's not just a scarecrow three; This is, Scarecrow: Gone Wild. Now we both saw the first two scarecrows, so we felt obliged to finish the job. Let's start with the DVD cover first. First, note the picture of Ken Shamrock ("The Most Dangerous Man of the World") on the cover. Apparently he was used to market the film as a "main actor". By the way, he has the least time on any member's screen of the attributed class. Furthermore, we note that a woman is very attractive and very sharp in the middle of the cover. I can assure you he's not in the movie .... at all. At the time of the lease we assumed that it should repeat the fact that the scarecrow "goes wild". In the background we noticed a great carnival on the island in the ocean. I can also assure you that carnival is also not in the movie ... at all. Looking back at me and my friend should learn something. Really, who the hell is building carnival on the island. Now to the current movie. We start when a young man is inexplicably melted into a scarecrow in the middle of a cornfield. Don't ask me how they were melted, but they thought about when Brandon Lee had awakened from the dead in Crow. It's just stupid. But in the defense of the scarecrow is "gone". Anyhoo, a bogeyman who now lives in a young man, sets out on a trip to the local beach to brutalize those who made him wrong. Since yes, in the world of scarecrow, the beaches are conveniently located in the same proximity as the cornfield. To make the long story short, the scarecrow kills all who stand on its way without any warning, except for a whistle that is a sign of a scarecrow whistle. This is however somewhat impossible to believe because the scarecrow's costume is mouth clearly sewn closed. Several tracking shots that would later cause Kubrick to roll into the grave, and we have one of the worst third installments in a row. Well, except maybe the third Matrix. As Joel Siegel said: "This scarecrow is wildly bad."
