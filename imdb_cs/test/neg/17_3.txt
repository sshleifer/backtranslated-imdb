It could be the biggest disappointment I will see in 2009. I think I'm a rare person who didn't like Parkboy Oldboy, but I think his Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance “is one of the best movies I've seen in the decade of 2000. That's why I was really looking forward to it, especially because it got such positive reviews. Instead, I found a film cliché and broke a little bit if there was a new basis for the vampire genre. And while I can appreciate a bit of gallant humor in movies like this, I felt that Park did it at very bad times. Others have compared it to "Let the Right One In" and I must say that "Let The Right One In" was much better than this one, and it was a new look at the vampire genre. Sadly, Park's will was tired.
