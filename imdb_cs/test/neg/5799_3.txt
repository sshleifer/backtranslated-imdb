I have to say that I was excited about this movie before I rented it because it was Adam Sandler's production "Happy Madison" and I'm usually attracted to this type of stupid humor. There were a few fun moments at the beginning of the movie, but this film lacked everything that makes a good movie. I realize that many movies that are not realistic can still be quite funny, but this movie was unrealistic and not funny at all. Behavior was terrible, cinematography was very poor, the plot didn't make any sense. I can't get through the fact that 3 primitive older ladies would even work for such bad writing. Overall, I was very unconcerned with this film and I do not recommend wasting $ 5 on renting it.
