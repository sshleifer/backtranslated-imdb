"The Cave" must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There was no plot, no story and lighting was terrible. For most of the movie, I was not able to make sense of the scenery as it was highlighted by torches. Persistent gray spaces throughout the film were unpleasant. The only scene that really went through was clearly illuminated in the cave by what seemed to be the wrong simulation of the conditions in hell. All in all, the movie isn't really worth watching. If producers cannot come up with something better, they should find another profession. The underwater scenes were especially terrible, mostly made up of bubbles and flashlights, with an occasional look at the actors. In sum, a really horrible movie with poor lighting, external flashes all over.
