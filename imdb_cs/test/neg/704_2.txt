I never want to see this movie again! Not only is it terribly bad, but I can't stand my hero Stan Laurel looking so old and sick. <br /> <br /> Mostly I can't watch this horrible movie! Honestly, there's no reason to watch this horrible movie. The story is just stupid. Actors who surround Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are really really bad and Laurel and Hardy are more fun in some of their earlier movies! <br /> <br /> I warn you not to look at it, pictures will persecute you for a long time!
