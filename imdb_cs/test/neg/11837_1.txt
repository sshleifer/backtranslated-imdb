I understand that Roger Corman loves to do cheap things, but it's just sad. I bought this movie from a dollar basket in my local video store not a month after watching the original Carnosaur. I was blown away; It was the same damn movie that only some of Corbin Bernesen put in! It reminded me of all the ninja films from the 1980s that took old Kung Fu movies and merged into a bunch of white ninjas running on ninja wheels (if you haven't seen them, look at "Ninja") Terminator "," Thundering Ninja "," Black Dragon "and" Ninja Warriors ") Thanks to Roger Corman, you just let me waste a dollar.
