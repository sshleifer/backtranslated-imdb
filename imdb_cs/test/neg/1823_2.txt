Simply Poor Vehicle Lana Turner-Ezio Pinza. Pinza had a beautiful voice, but he rarely used it in a film that reminded me of a "student prince" with adults. Pinza is not even a leading man. It looks like an older man is willing to collect social security and go fishing. The plot is a very thin and supportive cast of Barry Sullivan, Marjorie Maine and Debbie Reynolds are so few. Sir Cedric Hardwicke comes to the end to announce that our King Ezio has returned to his people better. As for me, the faster the better. Is it Lana Turner really singing with Pinza? It's not bad if it's her. The painting would also remind me in 1960 of the film "Prince and Showgirl" with Marilyn Monroe and Laurence Olivier.
