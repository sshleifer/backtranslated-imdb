The worst movie ever, with characters from Carnosaur 1-3 inserted only to fall to the same extinction they had in the first movie, so shots and special effects could be reused. Stay away from this debacle. Corman destroys his link. He did and produced some amazing movies - but that era ended with Carnosaur being his last "creative in his bad" movie.
