Komodo vs. Cobra will not build the world into the fire. It's not a sign of cinema history. It is a group of underfunded filmmakers who are trying to make another film, make another paycheck and continue to support themselves and their families. As such, I give these efforts a lot of will. I mean, it must be hard to be a Russian special effects technician. It's not a lot of big movies getting there. But - they are dedicated bunch and more than willing to throw all of them into any lame American monster movie they need affordable SFX. And I get a kick out of finding the same places to appear again and again in these flicks. If for some reason you find yourself looking at it again, look at the sequence where Pare and the company go through the "jungle". Look at their feet and you will see paved walkways. And if you still have a copy of "AI Assault" (shown a week or two earlier on SciFi), you will see that people in it by tram across the same ersatz jungle. Think about it, I think helicopters will land in the same clearing in both swings. I can admire how fragile these films are. Every dollar really appears on the screen! Too bad there's just not enough dollars ......
