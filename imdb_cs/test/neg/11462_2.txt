Is it really possible that so many people in this movie believe the girl is a witch? Just because she has dark hair and wears dark makeup, should she be a witch? And I had the impression that she was trying to imagine her as someone who was "different", someone who nobody understands ... She's just a teenager and some stupid high school girl says she's a witch and everyone believes her. In addition, Brandi is either displayed very badly, or the character itself is so ... Fake. She didn't convince me she wasn't a witch, not that I believed it in the first place. Everyone accuses her of being a witch and behaving as if she is not entirely sure she is a witch or not. And the way they put her in the yard - I see old ladies every day who wouldn't hear it, even if it was the last garment in the world! Brandi's brother was also not very convincing ... But as you can see, the important thing is that "at the end of the movie she loaded a bad, bad girl on the floor". "She won the battle, she proved to everyone that she was different." This is probably one of the worst movies I've watched in life, too shallow. I just watched it because there was nothing else on the TV, so I was sentenced to this waste. Don't waste your time watching this movie. When I saw a 7-star rating, I almost fainted ... It doesn't deserve it compared to other movies that are also rated with 7 stars.
