To be honest, I've never been to Congo or even to Africa and after watching the TV movie Heart of Darkness, I don't think I want to. The film totally shakes the book to the highest possible level. Although the book wasn't the best I read, I seemed to appreciate the book 100 times more after watching the movie. Nicolas Roeg, director of the film, has done a terrible job portraying Joseph Conrad's novel in the film. I give Roeg some appreciation for trying to make it impossible to try to make a book in a movie, but that didn't have to be for him. The film was unsuccessful to express any part of the short story other than the basics of the plot. The ensemble and the scenery also lacked the beauty of Conrad's portrayed Africa in the book. In the book, Marlow saw so many amazing wonders, but you didn't get the same experience in the movie. No, I don't blame the director for everything. playing in the movie was just awful. All the actors were boring and uninteresting. Throughout the film, I felt as if the actors did not give any emotions as if they had read the script all the time. Tim Roth, who plays Marlow, did not draw Marlow's sense of adventure for his trip to Congo well. Marlow's journey to find Kurtz was bold, but I didn't experience it in the movie. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie, especially if you've already read the book. He is not approaching justice for Joseph Conrad's novella. Conrad's words capture the reader and take them on the road with Marlow, on his way to find Mr. Kurtz, where he didn't do the movie. Great news, but very bad movie. The Heart of Darkness film is based on Joseph Conrad's book, also called The Heart of Darkness.
