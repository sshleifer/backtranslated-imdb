This film was horrible and the only reason he was even made it was the story that he spoke far from the left. I consider my own moderate, so I was able to see this movie as a pile of garbage. While I'm not a Bush fan, your resistance to GW is not enough reason to see this movie. cheap, rather than artsy. Moreover, the characters are seriously missing. Chris Cooper's character was a bad parody of George Bush; more suitable for Saturday Night Live then dramatic film. The rest of the characters are clich√© walking and are bad facsimile of other characters from much better movies. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs!
