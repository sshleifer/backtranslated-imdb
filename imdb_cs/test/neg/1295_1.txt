Avoid this movie. If you expect "The Poseidon Adventure" (1972), you can experience more than just a "bend". This film offers more than two extremely long and drawn hours full of boredom. Castings seem to be angry with the irritation of the bath of water overflowing on the bed of negligible petunias. The screenplay is totally unrealistic and the film does not even have a catastrophic film. In fact, everything about this movie is bad, except for Tom Courtenay. It is unfortunate that such a subtle actor was swept by a flood of distortion to appear in such a washout. When this film was made, Poseidon had to turn, in his water grave, in a sea of ​​shame. And Shelley Winters again gets up from the dead (directly from Poseidon) to chase anyone who dares to see this pathetic film. This movie rated 1 out of 10, but really deserves zero. This film will want to avoid or completely reverse the water. And he leaves a bad taste in his mouth. It may even want to see "Jaws" (1975), and make friends with the great white.
