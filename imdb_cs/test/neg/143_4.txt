I saw this movie on VHS some time ago (January 27, 2003), just because of Paul Rudd's name on the cover. I really liked his performance in "Object of My Affection" and I really expected a good job. But I found this film as a complete mess. The story has a very confused scenario and the characters aren't well developed. In addition, low budget special effects do not help much. I do not know the previous generation of policemen, but this next generation is not good. I don't remember exactly why I gave this degree (and I do not intend to see this movie again), but my voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name '(`Gen-Y Cops Next Generation')
