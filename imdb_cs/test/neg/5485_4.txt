This is my first film, Almodavar. I admit that we chose it mainly because we knew it had the tempting prospects of Antonio Banderas in homosexual sex scenes. I consider myself to be a relatively sophisticated viewer, I like European films, "art" films, and generally I can recognize a quality film, even if it is not in my special tastes. But this movie was completely empty for me. The story was ridiculous, the characters were lifeless, the box was called a "merry comedy," but once I wasn't allowed to laugh. Loosly and awkwardly designed, with lots of unnecessary dialogue. I don't get it at all - it looks like an amateur effort. Can anyone enlighten me?
