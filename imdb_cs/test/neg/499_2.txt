You have to acknowledge the contribution of Cimino to the cinema. He gave us both the most revised film in history (Deer Hunter) and the worst film in history (The Gate of Heaven). And before you start with 'It's bad, but not the worst ever', let me explain. For more than twenty years, I've been listening to criticism and avoiding the "heavenly gate" - in fact, it wasn't difficult because you barely bombarded the opportunity to view this movie. Then a few days after I saw the documentary "Final Cut: Making and Unmaking of Heaven's Gate", I came across a $ 9,99 DVD long version. My advice at 229 minutes is to find the most negative rating ever written about this movie (you will find a wide selection), and imagine that Cimin's devoted mother is a reviewer and that she does everything in her power to positively influence her film dear son. Then you'll have an idea of ​​how big Cimino is. While there is almost everything wrong with this film, which ultimately means that the scale is even worse (and less classic) a zero "example" is its blatant distortion of history. Although the cattlemen association sent a group of regulators / gunmen to Johnson County and made a list of target names, the actual facts of interesting historical events are hopelessly exaggerated. In the morning of April 9, 1892, Nick Ray and Nate Champion were surrounded and eventually killed by an army of about 50 cattlemen and Texas rented weapons who came to Johnson County to clean up the beasts. Citizens then besieged regulators who were finally arrested (or rescued) by the army. Women were not actively involved in the fighting, and there were minimal losses except Ray and Champion. After all, these were sieges not attacks - and there weren't immigrant wagons to ride in circles around camp regulations (early westerns on the contrary it was a movie device and not a real Indians tactic). And weeks before the advent of regulators, several Johnson County residents were hanged without trial, including Jim Averell, a modest road ranch keeper, and his wife Ella Watson (who will resurrect Cimino as his two leaders and even show he lives Averell's mature age). There is no film sin greater than fictional history, if you are going to play quickly and freely with historical facts, then change names and places to protect unsuspecting members of the audience who might leave. the film believing what they saw actually happened. Fortunately, so few people saw this movie that the damage was minimal. Perhaps it is cruel to blame Cimin for his distortion of history. He could probably escape the guilt of madness - the film provides enough support. If Cimino was going mad when spreading the Heavenly Gate, he would explain a lot of things. But my voice goes to "lack of talent management" instead of madness. There are good things on the heavenly gate. You can actually see on the screen where some of the huge budget went; expensive sets-beautiful epic camera footage-artful dance sequence. Isabelle Huppert (a strange choice of casting that actually worked) gives a pleasant and sympathetic performance, although most of her scenes are very boring (when a director forgets to give a viewer a reason to care for characters). In general, dialogue is solid if it is common. However, they do not fall into the bullshit that this film experiments with narration by mixing the moments of character interaction with the textured outbursts of communist action. That means there was a method to crazy Cimino. "Experiments" is another word when the filmmaker is so lost in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible. A simple fact is that there is no evidence of Cimino's storyboarded one scene or made any attempt at control or organization. It looks like he just turned DP on the scene and got an endless selection of color shots - 1.5 million feet of freely staged scenes. Then he tried (without success) to compare it and put it in post-production. The final battle scene is truly cheerful because babushka wears women in towns (maybe borrowing from Fiddler On the Roof a travel company) suits countless bars of dynamite on regulators. Unfortunately, every explosive falls short of target and explodes harmlessly. After seeing it happen 50-60 times, you can relate to a woman (the one who looks like something from the "Grapes of Wrath") who puts a huge weapon in it and pulls the trigger. This is probably what Cim's mother did after writing this review. So believe what you have heard about this movie since 1980. It is a sloppy, disconnected, poorly stimulated and historically distorted mess. Values ​​only as a "no-film" for film historians and as a source of amusement for those who have knowledge of the true history of the American West.
