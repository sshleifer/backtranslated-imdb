What if someone made a horror movie that was totally free of a plot? Well, I guess it might end up a bit like this. I don't think I've ever seen a move that is so stable that his slip from hackney (at the beginning) has finished the crap (to the end). I just got stuck with it because I still thought it couldn't get any worse. Well, to the very end, "Necrophagus" / "Cemetery of Horror" has shown me wrong. Who would suspect that a film with an undead lizard-man, evil graves, who robs cults, and crazy scientists who do not, could not suck the bad? You'd think there was at least some humorous value ... but not here.
