George Sluizer of Fame VANISHING (He made both a haunted European original and a Hollywood remake) directed by CRIMETIME. He shouldn't be blamed for this confused, bad movie because all the problems lie in the Brendan Somers script. It's poorly focused and lazy. For example, a killer hangs around a nightclub waiting to take a victim, a victim, and talk to a teenage girl. Cut to the next scene, telling the villain, "Did I tell you all about yourself, tell me about your life?" Unfortunately, the girl told a bad life story off the screen and is a terrible example of the screenwriter being unable to bring dialogue through dialogue. I know how bloody difficult it is, but for the scenario that is being produced, the writer should try harder. It's hard to explain the message of the film. On some points, it seems that the British NATURAL BORN KILLERS is a crime-stricken soyeurist (perhaps even influencing the infamous MANHUNT video game), but the script is not funny enough to not happen. If you have a sex scene that does not continue to conspiracy or characters or a hint of subtext, you know that you have a poorly written script and CRIMETIME is a badly written script
