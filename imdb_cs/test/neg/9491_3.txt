I'd like to know the real name of the Lodge where the scenes from the movie were filmed. It's really beautiful and hearkens back to 20 and 30's architecture like Hotel Del Coronado. I know it was either on the Big Bear Lake or Arrowhead Lake and I'd like to hear if it's still in existence. As for the film itself, it is really amazing that Jane Wyman was even nominated for an Oscar. That must have been a time when her college colleagues liked her. It would be really interesting if Wyman and the other actors in the film were really impressed with the script. The film's screenplay, as well as Kevin Costner's recent movie-in-bottle movie, is so incredible that it limits the credibility that actors can bring to their parts. Rock Hudson can be forgiven. He has never been a great actor, was able to get mostly on his appearance and did not get credible roles until later in his career (Pretty Maids is the exception). But Wyman had to be forced to take this film through contractual requirements or a studio system.
