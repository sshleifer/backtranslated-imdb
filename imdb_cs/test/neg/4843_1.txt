Sure, you can see some goats, but if it's all you're looking for in the movie, you'll get more miles from youtube. I just paid a dollar from the redbox because I saw the name of Val Kilmer. Bad move. The fence wasn't thick, the dialogue was delicate, the characters at best undeveloped. Someone said cinematography is fine, but don't expect too much. This film moved very slowly and ended without mercy. Black list. I spent a lot of film wondering if an event or color scheme of things was symbolic. I never really came back to find out because nothing was ever explained at the end. No twists. It also left many questions that as it turns out, I didn't have the desire to hear the answered. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
