Hahahahah Probably one of the most fun movies I've ever seen. Of course, this is not intentional. It takes about half of the film for the main character to realize what a big hilly thing is in the center of the city is spewing hot red things, and the other half spent redirecting the river flow through the city using fire trucks (yer right). I'm sure it made me laugh. Arnie looks like Arnie looks like an RSC. It's amazing that movies like this are ordered. A more interesting version would be someone who would move close to an active volcano and shoot, and probably cost about Â£ 20. ($ 40) I see a guy filming a movie in a film company "this big VOLCANO is good and explodes in CITY .... pretty radical hey" If you can find it in dollar baskets, maybe it's worth buying Watching this movie would look like good.
