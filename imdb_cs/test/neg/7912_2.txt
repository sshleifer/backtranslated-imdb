After watching all the Star Trek TV series episodes many times since the 1960s, most of them are pretty good, and very few of them are average, my opinion is that this is the worst of all. In fact, I think it's so badly done that it's embarrassing in the series. It's not that the story is so bad, although it's not exceptional in any way, but acting is simply absurd from the side of two leading characters, which means different than regular in this case. Barbara Anderson gives her the weakest performance as the daughter of a mass murderer and is on a mission of its kind. He practically calls a role from the phone and shows no emotional abilities. Although in most of her film and television roles she is usually not used as more than a pretty face, it is usually small, but much better. Arnold Moss as father gives a new meaning to the term 'Ham' and is the only actor ever on the 1960s Star Trek episode that outperformed William Shatner in the area, and actually makes Shatner look excellent in comparison. And he gets into the game of Shakespeare's actor no less, which gives him more incentive to overload, and does so. In addition to these two leaders, it's so weak that the story is that anyone who makes any sense can even tell who the murderer is in the first 15 minutes. I say this because I told my brother the whole plot that ended on the first commercial break when we watched the original 1966 broadcast as preschoolers. His answer was: Yeah, you're right. Skip this and watch the much better episodes of the menageries that were originally aired earlier.
