Two years after filming this movie, "The Juror" was released. Don't waste your time on this. Instead, see "Juror". "The Juror" is basically the same story as "Trial By Jury", with better performance, better direction and a much more appealing aura. William Hurt was not believable as a cop-off-bad, and Armand Assante couldn't be more unlike the crowd boss if they put him on clown clothes. You didn't care enough about Joanna Whalley's character that it was upsetting what was happening to her. Also, the way she worked with the jury was neither convincing nor interesting. The role of Kathleen Quinlan as a hooker / killer was not fanciful and, quite frankly, it was not necessary for this conspiracy.
