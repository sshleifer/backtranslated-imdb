Despite having a very nice lady (Rosita Arenas, one of my boys' crunches), acting and directing examples are examples of what she can't do while shooting a movie. Locations in southern Mexico, Popoca, Aztec's mother (by the way, real Aztecs, DID did not make a mummy) were awakened by leading figures and started making trouble in the suburbs of Mexico City during the first movie (Aztec's Mum). In this second part, a leading man and woman want to find a mummy and place it in their last resting place (the fireplace would be my first choice ...) <br /> <br /> The Bat, the criminal master-mindless the stereotype of a criminal genius who creates a "human robot" (some idiot inside a SUIT robot) that controls Popoca and (that is) to take over the world. The last game between the robot and the mummy is hilarious, some of the worst choreographies ever witnessed. The funniest thing is that this film was made and released by a serious Mexican film studio! Acting is the same horrible hearing of a movie in Spanish as it is in English (dubbed replay!). You should watch this movie through MST: 3000. The comments are even more fun.
