I have as much testosterone as my next boy and Raquel Welch in her best form is definitely worth a look; But the fact is that cardboard cutouts could work better and the hour and a half of Miss W, who shows off her considerable assets, is not a movie. Given the cast, it's surprising that it's as bad as it is. I've never been a big fan of Wagner and his tough guy, Harry, is as convincing as a 9-dollar bill. Godfrey Cambridge and Vittorio de Sica, both of whom I usually enjoy, seem to sleep through their lines; and as far as Edward G ... well, I can only assume he was behind the pay slip. This film is a mess: from a non-existent plot, through a stop-start event, and an unfair script of a child slapstick and annoying 60's 'caper' music. If it wasn't for Miss Welch, I'd give her 0. <br /> <br /> She said it was a treatment for the eyes - even better than her delicious portraits in "Bedazzled" - and the only reason I gave it was 3.
