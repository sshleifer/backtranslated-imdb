Adored by fans for his unusually charming creativity and Hollywood for his softball, user-friendly film-making techniques, Tim Burton tipped the weights too far in favor of wording with his new upset movie legend, Sleepy Hollow. After finding Ichabod Crane? played by Johnny Depp, bringing this vague movie is just a glowing point? In the heart of the mystery surrounding the seemingly random and horrific murder of the city by the legendary headless rider, the story unfolds as if he was deliberately trying to be completely predictable. Contrary to the bedtime story for children, the humdrum performance is characterized by intended exciting inscrutable scenes of persecution that, together with undeveloped characters fleeing for their lives, produce as much fear and excitement as a nightmare before Christmas. Throw in an endless bundle of old trees for the environment and wide-eyed, big-busted blonde love interest (Christina Reechi) and Burton has himself a movie that takes the age-old legend of Sleepy Hollow and managed to do it as a Disney movie without magic or passion. The dialogue was disheveled and ridiculous, the separated heads were sufficient, and there was plenty of conspiracy to reveal monologues that would embarrass James Bond. Even with the support of Emmanuel Lubezki, the most sought-after cameraman in Hollywood, the amazing acting Depp and Burton's staggering name, Sleepy Hollow has nothing to lose.
