The overall story, though quite graphic, is really decent and reasonably interesting for the reader. But the film was terrible. The story was good, but acting was terrible. I was crying all the time because I knew I could never get back. You don't see this movie. If you do, take a bullet pistol into it and several rounds if you go with your friends. I'm sorry for anyone who has something to do with this movie. I'm also sorry for anyone who had to watch the movie. Avoid this movie at all costs, and if your mother makes you watch, kill her. Hahahahaha! See! I'm now psycho !!!! IKWTCBS turned me into a psycho !!!!
