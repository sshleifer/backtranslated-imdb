this show just pisses off. I don't think I have to say it or why, because judging by the number of comments I just repeat everything. The keys to VIP is like turning on the TV and having a poo throw at you. This is exactly what it is like I do not exaggerate a little bit. These guys are so stupid, not funny and not smooth with the ladies that it's not even funny what's stupid. I sat in four episodes and wanted me to have two hours back. where they will find competitors because they are apparently inadequately mentally. If I was the man who came up with this idea of ​​the show and put it on TV, I would make the world a favor and jump from the tallest building I could find. how do garbage get on TV? especially a comic network wouldn't have a show on something called a comedy network, at least a comedy show or maybe so funny?
