This Fulci schlocker is a totally helpless mix with an incurable gambler (Brett Halsey) who decides that Bluebeard pays off to pay off his ever-growing debts by seducing some of the ugliest girls you watch and who they are. rich widows! The Fulci-written script also includes several black-comedic elements - which results in just an unfair trade involving a corpse that is not left, a victim of an opera singer who does not stop singing, etc. - not to mention the doppelganger theme directly from the PRAGUE STUDENT - although in this case two people communicate via pre-recorded radio messages !! Finally, I am not surprised that this film shows no sign of the sophistication of HATCHET by Mario Bava PRO HONEYMOON (1970), which resembles a number of ways and is satisfied with the mere accumulation of disgustingly bloody (but not very convincing) effects of torn limbs and crushed or the molten faces with which Fulci then became completely connected.
