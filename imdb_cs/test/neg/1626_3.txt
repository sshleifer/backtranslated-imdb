This movie has some of the worst production values ​​and adjustments I've ever seen. There are several examples of actors who are silent and try to remember their lines, actors who go before the actors who speak, and one place where the film skips seven shots. Not to mention that the heroine gets into her chest, but begins to limp! And what about a secret passage that is well lit and in the open. Grapes. The plot is non-existent, something to do with the primitive nuclear bomb and the ending of the Earth and some war war. Ator pulls out the hang glider at the deepest point of the film. Dialogue is stupid and contains such gems as "It's all and nothing." and "I feel it here." The film is a mess, confused, crazy mess. Ator is an unreal hero, sword fighting is absurd and the plot conspires slowly. All in all, it's a movie you have to avoid.
