"The Bone Snatcher" starts very hopefully, with the introduction of a new and original type of invisible evil, as well as the use of the freely isolated film location of the African Desert. While checking the pipes in the desert, the three miners are attacked and killed by a seemingly non-free creature that absorbs their body and leaves only a heap of half of the bones eaten. The expedition crew who sent them to rescue finds that the monster is a superior queen and will soon be trapped in a mysterious desert. Director Jason Wulfsohn maintains a respectable level of tension until the nature of the monster is identified. Immediately after that, the film quickly turns into an ordinary creative feature, with all the characters who fail to survive one by one. The other half of "The Bone Snatcher" is extremely boring; with inevitable love clich√©s and complete absence of cruel murders. All characters are unbearable stereotypes that work and say exactly what you predict a few minutes in advance. Is there a newcomer who has to prove himself, a woman with a brain capacity, in addition to her hot appearance, an unpleasant, experienced guy who will redeem himself at the end with self-sacrifice and? last but not least ?? who might forget a wise black man who refers to a monster using all kinds of voodoo names. Wulfsohn is trying too hard to make his monster look like the "Alien" and "Predator" space threats. The ant has infrared vision and breaks up when it shoots, yawns! In fact, the film only benefits from its unique environment and a handful of ugly images of decomposed bodies. It could be a modest gem, but instead it is less than average. Avoid.
