The director is as sweet as his director Shira Geffen, but their film is angry. She has her moments (and some pretty girls), but there are too many: "Amelia" meets "Pauline on the beach". You're leaving, you want to know more about a wedding photographer and a girl who likes it when nothing happens, be it in movies or in real life. Instead, you get a suicide writer, a neurotic actress and an illegal immigrant-social worker with a heart of gold. It is as if more than one truly touching story hides in the script, but at face value it is a cargo of wasted storylines and sentimental bullshit. Hard to sit as it is.
