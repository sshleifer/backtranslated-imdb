If you've ever listened to any of James Lee Burke's tape or CD books, and Will Patton's reader, you can agree with me that Will is the epitome of Dave R. Tommy Lee Jones is native Texan (or so heard) and nobody draws texan better IMHO but not Cajun. His birth is bad. I have lived in the state for several years and I still hear the strange patois that the Louisiana accent contains. TLJ has nothing like that. I thought Marry Steenbergen was a good choice for Bootsy, but I missed Cletus (who will be cast in this role? Rock? Mickey Rourke? will have to be big). Overall, I thought the movie was just 4 - a flop plot around like a fish out of the water and had no normal interesting but non-linear continuity that the book usually has. Hopefully Hollywood will try another JLB book, "The Last Car at Elysican Fields" would be a good choice. We should see some of the best villains of JLB.
