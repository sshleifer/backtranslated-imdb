This movie was terrible. He focused too much on Eddie, Clark Griswald's brother-in-law. Eddie works a lot better by changing good pieces like "Christmas Holiday" and "Holiday". I really don't understand how a movie like this would give a thumb up. Now don't get me wrong, I like Randy Quaid, but I felt that this film was totally wrong for him and his character. This movie leaves much to be desired and really needed some bigger name of the actors.
