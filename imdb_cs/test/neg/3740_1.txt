I honestly can't understand why people love this show so much. My friend is watching it and because I like science fiction, I tried to watch because the storyline was promising, but in reality it is a very boring show. The only thing that keeps you awake during this show is the CGI video game effects and the full use of muppets. Note that I call it muppets because they really look like muppets, not aliens who should be. Speaking of it; muppets and makeup effects are severely overused in this show. You have the guy who can best be described as an alien / dwarf-hybrid, you have a pale girl who looks like a cheesy vampire girl, you have a floating frog-alien ... superfluous, and to the point that you feel distracted from the whole story about lost astronaut. <br /> <br /> Each episode is also too separate. The creators of this show directed it so that every episode almost felt like a whole other show. At least until you see the main characters / muppets again, that's it. The whole plot about the main character, who is returning to Earth, is the way to the points that come into the background. Acting is also quite bad. Conclusion: If you want a good science fiction, look somewhere else. This is not, in my opinion, a real science fiction, because the show is more focused on fantasy elements with all puppetry and strange dreams. And if you want to see the muppets, then I suggest you check out the Muppet Show and feel happy that this show's abomination is over. <br /> <br /> By the way; does anyone have a story with a living spacecraft? Ohyeah that's right; Doctor Who started this concept almost 30 years ago! This show is like a collection of 'sci-fi' remnants. Scripts and events that have been abandoned for good reason to be captured by this horrible show.
