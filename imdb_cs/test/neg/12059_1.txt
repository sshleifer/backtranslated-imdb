Camp Blood is a totally awful film of slasher. We mix Friday the 13th with the Blair Witch Project and add .... the killer in the clown mask. The budget for this movie had to be very low, some actors played more parts and the used camera created an image that is the same as the color version of the original Night Of The Living Dead, which if anyone saw that it will return me that it is bad. This movie was just so bad. There is nothing worth watching in the movie. The fact that I watched it all the time stunned me. Just take my advice and don't buy or rent this movie. It's scary.
