Whether the prevailing social message of this film - that fair justice is acceptable - is justifiable, I was more offended by McConaughey's final statement. In the courtroom drama, the defense attorney's final statement is largely at the heart of the film, and when the problem is so difficult to resolve, like this, the statement is actually delivered to the audience and jury. This basically means that viewers consider the rape of a white girl to be a more horrible crime than the rape of a black girl. Even for one it is very offensive. As for the others, I found it reasonable, except for Sandra Bullock, who seems to be playing her usual temperamental self (in fact not working in the courtroom), but what is the moment when the film message is as poor as this one. He tells you that the vigilance of justice is fine and accuses you of racism if you disagree.
