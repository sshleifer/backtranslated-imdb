The "Open Graves" plot is very simple: it's about a board game called Mamba, where players die in real life the same way they die in the game. The death scenes involved are killing through computer generated crabs and snakes. cardboard and deliberately annoying and there is not even a small bit of tension. I liked Eliza Dushku in the "Wrong Turn" but she is absolutely unnecessary and unmemorable here.The top with the CGI-witch from the sea is absolutely laughing and stupid. The only reason to see "Open Graves" are some interesting camera angles plus sexy Eliza Dushku. \ TIf such movies are the future of horror then I seriously put up. \ TGive me 70 or 80's low budget horror flick over this modern piece of Generous 3 out of 10.
