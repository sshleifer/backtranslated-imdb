Puzzle as a concept is an interesting idea, but I'm afraid it's wrong, Vinnie, if Hardman's role is like Lock Stock and Snatch. In this movie Vinnie plays a journalist sports writer (greyhounds being exact), who during the course of the film is easily defeated with ease and tied over a balcony by a man who 10-15 years his senior. I'm sorry, Vinnie is tough, hard and has him so stupid. Trying to explore the double murder of a friend and drug addict located near the Thames. He is a policeman, while real police is the role of Charles Dickens' flashbacks. When Vinnie is on the screen, his reputation precedes him that he looks tough, but he's not. the part needs to act hard, growling at the camera in parts. If you look at the Mean Machine, it is perfectly cast and believable and makes a very decent performance. Returning back to a movie that confuses things somewhat confusingly is a memory of Charles Dickens, who tells a different story with characters who are also appearing today, these two stories seem unrelated except they use the same actors. The sound on the film, especially from Julie Cox, is sometimes inaudible, and not as much as her role in the film is not interested in Vinnies Love, but the movie starts as Detecive, but quickly becomes a friend. The death of a prostitute is somehow answered but not answered. Pluck up Charles Dickens's stuff and maybe you'll have a decent movie. Vinnie is slowly becoming Britain's Steven Segal, sticking to the role of supporting the actor, you're pretty good at that.
