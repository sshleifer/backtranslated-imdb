A while ago, while browsing Netflix, I came across this DVD and decided to do it with such an impressive cast. I've never seen a movie that would try to be a new version of an existing great movie (Scarface) and failure so spectacularly. The main problem seems to be a complete misunderstanding of what the story should be. In Scarface, Tony Montana was a self-styled "evil man". His magnificent rise and eventual fall was not sad, it was a big (and only logical end) for someone who lived such a life. Damian Chapa, director, writer and main actor, sees Kilo as a hero or at least a complicated guy. However, it does not want to do grunt work that would create a realistic, likable character. He was brought up by a white mother, except for six months of his childhood, where his father, a gangster himself, showed him his life. For reasons that were never fully explained or even mentioned, he decided to want to be a drug dealer and actually goes to the wrong part of the city, approaching two dealers and saying, "Hey, I'd like to buy some drugs." He leaves his father's name and is not just rich at any time, but the two boys who supply him are willing to act for reasons that are never explained. Chap wants you to feel bad when his character is sentenced to imprisonment when a police informant lies about him. However, since he had done a lot of drugs before, why should one feel compassion for going to jail this time? The most obvious case of Chapa, who wanted to be a good boy, is his prison execution, White Supremacist / Rapist, played by Gary Busey. In Scarface, Tony Montana kills someone in jail because he has pretty much to promote himself, he's done, he's moving on. In this case, however, they must force Busey to not just become a bully / pedophile but also a White racist. A little overkill, don't you think? I will not deal too much in this regard, but their desperate message "PLEASE LIKE ME! I COMPLICED GANGSTER! ‚ÄùFailure at each level. Try as they could, I did not feel bad, in conflict or compassionate when his friends were killed (after a gunfight), his wife is also killed (shortly after he called him a miserable father and during an escape attempt) decided he would be fine to go next to a car filled with gunmen while his wife was in the car) and his eventual demise. Suffice it to say that his performances can be quite summed up as miserable, his only success bringing the term "wooden" to stellar new heights. Busey should be credited for putting effort into his ridiculous role. Tiny Lister did well. Stacy Keach plays his guardian from the role of Prison Break. Robert Wagner sets out on a paycheck. Faye Dunaway, while the touch dramatic, still changes in performance better than this film deserves. Brad Dourif is in the movie for about two minutes and does what he can. And to grant a film credit, it makes one-up Scarface in one direction - Jennifer Tilly now holds the title of "the most sensible attempt on hispanic accent." (Sorry Robert Loggia.) In short, this film had an interesting assumption, but a bad story arc, unsympathetic characters, and hit-miss-miss shows. I would like to advise Mr. Chap to get rid of his forced sympathy next time - in fact we do not like your character, we must be interested. Better luck next time.
