When you see Barry Corbin in casting a movie, you can never be sure it will be classic or garbage. Guess which SOLO category it belongs to. Obviously derived from the popular sci-fi novel WEAPON, SOLO plays Mario Van Peebles as a human-looking robot who decides to think of himself and is focused on removal. Hiding in a Mexican village, it is obviously saving money in places and above standard. I think paying in pesos is cheaper than paying in dollars. William Sadler is on his way, as one of the robots and soldiers sent to destroy Van Peebles. Of course, Van Peebles can easily defeat them all, while Corbin watches them all at a distance. The film is a terrible ripoff of The TERMINATOR and CYBORG series and seems to have little to do with its source material. It's terribly written and acted, and a big fight at the end if downright comical. Van Peebles, a decent actor elsewhere, is screaming when he pretends to be a robot covered with a synthetic body. It seems that Robot Dance is doing most of the time.
