Despite a small handful of nicely done scenes, this record (fourth) feels tired. Toshiharu Ikeda, who directed the excellent MERMAID LEGEND and the semi-final Japanese film, EVIL DEAD TRAP, shows little enthusiasm for a musty premise. Poorly becoming obsessed with a conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in porn photography. Predictable persecution, harassment, assault and rape follows. Crucial Roman Porn is Sex. And sex mixed with violence. Both potentially exciting themes, but certainly not, but not when there is so little effort to be fresh. The masturbation scene, in which a woman pulls pencils into her opening (through a condom), is too small to get lost late. The rain rain theme continues and the last scene of the film brings relief.
