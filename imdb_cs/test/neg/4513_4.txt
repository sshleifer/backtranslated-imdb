As a devotee of Mrs Frank, I remember being so excited that the game was ready for television again. That is, until I saw it ... This film is a prime example of how casting is important and how directing plays an important role in creating a sense of meaning. Casting any CENTRAL role is CRUCIAL to produce this kind of ... show like AUNTIE MAME and MAN OF LA MANCHA are totally dependent on the lead actor's charisma. And in casting this film, the whole thing is destroyed by the cruel casting of Melissa Gilbert into the lead role. There is no ONE SIMPLE TORQUE that Mrs. Gilbert would even come to occupy the sensitive, mature Anna - Mrs. Gilbert is "white bread" throughout the film. of Anne's most prestigious line: "I still believe, despite the fact that people are truly good at heart" - that is what Mrs Gilbert says, who is so rushed that she does not believe she can break well and achieve the same goal. effect. The film and dance legend Marge Champion was a dialogue coach for this production - she was to pay her back! Although Mrs. Gilbert destroys DIARY, other appearances are satisfactory for most specialty Joan Plowright as Edith, Scott Jacoby as Peter and Clive Reville as Mr. Dussell. Maxmillian Schell does not have a deep-rooted soul and spirit, like Otto, as the creator of the stage and film role (Joseph Schildkraut), but he is fine. Doris Roberts and James Coco as Van Dann are quite superficial in their parts - they are exuberant and bombastic, but only on the surface. This could be due to the fact that the stimulation of the project is too rushed (as mentioned in previous posts) - this film is 45 minutes shorter than the movie version - the difference due to the dramatic pause that seems necessary to promote the relevant MOOD for this story. This is not obligatory viewing, especially for young people who first learned about Anne Frank in the original movie version, or better yet, in TV production ANNE FRANK: TRUE STORY starring Ben Kingsley, which is the most interesting thing in the world. capturing the turning point and reality of Anne's situation she has ever recorded! Note: Especially scary is the fact that Melora Marshall, who plays Anna Margot's sister, is NOT included in the opening credits along with all the other members of The Secret Annex ... is featured in post-credits along with actors playing Miep and Mr. Kraler. If I were Mrs. Marshall, I would have wished it!
