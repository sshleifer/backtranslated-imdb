How bad was the remake of an almost Oscar-winning film?! MARTHY MARTHA is much better, has depth, subtlety and so on and above all: a beautiful and talented starring actress (Martina Gedeck). It's a joke and ugliness with a handsome Aaron and the whole atmosphere ... again a ridiculous effort from Hollywood. There is more and more remake and movies are full with programs .. Isn't there anyone who can create good and newly script? Or is it a security solution to make remake or movies of proven cartoon characters? Today, films are much less interesting. Oh yes: If you want to see a really good movie watch the original. Certainly worth it.
