*** Minor Plot Spoilery *** <br /> <br /> I have to admit, I have a soft spot for Wayne Crawford. I know little about him, but he seems to have a lot of enthusiasm to compensate for the lack of talent. In his films, he usually performs multi-tasks - perm any 3 from a leading man, director, producer and scriptwriter - solving the storyline from the underground. Despite the fact that the end product is usually a fun pastime for non-discrimination. 'The Evil Under' features Crawford as a down-on-his-luck Captain of a shabby charter boat, a bit like Bogart in 'To Have & Have Not' - the similarities between the films here, however. The story begins with an underwater scene with two divers looking for a wreck before being invaded by an invisible creature - a bit like the beginning of "Jaw 2". The wreck turns out to be "El Diablo," which had fallen a few centuries earlier. The ship was occupied by heretical priests on the run from Spain, with the cargo of the stolen church. This allows for the introduction of different links to supernatural powers with Lucifer and Armageddon as they both look inward. The film's title refers to this sunken Devil-ship, rather than to any malevolent sea creature. <br /> <br /> Any film bugs (and many of them) is fun to watch and produce. You can't help but, as a film, copy the famous beach scene in 'From Here to Eternity' and the final line from 'Casablanca' in the last 5 minutes.
