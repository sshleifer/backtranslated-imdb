I just watched this movie just because Sarah & I also give these 4 stars just because of it, on the other hand This movie was easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Theacting was terrible. The script was uninspired. That was a movie he contradicted himself. The film was sloppy and unoriginal. it's not like I expect a good movie. Just something that gives me a jump or two. He didn't do that. The worst thing is that the more I think about the overall plot, the less senses it actually does and the more holes we have. The real shame really, as I'm pretty sure there was a good idea lurking there somewhere ... <br /> <br /> I'm maybe a little rough giving a 4/10 movie, but due to the actors involved, and Again, the apparent talent of SARA's talent, this film really had to bring much more.
