If you only want gore and nothing but gore and torture, you have the right movie. If you want a bit of good acting, logic, story, consistency, or even a good guy ending up, go somewhere else. are these people mentally challenged? "Example: after the main character has been persecuted and other disfigured animals have been seen, she meets a policeman and sends her story to the police with tears and everything and tells him about a psychopath who rides in a yellow car. The yellow truck rises and the officer only so she goes in, talks to a guy and the truck leaves without a problem, and the actress comes out and says why you didn't arrest him, and then he drives the truck over the police officer ... after being hit, the truck stops on the road for about 20 feet, just standing there While the actress is trying to pull the cop off, but he's too heavy. (At that time) At that time the truck backs up and runs twice over the shelf, then the truck leaves.Why did the actress not get the gun behind me. the psychopath had to burn alive) Once with the mouth that did not kill him (Duuuumb) and twice completed the job. * Roll eyes * Immediately after Eyes gone to escape from the bathroom, which is about to explode, and when it rises near the roof, turns around and the cop is no longer there ... OK ... <br /> <br /> Another example: The main actress meets the trapped in the bathroom woman spits out like a gallon of blood on the floor and covers about 1/3 of the room. (Probably more) After the main actress goes out to take a towel, she returns and everything is gone. : / They do not explain why everyone is still disappearing. Stupid stupid stupid. I like horror / thriller / gore movies, but this was too stupid. I lost brain cells that follow this dribling and you shouldn't too.
