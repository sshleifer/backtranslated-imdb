Okay, I'm really into King's stuff, but this is just awful. the whole movie, waiting for the main character to do something deep with his new youth and power. I can tolerate the worst of the movies because anything is better than watching a cut movie with ads in it. but this will take a cake. I gave it 2, and I would never recommend it to anyone.
