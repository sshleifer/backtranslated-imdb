If you liked Grinch's film ... go look again, because it was not close to a good translation of the Seoul film. Mike Myers' Cat is probably the most annoying character of "grace" screen recently. His voice / accent is horrible and he laughs at his own jokes with the fearsome sound that is about the only laugh I have heard in the theater. Even the children didn't like it and the children are laughing now. Save your money and go see Looney Tunes: Back in action if you're really looking for a fun recreational family movie.
