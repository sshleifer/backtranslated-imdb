I do not know if I should be amused or offended by a drivel like that, which gave "Life: Television for Women" It should be renamed "Lifetime: Television to shut down in drama" because I have not yet seen a movie that was not a tear boiler. This film was no exception. You know the film will be bad when Tori Spelling is the biggest headliner, completely creating bad plastic surgery and spoiled privilege minus any real talent. Everyone else answered her in an incredibly bad acting and the story was stupid, as if someone could believe it. If I weren't helpless on the couch, if I had the same fascination, I'd see a murderous wreck of a car I'd change.
