While the dog was cute, the movie wasn't. It was neither a prerequisite nor a topic that was a problem. Space had great opportunities for humor and pathos. The theme is good. Helping other people is more important than accumulating wealth. Sadly, an adorable dog, a unique premise and a theme, was subdued by poor acting, dialogue, and amateur filming. Even my youngest child, who will sit almost anything, surrendered before we got half. How many times can the dog run up and down the same corridor? I can't spoil it because I never saw the end. It's just not worth watching all the way to the end.
