I watched this movie or part of it, hoping it would be fun to laugh as it was, but soon it turned out to be just stupid. For one you have the worst EVER action! The leading "actress" Birgitte Nielsen is terrible, uninspired and hardly attractive. And he certainly doesn't look like a female warrior who could easily kick some veteran warriors, but he does. And with the feminist attitude, it is simple hypocrisy. Her family was killed by women, then joined a war school, or so she could learn to fight men. She then joins the fat servant and his child king, whose city was destroyed by Gedren. These two characters are simple stupid and destroy the little atmosphere that the film could create. After this I could not take more Nielsen painful acting, and stupid clich√© and lack of any real action. Schwarzenegger as Kalidor was the only part of this movie that actually did it remotely watching. <br /> <br /> I like Conan, but this is pure crap!
