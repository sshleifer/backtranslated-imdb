I'm not sure what it is, but it seems to be a curse when it comes to movies about the elusive Bigfoot. So far, there has not been a film that would intelligently approach this subject, nor one that would create some real tension. Both "Legend of Boggy Creek" (1972) and the first film, "Sasquatch" (1978), have become smaller cult classics, but none of them have been unforgettable. Both films were aimed at a family-friendly audience, making it impossible to really scare anyone. "Harry and Hendersons" (1987) was the first large budgeted film to use Bigfoot, with the amazing creation of the creation by Rick Baker. However, they also decided to focus on the younger audience, but this time as a comedy (as did "Bigfoot" in 1995). I waited a long time for someone to deal with a theme like a thriller, maybe in the vein of "Jaws" or "Predator." When I saw it in my local video store, I thought my dream came true. Boy, I was wrong! Lance Henriksen plays a billionaire who runs an expedition to the Pacific Northwest in the hope of finding her daughter when she was aboard a small plane as she hit the mountains. The assumption is interesting and promising. The truth is, it never creates any real tension. I have never been interested in any of the characters at all, because each of them was very two-dimensional and somewhat bland. Henriksen always seems to be calling in his speech. Every time she appears on the screen, she looks boring. He should be, because we can't talk about the first hour of the movie. As for creation, where do I start? At least I thought we would have a nice looking monster in the woods, but instead we get that bald man (yes, I said "bald!") A man with black skin on the playground and fur spots back and forth. Picture a cross between the "Swamp Thing" and Chaka from the "Land of the Lost" and you get the idea. Nothing like artwork on a cover box assures you. Sloppy editing and careless direction also adds to the confusion as half of the time everything seemed out of sequence, while the other half of the film was continuously used with these long, slow fade outs (which made no sense or served any purpose). They even stole the whole infrared vision of P.O.V from the creature in the "Predator" that looked too stupid and in place to be effective. Maybe all this proves that Hollywood should forget that he should do Bigfoot movies because he has to do the one that works. So far, each of them was just as scary as the episode "In Search Of" 3/10
