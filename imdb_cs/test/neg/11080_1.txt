Sometimes you ignore the little voice in your head that says you stay away from this movie. We should all pay more attention to this little voice. This may be the worst movie I've ever had when I haven't met, or it may be the best reason to remember that your DVD player has a fast forward button. Made on a budget somewhere close to $ 1.99, "The Cavern" is apparently a fast-paced delicacy on the back of a current bunch of creepy cave-lots of dark-claustrophobic spelunkers-unknown threats flick like "Cave" and "Descent". A few years ago, a similar shot of a similar film appeared, using naval ships instead of caves. They all had scary ships / submarines - lots of darkness of claustrophobic adventurers - unknown threats ... of the same old. "The Cavern" is really a "Blair Witch Project" only this time we're lost underground and not lost on top of it. Throw a flashlight with faulty batteries, a cow skull with fangs stuck to it on the monster, and one of the dullest "twist" climax ever filmed. I'd tell you to listen to me, a little voice in your head. I'm your friend. I want you to have a happy life. Stay away from this movie.
