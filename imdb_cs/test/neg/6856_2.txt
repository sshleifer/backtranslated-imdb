Lame is really the best way to describe this movie. He has a really bad script, an uninteresting dialogue and characters and he basically misses everything else. <br /> <br /> There are too many characters and the problem is that you don't care about them. What is missing is one good and clear main character. Instead, the film has a little bit of everything, it has a bit of a hero, a little love interest and a bit of a villain. I wish it had a little less Ghoulies, though in this movie they are mostly mostly uncomfortable. Ghoulies should be devil creatures who murder for pleasure. But in this movie all they want to do is drink beer and watch naked college girls. Besides, someone had a "great" idea to let Ghouliesi talk this time. It works really badly and uncomfortably. Ghoul's puppets have been definitely improved for this film and are more detailed looking and able to do more, but at the same time they are more fake than those of previous Ghoulies movies. Obviously, this time the aim of this movie was comedy rather than horror. The film is like Lame '80's Comedy High School (even though this film got in 1991). It's a humor that is really the worst and dumbest thing about the whole movie. It's so incredibly annoying and just not funny at all. The story gets nowhere with his story and the film is basically one big mess that never ends. The plot ghoulies line basically have nothing to do at all with the other plot lines of the film, including human figures. The film is not about the fact that Ghouli√© terrorize college, people try to hunt them and stop their rampage. No big surprise, it's Brent Olson's only written film yet. He just has no talent for it, and I think he also discovered it and instead went back to college. This movie is just awful! <br /> <br /> 2/10
