This sequel "In the Heat of the Night" will suffer in inevitable comparisons with his infinitely better predecessor. Instead of looking like a television-adapted theater movie, "Mister Tibbs" looks suspiciously like a TV movie adapted for theatrical release, with grainy photography, cheery introductory titles and files that look like they're made of plywood. The murder sequence has a blatant continuity error: the camera shows two hands choking the girl, then the hand reaches for the statue, then the girl who choked again with two hands, and finally the statue descending down. deathblow. The solution to the case should be easy: find a single guy with three hands! But poor production values ​​cannot completely conceal the great merits of this film: specifically, the performance of Sidney Poitier as a great detective who has decided to follow the evidence wherever it may lead, even if it means a friend. Martin Landau is also convincing as a do-gooder preacher-activist suspected of brutally murdering his prostitute. In addition to being persecuted, Tibbs is in conflict with his home life, but the problems of racial and Tibetan barely hidden sense of social outrage are missing. So it's a complicated murder secret that made "In the Heat of the Night" so compelling.
