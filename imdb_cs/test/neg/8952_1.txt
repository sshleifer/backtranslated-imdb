This TV show is today the most patriotic showcase of crap on television. Terribly predictable, obscene use of slow photography, cheese story. Chuck Norris is an abomination that should never be allowed to be filmed in anything. The way he chooses each episode in a public announcement is really unpleasant. His acting acts are so bad that it makes one cringe in embarrassment. I'll give the series some credit though ... it occasionally entertains, but not enough to make any difference. With all the negative points that this series has, I still prefer it to the reality of TV, it can't really get more worthless than that.
