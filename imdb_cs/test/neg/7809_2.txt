Dreamy young Ashton Kutcher (like Tom Stansfield) wants a date with sexy blonde Tara Reid (like Lisa Taylor). Mrs. Reid thinks Mr. Kutcher is gay. Kutcher works for Father Reid, anal retention Terence Stamp (like Jack Taylor). Kutcher agrees to "houseit" for the boss, believing he gets closer to Reid. Mr. Stamp has a pet owl called "O.J.", which becomes a toilet coke head. <br /> <br /> This is a movie designed to make your limited to "G-rated" pre-teens ready for raunchier "R-rated" fare. It will help if they have not yet seen a conspiracy, and especially humor humor. Remember, people get paid to behave like that. David Zucker ~ Ashton Kutcher, Tara Reid, Terence Stamp (2003)
