A high school star falls dead after winning the race; Shortly thereafter, her older sister (Patch Mackenzie) returns home in time to notice that all her team members are disappearing. Who could be a killer? Maybe you don't care to find out. Rough, inexpensive, amateur slasher is almost totally worthless, although the top-billed Christopher George (as an ugly, hard trainer coach) tries to give him a lift with intense performance. Not even gore is worth mentioning. The whole thing is from beginning to end lame, starting with opening the film to a song that will consist of discography, and casting E.J. Peaker, once a co-star of the movie "Hello Dolly" as a character called "Blondie"! That's right, "Blondie". This may mean that we should not take the film seriously, but in any case it is shambles. It is a kind of routine slasher junk that makes "fifth-13" movies as art in comparison. The only interesting point of interest can be the effort to display Vanny White's film of all people on time. <br /> <br /> 2/10
