Stunning Blonde Natasha Henstridge is a young, not so sad widow at a hilltop and tells her story to a television reporter in Monroeville, Virginia. And among the courtesy community he is suspected of participating in the death of his older husband. That's James Brolin, trusting like a girl in her arms. Flashback teledrama made in Canada, based on an article that appeared in Vanity Fair magazine. That must be true! Whatever it is, it's much more romantic than a secret and a well-known story. Leggy generic star Henstridge as a gold digger nurse? It could happen, I think. And it's good to see Brolin in his big role after his deft turn in Antwone Fisher, even if he doesn't get to the end of the picture. At the end of the picture? He won't even get to the top of the picture. That's why flashbacks were invented.
