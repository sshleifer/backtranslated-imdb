The Angels of Hell have lost the losers in this film. Sonny told the director that NOBODY would do it to Angles and leave with him. His version was two guys to be shot books to death, but his suggestion was ignored. They were tilted down to even appear, becoming much less "technical advisors" in the smelly bomb of a movie like this. Hell's Angles on JAP Wheels? Come on! (though in Sonny's autobiography he says, "F $ K Harley Davidson!" and that if they were smart, they would be riding Hondas. (ST1100) Read his car ... he hates Harleys. The city on their sewing machine sounded on Japanese bikes, not too intimidating, because they would laugh out of town.
