The Garden State was at best an average movie. The film looks more like a compilation of thoughts that the writer (Zach Braff) had, rather than a coherent story. A discontinuous conspiracy could be more engaging if it was not scattered with nonsensical scenes that were nothing but "weird". Coincidentally, these scenes are often the ones that are transmitted in the conversation (Zack walked past faucets that turn on as he walks, crazy scene underfoot, screaming over the gorge, the list goes on). The main character is flat, unwavering, and ultimately unlikable, which is most exposed in the scene where he talks to his father, selfishly ignoring his fathers problems, including the recently deceased wife, and droning about his own "what do I do with my life? "The problem ends. <br /> <br /> The film ends when Andrew (Zach Braff) decides not to return to LA because he can't break away from the love of his life, Sam (Natalie Portman), whom he has known for two days. Which can only lead me to the conclusion that the message of the film is that love at first sight heals a working dilemma ... Sure you can interpret it as a misappropriation of priorities, but if it is, it could be better. This film does not know what it wants to be: drama, comedy, a film about teenage wilderness, or a lot of other things, I say it as a genre-oriented person, but as a person who loves multi-genre pieces like The reason why I think it doesn't work for Garden State is because rather than mixing genres together, it jumps around; one scene is one genre, the next one, and back again, so on. <br /> <br /> I've heard a lot People told me to rescue Zach Braff, but after all it was his first feature film and made his debut as director, writer and main actor. Impressive, because it was the first movie, I should think that with so much money he has, he could do better. There were much better first-director directors of the feature film (Michel Gondry "Human Nature", David Gordon Green "George Washington"). Perhaps if he kept writing OR directed OR, he would have acted better. Zach Braff is a talented artist, maybe his second attempt will not be so boring and incoherent.
