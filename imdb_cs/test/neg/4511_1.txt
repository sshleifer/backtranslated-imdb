This is really a re-make that should never get out of the stables. It has two castings that work in completely different layers. At the top of their game are Joan Plowright and Maximillian Schell. Every nuance of Franks is in sight. at the bottom of the rock are Melissa Gilbert and Doris Roberts. I can't imagine how Schell and Plowright play so well when Gilbert and Roberts work with their magic. Gilbert destroys every scene he is in. It's like Father Knows Best in the ghetto. It's Ann Frank. Her run to Helen Keller was thin, but not terrible. This is a sacrament. Doris Roberts just makes Mrs. Van Damm uncomfortable. It is a totally unsuitable choice to play a sex hungry woman whose flirtatious, dissatisfied presence has caused so many problems in het Acherhuis. That must have been a woman who could convince us that she had at least remembered what it was like to be sensual. Her weight is not a problem. Joan Plowright could play this part beautifully. Roberts was on a high career when it was done, getting a lot of press and many opportunities. Her performance here shows her weakness as an actress shamefully. James Coco and Clive Reville have most of their scenes with Gilbert and Roberts, and although they are strong, they are completely unable to destroy the partners' damage. Reville is a proficient actor capable of the kind of iconic performance that Ed Wynne gave in the original movie. He doesn't get any support from Gilbert. Drops the color from each scene. I read with horror the comments of those of you who grew up watching this version, filled with attachment to these performances. It is a lesson about how the version you see will be attached to you. It makes me reconsider my link to some of the worse products I loved in my childhood. I suggest you look at the original. It has very few weak spots and it's head and shoulders over this mess.
