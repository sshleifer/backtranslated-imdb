Beethovan Lives Upstairs is a very bad movie. In my World History class, our teacher watched us and Amadeus could compare both composers or something. At first we watched Amadeus and it was a very good movie, but when she followed us right after this movie, I couldn't believe what I saw. The acting was scary, the costumes were ugly (the little boy was especially ugly and girlish) and the cinematography was from-grade. My friend compared her to a home movie without showing the date in the bottom right corner. I understand it was a VV movie from Canada and it probably cost $ 10, but please, they could do it better. I've seen some good movies in VV at my time, but this wasn't one of them. The biggest thing I don't understand is why my world history class couldn't just watch Immortal Beloved or something. How can I compare a composer to Amadeus, for Mozart and Beethovan Lives Upstairs, for Beethovan? It's not possible when it's a movie choice for Beethovan. I give Amadeus A (9 out of 10) if someone is interested in him, but Beethovan Lives Upstairs gets F (1 out of 10).
