"At the heart of Earth" was on TV yesterday. I was at my computer who worked and I happened to look and see what had to be the worst action sequence. Immediately I was fascinated by the values ​​of the film's production production, the frightening acting (all included - even Peter Cushing) and the terrible, unintentionally cheerful action sequences and puppet monsters. The film is about a Victorian scientist who takes a stereotypical Buff American hero on a country-boring trip in the Welsh countryside. Little do they know that a great evil is lurking in the center of the Earth's core .... Forget that the name doesn't make sense. (If they were really at Earth's core, they should be about 2700 kg / m3 underground and burn alive in the Sea of ​​Iron or what's down there.) Forget that the puppets used in the production opponent "The Beast Master" it is a false aspect of all time. No, the real genius "At the heart of the Earth" is its naive stupidity - the gung-ho action show with no real action and no real spectacle. This is basically just a gung-ho movie and stupid in it. People who like MST3K-style things will love it - it's so bad, and so bad that it's almost fun in a strange way.
