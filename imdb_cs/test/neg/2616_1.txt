Very disappointing chapter 7 of this slowly dying series. Very clear that the budget was extremely low. This film was made for one reason and one reason alone. Sell ​​Puppet Master Toys! Fans, like myself from the show, have decided from what I have read and heard that the only one in the series worse than this is the curse of a puppeteer. And he turned us away from the show again. <br /> <br /> If you decide to make this movie a PG-13 movie for any reason, it didn't help in movies. The conspiracy seemed almost there, but it was easily lost in the constant stream of nonsense. The only film in the series to be watched, including Decoteau, is part 3 of Toulon's Revenge. I admit I prefer the scenery in the movie. Yuck!
