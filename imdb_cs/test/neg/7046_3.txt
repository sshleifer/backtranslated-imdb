It's really a pity that there has been so much controversy around this picture (in other words, the infamous affair between Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini) because it has attracted a very forgettable movie. The story is incredibly slow, cheap and uninteresting. In addition, the film is filled to the brim with amateur actors who barely speak English. I really would prefer the headlines - it would be less exhausting. Back to the rotten deal. The neo-realistic movement was great in Italy at the time this film was made. Many of these films are absolute masterpieces (eg De Sica Umberto D., The Children Look at Us and the Miracle in Milan) because they have gone from non-professional actors. They acted like normal people, but in Stromboli they act like normal people who try to be actors and leave very badly - like kids in school play. By the way, if you're hoping the movie has a good ending (giving your time to film while it's worth it), don't bother. The story was totally unpredictable and stupid - so much that I really found myself less able to take care of the characters. Like the island they inhabit, the film is desolate and without color or life.
