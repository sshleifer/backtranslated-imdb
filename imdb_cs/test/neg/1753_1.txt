Kidman and the law lack chemistry to carelessly order, poorly written romance / melodrama work at any level other than grandiosity. Kidman Pouts and <br /> <br /> Pine thoughtfully for her absent lover law. He had just met him when he went into battle for the South in the Civil War, and they exchanged only five sentences and one kiss, yet they are totally beaten. The main direction of the law seems to be: "Look honest and shocked, but sensitively." Yee-hah boy howdy! Something about her nature felt more like a sketch of Monty Python - the one from the "Holy Grail", where the peasants spent their entire time roaming the mud for no reason. Kidman is a pretty smart actress to avoid her way whenever she can. Their scenes are like comics hidden inside the Victorian era novel. Whenever swamps come into complete tedia, which is often the case, all writers shout "Cue Simon Legree-Villain!" and Teague (Ray Winstone) comes galloping out of nowhere to do his unspeakably horrible actions like it is to kill and torture innocent godfathers in the name of loyalty to fast escape <br /> <br /> Confederation. All other times are lacking in action that is also meaningless in this script. There are many other talented actors who give credible performance in small These are the characters that the law encounters when making its Johnny Appleseed trek from the front lines where he left, to the hopeful kidman hug of Kidman at Cold Mountain, but none of these characters matter. These small mini-films have the same tired theme: War is a gol-durn hell, and turns a differently decent Christian people into angry animals. <br /> <br /> A scenario it is too predictable, too cumbersome, and the story's pace is very slow, the whole movie waiting for the inevitable reunion of Romeo and Juliet when Kidman shook hands and sighed, the law overcame incredible chances and avoided bullets. And when it finally comes, you don't care. You will watch the watches that interest you, how much more of this clap you have to endure. I give him one star out of five for battle scenes. Here is a strong anti-war message. The incredible lack of interest in losing lives by generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful. But it's only about 15 minutes of this 150 minute dog.
