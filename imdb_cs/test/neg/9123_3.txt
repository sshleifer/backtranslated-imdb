I really don't think producer George Lucas really did not make such a terrible sequel as it turned out to be "More American Graffiti". But retroactively, it was the first crack in his seemingly impenetrable armor. The film comes directly from the huge success of "American Graffiti" and is produced essentially at the same time as "Star Wars". This movie was the first Lucas to take away from Coppola without bothering to drive him. The result is a typical Lucas - much more interesting in terms of its structure and the way it is modified than the actual material. Writer / director Bill Norton is allowed to use a variety of different screen conditions and split screens to create special associations in images. While it is interesting to see the ironic composition of the four storylines, the style only embodies the broken nature of the film itself. Lucas's great original film was about a group of friends on an archetypic film. The Last Big Night "Before the End of School and Kurt (Ron Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) have to go to college. One thing that made the film work, despite the fact that it's very episodic, is that You have the basic characters together at the beginning and they will end up together.There is a disposition of time, as in "Ray Rebel Without a Cause" Nick Ray, where a certain period of time becomes very elastic and takes more meaning than such a specific time actually in real life, but everything takes place in static space. "More American Graffiti" is basically the opposite - space is very dynamic, with Toad Toad (Charles Martin Smith) in Vietnam, his former girlfriend Debbie (Candy Clark), party with hippies in San Francisco, Steve and Laurie (Cindy Williams) involved in student protests at Berkeley, and John Miler (Paul Le Mat) drag racing for the semi-pro circuit. they are assembled to look at John's race, but after that the fibers do not return together and unite as they do in the original. Instead, we broke up and followed the characters for about 3 years of time, just seeing different events on New Year's Eve in what seems to be in 1967, 68 and 69. It's easy for the audience to be confused and I think it's fair to say that we do. While the original film has seemingly condensed important events and rites of passage into an unreal theater time that has brought nostalgia to those who have never experienced these events, this sequel pulls and spreads a couple of plot from the original epilogue and tries to make them a coherent film. The best work of the film are those with Candy Clark in SF and Charles Martin Smith in Nam. Some jokes fall straight, but the style of these sections is interesting and creates a clear contrast between them. A good movie might have been done if these parts were a little bit better, and if the other parts were not such a move. Speaking of drag racing, the whole plot with Milner talked to a foreign exchange student was really lame, indecent, and throwing at Mackenzie Phillips for portraits didn't help at all. It was just another moment, as when they briefly explained why Curt wasn't in the movie because he was in Canada. Instead, Laurie has another brother who is essentially the same as Curt, but has a different name and is now a very boring actor. There is a black sort of satire to some Vietnamese stuff, very similar to that I would imagine Lucas and John Milius' original idea for "Apocalypse Now" would be like. And there's something in San Francisco's scenic entertainment that first movie fun. But still with that fun thing, you have the rest of the film dragged down, as if someone wanted to see that Steve and Laurie are arguing in their terrible suburban mansion, as if they were trying for the Spielberg film on divorce and abandonment. I think that even if these parts of the film were not so painful, it wouldn't really be comparable to the first film because there is no closure and no feeling that one could go back or learn something. It's just something that ends when they run out of money or something, a cheap frost imitation of "Two-Lane Blacktop" and so many better movies. As well as the original, this film has a great soundtrack of period hits that are worth owning and almost make the film itself tastes. Country Joe and Fish are great, and Scott Glenn, who played with hippie in love with Candy Clark, is a sight to see - wondering if he had to use a wig anymore? I couldn't recommend this movie, and yet it has a little affection in my heart because I love the original so much. Every few decades I have to give this movie an attempt to make sure it's really worthless as I remember. He's a party killer, but it's something every "American Graffiti" or George Lucas fan will generally want to see at least once or twice. It shows how much effort can go into something and it can still get pretty half baked. This forces you to think about how much miracle it is that Lucas actually made such a good movie as "American Graffiti" in the first place, as if all the elements were in place and all the relevant gods were stolen. Unfortunately, this was not the case for this movie or Bill Norton.
