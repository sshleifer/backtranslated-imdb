I am a huge fan of prison dramas, which is reflected in the fact that OZ is my favorite American TV show. I think the appeal lies in the type of smug voyeurism that wants to see bad things in bad men's bottoms, but I found Don Siegel's RIOT IN CELL BLOCK 11, which is rather disappointing. Well, I knew that since 1954 it would have been without the bad language, the graphical stopwatch and the gang rape, but still it is a rather weak film compared to a prison portrait in earlier films like EVERY DAWN I DIE and WHITE HEAT. The problem lies in the pulpit of the film with the riot leader Dunn, something like a prison reformer. Yeah, that sounds ridiculous because it's more of a violent adversary than some flaccid wrist of a tree that rejoices in pay, but that's what's basically, wants to see prisoners rehabilitated to return to society and not to be suffered. There is also the problem of creating B film with such radical themes (quite ironically that Siegel would later make DIRTY HARRY, where the only good criminal is dead) and that is a cast, is not very good with Emil Meyer, because the guard is particularly irritating his performance. as I said, disappointing the movie
