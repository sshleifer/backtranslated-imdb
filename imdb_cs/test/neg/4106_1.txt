Damn horrible! There is no other way to give it. In fact, it is ** SO ** bad that the only reason I waste words is to warn other reasonable viewers who want to have fun. You will lose I.Q. observation. Think about it, it's not even suitable for mindless observation due to an irritation factor. There is no guilt of pleasure in watching something like this incompetent. Reasons to Avoid It: 1) Terribly scientifically inaccurate, to the point that it's no longer science fiction, it's just a sadly sloppy, lazy fantasy. 2) It's FX sports, which is cheesy for faith. It's not even a cheesy kitsch that is blinking and nodding like vintage Doctor Who, but only cheap and delicate to the point of being offensive. FX's so bad they're not even ridiculous. They spent about fifty dollars on it, not more. 3) The direction is so weak and mindless that the only way the actors could go through to the end of the shoot without becoming terminally depressed was Though Catherine McCormack did anyway, probably on the principle and in spite of the director, though she tried to cross their roles. Besides, it's not the only bad movie of Peter Hyams: his flubs greatly exceeds all barely overcome, of which Timecop was the last, and that was 15 years before that writing. he had nothing to half respectable because (the end of days was just like slapdash, Arnold was the only draw, and he needed a much firmer direction than Hyams provided). Hyams only makes it more and more unnecessary for anyone considering to give him more work. Finally, <br /> <br /> 4) Ray Bradbury stories deserve much better treatment than this. Refusing to watch this movie sends this message, not that Hollywood was particularly listening. <br /> <br /> Watch at your own risk. If you do this and turn off the movies completely, you only have to blame yourself (and Hyams) because you were more than warned enough.
