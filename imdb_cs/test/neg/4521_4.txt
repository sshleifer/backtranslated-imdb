There is excitement from the low-budget film noir. And there is a frustration of meandering, uninteresting movies made on cheap. It falls into the second category. <br /> <br /> Spot is the name of a nightclub. The film is about a policeman whose father was killed by gangsters. He leads out to watch them. It may have been a bad print. Maybe it's me. But I felt I saw it a hundred times, most of them were better than here. It also has a promise: The cop is fascinated by the woman who plays the recordings she presents through Juke boxes. Then they meet. Now, even though it was done well before I was born, I saw such a kind of juke boxing. And it's incredibly fascinating: When I was a teenager, I went to a bar that had such a device. I always liked juke boxes, in bars or restaurants. But this was different. You talked to him and the sad-sounding female voice came to you! This is said here but dropped into a general, uninteresting goulash. The film has one thing that suits it: In a small role, it is a very young Anne Jeffreys. What beauty was and undoubtedly still is!
