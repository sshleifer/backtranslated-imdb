his totally average movie with several semi-characters that make the plot a little better and remind the viewer of the classic van ladies movies. parts of the conspiracy do not make sense and seem to be added until they are used. the final graph is of a very basic type, which does not let the viewer guess and any reversals are obvious from the beginning. The bulbous-back end scene makes no sense because they are added and seem to have little relevance to the history of van ladies. It really is not worth watching again, a little disappointed in the final production, although it is obvious that he was shot at low budget some shots and sections in the movie are of poorly focused quality
