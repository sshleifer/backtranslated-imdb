It seems that I remember a lot of hype about this movie when it came out, but avoided seeing it over the years. I wish I waited longer. Maybe this movie was funny in 1988, I don't know. I was younger, but the world didn't seem to be different. Michelle Pfeiffer, beautiful as she is, is never convincing. Mercedes Ruehl not only chews the scenery, but also faces like gerbil to save later. Dean Stockwell is about as convincing as the crowd boss, because James Gandolfini would be the main dancer for the Welsh dachshund. And Matthew Modine showed the most prominent case of delayed puberty I've ever seen. All in all, it's not bad enough to pull your eyes out with melon, but it's not far away.
