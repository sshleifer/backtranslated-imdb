A film about a French girl who is raped by street hoods. The rape scene itself is shot in all its harsh details with all the male and female organs and their interactions clearly visible to the camera. In a tantrum, the victim grabs his friend's weapon (or is he a brother?), Shoots him and runs with his weapon. She meets this prostitute who has just seen her pimp shoot down, join, and head towards Paris. Following a series of crazy, senseless and wild kills, girls seem to enjoy more than any previous murder. One poor guy gets shot in a **** hole. Between numerous murders, good doses of sex are thrown. The film is not the strongest I've seen, I think Saving Private Ryan probably had more violence in it. If violence is what you are looking for, then there are plenty of other movies out there. And if it's sex you're outside, then I'd suggest one of those XXX. I went to see the movie for all the hype that the media gave. The film itself is not a big deal, just a lot of violence and sex with something like a handheld camera. I was surprised that this film had a 15 year old age in Sweden, if they could see it for 15 years, they should be able to watch XXX movies.
