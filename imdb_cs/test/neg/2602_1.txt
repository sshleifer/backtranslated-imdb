You know what? Family Guy started out as something fresh, funny and original. Random humor used to make it humorous. Actually, I thought it was the best animated sitcom beside the Simpsons. After watching new episodes that have been broadcast over the past few weeks; I grew up with a show relying too much on random humor to be funny. South Park was right about FG dead when they raised Manatees and thought balls. And when I watched the show itself, I don't understand why my parents like it a lot; there is nothing big about it. "Intellegent" humor is funny and would be more fun if the show did not rely on randomness.
