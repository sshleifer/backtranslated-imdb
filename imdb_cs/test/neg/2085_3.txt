I saw this film more than 20 years ago and I had memories of it. I caught Cinemax again this month and realized how little I had about the movies. That's just plain western spaghetti with nothing remarkable about it. Screenplay, direction, acting, photos are great blah. Stick to Western Sergio Leone!
