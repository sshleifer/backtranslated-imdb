The first twenty-five minutes stand out as the worst in modern British film. The director / adapter William Cartlidge has worked Wilde's original with such reverence that he seems to have completely ignored the needs of the film audience. Fortunately, the direction and cut quality has improved significantly after the first half hour, but the damage has already been done. From the actors, Prunella Scales and Robert Hardy wipe the floor with the rest of the cast every time they're on the screen. Other exceptions are Jonathan Firth's Arthur and Karen Hayley's Mabel, who are given enough freedom to deliver their lines with the true comic sense which Wilde intended. The apparent leadership, James Wilby and Trevyn McDowell, are in comparison to the bland and wooden. In an obvious attempt to disprove every penny from a poor budget, the game was nominally updated to the 1990s, but in conjunction with the original script the effect is more badly the screenplay of the 1970 television drama. The real moments of comedy are very few and far, but when they arrive, they are very fun - maybe signs that a more sensible pruning of the rest of the game could have led to a better, more balanced movie.
