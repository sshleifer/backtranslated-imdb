That was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Why would someone make a film about getting rid of murder? Mr. Allen once again plays the only type of character who is a capable, sexually stunned man who can't get a girl. Get an idea, Allen, there's a reason it's the only character you can portray successfully. Remove this movie! It's a waste of time if you don't want to know how to successfully murder someone. I'm sorry for the actors who say 'yes' to Woody Allen. Look at his cast and tell me how many of those people are still working. My respect for all the actors who work for him is falling immediately because they have decided to participate in the film.
