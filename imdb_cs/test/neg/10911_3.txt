and a totally scary movie. They don't care about the characters at all and spend most of their time in the car. The dog is at best ugly, never spooky. A more threatening threat, at least a few people you care about, and a certain emotion in you, would be of interest. Last but not least, something interesting must happen. Something unexpected. As it is, this film just drags on and on, in what looks like forever. Maybe Saint Bernhard was not so smart to choose as a terrible threat to life and society? In most scary movies / thrillers / secrets, just any genre, there must be characters that sparkle interest and make you want to know what will happen. It doesn't really matter here, just wait for it to stop, and wonder if it would be better to see something else. One of the weakest kings adaptations.
