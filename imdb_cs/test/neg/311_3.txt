We were thrilled to rent this one after reading a few reviews and seeing it scored so much. Well, we got him home and we couldn't believe what we saw. He basically comes out as though he was written by some severely perverted old man who couldn't help putting his sexual frustrations and fantasies into an anime movie that really lacks conspiracy and humor. The main character is everywhere ... one moment, he's like an immature little boy, next time he's mature and intelligent, then heroic, then perverted stalker. The worst part is all sexual content out of place. I have no problem with sex and kicking a movie that has some good sexual energy, but it is only presented in a way that is creepy. Warts slips, closes the crotch girls' windows (many times) in white panties or swimsuits. It was totally in place and the person who wrote it seemed to be trying to survive some fantasy through his cartoon characters. We were expecting something of a mature character, but we were still looking at each other and asking what the hell was, except we were shooting like a cartoon and a bad dialogue. If you want to see some cartoon characters and crotch ... that's for you. If you're looking for something extra, this movie was empty. Characters and dialogue were simply irritated. <br /> <br />
