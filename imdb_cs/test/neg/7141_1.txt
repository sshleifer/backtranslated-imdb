Well, good thing first: If you saw a trailer, you know 100% of the "scary / nervous" moment of the movie. And yes, it's a good thing because you should stick to a trailer and not see a movie. Now I understand why Sarah Michelle Gellar hasn't stayed alive in this movie, I don't want to associate her name with this production. I wish her the best for "The Return". <br /> <br /> In this movie, you have to watch 3 different stories and all are disconnected (in time and meaning) until the very end. And then it's a very bad peak. And God did not let the door open to another. Yes, in this movie "The Rage and Fury" is on the move. You no longer have to visit the house, be close to someone inside and you're done. It's not a curse anymore, it's like a virus. Go inside the house, scare, go back to the US and spread the joy in your apartment building. It's not that hard to follow, but you really don't really care about anyone. The plot line is slim to none and you have a lot of scene in this movie where you just laugh and shake your head ... Milk anyone ??? I saw Ju-On 2 at the Fantasia Film Festival last summer, a different story completely but much better than this bagpipe. It's not a remake, but this time maybe you should just make a remake .... <br /> <br /> If you have to see it, wait for the DVD.
