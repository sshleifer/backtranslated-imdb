I will say in advance that I am not a fan of the independent "direct to video" genre, which owes grindhouse films to the 1960s a large debt. I don't own any, I've never rented any, so I might lack recognition for these linguistic, low-budget stinkers that many other people have. This movie I caught on Cinemax late Saturday night with a friend. Please don't ask me why I was watching Cinemax late with my friend on Saturday night. We are bored by the Poker World Championship Poker. Some sinisterly bad actors with the kind permission of Misty Mundae (and I wish she did not own that she was from Illinois because we actually showed that we have very clear thespians here) were impressed. Normally, the goal of good soft-core porn would be to get you and your partner into the mood. Some good sex, a tongue in the face of humor, and who knows what might happen? After about 15 minutes, and the scene where the title character seduces the victim, my girlfriend said, "If you want to watch the rest of this fine, I'm going to bed so I don't have to. Please turn off the volume. 'Here's what I learned from the conspiracy: Misty character is a helpless nerd who gets bitten by a spider and turns into a super-sex kitten with a super web tying force that doesn't come from her wrist. There is some kind of evil glee involved, who didn't look particularly evil or sexy. Spiderbabe will save the day, have sex, MJ (who is the man in this movie) is constantly getting rid of stereotypically bad homosexual cyclists, and some evil village will move away from the building to her death. <br /> <br /> What was good about this movie? It's over. <br /> <br /> What was wrong with it? Behaving to make the third degree procession look like Oscar winners, the script turned out to be people who I imagine to be drunk, undergraduate-aged sexual perverts who wouldn't know what sex is if they took class taught by Dr. The effects that were about as strange as someone jumping from a trampoline, humor as funny? Well, I haven't met anything that's lamer yet. Sex Scenes? If we were watching the video, the only thing these scenes would turn on is the fast forward button. And the action scene? Some of my old Atari VCS games had better choreography. Now I know that this type of film should enjoy its nature. Companies like EI are not trying to make good movies: they have a niche and focus on them. My experience as a trader tells me that they are right about money in the service of their viewers. But after my short exposure to 'Spiderbabe', I can say for one that I'm not going to this world again. Perhaps the problem with filmmakers in this type of genre is this: they spend so much attention making the films bad that if they tried to focus on those things they do very well, they would turn some very enjoyable 'le bad' Cinema, movies from Three in the 80s. Sorry people; the spirit is there, but the effort is not. Although I have to admit that "Alice in Acidland" fascinates me?
