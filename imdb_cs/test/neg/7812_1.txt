To be fair, I couldn't bear to watch this movie all the way, so I have no idea if a better film suddenly gets. But the first 30 minutes are among the worst I've ever seen. Children under the age of twelve could kick out a badly written, fictional and controlled grotesque humor, but adults who have full control over all their abilities should turn away that smelly.
