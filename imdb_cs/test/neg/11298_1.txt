Hannibal must be the worst movie I've ever seen. Actually, I want my money back. What a waste of time. No conspiracy, development of minimal character, controversial motives, bad dialogue, nonstandard acting. What else should I say? If you haven't seen it, don't bother. I wouldn't like to rent a video and if you came on TV ... change the channel. The only reason anyone could see this film would be to find out if gratuitous violence lived up to all the hype (which is, frankly, why they added it). If you want to see some gug eat your own brain, then quickly forward to this bit. What was the purpose of this film? It's like someone asked, "I wonder what Hannibal is up to these days" and we just went for a ride. It is free at the beginning and free at the end. Meanwhile, it is a lot of pleasure from Anthony Hopkins and filmmakers. Julianne Moore bravely tries to put some life in her Clarice, but gave her a subnormal scenario, and if I'm concerned, she was set to fail. In my opinion, it's just a very bad story in every sense of the word. The only reason he made so much money was because of the senseless violence they added, which gives you a greater sense of contempt at the end of the day than the horror you should feel. <br /> <br /> I give him a big fat RASPBERRY!
