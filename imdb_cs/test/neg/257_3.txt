In 1932, Humphrey Bogart was a relative of an unknown - unproven actor who played in one of his first films. And because he was unknown, the film they gave him was clearly a B-movie - a fast film with relatively low expectations. After I noticed it, I saw why it would still take Bogart for many years and another movie studio before becoming a household name. While the film isn't terrible, it's definitely not good - making it more curiosity than anything else when it's seen today. Bogart is a pilot who has the dreams of building his own aircraft engine company. However, when a mindless, rich playgirl sets out on a journey, all his dreams seem to be fine. As one of the characters in the film said, the combination of both is like oil and water - they just don't mix. While Bogart discards his promising career, his sister goes full speed on his way to Skankville - they met a slippery guy who convinced her to sleep with rich guys so they could shake a lot of money with them! Bogey does not know that his sister is not an actress she claims to be and does not realize later that the rich woman she loves leaves him for the same guy whose mistress is ... Bogart's SISTER !!! All this leads to a finale that is reasonably pleasant. But what follows is one of the dumbest scenes I have watched in a very long time! The rich lady will now not marry a guy sleeping with Bogey's sister (went!), But because she is now poor and not good for Bogart, she is going to fly and kill herself. Bogey finds, pursues the plane on foot, jumps on the plane, takes off and crawls on the hull to take control of the plane and save her! That's so stupid and ridiculous, I found myself laughing loudly. Until then, I might have scored it at 4 or 5 - this movie got to 3 (as one reviewer gave me 8 points behind me). The bottom line is that it was a talking and stupid movie. In addition, it's all bad for Bogart, as an action hero at the end and the simpering lover are terrible matches for his persona, which was so wonderfully created in the early 40s. Manly and better fit the man - one of America's greatest actors, but clearly beyond his element here. By the way, those who love Pre-Code movies and their very adult feelings want to see this. Virtually everyone in the film believes and practices premarital sex and the curse of Bogey in the film - things you would never see after a hardened and more moralistic production code were adopted in 1934.
