It's true that it takes a lot of effort to make a bad movie - this is no exception. I'm not a yanks lover, but their amazingly simplistic view of the world and their ability to reduce everything that is black and white, as well as events (even fictional in novels) suitable for an agenda that has little or no relation to the complexity of any kind is irritating at the extreme. Wilbur Smith is descriptively detailed but weaves intricate stories that deserve more than this terrible mishmash movie has delivered. <br /> <br /> Sadly for those who never read Smith. They will be left less than a decent display of his Egyptian series, which must be gigantic in his exposure. Indiana Jones movies were fun. Trying to repeat that manipulating Smith's novels with this production lacks miles in the country. Pathetic, except for Malik's photography and art.
