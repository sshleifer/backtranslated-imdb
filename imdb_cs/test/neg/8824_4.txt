It looks like an exciting prospect, a modern "Othello" dress with Christopher Ecclestone, who was so frighteningly good at "Shallow Grave" and (especially) "Jude" and Eamonn Walker, who brought such intensity and introspection to his key role on "Oz" . One would think that both natural Shakespeareans, but both performers misfire: Walker Othello is a pretty cookie-cutter taken on the side, with a whisper delivery that doesn't give much impact; and Eccleston puts him in shock as Iago, blinking at the camera almost in an outrageous parody of the role. It is likely that his director stood up to him, whose florid approach could work better with the Elizabethan language, but which seems to be an unpleasant and arrogant choice for this modernized scenario. And the scenario itself is less disappointed with being modern than obvious? it is as though Andrew Davies outlined the famous conspiracy and then just wrote any dialogue that first appeared in his head. All in all, failure. 4 out of 10.
