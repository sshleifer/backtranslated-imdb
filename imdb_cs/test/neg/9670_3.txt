After I saw Shootfighter 1 and the buckets of blood shed, I was ready for another exciting massage of cardiac massage and chiropractors in the cage. But nooooooo, it was like Barney's version of the first movie, with a lamer from the Karate kid. At least Bolo Yeung is still kicking the prey, though he needs to do more movies like Bloodsport and Caddyshack.
