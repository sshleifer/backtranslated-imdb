I saw this movie considering it as a normal Hollywood movie, but then I learned that its a movie created for a TV channel. On my DVD cover from two critics, one of the critics who appeared in the movie from the moviline movie labeled him the Best Movie of the Year. <br /> <br /> All characters were simple and decent performances except for the character of the brain that never It does not reach the extent that the director wanted to keep the secret until the end .. There was tension until the end, but when you see the end that the Lady Police Officer and the main culprit had a lesbian affair, it seems to be a totally stupid idea. God knows what happens to the DAVE male leader. Another critic from Mr. Brown's movies said he was shocking and effective, but he wasn't quite living up to all the Hype ... I saw after watching the movie. to read this first before taking a movie.
