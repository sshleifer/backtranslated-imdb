I must say that there is one redeeming spot in connection with this "film". Firmly bases the bottom of the barrel. Now filmmakers know what to do when filming. Besides, I regret watching this debacle. What shameless abandonment of this "movie" was. What a waste of $ 100,000 (that's the right people, ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND dollars). This "movie" reminds me of the "Adult Video Awards" show, where a group of "industrial prostitutes" praise and believe they are real actors, actresses and filmmakers. Ironic then, as I watched blue movies with better acting, directing and writing. I also found it funny that executive producer Justin Ament had to be in the movie. Deputy Jake Barker plays. I'm sure his "acting" career has taken off ... Ted Pfiffer, a writer, has a role to play. No doubt he raced in the clich√© he had created. It should be noted that Carrie Finkle has a leading role in the film. You may remember it from Gus Van Santa's "elephant". Although I'm not sure he'll want to write this film about his resume. And I'm not sure which is a more depressing point; money was spent to watch this movie or people. Together with "Torque", "Godsend" and "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow", one of the worst films IF THE WORST FILM IS NOT 2004.
