The only reason I even give this 4 film is because it was done in the Mystery Science Theater 3000. Leadership is an actor I've never seen in anything else and shows it. No chemistry with a love interest and so bland that you almost don't care what happens to him. Dick Sargent wasn't convincing because the worst of those guys was supposed to be a super evil ... he was more annoying than anything. Peter Graves was the only person who wasn't terrible, his part was small and he couldn't even compensate for the lack of talent of his teammates. In 2004, someone tried to make this mess again, it was called The Island ... Personally, I didn't see the movie, but what I understand is the same film. If you want to laugh on this movie getting the MST3k episode its really funny ... full of charming and resume links it makes this movie finally traceable
