Sur un Air de Charleston, which was made with Nana's film material, is described as a holiday movie for everyone involved, and that's the best way to see it. It seems that Jean Renoir has not even noticed to adjust the shots together. Is the story a simple return of racial stereotypes? in 2028, a black explorer travels to a post-holocaust in Paris where Charleston teaches him a white indigenous girl (naturally assumes he's a savage whose dance is a prelude to her meal before giving up the seductive rhythm of "White Aborigine"). There are plenty of unreal touches, be it a domestic gorilla eating flowers in Catherine Hessling's hair, girl phone angels (Renoir and producer Pierre Braunberger between them) or the fact that black artist Johnny Huggins plays his part in minstrel blackface, while Hessling is a dancing ability It is almost completely nonexistent, and there are some interesting occasional experiments with slow motion, but there is not really enough to keep it for two roles. Another air of surrealism is ensured by the fact that this silent musical has no score on the new Lions Gate DVD?
