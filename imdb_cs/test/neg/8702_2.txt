I realize it's hard to live up to The 10 Commandments first movie (which was magnificent and not personally a Charleton Heston fan) but wow ... this movie / mini series was disappointing. Even the animated The Prince of Egypt was better. One thing that threw me away was Ramses. Compared to Yul Brynner's version, Paul Rhys's version seemed so weak and not Pharoh. Acting wasn't that great. For a modern adaptation, I expected something better. Visually, it didn't look overwhelming. I think they ran on a tight budget or something. Sometimes a voice narrator appears, which I found strangely and unnecessarily. It also broke the flow of the story. And um ... God's voice / lines were a little strange.
