"Flashdance" meets with "Meatballs III" or maybe he should be called "Meatballs IV". This is my favorite favorite movie of my friend Wesley, mainly because he has something more about cheerleaders J.V. As someone once said, "That's okay-more than okay - but as you get older, you have to split up. Whether or not you want it." She has the biggest cinema JV cheerleader Mary Ann (played by Beth Miller) who looks like Alicia Silverstone's sweet face before her "Clueless" days. Wesley hates Miller's other film, the scary "teen wolf too" made three years later, where she plays fickle southern belle much like Martha Smith's character in "Animal House". I personally admire Miller's range because these two characters could not be more different and she is both convincing. Mary Ann is a naive newborn cheerleader from Moline (member of The Lucky Ducks) who comes to Beaverview camp for cheerleading. She is related to Jenna (Karen Lee Kelly), a leader of the hardcore girl-group-named named "Demons". Jenna becomes Mary Ann's guard after her main opponent immediately gets Mary Ann. Later Mary Ann gets a crush on Tommy Hamilton, the chief instructor. Tommy spends a summer match with the dilemma that she has to grow up and move on, a problem because his only skills are teaching cheerleading and performing complicated dance procedures in the shower, for the viewers to perform on such a kind of thing. Phoebe (Daphne Ashbrook) is Tommy's long-standing girlfriend, has a well-adapted attitude and an experienced perspective. She even tolerates Tommy's flirting with Mary Ann-trusting that Tommy doesn't really use the young Mary Ann. While these four characters are solid and their relationships have a nice charm, the support cast is almost like the material they have to work with. Which is a shame, because they brought some real comic relief into production, it would be a decent movie. Jennifer Cooke plays Pam, a social climber and a deviously picply instructor who continues with Bucky's owner of the camp. And there is another couple with stuff for characters from "Mad Max". Since nothing is very funny, you will only get cute semi-romance and some great dance routines. cinematic experience the result is never in doubt. And there is a back story of some Japanese entrepreneurs from whom Bucky wants to raise money, but is not dramatic or comical. Then again, what do I know? I'm just a child.
