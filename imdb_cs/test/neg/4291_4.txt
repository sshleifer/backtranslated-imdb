First, I must emphasize that the role that Wendell Corey played was exceptional. Usually Corey was sentenced to supporting roles, but here's what helps to carry this very flaccid movie. Without him and the character he was playing, the film would be much worse - barely deserving 2 or 3. <br /> <br /> So why did I hate the rest of the movie so much? One of my pets is when characters act "too stupid to live". You can't base your main plot of points on the assumption that your main characters are absolutely stupid (unless the brain injury is part of a plot, of course). But that's exactly what's going on in this movie. Wendell Corey is a crazy man who murdered three innocent people and knows his next goal is Joseph Cotten's wife. So what are they doing? Yeah, they provide really inadequate police protection and a plan that doesn't make any sense (no shooter and guys with shotguns that are so far that they probably won't stop this madman). And if it's not bad enough, the marked woman inexplicably runs away from her hiding place and goes straight to the worst place she could be! Is anyone who stupid?!?! Arrrggghhhh --- I hate movies when they have such stupid characters. In fact, I found myself rooting for Corey because I felt that the idiots deserved to die for their behavior! In addition to these character cliches, there was also a small player who fainted. Sure, seeing your husband shot CAN CAN cause someone to faint but in real life this is a rare case - people rarely faint if there's no medical reason. The combination of this with the above-mentioned problems with characters is a real nightmare for people looking for realism - something that the films of Noir MUST have. All these serious problems are even more angry because the character of Wendell Corey is wonderfully well written and conceived. It was his chance to shine like an actor - too bad the rest of the movie was so fragile that Corey and the basic idea of ​​the plot were sunk. This is one movie that could really use a remake - but this time without mindless characters.
