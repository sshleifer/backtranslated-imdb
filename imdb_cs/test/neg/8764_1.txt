I watched the first show of each series just to see and lose time. The Emmerdale girl was fat so she should be in a fat friend, but no one lost weight. <br /> <br /> Like Itv, she made a big mistake about it. Bad Girls is 100 times better. I feel the whole show was just about the big people trying to lose weight but never tried to enjoy the story oh my god, which is a waste of time and time. This show was not repeated on ITV2 / 3/4 yeah, that's how good it is. <br /> <br /> I would say it wouldn't be that the box was just a waste of money. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION
