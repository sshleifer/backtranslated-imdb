I normally don't try and guess about a criminal thriller, but Cleaner was just too predictable. Samuel L. Jackson playing Tom Cutler along with his profession created an interesting twist at the beginning of the film, but that was about him. Without even thinking that I knew where to go, and within 30 minutes I figured out who the killer was. Instead, I trusted myself and saw a few movies that made the tour, and I watched it finish. What a disappointment I had from the beginning. Character casting was good, as was Jackson and Harris acting ... except Eva Mendes. She didn't play a credible character correlated with the script from the starting gate, and it destroyed the story too soon. Maybe it was a direct accident or just a weakness in the story itself. Her role as Ann Norcut was to show more emotions and anxieties for the situation she built around her. That would be a little more convincing and the end would be more dramatic. However, Cleaner is observable, unforgettable. I've seen CSI episodes that were more exciting than this.
