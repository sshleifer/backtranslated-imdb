Unbelievable origin of Lone Ranger. He shows who he was and how and why he became a Ranger. The Legendary Bomb. The idea was not bad - to rediscover and introduce the Lone Ranger for the audience of the 80s. Right from the bat, though there were problems. The studio ordered Clayton Moore (the original Ranger) to stop appearing anywhere like the Lone Ranger. This led to an ugly battle that made headlines. I know about people who refused to see a movie because of how Moore was being treated. They also hired the horribly unreal Klinton Spilsbury to play the Rangers. Spilsbury was very handsome and muscular, but he had absolutely no charisma and simply couldn't act. In fact, his entire vocal performance was shifted by another actor! Also his off-screen antics (public drunkenness and beating people up) didn't help matters. By contrast, the script is boring and slow. Also, the Ranger itself will not show up to HOUR in! There were some complaints at the time that the film was too violent for PG. But I don't think it was so bad. There are a few (very few) things to do here - the photo was really beautiful; Michael Horse was excellent as Tonto; Christopher Lloyd is a lot of fun as a villain and when Lone Ranger finally shows up (with William Tell Overture flourishing from the soundtrack), it's really exciting. But in all, it is a boring and horrible attempt to return the Lone Ranger. It's easy to understand why it bombed. And 4 - mostly for photography.
