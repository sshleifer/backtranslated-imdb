The opening scene keeps me from absolute zero. I wish the whole movie was as bold and real as an intro. <br /> <br /> In order to enjoy some movies, a lot can be forgiven, (handguns with 60 shots, a hero with super human abilities, all women are gorgeous and half naked), but Puuuuleeese this "Assault On My Intelligence 13 "is still drawn so I am surprised that the cast appeared on the second day of filming. First, how do these guys be cops? On the basis of stupidity, I think. How the main female characters justify being half naked in the middle of winter in Detroit or wherever they are. In fact, no character responds to elements in this movie at all. No windows, no electricity (which miraculously returns unexplained) during a century thunderstorm and all are comfortable as bugs in the carpet. What technology exists that prohibits all cell phones, radios and brain functions. It must be the same power that causes Maria Bella to walk from her disabled knee deep in the snow-free snow and barely wearing any clothes.
