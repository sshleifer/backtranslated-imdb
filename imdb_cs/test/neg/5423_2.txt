With this series performance, this series could have been made anytime since the mid-1940s. You know a drill in a cardboard kit, in the moonlight flashes, sewn on aprons. This is Rocky Jones' adventure, representing a space cop with the unbearable Bitch Queen of Offeecious, a comic planet that won't join United Planets. When noble messengers announce from an intergalactic reason that Offeecious is on a collision course with this other, vaguely Slavic planet, Bitch Queen decides to throw out more boys, rather than evacuate her land. This introduces the moral effect of "the size of a nation not in its country, but in its people," which is five or six times driven in a climactic talkfest. BQ is a constant nasal ranting about "OffEEEEcious" providing relief from some seriously wanting space effects, is it a TV show?
