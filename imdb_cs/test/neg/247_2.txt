Such an original title for a very poor film. Dubbing is fun because voices and mouths never look like. As a result, I had no idea what was happening when I watched this mess unfold. There are flashbacks inside flashbacks and no real time takes place to the very end. The Aztec ceremony laughed at me. I rewound it twice and got the best ab workout ever. Singing Aztec Lady is a comic naturale and dance and costumes are hooves. Some guy gets a face full of acid, there's a lot of fighting, you don't know who a character is (not that I really care), and it's a noir mess. Oh, and the real fight won't happen for a while, so during the movie don't hesitate to get up, take a nap, go on a trip. Don't miss anything exciting.
