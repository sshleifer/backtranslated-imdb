Compared to other "sand and sandal" fare, Egyptian leaves much to be desired. The film is based very well on Mike Waltari's well-explored novel, which focuses on the adventures of Egyptian doctor Sinhue in Akhnaton's court, as well as his travels through Canaan, Minoan, Crete and Africa. Unfortunately, due to the moral rigor of that time, many of the Sinhue story (which is abundant with romantic and sexual exploitation) remains on the floor of the cutting room and instead, the audience is processed to rollers and Victor Mature's cylinders playing wood. Even Gene Tierney? leading lady "basic" time? it cannot look or act best in this flick, rather giving it a somnambulistic performance that can only be justified by the fact that the actress had some serious psychiatric problems at the time. There are a lot of rhetorical and theological machinations over the idea of ​​monotheism vs. polytheism, but Michael Wilding is as tiring as the revolutionary Akhnaton, that someone surely cheers someone who takes him away and restores the old religion to the other. My advice: buy a book from E-Bay, rent something more fun, like Solomon and Sheba, and then call it in the evening!
