This is really a cringe to do exercise. Dressed as a tribute to firefighters contains silly scenes "we're just a bunch of madmen" in the middle of "my good it can be really dangerous" parts. Usually it's just stupid. You couldn't believe for a minute that real firefighters acted like this. It's so horrible that I couldn't watch sometimes. If my daughter did not rent it and then it would take her to see it to the end, I would have no choice but to turn it off. The thing is John Travolta's fan. Every conversation I have seen only raises his opinion of him. I think it wasn't exactly for the money. I'm sure he'll be happy to forget him.
