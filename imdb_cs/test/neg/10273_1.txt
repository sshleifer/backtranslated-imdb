I was relieved that later reviews became acidic - reading all the positive feedbacks, I was beginning to fear that my understanding of films (and life) was completely different from the rest of the world. Everything in this movie came to me falsely ... characters, dialogue, manipulative soundtrack, frantic narrative, all this. As each scene unfolded, I was still thinking, "People don't follow that." It's inexorably cumbersome and maudlin. In a way, I think the movie encourages you to like it, or pretend to like it because he's a serious and real person and confronts problems. But man, it really didn't work for me.
