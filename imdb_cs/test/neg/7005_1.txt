I heard about this movie through a friend, it was supposed to be a thriller, but what I watched was not a "thriller". It was rather a weak attempt. Amber Smith was a clear place that could give her too much credit. The scenes were in bed with actress Erika Michels also lame. Both actresses didn't seem to click at all. Amber Smith got out of this league and it certainly turned out to be a camera. These scenes didn't seem at all. I was disappointed because my friend-guy of course-drew this movie to be something "great" but it was actually more like watching a dime shop porn.
