What happened to RGV? There are so many things to stop in this movie and decide where to start - first and worst - music. Each scene was accompanied by this challenging background music that told you the mood, quite pathetically, I can add. Second, lighting - do we really need such dark scenes where we ask if the projector is still working? And finally - if you are going to an Indian godfather and godfather 2 - be aware that many of us have seen. I saw the resemblance both in society and in Sarkar and while RGV Ab Tak 56 was brilliant, these two films left something that should be desirable. People will no longer be impressed only by corrupt politicians and a lot. Maybe RGV should see Maqbool, which is good enough to be RGV !!
