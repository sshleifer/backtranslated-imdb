In the real world of art, Elizabeth Wurtzel is a sexy queen of the drama every man wants to do, but no one wants to wake up next. Her on-screen actress, Christina Ricci, is an ugly little girl who desperately wants everyone and every guy, but no one touches her. This is why Prozac Nation, the unreleased 2001 Westszel's best-selling book of the same name from 1990, is in immediate trouble. OK, the problems begin before Ricci is wrong, who has an emotional range of thimble - is it surprising that by far her best acting performance has been in the two Addams Family movies? At first she is bizarre - with big eyes and bulging forehead, which reminds her of the 2001 fetal Starchild: Space Odyssey. Second, he always plays whiney brats. Thirdly, it's the way films try to make it look like any person will be attracted to it. In one scene in the film, her friend Ruby (Michelle Williams) and Liz walk through Harvard, and all the boys' languages ​​tremble on Ricci, not super-cute and sexy Williams. Hi ?? Reality check time ??. This material begged for the treatment of Andy Warhol. Here's his movie version. A five-minute shot of a hypodermic needle. A five-minute shot of the furry pudend Wurtzel. A five-minute shot of her sleeping naked and stoned on the bed. He gets up, gives the audience a middle finger. Cue Credits. You see, in less than twenty minutes, for Wurtzel to be gone all his life. And yeah, Warhol's movie wouldn't have Ricci. Even Michelle Williams would be better, and if I saw Ricci's pale breast, I'd take something that Williams or another child would have to offer me kinematically. Ricci is almost a kiss of death for the film, and as he works, he is a mystery. Think about her performances in average bad movies like Monster, Sleepy Hollow, and Woody Allen's Anything Else - Jason Biggs' teammate, and now imagine another actress in her role and movies may seem better, if not great. It is a female counterpart to banal, wooden, milquetoast actors like Tom Cruise and Leonardo DiCaprio.
