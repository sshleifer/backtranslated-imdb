Why was this film made? Are producers so easily fooled by sadists to give them money to create torture methods like this "film"? I love the bad movie as well as another masochist, but "Cave Dwellers" are pushing it. It's really physically painful to watch. The story is something about a dude named Ator - excited numbnuts that I will refer to as Private Snowball for the rest of this review - who has to fight the invisible warriors and save the princess to beat the bad guy who needs to find a better hairdresser. Maybe I was wrong because it's been a while since I watched this scream, but really, you care too much? Well, Private Snowball also has a mute of Asian sidekick. Who's not funny. Anyway, Private Snowball fights invisible people, visits some caves, all in the name of a good king, so Al Gore does like Jim Carrey without personality. Then Private Snowball builds a hang glider (yes, I'm serious) and gets a girl. Yippie-kee-yay. It's cheap, unintentionally stupid and bluntly boring. Why is it not surprising that the director ended up making porn? <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: AVOID. Ator will steal part of your life and you won't have any funny "so bad-they're good" catchphrases to make with you from experience. Bad Ator! BAD! Aak! * gags *
