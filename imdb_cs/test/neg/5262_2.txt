This movie has a really strange mix of genres - toilet humor and action in one. It's not really pulling it out - it should be stuck to one genre. The best thing I can say about the film is that the dog in it is cute. The most disturbing sequence is in the middle of the movie when Moses (Sandler) and Carter (Wayans) decide to stop. in a hunting lodge / motel. I'm not quite sure what the meaning of this succession is - it's just unreasonable. The owner of the hunting lodge ("Charlie") is a very stupid looking guy. For some reason, Moses starts talking to Charlie about porn, lifting, gay sex, sex in threesome ... Charlie's photo of his "wife" looks like Charlie is dressed. There is no reason for this truly youthful dialogue and scene. The whole scene seems to be directed to the point where Moses ends up with Carter's arms and ass and Charlie sees them through the window. It's all about homosexuality - school boy humor - horrified and titrated at all times - which I can't find funny at all. <br /> <br /> I have a friend who always climbs about Adam Sandler's films. This is the first thing I've seen - after this, I'm not sure I want to see more. BTW, this is my husband's account - he saw Happy Gilmore, and he tells me it's pretty good - maybe I should give Sandler one more chance. Countess Skogg
