I can't tell if "The Cavern" is ripoff "The Cave" because I didn't see it. I've seen "The Descent" and it's not terrible, but it's very hard to watch, so that's it. Hard to watch, as in, there is very little light and plenty of fast movement, so it's hard to tell what you're looking at. There are times when I think you should be scared, judging by music, but you're afraid of what? Camera malfunction? Poor lighting? If so, it should be the most frightening movie. The story is that a bunch of explorers caves go to a cave in Kazakhstan (home of Borat) and make their descent, but something is (of course) there with them. And what is it? One guy says it's a wolf / bear hybrid, that is, just before it tears, but what it is you don't see. And just when you think the movie ends because the screen gets darker, you can see that the two remaining caves (two women) have woken up somewhere in Betty and Wilm's clothes and started to find their way out. wherever they are. They drink a little water and start eating until they find out what it is and start collecting .... and then the secret of what's in the cave will appear and you will just be amazed. Maybe not. Stupid stupid stupid ... I think I did pretty well with cave movies at this point, 2 out of 10.
